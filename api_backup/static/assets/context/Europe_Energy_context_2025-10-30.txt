European Energy has agreed to sell a 50% stake in its Saldus project in Latvia to Sampension, a Danish pension fund.

The Saldus project integrates a 65MW solar photovoltaic (PV) facility with a 46MW battery energy storage system (BESS).

Construction of the project commenced in July 2025 and is anticipated to be completed by May 2026.

Upon completion, the project will supply renewable electricity to the Latvian grid and offer enhanced power system flexibility through the integrated battery storage.

European Energy deputy CEO Jens-Peter Zink said: “This divestment is a clear example of our ability to take large-scale renewable energy projects from development through construction and into the hands of long-term institutional investors.

“The capital recycled from projects like Saldus enables us to expand our pipeline of wind, solar, and hybrid projects across Europe.”

[TITLE]EU moves to choke off Russia’s energy cash flow with sanctions on ‘shadow fleet’ and LNG sanctions:
[TEXT]
The European Union has agreed on a new raft of sanctions against Russia targeting its shadow fleet of oil tankers and banning its imports of liquefied natural gas, the Danish EU presidency announced Thursday.

“Today is a good day for Europe and Ukraine,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a statement, as EU leaders were gathering for a summit in Brussels.

He said that the new sanctions “will introduce new and comprehensive measures on oil and gas, the shadow fleet and Russia’s financial sector.” A new system for limiting the movement of Russian diplomats within the 27-nation EU will also be introduced.

The move comes a day after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration announced new sanctions against Russia’s oil industry that are aimed at moving Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and ending Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

Energy revenue is the linchpin of Russia’s economy, allowing Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.

The new EU measures took almost a month to decide. The 27-nation bloc has already slapped 18 packages of sanctions against Russia over the war, but getting final agreement on who and what to target can take weeks.

The sanctions agreement was sealed at a Thursday morning meeting of EU ambassadors, just a few hours before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joins his European counterparts for the one-day summit, as they press for a ceasefire to halt almost four years of fighting.

The summit comes after Trump said that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.” It was yet another twist in Trump’s stop-and-go effort to end the war.

The leaders are also eager for any progress on Trump’s Gaza peace plan, and will debate ways to keep the 27-nation bloc involved in proceedings.

The EU is the world’s biggest provider of aid to Palestinians but has little leverage over Israel – in part because European nations are divided over how to handle the conflict – and it has struggled to play a role of consequence.

It’s role in the war in Ukraine is clearer, and the summit takes place as Russian armed forces strike at the conflict-torn country’s power grid just as the weather starts to turn colder.

Earlier this week, Ukraine’s strongest European backers who form part of the “coalition of the willing” said they opposed any push to make Ukraine surrender land captured by Russian forces in return for peace, as Trump most recently has suggested.

The U.K. will host a meeting of the members of that coalition of more than 30 countries on Friday.

On the EU side, leaders intend to push forward with plans to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine’s war efforts, despite some misgivings about the consequences of such a step.

The biggest tranche of frozen assets – some $225 billion worth – are held in Belgium, and the Belgian government has been reluctant to take any risks on using the money without firm guarantees from its European partners.

Ukraine’s budget and military needs for 2026 and 2027 are estimated to total around $153 billion.

The EU leaders are also likely to sign off on a new “road map” to prepare Europe to defend itself against a Russian attack by the end of the decade. Top officials believe that Russian could be ready to take aim at another European country within 3-5 years.

[TITLE]Petronas Keeps the Gas Flowing as Malaysia Burns More Coal:
[TEXT]
Liquefied natural gas has once again become trendy. After several years under attack from environmentalists, even the EU has accepted that natural gas, in whatever form it can get it, is going to stay in the energy mix for quite a while yet. The U.S. is building new export capacity like there is no tomorrow; Qatar is ramping up output; and Malaysia is boosting coal imports so it has more LNG to export.

Over the first half of the year, Malaysia imported a record amount of thermal coal—the sort used for power generation. The total for the six-month period stood at 20.9 million tons, and coal accounted for as much as 60% of electricity output over the period. It did not stop there, however. Coal imports continued at elevated levels after June, too. Reuters’ Gavin Maguire reported the news, noting that the surge in coal imports is linked to Malaysia’s appetite for higher LNG exports, lamenting the consequent increase in carbon dioxide emissions from the power generation sector.

Malaysia is already one of the largest exporters of liquefied natural gas globally. However, unlike other top exporters, it has found it difficult to boost natural gas—and LNG—production. Gas reserve decline has coincided with energy demand growth that is only going to accelerate in the coming years, suggesting demand for coal will remain robust. Not only that, but the LNG exporter will have to start importing LNG.

Indeed, Australia’s Woodside Energy last month inked a deal with Malaysia’s Petronas for the delivery of 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually to the latter. Deliveries will begin in 2028 and continue for a term of 15 years. Meanwhile, Petronas continues to explore for new supply to secure future demand, Wood Mackenzie analysts noted in a report on Malaysia’s future energy demand and supply trends. The consultancy noted the expected strong growth in demand for energy both from the power generation and the industrial sectors, and the decline in local production, notably in peninsular Malaysia, where Wood Mac sees a sharp drop from this year onwards.

This will not affect Malaysia’s exports immediately, however. The country is going to remain a net exporter of liquefied natural gas until the 2040s, according to Wood Mac. It will probably continue using quite a lot of coal for local power generation in the meantime. The reason for this is as simple as they come. Imports of coal are a lot cheaper than what Petronas makes from exporting liquefied gas.

Because of its ambition to keep boosting gas exports—and revenues from these—Malaysia has countered a global trend in shifting from coal to natural gas in power generation. Unlike other countries that have made the switch to the best of their financial abilities, Malaysia has seen the share of natural gas in its power generation mix drop from as much as 80% in the 2000s to just 30% this year, according to Reuters’ Maguire, who cited data from climate change advocacy outlet Ember.

From an energy transition perspective, this is the wrong path to follow. However, Malaysia’s coal choice means there is more LNG for other countries that, without that option, would resort to coal-burning themselves. There is an obvious conclusion to be drawn from this situation and it comes down to the fact that despite the growing popularity of natural gas, coal will continue to be used until such time as it becomes too expensive.

Malaysia, somewhat counterintuitively perhaps, is going to try this next year, when it plans to introduce a carbon tax on power utilities and heavy industries as part of its own transition efforts. Chances are, however, that it will continue importing coal to keep more natural gas for exports—until LNG supply overtakes demand.

[TITLE]BP’s US$25bn Five-Field Megadeal In Iraq Is Finally Activated:
[TEXT]
Back in 2009, British oil and gas giant BP along with its then-Chinese partner China National Petroleum Corporation secured a technical services contract with Iraq’s state-owned South Oil Company to develop Iraq’s largest oil field – Rumaila – in the first such foreign exploration on the country’s energy sector in 40 years. The company’s activation earlier this month of a US$25 billion five-pronged oil and gas megadeal in the same country may prove even more historic.

The 2 October activation of the deal means that BP is now fully focused on developing the five huge oil fields in Iraq’s northern Kirkuk region, a senior source in the European Union’s (E.U.) energy complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “From when the deal was broadly agreed [memorandum of understanding signed in July 2024, and technical terms agreed in December] to now, it [BP] had to nail down some of the legal and accounting details in the contracts, but everyone appears to be satisfied at this point, so it is full steam ahead at this point,” he said. Whether or not these precise details pertaining to BP are the same as those that have concerned other Western companies operating in Iraq at various stages is unclear. However, a senior source who works closely with Iraq’s Oil Ministry did exclusively tell OilPrice.com last year that they were certainly of major concern to France’s TotalEnergies in its US$27 billion four-pronged deal, and the reason for the delay between its initial agreement and the activation of its own projects. The same source long ago told OilPrice.com that they were the same reasons why ExxonMobil decided to leave its own huge projects in Iraq years earlier.

That said, with any legal and accounting issues apparently now squared away, BP and Iraq’s Oil Ministry have agreed a preliminary production target of 328,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to the source. This is expected to rise to at least 450,000 bpd within the next two to three years, and then to be reassessed with a view to an increase in output and plateau production figures. The lifting cost of many of these barrels will be at or close to Iraq’s average of $2-4 per barrel (pb), which in turn is the joint lowest such figure in the world, along with Iran and Saudi Arabia. The project will last 25 years, but the contract will then be open for renewal, subject to agreement by both sides. Although the five fields -- the Baba and Avanah domes of the Kirkuk oil field and the three adjacent sites of Bai Hassan, Jambur, and Khabbaz – are already estimated to hold up to 9 billion barrels of oil reserves, these are very conservative estimates, according to the E.U. and Iraqi sources. “There is at least another eleven or twelve billion barrels across the near surrounding area, and possibly much more,” said the Iraq source last week. Additionally, BP’s efforts will not just be on oil development but also on capturing the gas associated with much of that oil drilling, with the initial target being 400 million standard cubic feet per day (mmcf/d) of associated gas. The British firm is a world leader in this field, being a partner in the Basra Energy Company, which provides technical support for the Rumaila oilfield development to help reduce flaring and emissions, and works with the Basrah Gas Company to manage the gas produced at Rumaila.

This is one of the broader reasons why this deal – together with that of TotalEnergies – is so strategically important for the West in a geopolitical context. A key thrust of the U.S. and Great Britain is to split Iraq away from neighbouring Iran, which has long held enormous sway over it through its political, economic, and military proxies. In so doing, Iran has been able to exercise a multiplier effect of its own power through the wider ‘Shia Crescent of Power’, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. This alliance held an extraordinary sway up until very recently over the political, economic, and security trajectories of the Middle East. With Iran at its ideological centre, the Crescent comprised key strategic assets in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, with inroads being made in Azerbaijan (75% Shia and a Former Soviet Union state), Turkey (25% Shia and furious at not being accepted fully into the European Union), Bahrain (75% Shia), and Pakistan (up to 25% Shia and a home to multiple terrorist groups antagonistic to the West). Core elements in this Shia Crescent alliance were also instrumental in Iran’s plan to build a ‘land bridge’ that would run via Iraq all the way to the Mediterranean coast, which would then be used by Tehran to increase arms shipments to its militant proxies for use against Israel. Another benefit for Iran was that it was able to present itself to superpower sponsors China and Russia as the gateway to the world’s largest unified pool of oil and gas reserves, which in natural resource-starved China was a major initial draw. Indeed, Iran and Iraq’s energy resources were at the heart of Beijing’s long-term foundation stone ‘comprehensive cooperation deals’ with both countries, as also analysed in depth in my latest book. These efforts have been extremely successful, with Chinese firms currently managing over a third of Iraq’s proven oil reserves and two-thirds of its production.

For these same reasons, removing Iraq from Iran’s immediate sphere of influence – and by extension from China’s and Russia’s – has been a key aim of the West, with the immediate focus being on stopping Baghdad’s continued reliance for energy supplies from its neighbour. It is a stunning indictment on the level of corruption that characterised Iraq for so long that a country so rich in oil and gas resources needs to buy in 40% of its power requirements in the form of gas and electricity from Iran. Having tried to persuade Baghdad to stop doing this and to meet its power deficit by developing its own energy resources instead, Washington moved recently to a different strategy, which is placing Iraq on a ladder of escalating sanctions against it if it does not do so. On the other side of the risk-reward equation, the TotalEnergies deal – and BP’s -- offers a clear, long-term path for Iraq not just to stop having to import power from its neighbour but also to dramatically increase its crude oil exports, and to become a major natural gas and liquefied natural gas exporter too.

BP’s presence across Iraq’s hotly-disputed Kirkuk region may also carry with another broader strategic benefit for the West. Although all the British firm’s operations are in the area of Kirkuk that is controlled by the Baghdad-based Federal Government of Iraq, they are also operating tangentially to the Erbil-based semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan. This has long been a key operating base for the West in the Middle East, particularly since the continued advance of China into Iran and the rest of Iraq, among other countries in the area. As it stands, the U.S. and Great Britain want the Kurdistan Region of Iraq to terminate all links with Chinese, Russian and Iranian companies connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps over the long term that have grown in recent years. The U.S. and Israel also have a further strategic interest in utilising the Kurdistan Region as a base for ongoing monitoring operations against Iran. On the other hand, the broad geopolitical stance of the Federal Government of Iraq (aligned perfectly with that of its key sponsors, China and Russia) – up until Donald Trump secured a second term as president, at least -- was conveyed to OilPrice.com some time ago by the senior Iraq source, who said: “By keeping the West out of energy deals in Iraq, the end of Western hegemony in the Middle East will become the decisive chapter in the West’s final demise.”

[TITLE]Buy LNG from US, ex-Commerce Secretary tells Donohoe:
[TEXT]
A former US Commerce Secretary told Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe that the Irish Government should offer to buy more liquified natural gas from America and increase its defence spending in its negotiations with the Trump administration.

Wilbur Ross, who served in Donald Trump's first Cabinet from 2017 to 2021, met Minister Donohoe earlier today.

Speaking in Dublin, Mr Ross said that Minister Donohoe had asked what could Ireland volunteer in discussions with the Trump administration.

Mr Ross said that he told Minister Donohoe that if Ireland bought liquified natural gas (LNG) from the US "it would augur very well with our government".

He added that Ireland had very low defence spending.

"I think increasing that somewhat would also augur very well because our president is very obsessed that European countries should pay a fair share relative to their economies," he said.

Mr Ross has been a major investor in Ireland. His company bought 35% of Bank of Ireland after the financial crash and he was a director of the bank until 2014.

He was speaking in UCD at an event co-hosted by Cardinal Capital, the company which had organised his investment in Bank of Ireland.

Asked about the impact of tariffs on Ireland, he said: "It may be that pharmaceutical employment here won’t be the growth engine that it has been, but I don’t think people are going to run away from Ireland.

"Ireland has a young, well-educated, very effective workforce. You have very good telecommunications, wonderful location to be a European headquarters for a company.

"Your tax rate is still a little bit lower than ours, so that’s a help as well."

He said that Ireland was in a "unique situation" due its low unemployment in comparison to other European countries.

He added concerns about the damaging impact of tariffs was "a little bit overdone".

Mr Ross said that in the US, there were quite a few people who felt pharmaceutical and technology companies had abused the system by transferring intellectual property to Ireland because it was a low tax jurisdiction.

Financial Results

Income Statement

Net interest income totaled $13.0 million for the third quarter of 2025, reflecting an increase of $610 thousand, or 4.9%, compared to $12.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, and an increase of $739 thousand, or 6.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2024.

The increase in net interest income when compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by higher average balances of interest earning assets partially offset by volume-driven increases in deposit interest expense, as the growth in earning assets was primarily funded by interest bearing demand and certificates of deposit growth. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities continued to trend downward from 4.07% during the second quarter of 2025 to 4.02% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

The increase in net interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily volume driven, as higher interest income from growth in average loan and interest-bearing cash balances more than offset increases in interest expense resulting from higher average balances of interest-bearing deposits.

The yield on investment securities was 4.62% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 4.73% for the second quarter of 2025 and 5.06% for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in the yield when compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter of 2024 was the result of a reduction in yield on certain variable rate securities due to lower long-term interest rates.

The Company’s net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025 was 4.35%, compared to 4.31% for the second quarter of 2025 and 5.00% for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in net interest margin during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the previous quarter was attributable to both (i) slightly higher loan yields, and (ii) a favorable decrease in the cost of funds. The decrease in net interest margin when compared to the third quarter of 2024 is reflective of the 100 basis point decrease in the target federal funds rate during the second half of 2024 by the Federal Reserve.

The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $1.1 million compared to $1.1 million during the second quarter of 2025, and an increase of $1.6 million when compared to the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses on loans recorded in the third quarter of 2025 reflects quarterly organic growth in non-guaranteed loans of $58.7 million, $707 thousand of specific reserves assigned to credit card balances, and the replenishment of reserves to offset $836 thousand of net charge-offs during the period.

Non-interest income was $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $5.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. The $1.8 million increase in non-interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in gain on loan sale revenue and an $871 thousand increase in net interchange fees. The $3.3 million increase in non-interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the third quarter of 2024 was driven by favorable increases across all categories of other income, including (i) an increase in credit card net interchange fees of $2.1 million as credit card transaction volume increased from $22 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to $321 million for the same period in 2025, (ii) an increase in gain on sale of loans of $754 thousand , and (iii) a $196 thousand increase in loan servicing income.

Net revenue totaled $20.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of $2.4 million, or 13.5%, compared to $17.8 million for the second quarter of 2025. Net revenue for the third quarter of 2025 increased $4.0 million, or 24.8%, when compared to $16.2 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Non-interest expense was $12.3 million during the third quarter of 2025, compared to $10.4 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $9.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. The quarter-over-quarter increase in non-interest expense was due to the previously mentioned unusual expenses incurred during the quarter of salaries and employee benefits expense and other expenses. The Company’s efficiency ratio was 61.1% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 58.5% for the second quarter of 2025 and 56.0% for the third quarter of 2024.

Income tax expense was $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate was 22.7% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to 19.1% for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and 23.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The fluctuations in the effective tax rate are largely driven by the timing and volume of certain stock-based compensation transactions resulting in tax benefits to the Company, as well as the timing and volume of state tax adjustments.

Net income was $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $447 thousand from $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2025, and a decrease of $707 thousand from $5.0 million during the third quarter of 2024. Diluted earnings per share were $0.30 for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.33 for the second quarter of 2025 and $0.38 for the third quarter of 2024. Earnings per share and other share-based metrics have been impacted by the shares issued in the previously disclosed private placement of shares of common stock completed in October 2024.

The Company had 187 full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 2025, compared to 188 full-time equivalent employees as of June 30, 2025, and 159 full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 2024.

Balance Sheet

Total assets increased 5.6% to $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2025, from $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2025, and increased 24.2% from $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. The increase in total assets from June 30, 2025 was primarily driven by higher loan balances as well as an increase in other assets primarily due to a bank owned life insurance investment of $15 million during the third quarter of 2025. The increase in total assets from September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by increases in loans, interest bearing deposits with banks, investment securities, and all other assets. Total assets, including $970 million of sold loans for which servicing is retained, totaled $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2025.

Total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, were $940.6 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $871.6 million as of June 30, 2025, and $781.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Loans, net of deferred fees and costs increased $69.0 million during the third quarter of 2025 primarily due to increases in commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and consumer loans, primarily due to credit cards, and partially offset by decreases in construction, multifamily and residential loans. The increase in loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $159.6 million from September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by increases of $145.8 million in commercial real estate loans. Total guaranteed loans as a percentage of loans(1) were 20.6% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 22.1% as of June 30, 2025, and 26.0% as of September 30, 2024.

The Company’s allowance for credit losses totaled $10.6 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $9.2 million as of June 30, 2025, and $7.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.12% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 1.06% as of June 30, 2025, and 1.02% as of September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding guaranteed portions(1), was 1.42% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 1.36% as of June 30, 2025, and 1.37% as of September 30, 2024.

Deposits totaled $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $59.7 million from $1.032 billion as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of $208.7 million from $883.5 million as of September 30, 2024. By deposit type, the increase from the prior quarter was driven by an increase of $82.3 million in certificates of deposit and a $6.5 million increase in interest bearing demand deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $227.9 million as of September 30, 2025, a decrease of $992 thousand from $228.9 million as of June 30, 2025, and a decrease of $2.0 million from $229.9 million as of September 30, 2024.

The Company’s ratio of loans to deposits was 86.1% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 84.4% as of June 30, 2025, and 88.4% as of September 30, 2024.

The Company held no short-term borrowings as of September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025, or September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had approximately $503.8 million in available borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, and through its various fed funds lines of credit with its correspondent banks.

Subordinated notes outstanding totaled $26.1 million as of September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024.

Stockholders’ equity was $158.2 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $151.7 million as of June 30, 2025, and $116.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The increase in stockholders’ equity from June 30, 2025 is attributable to increases in retained earnings resulting from net income earned during the quarter. The increase in stockholders’ equity since September 30, 2024 was the result of the previously disclosed private placement of shares of common stock completed in October 2024 and net income earned over the previous twelve months.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total assets was 12.2% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 12.3% as of June 30, 2025, and 11.1% as of September 30, 2024. The Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 13.7% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 13.8% as of June 30, 2025, and 13.1% as of September 30, 2024. The increase in the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio since September 30, 2024 was impacted by the downstream of $15.0 million in additional capital from the Company to the Bank during the first quarter of 2025. The Company’s book value per share was $11.07 as of September 30, 2025, an increase of 4.1% from $10.63 as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of 24.3% from $8.91 as of September 30, 2024.

Asset Quality

The provision for credit losses for loans totaled $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $570 thousand for the third quarter of 2024. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2025 totaled $836 thousand, or 0.35% of average net loans (annualized), compared to net loan charge-offs of $870 thousand, or 0.38% of average net loans (annualized) in the second quarter of 2025 and $22 thousand of net loan recoveries, or 0.01% of average net loans (annualized) during the third quarter of 2024. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2025 were attributable to certain commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and credit card relationships.

Nonaccrual loans increased $16.4 million during the quarter to $34.6 million as of September 30, 2025, and increased $29.2 million from $5.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The guaranteed portion of nonaccrual loans totaled $27.1 million as of June 30, 2025. Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest totaled $184 thousand as of September 30, 2025, compared to $146 thousand as of June 30, 2025, and $27 thousand as of September 30, 2024. The balance of loans past due 90 days and accruing of $184 thousand at September 30, 2025 was comprised entirely of credit card balances which are non-guaranteed.

The Company held $2.7 million of other real estate owned as of September 30, 2025. The Company held no other real estate owned as of June 30, 2025 or September 30, 2024.

Non-performing assets totaled $37.5 million as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $19.1 million from $18.4 million as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of $32.1 million from $5.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Non-performing assets, excluding guaranteed portions, totaled $10.4 million as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $5.8 million from $4.6 million as of June 30, 2025 and an increase of $8.8 million from $1.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The increase in non-performing assets during the third quarter of 2025 was the result of both (i) the transfer of $16.6 million of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans from accrual to nonaccrual status during the quarter, and (ii) $2.7 million of other real estate properties assumed during the quarter.

While the quarter over quarter percentage increase in non-performing assets seems significant when viewed alone, the financial risk is seen to be well contained with a reasonable non-performing asset risk ratio to total assets of 0.80% when removing the guaranteed portion of each non-performing asset. Further, it is important to consider the process we undertake when a collateralized SBA non-performing asset requires collection efforts. We repurchase the sold portion of the guaranteed loan to affect the foreclosure and resale of the property. This process immediately increases the non-performing asset balance on our balance sheet to include the guaranteed portion – thus the importance of always adjusting for the guaranteed portion of the non-performing assets as well as considering our “off balance sheet” assets consisting of the sold portion of SBA guaranteed loans of $970 million that increase our total assets under management to $2.3 billion.

Loans past due between 30 and 89 days and accruing interest totaled $3.6 million as of September 30, 2025, a decrease of $4.6 million from $8.2 million as of June 30, 2025, and a decrease of $8.8 million from $12.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The guaranteed portion of loans past due between 30 and 89 days and accruing interest was $2.4 million as of September 30, 2025.

The ratio of total non-performing assets to total assets was 2.88% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 1.49% as of June 30, 2025, and 0.52% as of September 30, 2024. The ratio of non-performing assets, excluding guaranteed portions, to total assets(1) was 0.80% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 0.37% as of June 30, 2025, and 0.15% as of September 30, 2024.

The Company continues to closely monitor credit quality in light of the ongoing economic uncertainty caused by, among other factors, continued uncertainty regarding U.S. trade and tariff policy and the lingering inflationary pressures, and the risk of the resurgence of elevated levels of inflation, in the United States and our market areas. Accordingly, additional provisions for credit losses may be necessary in future periods.

Other Financial Highlights

SBA Lending and Commercial Banking

SBA lending and commercial banking loan originations totaled $242.1 million during the third quarter of 2025, including a record of $92 million in the month of September, compared to $160.5 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $156.4 million for the third quarter of 2024. Loan sale volume increased to $110.8 million during the third quarter of 2025, compared to $82.1 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $71.4 million for the third quarter of 2024. Gain on sale of loans increased 38.5% to $3.6 million, compared to $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased 26.6% from $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The average pretax gain on sale of loans margin was 3.24% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.16% for the second quarter of 2025 and 3.98% for the third quarter of 2024.

Gaming FinTech

Our Gaming Payments Operations in the third quarter of 2025 focused upon redirecting all credit card marketing to our gaming consumers; concluding and subsequently terminating a third party non-gaming direct mail market agreement; onboarding BoltBetz with Distill and Terrible Gaming slots; enhancing our influencer marketing with the engagement of Champ Mike Tyson; and, concluding the development and launch of our digital credit card application platform with the most advanced KYC and fraud protections. This new application platform will enable our influencers to support the growth of GBank's credit card gaming customers.

Our initial efforts to “patch” the existing application platform were not successful and required that we halt applications when we were faced with identification fraud. This pause stopped the fraud applications but also resulted in limiting the growth in the number of gaming cardholders. Despite this, credit card transaction volumes increased almost 60% sequentially to more than $131 million during the third quarter of 2025.

The Prepaid Access/Slot program involving BoltBetz is continuing to make significant progress with Distill Taverns and Terribles Gaming onboarding over 2,500 slot machines. BoltBetz is in the final process of Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) testing by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. This is the final process required to launch which is now anticipated in November 2025.

The Pooled Player (“PPA™”) pipeline continues to develop new payments agreements with both the Prepaid Access accounts and virtual ATM providers which are expected to launch in the coming quarters following the receipt of final regulatory approvals.

Including BoltBetz, BankCard Services LLC (“BCS”) and GBank now have sixteen active payment and PPA™ and Pooled Consumer (“PCA™”) Program clients. Currently, BCS and GBank are conducting due diligence for five new clients, with anticipated onboarding in future quarters. Gaming FinTech deposits averaged $37.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $39.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. We anticipate deposit growth from BoltBetz Casino clients to commence in the second quarter of 2026.

[TITLE]Optimizing carbon footprint in long-haul heavy-duty E-Truck transportation:
[TEXT]
Our preliminary model and approach were initially introduced in our conference paper28. In this section, we provide a more comprehensive and self-contained presentation of our model and approach for completeness, which includes detailed problem formulation, improved algorithm with lower time complexity, performance analysis, and discussion on model limitation.

System model

We model the highway system as a directed graph \({\mathcal{G}}=({\mathcal{V}},{\mathcal{E}})\). The node set \({\mathcal{V}}={{\mathcal{V}}}_{r}\cup {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}\) consists of road connection points \({{\mathcal{V}}}_{r}\) and charging stations \({{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}\). The edge set \({\mathcal{E}}\subset {\mathcal{V}}\times {\mathcal{V}}\) represents physical road segments. Each road segment \(e\in {\mathcal{E}}\) has a length D e and speed limits \([{R}_{e}^{lb},{R}_{e}^{ub}]\), which define the minimum and maximum travel times \({t}_{e}^{lb}={D}_{e}/{R}_{e}^{ub}\) and \({t}_{e}^{ub}={D}_{e}/{R}_{e}^{lb}\), respectively. Without loss of generality, we assume homogeneous road conditions (e.g., grade) on each road segment. Following the model in refs. 5,28, we model the energy consumption rate (in kW) on segment e as a convex function of the traveling speed r e , denoted \({f}_{e}({r}_{e}):[{R}_{e}^{lb},{R}_{e}^{ub}]\to {\mathbb{R}}\). This function f e (r e ) is primarily determined by the road grade and the E-Truck’s weight. Note that f e (r e ) can be negative on downhill segments due to regenerative braking29. Given the convexity of f e ( ⋅ ), we can assume the E-Truck travels at a constant speed on segment e without loss of optimality [ref. 5, Lem. 1]. We ignore the acceleration and deceleration phases between road segments, since their contribution to overall time and energy consumption is typically negligible relative to the entire segment duration, as justified in refs. 5,28. The total energy consumed to traverse segment e in time t e is then given by the perspective function c e (t e ) = t e ⋅ f e (D e /t e ), which is also convex in t e by the convexity preserving property of the perspective function30. We assume c e (t e ) is non-increasing in t e , as the increasing domain can be excluded without loss of optimality5,28.

At each charging station \(v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}\), an E-Truck may wait for a time duration \({t}_{w}\in [{t}_{w}^{lb},{t}_{w}^{ub}]\) and charge for a time duration \({t}_{c}\in [0,{t}_{c}^{ub}]\). The lower bound \({t}_{w}^{lb}\) accounts for the minimum time required for a driver to stop and wait in a charging queue, etc. The upper bound \({t}_{w}^{ub}\) is introduced to maintain model regularity and avoid excessively long waiting times. For ease of presentation, we employ a homogeneous lower bound across all charging stations and time periods while preserving the framework’s broad applicability. Its extension to heterogeneous lower bounds for different charging stations is straightforward. A discussion on more sophisticated, dynamic waiting time estimation can be found in Discussion on Model Limitation.

We model the charging process at \(v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}\) with a concave function Φ v (t). It gives the battery SoC achieved after charging from an empty battery for a duration t. For an initial SoC β v , the increase in SoC after charging for time t c is given by:

$${\phi }_{v}({t}_{c},{\beta }_{v})={\Phi }_{v}({\Phi }_{v}^{-1}({\beta }_{v})+{t}_{c})-{\beta }_{v}.$$ (2)

Here, \({\Phi }_{v}^{-1}\) denotes the inverse of the function Φ v ; see Supplementary Fig. 2 in Supplementary Information Section 5.1 for an illustration. While E-Trucks may support multiple charging modes, e.g., fast and regular charging, this work assumes the exclusive use of fast charging at all stations for simplicity. The inclusion of multiple charging schemes can be accommodated by modeling each scheme with a distinct charging node at the station and duplicating the adjacent road segments to connect these nodes. The concave charging function naturally captures the characteristic behavior of batteries, where the charging rate decreases as the state of charge (SoC) increases29,31, and provides a more realistic modeling framework compared to the constant charging rate approximation32.

At each charging station \(v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}\), the carbon intensity is represented by a continuous function \({\pi }_{v}(\tau ):{\mathbb{R}}\to {\mathbb{R}}\) (in kg/kWh), where τ denotes the arrival time at node v. For simplicity, we set τ 0 = 0 at the origin o. Note that carbon intensity data can be well predicted at hourly intervals, as discussed in ref. 33. Given this function, if an E-Truck with an initial SoC β v begins charging at time τ v and continues for a duration t c , the resulting carbon footprint is expressed as:

$${F}_{v}(\,{\beta }_{v},{t}_{c},{\tau }_{v})=\frac{1}{\eta }\mathop{\int}

olimits_{0}^{{t}_{c}}{\pi }_{v}({\tau }_{v}+\xi )\frac{{\partial }_{-}{\phi }_{v}}{\partial t}(\xi,{\beta }_{v})d\xi .$$ (3)

Here, η (with 0 < η ≤ 1) represents the battery’s charging efficiency. The left partial derivative \(\frac{{\partial }_{-}{\phi }_{v}}{\partial t}(\xi,\beta )\) corresponds to the charging rate at time ξ given initial SoC β. This carbon footprint function, which integrates the product of carbon intensity and instantaneous charging rate, yields a nonlinear and nonconvex expression.

A stage-expanded graph based problem formulation

We consider the problem of minimizing the carbon footprint for an E-Truck traveling from an origin \(o\in {\mathcal{V}}\) to a destination \(d\in {\mathcal{V}}\), under a hard deadline T and subject to the battery SoC constraints. The E-Truck begins with an initial SoC β 0 and has a battery capacity B, and is permitted to make up to N charging stops during the journey. Limiting the number of charging stops is reasonable in practice, as our analysis reveals that trips with 1500 miles typically only need 3–4 charging stops on average, while longer routes require proportionally more charging stops. Within our simulation dataset, the maximum observed charging requirement reached 12 stops for origin-destination pairs exceeding 3000 miles. This variable charging frequency reflects the realistic operational constraints of current E-truck technology and charging infrastructure, where trip distance directly influences charging strategy and route planning complexity.

In the following, we formulate the problem using the stage-expanded graph technique we mentioned in the “Results” section. A preliminary version of this formulation was presented in our conference paper28. Here, we provide a more comprehensive and self-contained presentation for completeness.

In the stage-expanded graph \({{\mathcal{G}}}_{s}\), a complete path is composed of N + 1 subpaths that connect the origin, up to N charging stations, and the destination. The selection of the charging stop at each stage and the road segments used in each subpath are represented by the binary variables. Specifically, for every charging station \(v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}\), a binary variable \({y}_{v}^{i}\in \{0,1\}\) is introduced, with \({y}_{v}^{i}=1\) indicating that station v is chosen as the i-th charging stop. Similarly, for each subpath i ∈ {1, …, N + 1} and each road segment \(e\in {\mathcal{E}}\), a binary variable \({x}_{e}^{i}\in \{0,1\}\) is defined, where \({x}_{e}^{i}=1\) denotes that segment e is selected in the i-th subpath. To simplify notation, we aggregate these variables as follows: \({{\bf{x}}}^{i}={\{{x}_{e}^{i}\}}_{e\in {\mathcal{E}}}\), \({\bf{x}}={\{{{\bf{x}}}^{i}\}}_{i=1}^{N+1}\), \({{\bf{y}}}^{i}={\{{y}_{v}^{i}\}}_{v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}}\), and \({\bf{y}}={\{{{\bf{y}}}^{i}\}}_{i=1}^{N+1}\). The feasible set for (x, y) is defined by the constraints that ensure connectivity, proper sequencing, and consistency across the subpaths and charging stops:

$${\mathcal{P}}=\left\{\left({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}}\right)| \,{x}_{e}^{i}\in \left\{0,1\right\},\,\forall e\in {\mathcal{E}},i\in \left\{1,\ldots,N+1\right\},\right.$$ (4a)

$${y}_{v}^{i}\in \left\{0,1\right\},\forall v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c},i\in \left\{0,\ldots,N+1\right\},$$ (4b)

$$\sum _{e\in {\rm{Out}}(v)}{x}_{e}^{i}-\sum _{e\in {\rm{In}}(v)}{x}_{e}^{i}={y}_{v}^{i-1}-{y}_{v}^{i},\,\forall v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c},i\in \left\{1,\ldots,N+1\right\},$$ (4c)

$$\sum _{v\in {\mathcal{V}}}{y}_{v}^{i}=1,\sum _{v\in {\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c}}{y}_{v}^{i}=1,\,\forall i\in \left\{0,1,\ldots,N+1\right\},$$ (4d)

$$\left.{y}_{o}^{0}=1,{y}_{d}^{N+1}=1\right\}.$$ (4e)

In the above set, \({\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c}={{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}\cup \{o,d\}\). Out(v) denotes the set of outgoing edges at node v and In(v) denotes the set of incoming edges at node v. The constraint (4c) enforces the flow conservation at each stage, ensuring that the path is continuous and connected. Constraint (4d) guarantees that exactly one charging station is selected per stage. Constraint (4e) specifies the boundary conditions at the origin o and the destination d. We also note that the feasible set \({\mathcal{P}}\) also accommodates paths with fewer than N charging stops, as the same charging station can be selected in consecutive stages.

Next, we introduce the decision variables for speed and charging planning. At each stage i and road segment e, we define \({t}_{e}^{i}\) as the travel time on segment e during stage i. Additionally, for each charging station v considered as the i-th stop, we define \({t}_{w}^{i,v}\) and \({t}_{c}^{i,v}\) as the waiting time and charging time, respectively. These variables are aggregated as follows: \({{\bf{t}}}^{i}={\left\{{t}_{e}^{i}\right\}}_{e\in {\mathcal{E}}}\), \({{\bf{t}}}_{w}^{i}={\left\{{t}_{w}^{i,v}\right\}}_{v\in {\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c}}\), \({{\bf{t}}}_{c}^{i}={\left\{{t}_{c}^{i,v}\right\}}_{v\in {\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c}}\), and \({\bf{t}}={\left\{\left({{\bf{t}}}^{i},{{\bf{t}}}_{w}^{i},{{\bf{t}}}_{c}^{i}\right)\right\}}_{i=0}^{N+1}\). The corresponding feasible set is given by

$$\begin{array}{rcl}{\mathcal{T}}&=&\left\{{\bf{t}}\,| \,{t}_{e}^{i}\in [{t}_{e}^{lb},{t}_{e}^{ub}],\forall e\in {\mathcal{E}},i\in \left\{1,\ldots,N+1\right\},\right. \hfill\\ &&\left.{t}_{w}^{i,v}\in \left[{t}_{w}^{lb},{t}_{w}^{ub}\right],{t}_{c}^{i,v}\in \left[0,{t}_{c}^{ub}\right],\forall v\in {\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c},i\in \left\{1,\ldots,N\right\},\quad {t}_{w}^{0}={t}_{c}^{0}=0\right\}.\end{array}$$ (5)

We define \({\tau }_{v}^{i}\) as the arrival time at which the E-Truck arrives at charging station v for its i-th stop. These arrival times are collected into the vector \({\boldsymbol{\tau }}={\{{\tau }_{v}^{i}\}}_{v\in {\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c},i\in \{0,\ldots,N+1\}}\). The feasible set for τ is determined by constraints that ensure temporal consistency with the travel, waiting, and charging times:

$${{\mathcal{T}}}_{\tau }=\left\{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}\,| \,{\tau }_{v}^{i}\in [0,T],\forall v\in {\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c},i\in \left\{0,\ldots,N+1\right\}\right\}.$$ (6)

We impose the constraint that the total duration for travel and charging during the i-th stage must fall within the predefined time window allocated for that stage:

$${\delta }_{i}^{\tau }({{\bf{x}}},{{\bf{y}}},{{\bf{t}}},{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}})= \mathop{\sum}\limits_{e\in {{\mathcal{E}}}}{x}_{e}^{i}{t}_{e}^{i}+\mathop{\sum}\limits_{v\in {{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c}}{y}_{v}^{i-1}\left({t}_{w}^{i-1,v}+{t}_{c}^{i-1,v}\right) \\ - \mathop{\sum}\limits_{v\in {{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c}}\left({y}_{v}^{i}{\tau }_{v}^{i}-{y}_{v}^{i-1}{\tau }_{v}^{i-1}\right)\le 0.$$ (7)

In the above constraint, the first term represents the travel time along the i-th subpath, while the second term accounts for the time spent at the (i − 1)-th charging stop, including both waiting and charging. The third term corresponds to the total scheduled time duration allocated between the (i − 1)-th and i-th charging stops, ensuring that the cumulative time used does not exceed the available window.

During the trip, it is crucial that our decisions prevent any battery overflow or underflow on each road segment, which may introduce numerous constraints and complicate the problem. Next, we seek to reduce the number of SoC constraints by leveraging a useful observation in practice.

We observe from empirical studies that regenerative braking provides only a limited amount of energy to the E-Truck, as noted in ref. 34. Given this practical insight, we demonstrate that by maintaining a mild reserve in the SoC upon arrival at a charging stop for a given stage, it is possible to ensure that the SoC remains positive throughout the entire subpath associated with that stage.

Specifically, let \({\beta }_{v}^{i}\) represent the battery SoC of the E-Truck upon arrival at charging station v during the i-th stop. We aggregate these variables into the vector \({\boldsymbol{\beta }}={\left\{{\beta }_{v}^{i}\right\}}_{v\in {\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c},i\in \{0,\ldots,N+1\}}\), whose feasible set is defined by:

$${{\mathcal{S}}}_{\alpha }=\left\{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}\,| \,{\beta }_{v}^{i}\in [\alpha B,B],\forall v\in {\tilde{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c},i\in \left\{0,\ldots,N+1\right\},{\beta }_{o}^{0}={\beta }_{0}\right\},$$ (8)

where α ∈ [0, 1) is a parameter that sets a conservative lower bound on the SoC upon arrival at any charging station. The initial SoC at the origin is given by β 0 . The SoC constraint that prevents battery depletion upon arrival at charging stop i is given by:

$${\delta }_{i}^{\beta }({{\bf{x}}},{{\bf{y}}},{{\bf{t}}},{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}})= \mathop{\sum}\limits_{e\in {{\mathcal{E}}}}{x}_{e}^{i}{c}_{e}({t}_{e}^{i})+\mathop{\sum}\limits_{v\in {{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c}}{y}_{v}^{i}{\beta }_{v}^{i} \\ -\mathop{\sum}\limits_{v\in {{{\mathcal{V}}}}_{c}}{y}_{v}^{i-1}\left({\beta }_{v}^{i-1}+{\phi }_{v}({\beta }_{v}^{i-1},{t}_{c}^{i-1,v})\right)\le 0.$$ (9)

In this expression, the first term corresponds to the total energy consumed along the i-th subpath, the second term represents the SoC upon arrival at the i-th charging stop, and the third term indicates the SoC after departing from the (i − 1)-th charging stop. We then demonstrate that, under the condition that regenerative braking contributes only a minor amount of energy, a small value of α is adequate to maintain feasible SoC levels throughout each subpath.

Lemma 1

Consider an E-Truck traversing a subpath consisting of n road segments en route to a charging stop, starting with an initial SoC β 0 . Let \({c}_{i}\in {\mathbb{R}}\) denote the energy consumed (or harvested, if negative) on the i-th segment. Provided the harvested energy from regenerative braking is relatively small such that:

$$\frac{1}{2}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{n}\left(| {c}_{i}| -{c}_{i}\right)\le \frac{\alpha }{2(1-\alpha )}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{n}{c}_{i},$$ (10)

and if the initial SoC β 0 is large enough to support the cumulative energy consumption:

$${\beta }_{0}-\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{n}{c}_{i}\ge \alpha B,$$ (11)

then the E-Truck maintains a non-negative SoC throughout this subpath.

Note that the amount of energy harvested–represented by the left-hand side of inequality (10)–by an E-Truck traveling on the US highway network is indeed relatively small34. This is primarily because the maximum allowable grade on U.S. highways does not exceed 6%35, which restricts the potential for large energy harvesting through regenerative braking. Our simulation results confirm that setting α = 0.06 is adequate to maintain non-negative SoC in the majority of cases. Furthermore, a comparison with a lower bound scenario where α = 0 reveals only a minor performance gap from introducing the conservative ratio α. The details of this comparison are provided in Supplementary Information Section 8.1. For scenarios involving non-negligible harvested energy, an extended treatment is provided in Supplementary Section 10.

The Carbon Footprint Optimization (CFO) problem is then formulated as follows:

$$CFO:\,\min {F}_{0}({\beta }_{d}^{N+1})+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N}\sum _{v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}}{y}_{v}^{i}{F}_{v}({\beta }_{v}^{i},{t}_{c}^{i,v},{\tau }_{v}^{i}+{t}_{w}^{i,v})$$ (12a)

$${\rm{s}}.{\rm{t}}.\,{\delta }_{i}^{\tau }({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}},{\bf{t}},{\boldsymbol{\tau }})\le 0,\,\forall i\in \left\{1,\ldots,N+1\right\},$$ (12b)

$${\delta }_{i}^{\beta }({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}},{\bf{t}},{\boldsymbol{\beta }})\le 0,\,\forall i\in \left\{1,\ldots,N+1\right\},$$ (12c)

$${\rm{var}}.({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}})\in {\mathcal{P}},{\boldsymbol{\beta }}\in {{\mathcal{S}}}_{\alpha },{\boldsymbol{\tau }}\in {{\mathcal{T}}}_{\tau },{\bf{t}}\in {\mathcal{T}}.$$ (12d)

Our objective is to minimize the carbon footprint (12a), where \({F}_{0}({\beta }_{d})={\pi }_{0}\cdot {\left({\beta }_{0}-{\beta }_{d}\right)}_{+}={\pi }_{0}\cdot \max \left\{0,{\beta }_{0}-{\beta }_{d}\right\}\) represents the carbon footprint for the used electricity in the initial battery and π 0 is the carbon intensity of the electricity in the initial battery. Constraint (12b) is the time scheduling constraint at each stage, the details of which are referred to (7). Constraint (12c) is the SoC constraint for each subpath, the details of which could be referred to (9).

The following theorem presents the hardness result of the CFO problem.

Theorem 1

The CFO problem is NP-hard. Further, it is NP-hard even just to find a feasible solution for the problem.

This hardness result was initially presented in our conference paper36 without the proof. Here we provide a proof in Supplementary Section 11.2 for completeness. Theorem 1 implies that unless P = NP, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can generate a feasible solution to some CFO problem. Such a result indicates that finding a feasible solution efficiently is difficult in the worst case. However, we observe that the hard case only happens when the deadline is stringent. In particular, we consider the following problem, which seeks to find the fastest solution subject to the SoC feasibility constraints:

$$T_f=\, \min \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \sum\limits_{v \in {{\mathcal{V}}}_c} y^{i}_{v} (t_c^{i,v}+t_w^{i,v})+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N+1} \sum\limits_{e \in {{\mathcal{E}}}} x_e^i t_e^i$$ (13a)

$${\rm{s}}.{\rm{t}}.\,{\delta }_{i}^{\beta }({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}},{\bf{t}},{\boldsymbol{\beta }})\le 0,\,\forall i\in \left\{1,\ldots,N+1\right\}$$ (13b)

$${\rm{var}}.\,({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}})\in {\mathcal{P}},{\boldsymbol{\beta }}\in {{\mathcal{S}}}_{\alpha },{\bf{t}}\in {\mathcal{T}}.$$ (13c)

We denote the optimal solution of (13) as T f . Note that when the user-specified deadline T in the CFO problem (12) is the same as the minimum time T f , it becomes difficult to find a feasible solution of (12) because the problem (13) is NP-hard and finding a feasible solution to the CFO problem (12) is as difficult as finding the optimal solution to the fastest solution for (13). In practice, however, the deadline T is usually determined by the customer and may not be close to the minimum possible travel time T f . In the following, we shall assume that the deadline T is larger than the total time of a practical baseline solution, and our approach starts with a feasible solution produced by such a practical baseline. We also provide a discussion on how to handle the case when such an assumption fails and the deadline T = (1 + ϵ)T f is close to T f in Supplementary Section 10.

An efficient algorithm with performance guarantees

In this section, we introduce an efficient dual-based algorithm for the CFO problem, leveraging structural properties derived from the formulation in (12). The algorithm utlizes a partially dualization technique5,6,37 for the constraints (12b) and (12c). After the partial dualization, we can convert the original problem (12) into a tractable dual problem that can be decomposed into small subproblems and a shortest path problem on the stage-expanded graph. We then update the dual variables by the subgradient method to obtain the final solution. Note that a preliminary version of this algorithm was presented in our conference paper28. In this extended work, we offer a more detailed elaboration of the algorithm, accompanied by a methodological improvement that enhance its clarity and reduce its computational complexity.

To construct a partially-relaxed dual formulation of the CFO problem presented in (12), we relax constraints (12b) and (12c), associating dual variables \({\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }\) and \({\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }\) with each, respectively. The dual variable \({\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }\) represents the price of the scheduled deadline at the stage i, and \({\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }\) represents the price of the SoC at the stage i. The Lagrangian function is given by combining the objective function and constraints using dual variables, i.e.,

$$L({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}},{\bf{t}},{\boldsymbol{\beta }},{\boldsymbol{\tau }},{\boldsymbol{\lambda }})={F}_{0}({\beta }_{d}^{N+1})+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N}\sum _{v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}}{y}_{v}^{i}{F}_{v}({\beta }_{v}^{i},{t}_{c}^{i,v},{\tau }_{v}^{i}+{t}_{w}^{i,v})$$ (14a)

$$+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N+1}{\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }{\delta }_{i}^{\tau }({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}},{\bf{t}},{\boldsymbol{\tau }})+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N+1}{\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }{\delta }_{i}^{\beta }({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}},{\bf{t}},{\boldsymbol{\beta }}).$$ (14b)

Here we stack the dual variables into a vector λ = (λβ, λτ). The definition of each term in the above Lagrangian function could be found in the CFO problem in (12).

The corresponding dual problem then seeks to maximize the dual function D(λ), which is the minimum value of the Lagrangian function L( ⋅ ) given a λ, i.e.,

$$D({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})=\mathop{\min }\limits_{\begin{array}{c}({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}})\in {\mathcal{P}},\hfill\\ {\boldsymbol{\beta }}\in {{\mathcal{S}}}_{\alpha },{\boldsymbol{\tau }}\in {{\mathcal{T}}}_{\tau },{\bf{t}}\in {\mathcal{T}}\end{array}}L({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}},{\bf{t}},{\boldsymbol{\beta }},{\boldsymbol{\tau }},{\boldsymbol{\lambda }}).$$ (15)

The dual problem is then given by

$$\mathop{\max }\limits_{{\boldsymbol{\lambda }}\ge 0}D({\boldsymbol{\lambda }}).$$ (16)

In the dual subgradient algorithm used to solve the problem, efficient computation of the dual function D(λ) is crucial. Here, we proceed to discuss the methodology for computing D(λ) efficiently. After plugging in the definitions and rearranging the terms in (15), we observe that computing D(λ) given λ is to solve a two-level optimization problem. The inner level involves multiple independent subproblems, each corresponding to an individual road segment or a charging station. The outer level involves a combinatorial optimization problem focusing on path and charging station selection.

$$D({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})={D}_{1}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})+\mathop{\min }\limits_{{\beta }_{d}^{N+1}\in [\alpha B,B]}\left({\lambda }_{N+1}^{\beta }{\beta }_{d}^{N+1}+{F}_{0}({\beta }_{d}^{N+1})\right)$$ (17a)

$$+\mathop{\min }\limits_{({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}})\in {\mathcal{P}}}\left(\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N+1}\sum _{e\in {\mathcal{E}}}{x}_{e}^{i}\underbrace{\mathop{\min }\limits_{{t}_{e}^{i}\in [{t}_{e}^{lb},{t}_{e}^{ub}]}{g}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{e}^{i})}_{{w}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }}):{\rm{speed}} \; {\rm{planning}}}\right.$$ (17b)

$$\left.+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N}\sum _{v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}}{y}_{v}^{i}\underbrace{\mathop{\min }\limits_{\begin{array}{c}{t}_{c}^{i,v}\in [0,{t}_{c}^{ub}],{t}_{w}^{i,v}\in [{t}_{w}^{lb},{t}_{w}^{ub}],\\ {\beta }_{v}^{i}\in [\alpha B,B],{\tau }_{v}^{i}\in [0,T]\end{array}}{h}_{v}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{c}^{i,v},{t}_{w}^{i,v},{\beta }_{v}^{i},{\tau }_{v}^{i})}_{{\sigma }_{v}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }}):{\rm{charging}} \; {\rm{planning}}}\right),$$ (17c)

where \({D}_{1}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})=-{\lambda }_{N+1}^{\tau }T-{\beta }_{0}{\lambda }_{1}^{\beta }\) is a constant for any given λ and the functions \({g}_{e}^{i}(\cdot )\) and \({h}_{v}^{i}(\cdot )\) are auxiliary functions for ease of presentation. In particular, the function \({g}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{e}^{i})\) is given by

$${g}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{e}^{i})={\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }{t}_{e}^{i}+{\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }{c}^{e}({t}_{e}^{i}),$$ (18)

and the function \({h}_{v}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{c}^{i,v},{t}_{w}^{i,v},{\beta }_{v}^{i},{\tau }_{v}^{i})\) is given by

$$\begin{array}{rcl}&&{h}_{v}^{i}\left({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{c}^{i,v},{t}_{w}^{i,v},{\beta }_{v}^{i},{\tau }_{v}^{i}\right)={F}_{v}\left({\beta }_{v}^{i},{t}_{c}^{i,v},{\tau }_{v}^{i}+{t}_{w}^{i,v}\right)+{\lambda }_{i+1}^{\tau }\left({t}_{w}^{i,v}+{t}_{c}^{i,v}\right)\\ &&\quad+\left({\lambda }_{i+1}^{\tau }-{\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }\right){\tau }_{v}^{i}+\left({\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }-{\lambda }_{i+1}^{\beta }\right){\beta }_{v}^{i}-{\lambda }_{i+1}^{\beta }{\phi }_{v}\left({\beta }_{v}^{i},{t}_{c}^{i,v}\right).\end{array}$$ (19)

Intuitively, \({g}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{e}^{i})\) includes all terms associated with the road segment e in stage i, representing the cost of traveling time \({t}_{e}^{i}\) under the dual prices λ. \({h}_{v}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{c}^{i,v},{t}_{w}^{i,v},{\beta }_{v}^{i},{\tau }_{v}^{i})\) includes all terms associated with charging station v at stage i, representing the cost of arriving at time \({\tau }_{v}^{i}\) with SoC \({\beta }_{v}^{i}\), waiting \({t}_{w}^{i,v}\), and charging for \({t}_{c}^{i,v}\) time under the dual prices λ.

Next, we show how to efficiently compute the dual function D(λ) based on (17), which includes solving the three types of subproblems (17a), (17b) and (17c) and determining the path and charging station selection \(({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}})\in {\mathcal{P}}\).

The first type of subproblem in (17a) is a single-variable optimization problem with respect to \({\beta }_{d}^{N+1}\), which can be solved efficiently. We define its optimal value as

$$\rho ({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})=\mathop{\min }\limits_{{\beta }_{d}^{N+1}\in [\alpha B,B]}\left({\lambda }_{N+1}^{\beta }{\beta }_{d}^{N+1}+{F}_{0}\left({\beta }_{d}^{N+1}\right)\right).$$ (20)

The second type of subproblem in (17b) is a single-variable optimization problem with respect to \({t}_{e}^{i}\). We define its optimal value as

$${w}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})=\mathop{\min }\limits_{{t}_{e}^{i}\in [{t}_{e}^{lb},{t}_{e}^{ub}]}{g}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{e}^{i}),$$ (21)

where the function \({g}_{e}^{i}(\cdot )\) is defined in (18). Given any λ, the above problem is a single-variable optimization problem for every edge e at stage i, which can be solved efficiently. The above optimization problem aims to find the optimal travel time \({t}_{e}^{i}\) for each edge e at stage i that balances the trade-off between the traveling time \({t}_{e}^{i}\) and the energy consumption c e (t e ) with the weighting factor λ.

The third type of subproblem in (17c) is a 4-variable optimization problem with respect to \({t}_{c}^{i,v},{t}_{w}^{i,v},{\beta }_{v}^{i}\) and \({\tau }_{v}^{i}\). We define its optimal value as

$${\sigma }_{v}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})=\mathop{\min }\limits_{\begin{array}{c}{t}_{c}^{i,v}\in [0,{t}_{c}^{ub}],{t}_{w}^{i,v}\in [{t}_{w}^{lb},{t}_{w}^{ub}],\\ {\beta }_{v}^{i}\in [\alpha B,B],{\tau }_{v}^{i}\in [0,T]\end{array}}{h}_{v}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }},{t}_{c}^{i,v},{t}_{w}^{i,v},{\beta }_{v}^{i},{\tau }_{v}^{i}).$$ (22)

Given the dual variable λ that gives the tradeoff between the objective and the constraints, the above optimization problem aims to find the optimal charging time \({t}_{c}^{i,v}\), waiting time \({t}_{w}^{i,v}\), battery SoC \({\beta }_{v}^{i}\) and the arriving time \({\tau }_{v}^{i}\) at stage i for each charging station v. The value of σ(λ) can be computed in \(O({M}^{4}/{\epsilon }_{1}^{4})\) time using a Branch and Bound (BnB) approach38, which involves sovling the fixed-size, 4-variable non-convex problem in (22). Here, \(M=\max\{t_c^{ub},t_w^{ub},B,T\}\) represents the diameter of the box constraint in subproblem (22), and ϵ 1 denotes the desired solution accuracy.

Upon resolving the above inner level subproblems (20), (21) and (22), we can rewrite the dual function D(λ) in (17) in terms of ρ, w, σ as follows:

$$D({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})={D}_{1}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})+\rho ({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})+\mathop{\min }\limits_{({\bf{x}},{\bf{y}})\in {\mathcal{P}}}\left(\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N+1}\sum _{e\in {\mathcal{E}}}{w}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }}){x}_{e}^{i}+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N}\sum _{v\in {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}}{\sigma }_{v}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }}){y}_{v}^{i}\right).$$ (23)

While the outer-level problem in (23) initially presents itself as a complex integer program, it can be effectively transformed into a shortest path problem on the stage-expanded graph \({{\mathcal{G}}}_{s}\). Here, each edge e at stage i is assigned a weight \({w}_{e}^{i}({\boldsymbol{\lambda }})\), and virtual edges linking node v from stage i to i + 1 are given weights \({\sigma }_{v}^{i}\). This reformulation not only simplifies the problem but also leads to a improvement in computational complexity (cf. Proposition 1) compared to our prior work28, which relied on a more intricate graph construction.

Given any dual variable λ, the value of D(λ) can be efficiently computed by first solving subproblems (20), (21), and (22), and subsequently addressing the outer problem (23) using shortest-path algorithms on the stage-expanded graph. To iteratively refine the dual variable λ, we employ a dual subgradient method. Let λ[k] represent the dual variable at iteration k. The update rule is applied as follows:

$${\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }[k+1]={\left({\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }[k]+{\theta }_{k}\underbrace{{\delta }_{i}^{\beta }\left({{\bf{x}}}^{*}[k],{{\bf{y}}}^{*}[k],{{\bf{t}}}^{*}[k],{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}^{*}[k]\right)}_{{\delta }_{i}^{\beta }[k]}\right)}_{+},$$ (24a)

$${\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }[k+1]={\left({\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }[k]+{\theta }_{k}\underbrace{{\delta }_{i}^{\tau }\left({{\bf{x}}}^{*}[k],{{\bf{y}}}^{*}[k],{{\bf{t}}}^{*}[k],{{\boldsymbol{\tau }}}^{*}[k]\right)}_{{\delta }_{i}^{\tau }[k]}\right)}_{+}.$$ (24b)

The values x*[k], y*[k], t*[k], β*[k], τ*[k] are obtained by solving subproblems (23), (21), and (22) using the current dual variable λ[k]. These solutions yield the subgradient components \({\delta }_{i}^{\beta }[k]\) and \({\delta }_{i}^{\tau }[k]\) for D(λ). We use the operator (a) + to represent \(\max \{0,a\}\), and θ k denotes the adaptive step size at iteration k.

The overall approach is outlined in Box 1. We first initialize the solution by the baseline solution sol 0 (cf. discussion below Theorem 1) and then iteratively compute D(λ) and update λ via the subgradient direction. Intuitively, the dual variables λ can be viewed as penalties associated with violating the scheduled deadline and the battery SoC constraints. A higher value of \({\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }\), for example, places larger emphasis on the constraint \({\delta }_{i}^{\beta }\), leading to several consequences. First, it increases the influence of energy cost in (18), which in turn leads to longer travel times solved from the edge subproblem (21). Meanwhile, an increase in \({\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }\) leads to a decrease in the scheduled battery SoC \({\beta }_{v}^{i}\) at the i-th stop, while simultaneously increasing \({\beta }_{v}^{i-1}\) and extending the charging time \({t}_{c}^{i,v}\) at the (i − 1)-th stop. This indicates that a higher \({\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }\) amplifies the difference in scheduled SoC between consecutive charging stops (i − 1) and i. A similar interpretation holds for the dual variable \({\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }\). Essentially, the algorithm in Box 1 aims to iteratively update the dual variables to identify a solution that balances the objective and the penalties from the constraints.

We now present a theoretical analysis of our approach, establishing three key properties: (i) the algorithm guarantees convergence with a rate of \(O(1/\sqrt{K})\), with K number of iterations; (ii) the computational complexity per iteration remains polynomial with respect to the graph size; and (iii) under certain conditions, the algorithm will produce the optimal solution, while otherwise will produce the solution with bounded suboptimality. The proofs are available in the Supplementary Information.

Consistent with classical subgradient methods39, the proposed algorithm in Box 1 achieves convergence to the dual optimal value at the same \(O(1/\sqrt{K})\) rate.

Theorem 2

Let D* denote the optimal dual objective, and \({\overline{D}}_{K}\) represent the maximum dual value achieved over K iterations of the algorithm in Box 1. Using a constant step size \({\theta }_{k}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\) for all 1 ≤ k ≤ K, there exists a positive constant C such that the following holds:

$${D}^{*}-{\overline{D}}_{K}\le \frac{C}{\sqrt{K}}.$$ (25)

Theorem 2 shows that a constant step size \(1/\sqrt{K}\) is sufficient to achieve a convergence rate of \(O(1/\sqrt{K})\). To obtain faster convergence, one may adaptively update the step sizes40 or modify the subgradient directions41.

Next, we provide a summary of the time complexity per iteration for the algorithm outlined in Box 1, as described in the following proposition.

Proposition 1

The time complexity per iteration of the algorithm in Box 1 is given by

$$O\left({\left(N+1\right)}^{2}| {\mathcal{V}}| | {\mathcal{E}}|+N| {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}| \frac{{M}^{4}}{{\epsilon }_{1}^{4}}\right),$$ (26)

where \(M=\left\{{t}_{c}^{ub},{t}_{w}^{ub},B,T\right\}\) and ϵ 1 denotes the tolerance level used to determine convergence when solving the subproblems (22).

Proposition 1 establishes that, the computational complexity per iteration of our approach remains bounded by a polynomial function of the graph size. Note that as compared to our conference version28, the time complexity per iteration has been improved by a factor of \(| {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}| \), mainly due to a more efficient treatment for solving the outer integer problem (23).

Recall that Theorem 2 ensures that the algorithm in Box 1 converges to a solution in \(O(1/{\epsilon }_{0}^{2})\) number of iterations, with the accuracy tolerance ϵ 0 . By combining Proposition 1 and Theorem 2, the total time complexity of the algorithm in Box 1 is given by

$$O\left(\frac{1}{{\epsilon }_{0}^{2}}\left({\left(N+1\right)}^{2}| {\mathcal{V}}| | {\mathcal{E}}|+N| {{\mathcal{V}}}_{c}| \frac{{M}^{4}}{{\epsilon }_{1}^{4}}\right)\right).$$ (27)

Note that a convergence to the dual optimum does not necessarily guarantee convergence to the primal optimum due to the potential existence of a duality gap. We thus establish the following posterior bound on the suboptimality.

Theorem 3

Let OPT denote the optimal objective value for the problem in (12). If the algorithm described in Box 1 generates a feasible solution during iteration k≥1 with an objective value of ALG, then the optimality gap can be bounded as follows:

$$ALG-OPT\le -\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N+1}\left({\lambda }_{i}^{\beta }[k]{\delta }_{i}^{\beta }[k]+{\lambda }_{i}^{\tau }[k]{\delta }_{i}^{\tau }[k]\right).$$ (28)

Note that this posterior bound in (28) can be evaluated during each iteration of the algorithm in Box 1, enabling early termination when a desired accuracy level is reached. Furthermore, Theorem 3 also establishes an optimality condition for the generated solution, as formalized in the following corollary.

Corollary 1

If the algorithm in Box 1 returns a feasible solution in line 9, then the solution is optimal.

Box 1 A Dual Subgradient Algorithm for CFO

Discussion on model limitation

While our model and approach provide a comprehensive framework that captures the essential components of carbon-optimized E-Truck operations, there are several real-world considerations that are not explicitly modeled in this study. Below, we analyze how these considerations impact carbon footprint optimization for E-trucks and discuss potential integration approaches within our methodology.

Driver work/rest regulations

Regulatory frameworks worldwide mandate specific driver work and rest periods to ensure safety and well-being. In the United States, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Hours of Service (HOS) rules require: (i) maximum 11 h driving within a 14-h workday followed by 10 consecutive hours rest, (ii) mandatory 30-min break after 8 h driving, and (iii) weekly limits of 60 h over 7 days or 70 h over 8 days. Similarly, EU Drivers’ Hours Rules mandate (i) a maximum of 9 h daily driving, (ii) a 45-min break after 4.5 h driving, and (iii) a 45-h weekly rest period. While existing literature addresses driver scheduling under work/rest regulations42,43, these studies neither consider E-truck routing with intermittent charging requirements nor time-dependent carbon intensity dynamics, limiting their direct applicability to our problem. Given that deliveries in our scenarios may require 15–60 h of driving, the most relevant constraints are short breaks and mandatory rest periods. These requirements alter arrival times at charging stations, thereby affecting the carbon intensity of charging energy. Our framework could accommodate these regulations by synchronizing rest stops with charging schedules and incorporating mandatory breaks into route stages. Take the US HOS rules as an example, we could implement the following adaptations: (i) We can group every two stages and add a constraint that the total driving time in these two stages should not exceed 11 h. We can then add a constraint that the minimum waiting time \({t}_{w}^{lb}\) after the second stage in the group should be 10 h. (ii) We can add a constraint that the total driving time in every stage should not exceed 8 h, and the minimum waiting time \({t}_{w}^{lb}\) after every stage should be 30 min. The choice of \({t}_{w}^{lb}\) and the number of stages in a group can be adjusted based on the specific regulations and operational requirements. Our proposed scheme can be readily extended without new difficulty to solve the problem with these new constraints by following the same mathematical derivation steps in the “Methods” section. This adaptation would maintain regulatory compliance while leveraging dynamic carbon intensity variations across different charging times and locations. However, it may incur optimality loss as it reduces the feasible solution space. A comprehensive evaluation of work/rest regulation impacts on carbon savings merits dedicated future investigation.

Payload restrictions

Payload constraints encompass two dimensions: (i) vehicle-specific maximum load capacity and (ii) road-specific axle load limits. Regarding vehicle capacity, our current framework assumes a predetermined payload based on transportation requirements, with appropriate truck selection occurring prior to route optimization. Since payload directly influences energy consumption44, incorporating diverse truck types and payload configurations would enhance assessment precision. Our approach can be extended to broader vehicle and payload scenarios, which should be straightforward. For road-specific restrictions, we can preprocess the transportation network by removing edges where the payload exceeds allowable limits, ensuring regulatory compliance. Our approach then operates on this filtered network without requiring framework modifications. We also note that stricter payload regulations effectively reduce the feasible solution space, potentially limiting achievable carbon savings.

Weather impacts

Weather conditions affect three key model components: (i) carbon intensity function π v (τ) through wind and solar irradiance variations, (ii) energy consumption function c e (t e ) via wind speed and temperature effects, and (iii) travel speed limits during adverse conditions. For carbon intensity, state-of-the-art prediction tools like CarbonCast45 already incorporate weather impacts on renewable energy generation and grid carbon intensity33,45. Our framework implicitly accounts for weather-related carbon intensity variations through these prediction systems. For energy consumption and speed limits, we can integrate weather forecasts as additional model parameters46 to enhance realism and accuracy. Implementation would involve incorporating weather predictions to update these functions, then applying our approach with modified inputs. To address prediction uncertainties and unexpected conditions, we could incorporate buffers in travel deadlines and battery capacity while enabling dynamic re-planning when conditions change drastically.

Dynamic speed limits

Dynamic speed limits due to time-varying traffic conditions or heterogeneous road types could impact the design space of carbon-optimized operation. Integrating dynamic speed limits into the model would require real-time updates to travel speeds and route plans, potentially leveraging traffic condition predictions. Our stage-expanded graph approach could be adapted to accommodate these dynamic travel speed limits. For example, we can divide the time into different traffic phases (e.g., morning and evening rush hours)47 and treat each traffic phase as another type of stage. Therefore, in the stage-expanded graph, each stage also corresponds to a traffic phase, and our approach can thus be adapted to accommodate the dynamic travel speed limits. Such adaptation, however, may complicate the model and thus requires further investigation.

Sophisticated queueing model for charging stations

Recall that for ease of presentation, we employ a homogeneous lower bound of the waiting time \({t}_{w}^{lb}\) across all charging stations and time periods while preserving the framework’s broad applicability. Its extension to heterogeneous lower bounds for different charging stations is straightforward. More sophisticated, dynamic waiting time estimation could incorporate queuing theory approaches based on charging station capacity and traffic-derived arrival rates48,49, or simulation-based methodologies50. These refined queuing estimates could subsequently be integrated into our optimization framework for enhanced delivery planning accuracy.

We would like to note that, while more sophisticated models would undoubtedly increase realism, our work represents a comprehensive framework addressing carbon footprint optimization in E-truck operations. Our primary objective is to demonstrate the potential of carbon-aware E-truck strategies within broader decarbonization initiatives. We believe our current modeling approach provides a robust foundation for establishing this potential, while more sophisticated models constitute valuable directions for future research.

Simulation setup

Transportation network

We utilize the U.S. highway network data from the Map-based Educational Tools for Algorithm Learning (METAL) project51. The constructed network comprises 84,504 nodes and 178,238 edges. Road segment grades are calculated using elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)52, based on the endpoints of each segment. For real-time traffic conditions, we integrate the speed data obtained from HERE Maps20.

Energy consumption model

To obtain energy consumption data, we employ the FASTSim simulator53, and evaluate the energy consumption across varying driving speeds (ranging from 10 mph to 70 mph in increments of 0.2 mph) and road grades (from −6 to 6% in steps of 0.25%). It is worth noting that the maximum permissible grade for interstate highways in the United States, as specified in ref. 35, is a 6-m elevation change over 100 meters of road length. We subsequently fit the collected energy consumption data using cubic polynomial functions, which are also used in prior studies5,37,47. Among heavy-duty E-Truck models, we select the Tesla Semi54 as our primary vehicle model based on several key considerations specific to our U.S.-focused case study. The Tesla Semi currently offers the longest commercially advertised range (500 miles) among heavy-duty electric trucks available in the U.S. market. While alternative electric truck models are emerging, their typical operational ranges of 200–300 miles are not well-suited for the long-haul transportation scenarios examined in this study. More importantly, the Tesla Semi’s 500-mile range represents what we believe to be a realistic and achievable benchmark for electric truck capabilities as the technology matures and becomes more widely adopted. This range specification allows us to model scenarios that reflect the anticipated operational potential of electric trucking rather than being constrained by current technological limitations. For comparative reference, we have included a comprehensive overview of available electric truck models in the U.S. market in Table 2. We set the battery capacity to B = 1000 kWh (derived from manufacturer-reported energy consumption rates) and the gross vehicle weight to 36 tons, consistent with class 8 truck standards for highway freight.

Table 2 A summary of the available heavy-duty E-Truck models in the US Full size table

Origin destination pair and start time

We collect origin-destination pairs from the Freight Analysis Framework (FAF)13. We divide the long-haul origin-destination pairs into the following four distance categories: 500–1000 miles, 1000–1500 miles, 1500–2000 miles, and 2000+ miles. We select the top 100 pairs based on freight values from each group, resulting in a total of 400 origin-destination pairs. For each origin-destination pair, we select the corresponding nearest nodes in the highway network graph as the origin and destination nodes, respectively. For each origin-destination pair, we conduct the simulation with the start time of travel at 8:00 AM on February 1st, May 1st, August 1st, and November 1st, 2024, to account for seasonal variations in carbon intensity. For future projections, we use the same date and time with varying years.

Charging station data

Given the limited availability of dedicated truck-specific charging networks, we collect the location data of light-duty EV charging stations from OpenStreetMap (OSM)19. While these stations primarily serve light-duty EVs, we consider them operationally relevant for heavy-duty electric truck analysis for two critical reasons. First, dedicated truck-specific charging networks remain limited in current U.S. infrastructure deployment, making existing charging locations the most realistic foundation for near-term planning. Second, existing light-duty EV charging infrastructure can be technically adapted to accommodate heavy-duty electric trucks through power scaling and connector modifications, as demonstrated in recent infrastructure studies55. Consequently, OSM’s charging location data provides a realistic and practical foundation for heavy-duty electric truck infrastructure planning and operational optimization studies within the U.S. context. We merge the charging stations with the same locations into a single charging station. The dataset includes 1, 636 charging stations, and we model their charging functions using a piecewise linear approximation with breakpoints at 0%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100% battery SoC29. This model indicates that the studied E-Truck can be charged from 0% to 80% in 48 min. A visual representation of this charging process is provided in Supplementary Fig. 2 within Supplementary Information Section 5.1. For carbon intensity data, we utilize the Cambium datasets15, from which we derive a piecewise linear carbon intensity function π( ⋅ ) for each charging station. The charging efficiency η is set to 0.956.

ICE truck model

We adopt the parameters of the Kenworth T800 trailer57 for the ICE truck model. We set the same total weight of 36 tons as the E-Truck model. The FASTSim simulator is then employed to gather fuel consumption data for the ICE trucks, from which we derive the corresponding energy consumption function. To quantify carbon emissions, we apply the CO 2 emission factor for diesel provided by the EIA58. According to the data, a diesel-powered ICE truck emits 10.19 kg of CO 2 per gallon of diesel consumed, which is equivalent to 0.25 kg of CO 2 per kWh of energy. We assume that the ICE trucks begin its journey with a full fuel tank at the origin. Given the ubiquitous refueling infrastructure for conventional vehicles, we further assume that ICE trucks can access refueling stations with negligible detour or delay during transit.

Carbon-efficient operations for ICE trucks and hydrogen FCE-trucks

For ICE trucks, the carbon-efficient operation is equivalent to the energy-efficient operation, as we assume ICE trucks’ refueling takes negligible time along the transportation task. The CFO problem reduces the energy-efficient driving problem for ICE trucks, and our approach reduces to the dual-based method in5. We thus use the algorithm in5 to compute the carbon-optimized operation for ICE trucks. For hydrogen FCE-Trucks, we use the same energy consumption model as E-Trucks. We assume all the hydrogen fuel consumed by FCE-Trucks is produced by electrolysis of water using the electricity from the same region as the hydrogen refueling station59. Additionally, we assume that the hydrogen refueling stations are co-located with the electric charging stations. Because the FCE-Truck usually has a longer range and a shorter refueling time than the E-Truck, a feasible E-Truck operation is also a feasible hydrogen FCEV truck operation for the same transportation task. In the simulation, we adopt the same carbon-optimized operation for E-Trucks to the hydrogen FCE-Trucks. We then evaluate the carbon footprint of FCE-Trucks with an electrolysis efficiency of 80%60 and a hydrogen-to-electricity efficiency of 60%61. Although this direct application is sub-optimal, it still results in a substantial reduction in carbon emissions for FCE-Trucks. With our primary focus on E-Trucks, we defer a more comprehensive study on the carbon-optimized operation for FCE-Trucks to future research.

Electric grid projection

We use the electric grid projection data from the Cambium dataset15. We use the following three scenarios: (i) BAU: the business-as-usual scenario, called “Mid-case” in the Cambium dataset; (ii) CONSERVATIVE: a conservative projection that assumes the cost of renewable investment remains high in the future, called “High Renewable Energy and Battery Costs” in the Cambium dataset; (iii) OPTIMISTIC: an optimistic projection that achieves the electric grid meets the full decarbonization target by 203516, called “Mid-case with 100% Decarbonization by 2035” in the Cambium dataset. By default, we use carbon intensity data in 2024 with the BAU scenario.

Vehicle adoption projection

We use the vehicle adoption projection data from ref. 14. We select the data for long-haul heavy-duty trucks (class 7–8). We do not differentiate the hybrid electric trucks and ICE trucks in the simulation as they are both powered by diesel, and hybrid electric trucks contribute little fuel efficiency improvement in the long-haul task61. We use the following three different scenarios for the vehicle adoption projection: (i) NORMAL: the scenario with central assumption, called “Central” in ref. 14; (ii) ADVANCED: the scenario with lower charging infrastructure cost and higher utilization, called “Adv. Electricity” in ref. 14. (iii) CONSTRAINED: the scenario with constrained FCE-Truck and E-Truck technology advancement, called “Cons. ZEV Tech Progress” in ref. 14.

Baseline comparison

We evaluate and compare the following truck operation strategies: (i) CARBON: our proposed approach focused on minimizing carbon footprint; (ii) ENERGY: a variant of our approach where the objective is to minimize energy consumption, achieved by setting a uniform carbon intensity π( ⋅ ) ≡ 1; (iii) FAST: our methodology applied to the problem defined in (13), which aims to identify solutions with the shortest possible travel time. (iv) PRACTICE: a conceivable baseline that mimics the human practice for driving an E-Truck. In particular, we first compute the fastest path from the origin to the destination without intermediary charging stops. We then simulate the E-Truck to drive at the fastest speed until the battery is below tol = 20% SoC. We then find and route to the nearest charging station and fully charge the battery. We repeat the process until the destination is reached. If we can not find a feasible solution, we restart the procedure with a larger tol ← tol +5%.

Runtime environment

We implement our approach in the Julia programming language62 and run the simulation on the High-Performance Computing system CityU Burgundy with multiple computing nodes. Each node is equipped with two AMD EPYC 7742 64-core CPUs and 512 GB of memory. For each problem instance, we use 8 CPU cores and 16GB of memory to compute the solution with our approach.

[TITLE]Why Nations That Bet on Renewables Will Win the Next Energy Era:
[TEXT]
Fossil fuel dependence has long been a geopolitical liability. The crises over Middle East embargoes, pipeline disruptions, and Russia’s weaponization of gas supply have repeatedly exposed how brittle energy systems built on oil and gas can be. By contrast, renewable energy offers a fundamentally different strategic logic: once deployed, solar and wind farms are far less exposed to conventional geopolitical disruption. They are not immune from supply chain risks, but as electricity systems mature, renewables provide a pathway out of fossil vulnerability, and into resilience.

The fossil fuel trap

History has shown time and again how control over oil and gas can become a lever of power, or coercion. Russia’s gas cutoffs to Europe have jolted markets and exposed dependency. The OPEC oil embargoes in the 1970s reshaped global diplomacy and left economies reeling. Even today, many nations scramble to secure long-term fuel deals, maintain strategic reserves, or sustain naval dominance over shipping lanes, all because hydrocarbons must physically move, cross borders, and traverse vulnerable chokepoints.

In contrast, once your solar farms and wind parks are in place, the fuel, sunlight, wind, is local, free, and beyond blockade. The more distributed your renewable base, the less you depend on foreign suppliers to feed your grid. You reduce exposure to embargoes, pipeline sabotage, shipping disruptions, sanctions, and counterparty risk. That shift is not theoretical; it is visible in how energy security discussions are increasingly linking strategic resilience with renewables.

Renewables as strategic infrastructure

The strategic advantage of renewables lies in decentralization. A well-distributed network of solar, wind, storage, and smart grid infrastructure means that local disruptions have limited systemic effect. Rather than a small number of giant fuel producers dominating global flows, energy supply becomes more diversified across regions, stakeholders, and resources. Related: UK Sets £1.08 Billion Offshore Wind Budget In 2030 Push

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) observes that geopolitical shocks, like Russia’s war in Ukraine, have in many cases accelerated renewable deployment, because countries realize the fragility of traditional energy routes. Renewables lessen the role of money and diplomacy in securing fuel flows.

Another way to see the shift: nations that manage to build a robust renewables base gain strategic autonomy. They can rely less on imports, reduce the leverage others have over them, and direct more economic energy investment inward.

The elephant in the room: Supply chains for renewables

Of course, renewables are not a utopia. Their deployment is intimately tied to the supply chains for critical minerals, manufacturing of turbines, panels, inverters, batteries, and grid infrastructure. Much of that value chain remains concentrated in just a few countries. Disruptions in mining, processing, shipping or rare earth supply could slow deployment or introduce new dependencies.

But there is a critical difference: the risks in renewable supply chains are disruption of build-out, not disruption of operating fuel supply. If raw materials or components are delayed, you postpone new capacity. But an existing wind farm doesn’t stop generating because a mine somewhere is in turmoil. The resilience is forward-looking.

In this sense, the dependency trade shifts from fuel supply to component supply, and that is a less existential vulnerability. Moreover, unlike oil and gas infrastructure designed for extraction decades ago, renewable supply chains can be diversified, regionalized, and redesigned with security in mind. Nations can choose to localize critical parts of the value chain, stockpile key minerals, drive recycling, or invest in alternate materials to reduce concentration risk.

Strategic voices recognizing the shift

The strategic shift is being noticed in security and defense circles. In a 2024 workshop on “Clean Energy is National Security,” participants referenced how militaries increasingly see fossil fuel single-source dependency as a threat, and view distributed renewables as part of resilient energy and security planning. The former U.S. Admiral Samuel Locklear and retired generals have engaged in dialogue about the strategic necessity of clean energy for defense readiness.

Meanwhile, analysts at think tanks like Stimson argue that the paradigm of energy security must evolve: in the future, energy security will look less about securing oil flows and more about stabilizing technology supply lines, grid robustness, and clean energy redundancy. The green transition changes the chessboard, not just the pieces.

A strategic imperative, not a climate wish

The shift is not simply about emissions or climate activism. It is about power, influence, survival. Countries that remain overexposed to fossil fuel imports will be more vulnerable to coercion, price shocks, and supply disruptions. Countries that build resilient, distributed renewables and robust supply chains will gain strategic maneuverability.

This is not to underplay the complexity. Governments must safeguard and diversify supply chains for components and minerals. They must invest in recycling, alternative chemistries, and onshore manufacturing. They must anticipate geopolitical pressure over critical minerals just as they once had to negotiate over oil.

But the strategic move is clear: the future of energy warfare is unlikely to be over pipelines. It will be about cyberattacks, grid resilience, software, storage, materials, and local adaptability. And the more a country depends on fossil imports, the more vulnerable it becomes to disruptions, whether by war, diplomacy, sanctions, or sabotage.

Conclusion

Fossil fuels gave great power to those who controlled them, but they also chained many nations to them. The vulnerability was baked into the model. Renewables, by contrast, allow countries to turn the tables: to convert energy from a strategic weakness into a pillar of resilience. Yes, supply chain risks exist, but they are manageable and mitigable. What matters is who leads this shift, who secures the value chains, and who designs energy systems with strategic autonomy at their core.

The geopolitical age of oil and gas may already be waning. The age of renewables and resilience is dawning. The choice is not only moral or environmental, it is strategic. And those who ignore it do so at their peril.

At least $80 billion of nuclear reactors will be built across the United States in a partnership with the U.S. government, the three companies involved in the project said on Tuesday.The plan represents one of the most ambitious U.S. investments in atomic energy in decades, underscoring President Donald Trump's agenda to maximize energy output, focused on oil, gas, coal and nuclear.It also comes as growth in artificial intelligence data centers boosts U.S. power demand for the first time in two decades, straining parts of the grid.Under the agreement with Westinghouse Electric , Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management , the U.S. government will arrange financing, and will help secure permits for the plants using Westinghouse reactors.In return, the U.S. government would be granted a participation interest that, once vested, will allow it to get 20% of any cash distributions in excess of $17.5 billion made by Westinghouse, the companies said.The companies did not say when the U.S. government interest would vest, but added that the government must make a final investment decision and enter agreements to complete construction of the plants.U.S.-listed shares of Cameco were up more than 21% in midday trading.Building new U.S. nuclear reactors has been difficult due to soaring costs as well as public concern

[TITLE]Inside India’s Energy Transition: Tata Power’s Net Zero Strategy:
[TEXT]
Tata Power stood at the forefront of India’s energy transition. The firm’s long history was deeply intertwined with the country’s development. As Mumbai’s power needs increased, Tata Power built out thermal assets across India, and while thermal power generation remained Tata Power’s mainstay, the firm slowly started diversifying. By 2024, Tata Power was India’s largest private power producer by installed capacity with annual revenues of $7.4 billion. In 2020, Tata Power boldly announced a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050, concurrent with a complete phase-down of thermal capacity. It later brought this commitment forward to 2045.

BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, where we dive deep into Harvard Business School’s groundbreaking case studies. It’s been 10 years since 195 nations signed the Paris Agreement, the landmark international treaty that formalized the concept of net zero emissions. Today, thousands of companies around the world have set ambitious goals to achieve net zero emissions, including Tata Power, India’s oldest and largest private power producer.

By 2045, Tata has committed to phasing down its reliance on coal, even as India’s energy demand continues to grow. Today’s case looks at whether Tata Power can balance profitability with purpose as it diversifies into renewables, distributed energy, EV charging, and smart grids. Should they focus narrowly on their strongest businesses or is being integrated across the value chain, a source of resilience in a transforming sector? And what lessons does their journey offer for companies navigating similar energy transitions worldwide?

Today on Cold Call, we’ll discuss the case, “Tata Power and India’s Energy Transition” with Professor Vikram Gandhi and Dr. Praveer Sinha, CEO of Tata Power. I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR podcast network.

[TITLE]Petronas Keeps the Gas Flowing as Malaysia Burns More Coal:
[TEXT]
Liquefied natural gas has once again become trendy. After several years under attack from environmentalists, even the EU has accepted that natural gas, in whatever form it can get it, is going to stay in the energy mix for quite a while yet. The U.S. is building new export capacity like there is no tomorrow; Qatar is ramping up output; and Malaysia is boosting coal imports so it has more LNG to export.

Over the first half of the year, Malaysia imported a record amount of thermal coal—the sort used for power generation. The total for the six-month period stood at 20.9 million tons, and coal accounted for as much as 60% of electricity output over the period. It did not stop there, however. Coal imports continued at elevated levels after June, too. Reuters’ Gavin Maguire reported the news, noting that the surge in coal imports is linked to Malaysia’s appetite for higher LNG exports, lamenting the consequent increase in carbon dioxide emissions from the power generation sector.

Malaysia is already one of the largest exporters of liquefied natural gas globally. However, unlike other top exporters, it has found it difficult to boost natural gas—and LNG—production. Gas reserve decline has coincided with energy demand growth that is only going to accelerate in the coming years, suggesting demand for coal will remain robust. Not only that, but the LNG exporter will have to start importing LNG.

Indeed, Australia’s Woodside Energy last month inked a deal with Malaysia’s Petronas for the delivery of 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually to the latter. Deliveries will begin in 2028 and continue for a term of 15 years. Meanwhile, Petronas continues to explore for new supply to secure future demand, Wood Mackenzie analysts noted in a report on Malaysia’s future energy demand and supply trends. The consultancy noted the expected strong growth in demand for energy both from the power generation and the industrial sectors, and the decline in local production, notably in peninsular Malaysia, where Wood Mac sees a sharp drop from this year onwards.

This will not affect Malaysia’s exports immediately, however. The country is going to remain a net exporter of liquefied natural gas until the 2040s, according to Wood Mac. It will probably continue using quite a lot of coal for local power generation in the meantime. The reason for this is as simple as they come. Imports of coal are a lot cheaper than what Petronas makes from exporting liquefied gas.

Because of its ambition to keep boosting gas exports—and revenues from these—Malaysia has countered a global trend in shifting from coal to natural gas in power generation. Unlike other countries that have made the switch to the best of their financial abilities, Malaysia has seen the share of natural gas in its power generation mix drop from as much as 80% in the 2000s to just 30% this year, according to Reuters’ Maguire, who cited data from climate change advocacy outlet Ember.

From an energy transition perspective, this is the wrong path to follow. However, Malaysia’s coal choice means there is more LNG for other countries that, without that option, would resort to coal-burning themselves. There is an obvious conclusion to be drawn from this situation and it comes down to the fact that despite the growing popularity of natural gas, coal will continue to be used until such time as it becomes too expensive.

Malaysia, somewhat counterintuitively perhaps, is going to try this next year, when it plans to introduce a carbon tax on power utilities and heavy industries as part of its own transition efforts. Chances are, however, that it will continue importing coal to keep more natural gas for exports—until LNG supply overtakes demand.

[TITLE]Google and NextEra to Restart Iowa’s Duane Arnold Nuclear Plant to Power AI Era:
[TEXT]
NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) and Google have announced a landmark agreement to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa—the state’s only nuclear facility—to help meet soaring U.S. electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and data center growth. The 615-MW plant, located near Cedar Rapids, is scheduled to return to full operation by the first quarter of 2029, pending regulatory approval.

Under the 25-year agreement, Google will purchase a significant portion of the plant’s output as a 24/7 carbon-free energy source to power its cloud and AI infrastructure. The remaining capacity will be bought by Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO) on equivalent terms. NextEra Energy will assume full ownership of the facility after acquiring CIPCO and Corn Belt Power Cooperative’s combined 30% stake.

The Duane Arnold restart—shut down in 2020 after nearly five decades of service—marks a major return of nuclear generation to Iowa and underscores the growing convergence between Big Tech and clean baseload power. NextEra said the project will create around 400 permanent jobs and generate more than $9 billion in total economic benefits for Iowa, including $3 million annually in new tax revenue.

“This partnership with Google not only brings nuclear energy back to Iowa—it accelerates the development of next-generation nuclear technology,” said NextEra CEO John Ketchum, highlighting the collaboration’s role in strengthening U.S. grid reliability and advancing national energy independence.

Google, which has invested more than $7 billion in Iowa since 2007, framed the deal as essential to its AI-driven growth strategy. “Reopening Duane Arnold delivers reliable, clean power and hundreds of new jobs in the Hawkeye State,” said Ruth Porat, president and CFO of Alphabet and Google, calling it a model for similar clean energy investments across the country.

The companies also announced a strategic agreement to explore new nuclear generation projects nationwide, positioning nuclear power as a cornerstone of the AI and data economy. This comes amid growing concern that U.S. electricity demand—expected to rise sharply through 2035 due to AI, electrification, and manufacturing—will outpace renewable and grid expansion without firm, low-carbon generation sources.

Iowa officials hailed the move as a major milestone in the state’s energy evolution. Governor Kim Reynolds praised the project as “a fusion of nuclear and AI innovation that will drive economic growth, strengthen communities, and keep America competitive.”

[TITLE]GE Vernova Turbine Will Power New Indiana Gas-Fired Plant:
[TEXT]
Energy development group Maple Creek Energy LLC said it has secured an agreement to purchase a GE Vernova 7HA.03 gas turbine in a single-shaft configuration, along with associated services, for the first phase of the company’s two-phase Maple Creek natural gas-fired power project in Sullivan County, Indiana.

The installation is being developed by Advanced Power, a privately-owned global developer, manager, and owner of power generation infrastructure, along with BDC Power Holdings, a Bechtel company. Advanced Power is headquartered in Switzerland, with U.S. offices in Boston, Massachusetts, and Houston, Texas. Infrastructure investor ArcLight Capital Partners is the owner of Maple Creek and is funding the equipment procurement.

GE Vernova is a sponsor of POWER’s Experience POWER event in Denver, set for Oct. 29-31 at the Hyatt Regency Convention Center hotel. Clive Nickolay, CEO—Heavy Duty Gas Turbines & Aeroderivatives for GE Vernova, will sit down with POWER Senior Editor Darrell Proctor at the event on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 4 p.m., for a discussion of the company’s technology and the future of gas-fired power generation.

The agreement announced October 27 includes existing permits, land control, and transmission interconnection. The companies said they expect the project, a two-phase, gas-fueled electric-generation facility with more than 1.2 GW of generation capacity,, will enter commercial operation as soon as 2029. Officials in a news release on Monday said the “project will utilize lower-carbon natural gas and recovered steam in a combined-cycle configuration to deliver flexible, more sustainable energy to the MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator] grid.”

“Advanced Power’s expertise is delivering complex, modern power projects on time and on budget, while navigating the hurdles that emerge in a changing energy landscape,” said Tom Spang, CEO of Advanced Power. Spang told POWER, “Long equipment lead times have become one of those challenges, yet through disciplined planning, rigorous due diligence, and structured execution, we continue to develop facilities that generate reliable power and help empower communities.”

Bechtel Serves as EPC Lead

Bechtel Infrastructure & Power Corp. will serve as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor for the facility.

“Developing these grid-scale generation projects typically takes years, and this agreement with GE Vernova marks a pivotal milestone in the execution of a project that began in 2021,” said Spang. “Maple Creek will soon be ready to deliver reliable, dispatchable power to one of the fastest-growing load centers in the country. Advanced Power’s depth of experience in developing CCGT [combined-cycle gas turbine] facilities will strive to deliver a project designed for speed, flexibility, and performance—exactly what Indiana utilities and hyperscalers need to support growing demands for power and grid reliability.”

The companies noted that “securing GE Vernova’s power generation equipment eliminates a critical development risk: long-lead equipment procurement, at a time when global supply chain constraints continue to challenge other new generation projects. MISO projects an increase of up to 30 gigawatts [GW] in additional demand over the next decade, driven by ongoing factors such as the onshoring of manufacturing, continued electrification of the economy, and now, advancements in centers in the digital economy. We believe Maple Creek is uniquely positioned to meet this surge with scalable, lower-carbon power sooner than other proposed projects.”

“GE Vernova is honored that Advanced Power and BDC Power Holdings LLC have selected to develop the Maple Creek project with our most advanced 7HA.03 gas turbine technology, a testament to our commitment to helping accelerate new generation capacity to support demand growth in the United States,” said Dave Ross, president and CEO of GE Vernova’s Gas Power business in the Americas.

Maple Creek is part of Advanced Power’s broader development portfolio, which includes more than 12 GW of thermal and renewable generation projects and more than 9 GWh of energy storage. Click here to learn more about Advanced Power’s projects in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.
