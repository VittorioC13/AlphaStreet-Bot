Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) surged on December 18 after announcing a $6 billion all-stock merger with fusion energy company TAE Technologies. But retail investors aren’t buying the hype. Reddit sentiment collapsed from 78 to just 22 out of 100 immediately following the announcement, with the main discussion thread on r/stocks drawing 972 upvotes and 164 skeptical comments.

24/7 Wall St.

The disconnect is striking. While the stock posted strong single-day performance, retail traders are treating the news with deep cynicism rather than celebration.

Reddit Calls It an “Old School Penny Stock”

The tone on Reddit tells the real story. User cheddarben, whose post received overwhelming support from the community, captured the prevailing sentiment:

In the post, cheddarben wrote: “Old school penny stock with bizarro news. I am sure it will be a wild ride.” The characterization of Trump Media as operating like a penny stock resonated widely with commenters expressing similar skepticism.

Top-voted comments echoed this skepticism. Reddit user Unlucky-Clock5230 commented: “This is the most obvious pump and dump I’ve ever seen. The fundamentals are absolutely terrible.” Reddit user techgeek72 added: “TAE has been ‘five years away’ from fusion for the last 27 years. This merger is a joke.” Reddit user InvestmentGrift questioned: “How is a social media company with declining revenue suddenly worth billions by merging with a fusion company that’s never produced commercial energy?”

Retail investors have legitimate concerns:

Trump Media trades at a staggering 797x price-to-sales ratio with just $3.68 million in trailing revenue

The company posted negative EBITDA of $175.8 million and a net loss of $54.8 million last quarter

Revenue declined 3.8% year-over-year, moving in the wrong direction

Technical indicators support the skepticism, with the stock showing high volatility and overbought conditions following the announcement.

Truth Social Meets Fusion Energy

Despite recent gains, Trump Media remains down significantly year-to-date. The stock hit a 52-week low of $10.18 just days ago and trades well below its $43.46 peak. TAE Technologies, founded in 1998, has raised $1.3 billion pursuing commercial fusion energy but has yet to demonstrate a working power plant. The merged company plans to break ground on a 50-megawatt facility in 2026, with co-CEOs Devin Nunes and Michl Binderbauer leading the venture. For investors watching peers, the broader market offers a stark contrast. The S&P 500 is up 15% year-to-date, highlighting the challenging performance of Trump Media stock.

[TITLE]Blum Holdings, Inc. Announces Closing of Acquisition of High-Volume Bay Area Cannabis Retail Dispensary:
[TEXT]
DOWNEY, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blum Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: BLMH) (the “Company,” “Blüm,” “Blüm Holdings,” “we” or “us”), a California-based publicly traded holding company, today announced the successful closing of its acquisition of a high-volume Bay Area cannabis retail dispensary through the purchase of all outstanding equity of the operating entity.

The acquired dispensary is a well-established, fully licensed retail operator located in a major Northern California market and has generated approximately $12.0 million in annual revenue with a long operating history and strong local customer base. The transaction further expands Blüm’s Northern California footprint.

“This acquisition reflects our continued focus on disciplined, opportunistic growth,” said Sabas Carrillo, Chief Executive Officer of Blüm Holdings. “We are acquiring durable retail assets with real revenue, real customers, and meaningful operating history, positioning the Company to benefit from both improved execution at the asset level and broader structural tailwinds impacting the U.S. cannabis industry.”

The transaction was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement and included a combination of cash and equity consideration. The Company noted that all required closing conditions have been satisfied.

Carrillo added, “As the regulatory backdrop continues to evolve at the federal level, including ongoing discussions around potential reclassification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act, we believe scaled, compliant retail operators are well positioned to benefit from broader market development.”

Kolkata | Mumbai: The higher profitability in quick commerce, the fastest-growing sales channel for consumer goods makers, is diminishing primarily due to asharp increase in expenditure on advertising on the platforms, said industry executives.Profit margins of large fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in quick commerce have fallen to levels comparable with those in kirana stores and organised retail chains as they are forced to spend heavily on advertising given that shoppers on these platforms decide on impulse, mostly within a minute, they said. Platforms have been increasing advertising rates by auctioning premium listings and time slots.“The cost of doing business on quick commerce has gone up, whereby the profit margin has become almost similar to the general trade,” said Angshu Mallick, executive deputy chairman at AWL Agri Business Ltd, the country’s largest edible oil marketer.“Unless a brand is amongst the top three-four listings “The cost of doing business on quick commerce has gone up, whereby the profit margin has become almost similar to the general trade,” said Angshu Mallick, executive deputy chairman at AWL Agri Business Ltd, the country’s largest edible oil marketer.in categories where there is price competition like staples and essentials, it will lose out on sales. Hence, companies are forced to invest more to ensure their brands are visible as consumers spend 30-40 seconds to decide, said Mallick.“Quick commerce companies auction the slots and companies are buying at a hefty price,” he said.Until recently, the margins in quick commerce were the highest for the industry on account of higher sales of premium products, lower cost of distribution and shorter credit period. But margins have eroded significantly, companies across categories said, pointing out that the cost of marketing on the platforms has doubled for peak shopping periods such as 7:30-9:30 am and 5:30-7:30 pm. For instance, in the biscuit and snacks category, the current margins of 13-15% in quick commerce are on a par with those in modern retail while for the premium range they are around 20-22%. Margins have fallen 3-5 percentage points in the past three to six months, according to the executives. Zydus Wellness chief executive Tarun Arora said kirana stores have traditionally delivered higher margins to FMCG companies due to scale efficiencies, while quick commerce boosted profitability through a higher mix of premium products. “That advantage has since narrowed as quick commerce platforms shift their focus to improving their own profitability and negotiate more aggressively with brands,” he said. “Despite the margin change, these platforms are still viable for us interms of profit as well as sales.”In India, quick commerce initially dented sales of general trade as consumers opted for the convenience of instant deliveries over visits to neighbourhood kirana stores. However, it has increasingly replaced purchases from modern trade outlets and online grocery platforms as well. “Quick commerce companies are monetising through advertising. Given the increased investment on quick commerce now, the margins have become comparable with modern trade,” said Mayank Shah, vice president at Parle Products, India’s leading biscuit maker.The alternative channel has become the fastest-growing for FMCG companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), AWL Agri Business, Emami Marico and Dabur . For HUL , 70% of the business comes from general trade, 20% from modern trade, 8% from e-commerce and the rest from other channels. The country’s largest FMCG company doubled its quick commerce sales in the first six months of this financial year.

[TITLE]TikTok puts department stores in your phone. Macy’s and Nordstrom say not so fast:
[TEXT]
It’s shoppers like Quinn Kelsey who keep department store executives up at night.

The 38-year-old Denver resident gets makeup ideas from TikTok videos and other social media content, not salespeople at beauty counters. She uses an AI chatbot to get product recommendations that fit her budget and to see how a certain foundation or lipstick would look on her. When she buys, it’s usually from Amazon.

“I use Chat GPT as my personal beauty consultant,” Kelsey said. “Department stores? I’ll walk through one for the decor, but they’ve basically lost me unless I can get the same product-research experience there that I can get scrolling through my phone at home.”

Once the ultimate beauty destination, department stores lost sales and their authority as skincare and makeup trendsetters starting in the late 1990s. That was when the growth of Sephora and Ulta Beauty made shopping for cosmetics more of a playful, self-service experience.

But fast-changing consumer preferences have all types of retailers racing to outdo each other for a slice of the $129 billion U.S. beauty and personal care market. The competition is fiercer than ever due to the ease of e-commerce. Amazon, which has slowly added premium beauty brands to its massive selection, is the nation’s largest online seller of beauty and personal care products, according to market research company Euromonitor International.

Social media also has provided new sources of beauty guidance. Instead of store advisers, many consumers look to videos by influencers, beauty brand founders or dermatologists for advice. Shoppers also turn to TikTok and Instagram for information
