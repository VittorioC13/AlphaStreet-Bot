(See Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers section, Non-GAAP Financial Measure Disclosure table, Selected Segment Data table and reconciliation tables for additional information)

George Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our fiscal 2025 can be summarized by the successful integration of Tyman and the re-segmentation of our operating and reporting structure to align with our long-term strategic objectives, all while navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment. We believe the new segmentation represents a critical step in advancing our long-term Profitable Growth strategy and provides a solid framework to drive future revenue and margin expansion, which is consistent with the original thesis for the Tyman acquisition. Inflationary pressures, political instability, high interest rates, tariff uncertainty, housing affordability issues, and geopolitical tensions collectively weakened consumer confidence around the world, causing our end markets to decline meaningfully as compared to 2024. Despite these headwinds, we performed well and achieved another record year of safety performance, with both recordable incident and severity rates reaching historic lows.

“We continue to be encouraged by the overall resilience of the business in the current environment, demonstrated by our strong cash flow, which enabled us to repay a total of $75 million in bank debt in 2025. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and our liquidity improved further during the fourth quarter of 2025. While the integration of the Tyman business is substantially complete, we still believe there is a path to realizing approximately $45 million in cost synergies over time, above our initial projection of $30 million, which has been fully realized. In addition, we have made significant progress towards resolving the isolated operational issue at one of our window and door hardware plants in Mexico and we anticipate that the plant will be fully stabilized in the first half of fiscal 2026. Looking ahead, we continue to be optimistic

[TITLE]ECB to simplify bank capital rules but stick to buffer requirements:
[TEXT]

The European Central Bank (ECB) outlined plans to simplify bank regulation and capital rules on Thursday, but is sticking to its pledge not to ease overall capital reserve requirements.

The authority said the capital proposals are focused on having fewer – rather than lower – types of capital buffers lenders must hold to protect their balance sheets against shock losses.

Irish woman Sharon Donnery, a member of the ECB banking supervisory board, was a key member of the taskforce set up earlier this year to ease the burden of banking supervision following more than a decade of tighter rules in the wake of the global financial crisis, which resulted in taxpayer-funded bailouts of European banks.

In a statement, the ECB said its aim was to “simplify the framework” without endangering the “resilience of the European banking system”.

The ECB’s top decision-making body, its governing council, backed the recommendations. They will now be sent to the European Commission for consideration as part of a wider push by Brussels to streamline policies and laws to make the European Union more competitive.*

The taskforce concluded that the bloc’s current capital rules are overly complex and risk backfiring as investors may not understand them. European banks are at present subject to a number of individual capital buffers, four of which the ECB wants to merge into two.

“The variety of capital elements in place in the EU may decrease transparency and increase uncertainty as market participants face more challenges in assessing the capital framework,” the report said.

It suggested combining several individual capital surcharges that the ECB at present applies to banks based on their individual risk profile.

The report did not explicitly state whether the combined amount of capital that banks would be required to hold would stay the same, but it said lenders should “sustain current levels of resilience” to absorb losses in a crisis.

The ECB also proposed exempting more small lenders from the international Basel standards, which are designed for large, risky lenders with cross-border business.

At present, all banks with more than €5 billion in assets need to meet those rules, which the taskforce said created “undue complexity” and costs for lenders that were too small to have repercussions on financial stability.

The ECB suggested raising the threshold and adding more exemptions for smaller banks.

Still, the three domestic Irish lenders, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB will remain subject to standards set for larger banks.

The European Banking Federation welcomed the ECB’s report but said “concrete ‌and determined steps must now follow to enhance the global competitiveness of the EU’s financial sector”. – Additional reporting: Reuters, Financial Times

*Sentence corrected to read that the recommendations will now - rather than not - be sent to Brussels

Banks in the Asia-Pacific region, including those in India, have built stronger capital positions compared to their counterparts in the United States and Western Europe, Moody's highlighted in its latest survey report.The survey pointed out that a comparison of the largest banks in Asia-Pacific systems with peers in the US and Western Europe shows they generally have built strong capital positions under prudent regulatory supervision.Further, it noted that large Asia-Pacific banks' risk-weighted asset (RWA) densities reflect their underlying asset risks, consistent with their credit losses for the past 10 years. It also added that the banks' RWA densities vary across the Asia-Pacific.Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) represent a bank's assets adjusted for risk levels, meaning loans or investments considered riskier are assigned higher weights. A bank with higher RWA density indicates that a larger part of its assets carries higher risk.Explaining the capital strength, Moody's highlighted, "Large private sector banks in India have high CET1 capital adequacy and leverage ratios because their internal capital generation has outpaced their RWA growth in the past couple of years, and they can raise equity easily from capital markets when needed."CET1, or Common Equity Tier 1 capital, refers to a bank's core capital, primarily common shares and retained earnings, which serves as the first line of financial protection against losses. A higher CET1 ratio indicates a stronger ability to absorb shocks without affecting depositors.The report mentioned that as of the end of 2024, the average reported CET1 capital adequacy ratios of the large banks in Hong Kong, India, Korea in the sample stood at 18.0 per cent, 14.7 per cent, and 14.5 per cent, respectively, all above 13.5 per cent for the four largest banks in the US and 13.8 per cent for the top six banks in Western Europe.According to the survey, these banks can also raise equity easily from the capital markets when required. However, it stated that their government-owned peers remain weaker than private banks in both metrics.The report attributed the higher RWA densities in India, Vietnam and among certain Chinese banks to the use of the standardized approach, a regulatory method that assigns fixed risk weights rather than relying on banks' internal risk assessment models.It added that regulators in India have announced plans allowing banks to transition to the more advanced IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) approach by 2028, a move expected to lower RWA densities if successfully implemented.For India, the sample included State Bank of India ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank , together accounting for approximately 50 per cent of system assets.Overall, the report assessed a total of 35 banks across eight key Asia-Pacific banking systems, representing 75 per cent of total assets of all rated banks in these markets.

[TITLE]Frequency Electronics, Inc. Announces Second Quarter and Fiscal Year 2026 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
MITCHEL FIELD, N.Y., Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Frequency Electronics, Inc. (“FEI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ-FEIM) is pleased to announce its financial results for the second quarter and fiscal year 2026.

Revenue for the three and six months ended October 31, 2025, was approximately $17.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively, compared to $15.8 million and $30.9 million, respectively, reported for the same period of fiscal year 2025. Operating income for the three and six months ended October 31, 2025 was $1.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, compared to $2.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, reported for the same period of the previous fiscal year. Net Income from operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2025, was $1.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share and $2.4 million or $0.25 per diluted share, respectively, compared to a net income from operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 of $2.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share and $5.1 million or $0.53 per diluted share, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $0.6 million in the six months of fiscal year 2026, compared to net cash provided by operations of $2.4 million for the same period of fiscal year 2025. Backlog at October 31, 2025 was approximately $82 million compared to $70 million at April 30, 2025.

FEI President and CEO, Tom McClelland commented, “Our second quarter fiscal year 2026 performance was strong by a number of measures, with revenue of $17.1 million, and a record $81.7 million funded backlog. Revenue is up 24%, quarter over quarter, and represents the third highest quarterly revenue in the last decade. As we reported last quarter, Q1 results were impacted by customer induced delays on several programs. As anticipated, those delays are behind us, as evidenced by the Q2 financials. During Q2 we did experience delays in getting under contract on several programs due to the government shutdown; however, we expect any impact from this to be reversed in Q3 and Q4. All of which leads to optimism going forward.

“We anticipate multiple awards in the coming months, some of which are as large or larger than the largest contracts we have ever won. This near term growth is largely in FEI’s core technologies, for which we have deep experience, and thus confidence in our ability to execute with high margins. The evidence suggests that this core business will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, well beyond the next few quarters. On top of this, the Company is pursuing additional growth opportunities in quantum sensing, including magnetometers and other alternative position, navigation and timing (ALT-PNT) solutions, and proliferated satellite applications. These are expected to contribute significantly to expansion of FEI’s markets, and to growth in the 3 to 5 year time frame, and beyond. In other words, we expect continued strength in our core business to build a multi-year bridge to our next generation growth opportunities, and we believe those future growth opportunities will be additive to, not substitutive of, our strong core business.

“The second annual Quantum Sensing Summit, which was originally scheduled for the last week of October, was ultimately postponed due to constraints on government participation during the shutdown. However, it has been re-scheduled for January 14 – 15, 2026, at the same location in New York City. This scientific conference will convene leaders from government, academia, industry, and other laboratories to explore emerging technologies, discuss strategies for realizing their full potential, and reinforce our nation’s leadership in this critical field as well as FEI’s expanding strategic role in advancing this technology. We are excited

[TITLE]Freight Technologies Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
HOUSTON, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Freight Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: FRGT; “Fr8Tech” or the “Company”), a logistics management innovation company offering a diverse portfolio of technology-driven solutions, announced its third-quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2025, on December 9, 2025.

“In the third quarter of 2025, we continued to advance our transition toward a software- and AI-driven logistics model. Our AI Lab developed the autonomous voice-agent capabilities that now enhance the recently launched Zayren platform, strengthening our ability to deliver greater automation, accuracy, and real-time intelligence across our solutions. We also continued expanding the adoption and functionality of Fleet Rocket as more customers integrate the platform into their operations. At the same time, we supported a broad base of enterprise-level clients through our forwarding and brokerage services, where our technology is increasingly automating workflows and improving service levels. Despite elevated tariffs and cross-border uncertainty, we improved operating performance through focused execution and ongoing product innovation. As we move into the next quarter, we remain committed to scaling Zayren, advancing Fleet Rocket, and expanding our AI-powered offerings to drive long-term efficiency and value across the logistics ecosystem," noted Javier Selgas, CEO of Fr8Tech.

Business Highlights

Waavely gained significant traction in the maritime brokerage market with existing and new Fr8App customers securing overseas container shipping services through the online marketplace.

Fleet Rocket expanded its TMS capabilities with invoice validation tools, financial workflow integrations, and deeper data connectivity to customer platforms. The Company closed additional enterprise-level subscriptions during the quarter.

The Company established multiple new tracking integrations to improve real-time geolocation data that serves shippers and carriers across North America.

The Company developed fully autonomous voice agents to scale the capabilities of its AI-driven freight rate prediction and carrier-matching platform, Zayren, which the Company launched and announced in a separate release earlier this quarter.

Financial Highlights

Q3 2025 operating loss improved year-over-year by $0.4 million, from ($1.7) million in Q3 2024 to ($1.3) million in Q3 2025, driven by higher-margin brokerage business and lower operating expenses.

YTD operating loss improved year-over-year by $1.2 million from ($5.5) million in YTD 2024 to ($4.3) million in Q2 2025 on higher margin brokerage business and lower operating expenses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company strengthened its equity position, increased cash balances, and lowered interest expense, supported by improved working capital and more efficient capital structure management.

Due to Fr8Tech’s continued shift toward higher-margin software and AI-driven solutions, along with the sustained impact of elevated U.S. tariffs on the U.S.–Mexico cross-border logistics market, the Company is updating its 2025 outlook to reflect current market conditions. For the full year 2025, Fr8Tech now expects revenue of $12 million to $14 million and an operating loss between $5.5 million and $6.5 million.

[TEXT]
SecureTech formalizes U.S. “beachhead” strategy for its AI-driven construction subsidiary, targeting the rapidly growing Accessory Dwelling Unit sector and future lighthouse projects

Roseville, Minnesota, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SecureTech Innovations, Inc. (OTC: SCTH), a pioneering technology company advancing artificial intelligence, industrial 3D printing and manufacturing technologies, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure solutions, is excited to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, AI UltraProd, Inc. (“AI UltraProd”), intends to enter the U.S. market with an initial focus on the high growth ADU sector.

A strategic review by SecureTech’s executive and consultancy team identified ADUs as the most efficient and scalable U.S. “beachhead” for AI UltraProd’s AI-driven 3D printing platform. The ADU market is projected to grow from approximately $19.6 billion in 2025 to more than $43 billion by 2034, while the U.S. reportedly continues to face a 3–4 million-unit housing shortage.

SecureTech, which recently completed its full acquisition of AI UltraProd Group, believes the subsidiary’s integrated ecosystem—proprietary materials (Geo Mix, Geo Add), multi-robot matrix (GR1, RF1, RC1, RT1), and AI-driven generative design—positions it to address these needs. AI UltraProd’s systems can print vertical wall structures for a 2,000 sq. ft. home in days, with significant reductions in labor and material waste.

“The Board and executive team at SecureTech see ADUs as the fastest and most disciplined way to validate AI UltraProd’s technology in the U.S.,” said J. Scott Sitra, President and CEO of SecureTech Innovations, Inc. “Smaller, high velocity ADU projects allow AI UltraProd to demonstrate performance, generate early revenue, and establish references for broader expansion.”

AI UltraProd generated over $3.7 million during the three months ended September 30 and is positively contributing to SecureTech’s consolidated financials (as reported in the Third Quarter 2025 results). With full integration complete, the subsidiary is projected to approach eight-figure revenue by year end 2025, with additional growth expected in 2026.

“Our team views the U.S. ADU market as a practical proving ground,” added Xing YunZhu, Director of AI UltraProd. “The ADU focus is the first step in a roadmap extending to medical facilities, disaster relief housing, smart infrastructure, and next-generation industrial and off-planet construction.”

SecureTech and AI UltraProd are advancing plans for a U.S. “Lighthouse Project” - a compact, high-impact deployment showcasing the AI-integrated construction platform in a live American environment. Further details on the initiative, deployment locations, and strategic partnerships will follow.

Austin has signed off on an incentive package worth up to $5.5 million to support a major expansion by Southwest Airlines, the latest move cementing the carrier’s growing presence in one of its fastest-rising markets.

The City Council on Thursday unanimously authorized negotiation and execution of the agreement, which is expected to help Southwest add as many as 2,000 jobs in Austin over the next five years. City officials would not say what types of positions the Dallas-based carrier plans to bring, but city documents show the roles would carry an average salary of $180,000.

Stacy Schmitt, senior vice president of communications for Opportunity Austin, a local nonprofit economic development organization, said the city and Southwest continue to develop the airline’s plans locally but that preliminary conversations include building a state-of-the-art training facility for pilots and flight attendants and establishing a more substantial crew base, which could help the carrier develop more nonstop routes to and from the city.

“It is absolutely a great thing because it is a great community partnership with Southwest Airlines,” said Schmitt, whose group is helping coordinate the effort. “There is this real local piece as far as job creation and financial investment. From a regional aspect, it is a great thing for our airport, which serves the entire region.”

Mayor Kirk Watson, Gov. Greg Abbott and Southwest CEO Bob Jordan are scheduled to unveil more details Friday morning at an airport news conference.

Under the approved incentive framework, Southwest will receive $2,750 per Austin-based hire, provided those employees live within city limits and the airline meets job-creation and performance requirements. Southwest will also be required to return 10% of its award to the city’s Childcare Assistance Reserve Fund.

In all, the expansion is projected to generate $19.8 million in new local tax revenue — $11.85 million of that going directly to the city — while creating another 5,100 indirect new jobs in construction, hospitality, food service and other sectors.

“This agreement would bring thousands of good-paying union jobs that will help pay the bills and support our families,” said Council Member Vanessa Fuentes, whose district includes the airport. “We know that when people have stable work, our whole community benefits from local businesses to neighborhood stability.”

Southwest officials have previously said the airline hopes to grow its footprint in Austin as the airport expands, with a second concourse slated to open in the early 2030s. The airline is already the dominant carrier at Austin-Bergstrom carrying more than 40% of the airport’s traffic. In October, Southwest carried a record 872,000 passengers at Austin-Bergstrom, a 13% increase from a year earlier.

“Southwest appreciates the leadership of Mayor Kirk Watson and the Austin City Council and we look forward to working with them as we make Austin and Central Texas an even bigger part of Southwest’s future,” Southwest said in a statement ahead of the vote.

Southwest has recently added training facilities in other cities where it is looking to expand operations.

In April, the carrier opened a 23,000-square-foot facility near Denver International Airport that it said was needed to support projected growth in the region. The facility mainly focuses on training for ground operations personnel, including customer service, ramp, operations agents and cargo workers.

When the Denver center opened, Southwest’s director of training said pilots would continue to receive initial and recurrent training at the airline’s corporate campus in Dallas. Flight attendants also receive four weeks of initial training in Dallas.

[TITLE]AI defense booms in UK and Germany as new wave of billion-dollar startups emerge:
[TEXT]
The U.K. and Germany are emerging as key hubs for a new wave of AI defense startups, as Europe scrambles to rearm amid rising geopolitical tensions. Private funding for defense startups across the region has ramped up in recent years, with investors looking to tap into increasing government military budgets, driven by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and pressure from the Trump administration. But it's ecosystems in the U.K. and Germany that are seeing the most activity. The majority of the biggest rounds across the sector have been for startups based in those two countries, with both emerging as key launchpads into new markets and battlefield training. David Ordonez, senior associate at NATO Innovation Fund, told CNBC that this was "thanks to the scientific expertise of their talent base, national commitments to treat this sector as an economic engine for growth and a manufacturing base that enables the rapid scaling of breakthrough innovation."

'Visible pathways to procurement'

Venture capital for European defense startups has spiked as members of the NATO military alliance have agreed to increase security spending to 5% of gross domestic product, and defense departments in London and Berlin have increasingly signaled a willingness to adopt new technology built by younger players in the market. Investors, buoyed by the promise of commercial deals, have funneled a record $4.3 billion into the sector since the start of 2022, according to Dealroom — nearly four times the funds deployed in the previous four years.

Germany's AI drone makers Helsing and Quantum Systems hit valuations of 12 and 3 billion euros this year, respectively, after rounds worth hundreds of millions of euros. In the U.K., manufacturing platform PhysicsX, which works with defense companies, raised $155 million this year, and missile interception startup Cambridge Aerospace reportedly picked up a $100 million round in August. The U.K. government's Strategic Defence Review in June proposed boosting spending on novel tech and streamlining procurement processes, as well as unveiling a £5 billion tech investment package. "We see a system increasingly open to non-traditional primes, supported by wider investment in skills and technology," Karl Brew, head of defense at Portuguese-U.K. drone startup Tekever, told CNBC. Tekever, which became a unicorn this year, announced a major contract to supply uncrewed aerial systems to the Royal Air Force in May. Helsing has several contracts with the U.K. government, and U.S.-based Anduril signed a £30 million contract for its attack drones in March.

Germany announced its defense spending would rise to upwards of 100 billion euros — a record figure since the German reunification — from 2026, and also changed procurement processes to make it easier for startups to participate. While most European governments have ramped up defense spending, Germany stands out as having "visible pathways from prototype to major procurement [for startups] that many other European markets still do not provide," Meghan Welch, managing director at financial advisory firm BGL, told CNBC. Helsing and attack drone startup Stark are both in line to win a contract for kamikaze drones, the Financial Times reported in October. Helsing and Stark declined to comment to CNBC
