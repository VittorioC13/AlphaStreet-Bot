[TITLE]UK and US agree zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
The UK has secured a 0 per cent tariff rate for all UK medicines exported to the US for at least three years, officials have said, in return for the UK spending more on new medicines.

Under the deal, the US agreed to exempt UK-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes, the officials said on Monday.

The Trump administration said in return UK drugs firms committed to invest more in the US and create more jobs.

The UK government said the 0 per cent rate on all of its pharmaceuticals exports was the lowest offered to any country. As part of the deal, it said the country's National Health Service will spend around 25 per cent more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades.

Officials said that means UK health authorities will now be able to approve medicines that deliver significant health improvements but might have previously been declined purely on cost-effectiveness grounds, including breakthrough cancer treatments or therapies for rare diseases.

"This vital deal will ensure UK patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives," said Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall.

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the deal was "an important step towards ensuring patients can access innovative medicines needed to improve wider NHS health outcomes".

"It should also put the UK in a stronger position to attract and retain global life science investment and advanced medicinal research," said ABPI chief executive Richard Torbett.

US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement "strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to US-UK pharmaceutical trade".

AstraZeneca is among pharmaceutical giants that have cancelled or paused their investments in the UK in recent months. US ambassador Warren Stephens recently warned said American businesses will cut future investments if "there are not changes made and fast".

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed on a framework for a trade pact that would slash US import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for US products, including beef and ethanol. (AP) DIV DIV

LONDON -- The U.K. has sealed a deal securing a 0% tariff rate for all U.K. medicines exported to the U.S. for at least 3 years, officials said Monday, in return for the U.K. spending more on new medicines.

[TITLE]XOMA Royalty Announces Closing of Transaction to Acquire Mural Oncology plc:
[TEXT]
EMERYVILLE, Calif., Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XOMA Royalty Corporation (“XOMA Royalty”) (Nasdaq: XOMA), the biotech royalty aggregator, today announced it has successfully completed its previously announced acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Mural Oncology plc (“Mural”) (Nasdaq: MURA) (the “Acquisition”) pursuant to an Irish High Court sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland (the “Scheme”). Mural shareholders received $2.035 in cash per share (the “Consideration”).

The Acquisition was approved by Mural shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders convened pursuant to section 450(1) of the Irish Companies Act 2014 and an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on October 24, 2025.

The Irish High Court sanctioned the Scheme on December 3, 2025. On December 5, 2025, the Scheme and the Acquisition became effective upon delivery of the court order to the Irish Companies Registration Office.

Prior to the opening of trading on December 5, 2025, all of Mural’s shares will cease trading on Nasdaq, and Mural intends promptly to cause such shares to be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Advisors

XOMA Royalty was represented by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Mason Hayes & Curran LLP, who acted as U.S. and Irish legal advisors, respectively. Davy Corporate Finance UC acted as financial advisor to XOMA Royalty. Lucid Capital Markets, LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Mural, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP and Arthur Cox LLP served as U.S. and Irish legal advisor, respectively, to Mural.

[TITLE]The Global Protein Expression Market: Analysis of Trends and Business Strategies 2025-2030:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Protein Expression Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Protein Expression Market will grow from USD 3.90 Billion in 2024 to USD 6.83 Billion by 2030 at a 9.80% CAGR. The market's growth is primarily fueled by the increasing global demand for recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications, including the development of advanced vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.

Key Market Drivers

The global protein expression market is significantly influenced by the increasing demand for biologics and protein therapeutics, which directly drives the need for sophisticated protein production capabilities. Biologics, encompassing monoclonal antibodies, advanced vaccines, and gene therapies, offer highly specific and effective treatment options for a broad spectrum of complex diseases.

The consistent expansion in the development and manufacturing of these therapeutics mandates efficient and scalable protein expression systems. According to DCAT Value Chain Insights, in 2024, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research approved 16 biological therapeutics, representing 32% of new drug approvals, highlighting the sustained output from this critical sector.

Key Market Challenges

The substantial costs associated with advanced expression systems and specialized reagents present a significant impediment to the growth of the global protein expression market. The financial outlay required for procuring, maintaining, and operating these sophisticated technologies, along with the recurring expense of highly specific reagents, creates a notable barrier to entry.

This directly constrains smaller research institutions, emerging biotechnology companies, and academic laboratories from fully leveraging protein expression capabilities due to budget limitations, thereby impeding wider adoption across diverse research and industrial settings.

Key Market Trends

Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Expression Optimization significantly influences the global protein expression market by offering enhanced efficiency and predictive capabilities. These advanced computational methods enable researchers to precisely predict optimal protein expression conditions and design more effective protein constructs, accelerating drug candidate identification.

According to a November 2024 report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, AI has the potential to transform drug development, potentially reducing timelines by approximately half. This technological shift facilitates faster cycles and improved success rates in producing complex proteins. For instance, a September 2024 news release from the University of Texas at Austin detailed their team receiving nearly $2.5 million in grant funding for applying AI in protein engineering research for vaccine development.
