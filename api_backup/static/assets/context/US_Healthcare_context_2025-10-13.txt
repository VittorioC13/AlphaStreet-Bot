[TITLE]MIT invests ₹198 crore in Medi Assist Healthcare:
[TEXT]
Medi Assist Healthcare Services Ltd has secured ₹198 crore from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its affiliate 238 Plan Associates LLC through a preferential allotment, the Bengaluru-based health benefits administrator said Thursday.

The company issued 37.01 lakh equity shares at ₹535 per share, with each share having a face value of ₹5. The Board of Directors approved the transaction on August 7, 2025, and shareholders endorsed it in an extraordinary general meeting on September 4, with 99.15 per cent voting in favour.

The investment follows two significant corporate moves by Medi Assist. In July 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary Medi Assist Insurance TPA acquired Paramount Health Services & Insurance TPA Private Ltd from Fairfax. The previous month, the company entered into a technology collaboration with Star Health Insurance, India’s leading private retail health insurer.

CEO Satish V N Gidugu said the capital infusion reinforces the company’s strategy to drive digital health transformation in India. He emphasised that technology enables the firm to make healthcare processes simpler and more transparent, while accelerating AI-driven health benefit solutions.

Medi Assist operates through several subsidiaries, including Medi Assist TPA, Paramount Health Services, and Mayfair We Care. The company serves as an intermediary between insurers, policyholders, healthcare providers, and government health schemes.

[TITLE]See the exclusive pitch deck Sensi.AI used to raise $45 million to boost home healthcare for seniors with AI:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Romi Gubes knew her idea sounded outlandish: a small audio-only device that could sit in a senior's home and detect everything from falls to early signs of cognitive decline.

"It was like science fiction," she told Business Insider. "When we came up with this idea, everyone thought we were crazy."

But what seemed far-fetched in 2019 is now a multimillion-dollar reality. Gubes's startup Sensi.AI just raised $45 million in Series C funding, BI learned exclusively.

Qumra Capital led the round, joined by existing investors including Insight Partners. The raise brings Sensi.AI's total funding to $98 million.

Gubes, a former software engineer, cofounded Sensi.AI following a crisis in her own family. She learned her daughter was being abused at day care, a discovery she made only because another child's parents had placed a recording device in their backpack. The experience led her to a larger, more difficult question: how can we keep the most vulnerable people safe when their primary caregivers aren't around?

She saw a massive opportunity in elder care. By 2050, one in six people will be 60 or older, according to the World Health Organization. And most Americans want to stay in their homes as they age, according to the AARP, a demand that's far outpacing caregiver supply.

Gubes thinks those trends are pushing the healthcare market toward a breaking point.

"If nothing were to happen, our parents and grandparents won't be able to get the proper amount of care that they need," she said.

For years, the elder care industry has relied on systems like emergency buttons or wearable monitors, devices that many older adults don't like wearing out of embarrassment or fear of stigmatization. Newer monitoring systems incorporate in-home cameras, but some older adults balk at the idea of constant surveillance. Detecting early signs of illness and dementia remains largely out of reach for any of these tools.

Sensi.AI's discreet audio pods aim to break from tradition. Its ambient listening devices passively capture sound in the home that's then analyzed using a mix of large language models and Sensi's proprietary acoustic models. The startup's predictive AI technology, primarily sold to home care agencies that help people to "age in place," flags potential issues like confusion, agitation, or changes in daily routine to give caregivers deeper insight into their patients' health and well-being.

While staff in independent living facilities can keep a much closer eye on senior patients, home care agencies, which may only see a patient for a few hours each week, have far less visibility into that patient's daily routines, Gubes said.

"These providers are blind to their point of care," Gubes said. "They're fully dependent on the senior, who is not always capable of speaking to their quality of care, and the caregiver who may not always share everything you want and need to know."

Gubes said the startup now works with tens of thousands of home care agencies. Sensi.AI's emergency alerts are sent to home care agencies in real time, while other patterns the startup detects are rolled up in a care feed that providers can review daily to further tailor their care.

The home healthcare tech market is booming. Sensi.AI is competing with other startups building in-home senior care devices, like Cherish Health, and alongside startups helping home health agencies automate administrative tasks and coordinate care logistics, like Zingage and Axle Health.

Sensi.AI's annual recurring revenue has grown nearly fourfold in the past year, and Gubes says the startup is aiming to accelerate its growth even further, including by investing in its technology. The company wants to create an agentic layer to autonomously handle some tasks on behalf of providers, like automatically calling seniors or their families when Sensi.AI detects an emergency.

Aside from its technology, Gubes said Sensi.AI plans to use the new funding to grow its network of provider and payer partners to reach more patients, including through insurers' home care networks and independent living communities.

"We want to get to every senior from the minute they start their aging journey, as fast as possible," Gubes said.

Here's the 10-slide pitch deck Sensi.AI used to raise $45 million.

[TITLE]Microsoft Bets Big on Healthcare AI as It Looks Beyond OpenAI Partnership:
[TEXT]
Microsoft is making a major push into healthcare AI, aiming to establish itself as a leader in the field and reduce its reliance on partner OpenAI.

The Wall Street Journal reports that in a bid to catch up in the fiercely competitive AI race, Microsoft is turning its attention to the healthcare sector. The tech giant plans to roll out a significant update to its Copilot chatbot, leveraging a new partnership with Harvard Medical School to provide what it claims is more reliable and credible health information to users.

The upcoming version of Copilot will reportedly incorporate information from Harvard Health Publishing, enabling the AI assistant to respond to healthcare queries with greater accuracy and authority. Microsoft will pay Harvard a licensing fee for access to this valuable resource.

Dominic King, vice president of health at Microsoft AI, emphasized the importance of providing users with trustworthy health information tailored to their language and literacy levels. “Part of that is making sure that we’re sourcing that material from the right places,” he said, while declining to discuss the specifics of the Harvard arrangement.

The move comes as Microsoft seeks to establish itself as a major player in the AI chatbot space, currently dominated by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Despite a tentative agreement to extend their partnership, Microsoft remains focused on building up its own technological capabilities and reducing its dependence on OpenAI.

Under the leadership of Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, the company has increased staffing at its internal AI lab and made healthcare a key focus area. In June, Microsoft announced the development of an AI tool it claimed was capable of diagnosing diseases with four times the accuracy of a group of doctors, at a fraction of the cost.

However, the path to AI independence is not without challenges. Microsoft’s Copilot app has been downloaded 95 million times, while ChatGPT has surpassed the billion-download mark, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Currently, Copilot relies heavily on OpenAI’s models to respond to user queries.

To address this gap, Microsoft researchers and engineers, including recent hires from Google’s DeepMind AI lab, are working diligently to advance the company’s proprietary models. In August, Microsoft began publicly testing a homegrown AI model that could potentially power Copilot in the future. The company is also deploying models from OpenAI rival Anthropic in its 365 products.

Breitbart News previously reported on increasing tensions between Microsoft and OpenAI:

At the heart of the dispute is OpenAI’s desire to loosen Microsoft’s grip on its AI products and computing resources. The startup is seeking Microsoft’s approval for its conversion into a for-profit company, a move that would allow OpenAI to raise additional funds and potentially go public. Microsoft’s blessing is crucial for this transition, but negotiations have proven difficult. According to people familiar with the matter, OpenAI executives have even discussed the possibility of accusing Microsoft of anticompetitive behavior during their partnership. This “nuclear option” could involve seeking federal regulatory review of the contract terms for potential antitrust law violations and launching a public campaign against the tech giant. Such a move would undoubtedly destroy the partnership.

[TITLE]Quoin Pharmaceuticals Announces Private Placement Financing of Up to $104.5 Million:
[TEXT]
ASHBURN, Va., Oct. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNRX) (the “Company” or “Quoin”), a late clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on rare and orphan diseases, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with new healthcare focused institutional investors with the potential to raise up to $104.5 million in gross proceeds, including initial upfront funding of $16.5 million and up to an additional $88.0 million upon the potential cash exercise of accompanying warrants at the election of the investors. The private placement was priced at a premium to the Company’s prior day’s closing stock price.

The financing includes participation from new healthcare-focused investors, including AIGH Capital Management, Soleus Capital, Nantahala Capital, Diadema Partners, Stonepine Capital Management, ADAR1 Capital Management, and Velan Capital, among others.

Maxim Group LLC is acting as sole placement agent for the private placement.

Pursuant to terms of the securities purchase agreement, Quoin will issue an aggregate of 1,993,940 American Depository Shares (“ADSs”) (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,975,760 ADSs, at a combined purchase price of $8.25 per ADS and accompanying warrants, in accordance with the "Minimum Price" requirement as defined in the Nasdaq rules. The accompanying warrants will consist of four tranches:

Series H warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $9.075 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $18.1 million. The Series H warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the Company has received Type C meeting minutes from the FDA indicating openness to baseline-controlled pivotal studies for QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

Series I warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $10.3125 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $20.6 million. The Series I warrants are immediately exercisable and expire as follows: 50% of the Series I warrants will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the primary endpoint has been met in the monotherapy pivotal trial of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance; and the remaining 50% of Series I warrants will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the primary endpoint has been met in the adjuvant pivotal trial of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

Series J warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $12.375 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $24.7 million. The Series J warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the public announcement of the receipt of either accelerated or traditional approval by the FDA of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

Series K warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $12.375 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $24.7 million. The Series K warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the public announcement of the Company’s sale of a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

In lieu of ADSs, certain investors are purchasing pre-funded warrants at a combined purchase price of $8.2499 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrants, which equals the purchase price per ADS and accompanying warrants less $0.0001, which is in turn equal to the exercise price of each pre-funded warrant.
