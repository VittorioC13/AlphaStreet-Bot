Auto giant Stellantis invests $13B in U.S. manufacturing expansion

Stellantis (parent company of Jeep, Dodge and Fiat) announced a $13 billion U.S. manufacturing expansion, creating 5,000 jobs across Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana by 2029.

The move aims to offset $1.7 billion in tariffs on vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico, highlighting geopolitical trade war pressures.

Despite promises of new jobs, Stellantis is shifting production (including a midsize truck) from Illinois to Ohio, continuing a trend of layoffs and automation under the guise of EV progress.

While CEO Antonio Filosa claims the investment will "strengthen our manufacturing footprint," critics see it as profit-driven restructuring, following decades of outsourcing and automation that harm American workers.

The push for EVs ignores affordability issues, reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains and safety risks (like immobility when batteries die). Meanwhile, automakers take taxpayer subsidies while slashing jobs – raising concerns

[TITLE]Hacksaw Gaming: 100% Growth, 19x Earnings, and the Strong Capital Discipline:
[TEXT]
Hacksaw isn't a casino. It doesn't take bets, manage player accounts, or handle the regulatory burden of running a gaming site. Instead, it builds the digital content that powers casinos and gets paid every time a player spins one of its games. Here's the model in plain English: casinos integrate Hacksaw's games into their platforms. Players play. The casino keeps most of the gross gaming revenue (GGR), but a slice typically a negotiated revenue share goes to Hacksaw. This is a pure B2B model: no direct marketing to end users, no customer service costs, no player acquisition spend. Operators handle all that. Hacksaw just makes the content and collects a toll on every spin.

In an industry full of also-ran studios and hit-or-miss titles, Hacksaw has broken through with globally popular games like Wanted Dead or a Wild and Chaos Crew. These aren't one-off flukes they're part of a portfolio that keeps players engaged and operators hooked. The result? Revenue has more than doubled each of the last two years, hitting 137 million in 2024, with superb profitability margin. The market tends to slap high multiples on high-growth, high-margin companies. But here's the surprise: at the IPO price, the valuation was closer to fair than frothy. That's where I start to get interested.

The story is straightforward. Founded in 2018 in Malta, Hacksaw has built a proprietary remote gaming server (RGS) platform that delivers digital games to operators worldwide. Once a game is developed and Hacksaw now launches more than 60 a year it can be pushed to every integrated operator at essentially zero marginal cost. In 2024, EBITDA was 116.2 million (~85% margin) and net profit 92.3 million (~67% margin). That level of profitability is unusually high compared to peers like Evolution, and should be treated as the upper end of what's sustainable rather than a permanent state.

Hacksaw Gaming AB ( OSTO:HACK ) has recently listed publicly in Sweden, and on paper it's an iGaming content supplier a company that builds and distributes online slot games, scratch cards, and instant-win titles. But when I strip away the surface-level industry label, what I see is a business with three things I care deeply about: extreme profitability, low capital requirements, and a management team willing to give most of the cash back to owners.

When I evaluate a company, I'm not thinking

India’s capital goods sector is witnessing a phase of steady normalization, led by an improving demand environment, stable pricing post-regulatory transition, and expanding aftermarket opportunities.The genset segment , a key contributor within the sector, has emerged as a bellwether of this trend, reflecting the broader recovery in industrial and infrastructure-linked activity.Industry channel checks indicate that genset volumes grew by nearly ten to twenty percent year-on-year during the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, supported by increased offtake from data centers, manufacturing units, airports, hospitals, and educational institutions.Demand from commercial real estate and quick commerce remains healthy, while the construction and rental segments continue to show softness. Overall, the demand trajectory remains structurally stable even as sequential momentum moderates due to seasonality.Pricing across the industry has largely stabilized after the implementation of CPCB 4+ emission norms in mid-2024. Following a period of competitive discounting, most original equipment manufacturers have aligned their pricing strategies.A modest price hike of three to five percent is expected in the next few quarters as input costs, particularly copper, inch upward. Meanwhile, pig iron prices remain benign, providing a cushion for margins.The medium- and high-horsepower genset categories continue to drive incremental growth, aided by expanding data center capacity and ongoing government projects.Industry participants are also focusing on strengthening their distribution networks and aftermarket reach, particularly for the new generation of CPCB 4+ compliant gensets.The integration of telematics is expected to further boost service-led revenues over the next year. On the external front, engineering exports have shown consistent improvement since mid-2024, mirroring the uptick in global demand. However, near-term volatility persists due to geopolitical factors.Overall, the medium-term outlook for the capital goods sector remains positive, supported by a broad-based recovery in industrial activity infrastructure investment, and stable pricing dynamics.While export performance and high-horsepower demand from data centers will remain key monitorables, the sector appears well-positioned for sustained growth through fiscal year 2026 and beyondCummins is experiencing a broad-based recovery in its power generation segment, driven by strong demand from manufacturing, real estate, healthcare, hospitality, and data centers, pushing volumes back to pre-emission levels.Its leadership in high-kVA products and a well-established product-distribution network are enabling market share gains. Industrial growth is expected to accelerate, supported by new product launches in railways, mining, and construction, leading to an 18% CAGR from FY25 to FY28.The distribution business remains a stable growth engine, boosted by telematics, aftermarket penetration, and pricing power, with a projected 19% CAGR. Export growth benefits from rising global demand, especially for data centers and the Low Horse Power segment across various regions.Additionally, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) offer long-term growth potential. Overall, we forecast revenue, EBITDA, and PAT CAGR of 16%, 16%, and 17%, respectively, over FY25-28. Kirloskar Oil Engines has demonstrated robust performance across its core business verticals. The power generation segment continues to show strong momentum despite the high base impact from pre-buying ahead of emission norm changes.Demand remains healthy across infrastructure, real estate, and data centers, supported by the successful launch of the Sentinel and Optiprime product ranges and a strong nationwide service network.The company is optimistic about growth in its industrial segment, underpinned by strategic defense and nuclear projects for the Indian Navy and NPCIL. Exports have gained momentum, particularly in the MENA region, driven by its OEM partnership model.The B2C water management business continues to generate steady cash flows and maintains double-digit margins. With a diversified portfolio and efficient operations, we expect revenue, EBITDA, and PAT CAGR of 15%, 17%, and 18%, respectively, over FY25-28.(The author is Head – Research, Wealth Management : Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

[TITLE]No end in sight for government shutdown as key dates approach:
[TEXT]

Oct. 18 (UPI) -- Senate Democrats and Republicans are not budging on their demands to temporarily fund the federal government and end the shutdown as key dates approach.

The shutdown is the federal government's third-longest and entered its 18th day on Saturday after the Senate failed to approve a temporary funding measure for the 10th time on Thursday and adjourned for the weekend.

More votes are expected to be held next week, but if the Senate stalemate continues, active federal workers won't receive their full paychecks on Friday for the first time during the current shutdown, according to The Hill.

Those federal workers who are still on the job also received only partial pay on Oct. 10, which affected an estimated 2 million employees and their families.

Federal workers are guaranteed back pay when the shutdown eventually ends and the government is funded, in accordance with a 2019 federal law.

While active federal workers could miss their first full paychecks on Friday, military personnel are slated to be paid a week later on Oct. 31.

President Donald Trump earlier announced his administration has located $8 billion in unused research-and-development allocations from the 2025 fiscal year that ended on Sept 30.

He used that money to pay 1.2 million military personnel on Wednesday, but several congressional lawmakers question the legality of doing so.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., intends to hold a vote to pay military personnel and other "excepted" federal workers.

"We're going to give [senators] a chance to pay the military next week," Thune told media.

Senate staffers also are slated to be paid on Monday and House staffers on Oct. 31, but the funds are not available.

Another pressing issue is the Affordable Care Act's annual open enrollment period starting on Nov. 1.

A House-approved continuing resolution that would fund the federal government through Nov. 21 does not include an extension of ACA tax credits, which expire at the end of the year.

The 18-day shutdown will last at least into Monday and only has been surpassed by a 21-day shutdown from Dec. 16, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, and a 35-day shutdown that started on Dec. 22, 2018, and lasted until Jan. 25, 2019.

Senate Democrats mostly have refused to approve the continuing resolution and instead offered an alternative funding measure that would fund the federal government through Oct. 31 and would include an extension of the ACA tax credits and Medicaid eligibility.

Senate Republicans mostly prefer to negotiate such things in the 2026 fiscal year budget, though.

Another pressing date is Nov. 21, which is the Friday after Thanksgiving and one of the busiest travel weekends in the United States.

If the shutdown extends into the Thanksgiving weekend, a shortage of air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration workers would greatly affect air travel.

The president has cited the shutdown when laying off federal workers, but U.S. District of Northern California Judge Susan Illston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from continuing to lay off federal workers who are represented by two public sector unions.

On Friday, Illston said she might expand the injunction to include members of three more labor unions, Roll Call reported.

Former President Bill Clinton appointed Illston to the federal bench in 1995.

[TITLE]Trump Stops Biden’s Euro-Style Solution to Flight Delays and Paves Way to Lower Fares:
[TEXT]
The Biden administration spent four years placing a record level of new regulatory impediments on the nation’s airlines. An analysis by the Office of Management and Budget estimates that former President Joe Biden’s transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, nearly tripled the number of transportation-related rules and regulations.

There’s no evidence that all this added red tape made airline travel safer or reduced flight delays.

Biden should have learned from the airline deregulations of the late 1970s, which liberated airlines from government controls on pricing and flight routes. A famous study by Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution found that those reforms ushered in the modern era of air travel with much lower prices and hundreds of billions of dollars of savings for consumers over the past four decades.

Buttigieg, by contrast, blundered on nearly every major issue he faced. He bungled the proposed JetBlue merger with Spirit Airlines, a disastrous decision that landed Spirit Airlines in bankruptcy and left JetBlue struggling. This has led to less competition, not more.

Buttigieg also tried to restrict popular award miles programs that save money on airfares and reward passengers with flight upgrades. He’s imposed new penalties on airlines for flight delays—even when it wasn’t the fault of the airline.

The Biden-Buttigieg philosophy was that airlines were ripping off passengers and gobbling up profits. The truth is the opposite: Airline fares have remained reasonably low compared to the rapid inflation in food, energy, and housing costs.

The average inflation-adjusted airfare is down nearly 20% from pre-pandemic 2019—when airfares were already the lowest on record. In fact, airfares are one of the only major categories of consumer spending that has fallen on an inflation-adjusted basis. That’s not the sign of an industry price-gouging consumers.

Here’s a financial reality about this industry that few of the politicians and regulators seem to understand: Airlines have huge fixed costs and operate on small margins—which, even in the best years for airlines, lag the average profit margin in other industries.

If United, American and Delta relied solely on ticket revenues, the airlines would either go bankrupt, restrict flights, or have to start charging much higher fares.

Thankfully, the Trump administration under Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is charting a different course. The Department of Transportation has announced it will not implement the Biden-era proposal requiring airlines to pay European-style compensation for delays and cancellations and is canceling attempts to restrict airline credit card reward points.

One unresolved issue is what to do about flight delays and cancellations.

As a frequent flyer myself, I hate flight delays—which are more common than ever. What should be done? Reasonable compensation to passengers—except in cases where the flight delays are beyond the airline’s control—should be standard policy. Some airlines offer better compensation than others.

Rather than impose government mandates, let the market work. Airlines should announce what their delay policy is. All but one of the U.S. airlines already provide complimentary hotel accommodations when flights are delayed overnight. Modest Federal Aviation Administration fines or payments to customers should be required for long flight delays or cancellations when the airline itself is to blame.

The 1970s deregulation of the skies was a success that virtually all economists and passenger groups applaud. President Donald Trump’s transportation agenda under Duffy is: Airline Deregulation, The Sequel. The results will be better service and lower costs for tens of millions of American passengers and a more profitable and stable future for our vital airline industry.

LAUPHEIM, Germany, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With a time capsule ceremony and panel discussion on October 10th, Rentschler Biopharma SE celebrated the progress at its new buffer media station, which is currently under construction at the company’s headquarters in Laupheim. This project represents the largest single investment in the company’s history at the German site and marks an important contribution to strengthening the competitiveness of both Rentschler Biopharma and the biotechnology sector in Germany and Europe.

The highlight of the event was the symbolic placement of a time capsule at the new facility. It symbolizes Rentschler Biopharma’s commitment to scientific and technological progress and honors the contributions of employees and partners who made this milestone possible. The time capsule bears the message “Together We Build” – a symbol of shared responsibility for the future of healthcare.

“Together We Build”: Celebrating construction progress with a time capsule ceremony and panel discussion

On October 10, 2025, Rentschler Biopharma celebrated the construction progress at the new buffer media station at its Laupheim headquarters with employees and guests, including politicians, business partners, and the press. A time capsule was placed in the new facility: Serving as a bridge between the present and a future full of potential, the robust steel box contained a sample of current buffer and media solutions, a rendering of the new building, messages from the site leadership in Laupheim and Milford (USA), and the company’s core values – a testament of its corporate culture. This tribute to the present was thus linked with a clear commitment to shaping the future.

Christiane Bardroff, Chief Operating Officer of Rentschler Biopharma, explained: “As a CDMO, it is our responsibility to support our global clients in transforming innovative ideas into life-saving biopharmaceuticals and enabling rapid market access for new therapies. With the new buffer media facility, we will be even better positioned to fulfill this responsibility: enhanced automation and digitalization will make our processes more efficient and secure, while providing employees with a state-of-the-art working environment. With additional capacity for buffer and media solutions, we are laying the foundation to respond flexibly to our clients’ growing needs while ensuring patients have reliable access to therapies.”

Dr. Michael Zyder, Managing Director of NXTGN, added: “Innovation requires reliability. Especially at a time when the future of Germany as a biotech hub is widely debated, the collaboration between Rentschler Biopharma and the NXTGN Startup Factory demonstrates what truly matters: a partnership of equals that connects novel ideas from research and start-ups with industrial implementation – strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and strategic sovereignty.”
