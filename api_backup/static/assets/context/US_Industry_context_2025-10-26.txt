[TITLE]Beyond core business: Conglomerates see new growth engine in property boom:
[TEXT]
Mumbai: A surge in the prices of residential and commercial properties in recent years, after the covid pandemic, has made the sector an attractive opportunity for Indian conglomerates, which are rapidly expanding their real estate development businesses.

Construction is not a core business for most conglomerates, and they are typically not as aggressive in this sector as pure-play real estate companies, according to experts. However, these business houses are now rapidly developing their land holdings to cash in on the boom in prices. Many are also venturing into buying land or tying up redevelopment agreements to scale up their real estate businesses.

Among those rapidly scaling their real estate businesses are the Raymond Group, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), the Kirloskar Group, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the Wadia Group, and the Aditya Birla Group, experts tracking the sector said.

Take the Kirloskar Group, for instance. Known for manufacturing engineering equipment such as pumps and diesel engines, the group established a real estate company called Avante Spaces in 2020 to build its corporate headquarters in Pune.

Now, the group plans to scale the company by building commercial real estate and leasing it out as office spaces. Avante Spaces will focus on developing the Kirloskar Group’s vacant land, including

[TITLE]Hyundai supports renewed US-South Korea trade talks:
[TEXT]
HMG’s exports to the US are down 7% in 2025

Hyundai Motor Group’s (HMG) executive chairman, Chung Euisun, recently visited the US to join the leaders of several other major South Korean chaebols and support the South Korean government’s renewed efforts to negotiate better access to the world’s largest economy.

A similar mission in August failed to change the US Trump administration’s decision to impose a 25% import duty on South Korean imports, while duties on imports from Japan and the EU were recently set at 15%, and at 10% for the UK. This has created a significant disadvantage for South Korean companies operating in the US market.

HMG’s Hyundai Motor and Kia Corporation, and GM Korea, are estimated to have exported a combined 1.6 million vehicles to the US last year, worth around US$ 38 billion. Hyundai and Kia together sold around 1.7 million vehicles in the US in 2024, with shipments from South Korea amounting to 1.145 million units, while GM Korea’s US exports are understood to have amounted to a further 425,000 units.

Despite the toughening trade conditions, Hyundai Motor Group’s sales in the US increased by over 10% to 1.37 million vehicles in the first nine months of 2025. Imports from South Korea dropped by almost 7% to 736,000 units in this period, as the group stepped up local sourcing. The company’s new 300,000 unit/year vehicle assembly plant in Savannah, in the US state of Georgia, became operational around this time last year, with production yet to be fully ramped up.

Key sticking points in the South Korea-US bilateral trade negotiations include US access to some key South Korean markets and South Korea’s failure to convince the US that it will follow through on its stated commitment to investing US$ 350 billion in US manufacturing. At the last count, around US$ 150-200 billion had been committed to actual investment projects.

[TITLE]CNBC Daily Open: Trump's handprints on the U.S. economy:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement regarding his administration's policies against cartels and human trafficking, from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.

China on Thursday concluded its "Fourth Plenum," a meeting aimed at setting out the country's development agenda for the next five years. Beijing will focus on domestic consumption, self-reliance in technology as well as the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.

In the U.S. economy and markets — generally considered the exemplar of free-market capitalism — the government's handprints have started becoming visible, if you squint a little.

Trump, who terminated trade negotiations with Canada over an ad, pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, the White House said Thursday. Zhao was convicted in April 2024 for enabling money laundering at Binance.

The Wall Street Journal reported in August that the Trump family's crypto venture has been helped by "a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform quietly administered by Binance."

Even corporate earnings had the mark of the White House.

Intel reported third-quarter revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, helping the stock jump 7.7% in extended trading.

But it's hard to ignore the elephant in the room, that is, the U.S. government's 10% stake in the company, acquired in August. The company's stock has seen a massive surge since that acquisition, with President Donald Trump saying the government has made $30 billion to $40 billion on its stake. The transaction, however, complicates Intel's accounting practices for its income, the company suggested in a

In the U.S. economy and markets — generally considered the exemplar of free-market capitalism — the government's fingerprints have started becoming visible, if you squint a little.

[TITLE]Aldebaran Announces the Formation of Centauri Minerals and Completion of C$5.7 Million Seed Financing:
[TEXT]
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aldebaran Resources Inc. (“Aldebaran” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: ALDE, OTCQX: ADBRF) is pleased to announce the official launch of Centauri Minerals Inc. (“Centauri”), the previously announced new Aldebaran spin-out company formed to initially focus on exploration in Northern Argentina (see Company news release dated September 5, 2025). In addition, Aldebaran and Centauri are pleased to report that a private seed financing round of C$5.7 million has been completed to execute exploration programs and administrative preparations for an initial public offering or go-public transaction in 2026.

Sam Leung, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Centauri, commented: “I am honoured and excited to lead the new Centauri Minerals with the support of the Aldebaran team. The outstanding investor interest for this venture has reinforced our plans to conduct modern exploration programs on this unique portfolio of dormant projects in a mining region of increasing global interest. The completion of this oversubscribed private seed financing round allows us to get to work immediately, commencing exploration programs to evaluate and select new drill targets at Rio Grande and Aguas Calientes, solidifying our management team, and commercial preparations to become a public company in 2026. On behalf of our team, I want to thank the Centauri seed round investors for their trust and participation as co-founders in this new venture, many of whom are longtime investors and colleagues in companies we have advanced together. I am also pleased to welcome Altius Minerals as an investor in Centauri, a renowned investment group with a +25-year record of supporting successful new exploration ventures.”

Centauri Project Highlights

Centauri is initially focusing on copper, gold, and silver exploration in Argentina with a portfolio of six exploration projects spanning over 43,000 hectares located in Salta, Jujuy, and Catamarca provinces.

Rio Grande: The most advanced project with near-surface, open-pitable resources totaling 71 million tonnes of 0.30% Cu, 0.36 g/t Au and 3.2 g/t Ag in the indicated category and 41 million tonnes of 0.23% Cu, 0.28 g/t Au and 2.8 g/t Ag in the inferred category. In addition, well-mineralized porphyry dykes have been intercepted beneath the current resource, with the best intercepts returning 257.2 m of 0.53% Cu and 1.20 g/t Au. Rio Grande is located in Salta Province, approximately 9 km from the Lindero gold-copper mine owned by Fortuna Mining Corp. The project also owns valuable support infrastructure, including an active airfield located between the project and the Lindero mine, which is currently being utilized by the mine. Drilling at the project was last completed in 2012 with a NI 43-101 Technical Report completed by Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (now SLR Consulting Limited) in 2018, under much lower metal price assumptions and years before the nearby Lindero mine began operations in 2020. Several priority drill targets remain untested and more sophisticated modern geophysical and geochemical techniques have yet to be utilized at the project.

Several priority drill targets remain untested and more sophisticated modern geophysical and geochemical techniques have yet to be utilized at the project. Aguas Calientes: The project contains abundant and well-mineralized surface boulders with high concentrations of gold and silver along a 6 km strike length. Aguas Calientes is located in Jujuy Province and is approximately 35 km from the town of San Antonio de los Cobres, a major mining industry service hub in Salta. Limited drilling was completed in 2019, which intersected some mineralization, but more importantly, confirmed epithermal structures that are expected to assist in future targeting and drilling programs. The source of the high-grade boulders has yet to be found, and drill permits are still active.

The source of the high-grade boulders has yet to be found, and drill permits are still active. Earlier stage projects: The remaining portfolio contains four green-field exploration projects with limited historical work completed but with prospectivity for copper, gold and/or silver, including: El Camino (Salta), Oscara (Salta), La Frontera (Catamarca), and Catua (Jujuy). These projects have not been worked or re-evaluated for many years, but the mineral concessions have been held in good standing through Aldebaran and predecessor companies.

Value to Aldebaran Shareholders

Aldebaran intends to distribute its shares of Centauri to Aldebaran shareholders upon a go-public event for Centauri. Aldebaran may elect to distribute the Centauri shares all at once or in stages and may retain a minority interest in Centauri. The formation of Centauri will allow Aldebaran shareholders to maintain their exposure to the Altar copper-gold project in San Juan, Argentina, while also receiving additional value through shares in Centauri.

Formation of Centauri Minerals Inc. and Seed Financing

Centauri is currently a Canadian subsidiary of Aldebaran. Aldebaran and Centauri have executed a definitive transfer agreement, pursuant to which Centauri will acquire all of the shares of Aldebaran Argentina S.A. and Minera El Toro S.A., the subsidiaries owned by Aldebaran that hold the portfolio of Argentina projects. In exchange, Aldebaran will receive 40,000,000 common shares (78.1%) of Centauri, and the balance will be owned by the seed round investors. The transfer is subject to certain conditions and closing is expected to occur in Q4-2025. Pursuant to the non-brokered seed round financing, Centauri has issued 11,380,000 shares at C$0.50 per share to new investors for a total capital raise of C$5,690,000.

Centauri is currently governed by a three-member board of directors, which includes Mr. Mark Wayne (CFO and Director of Aldebaran), Mr. Javier Robeto (Vice President and Argentina Country Manager of Aldebaran), and Sam Leung (CEO of Centauri). An exploration advisory committee has been formed to assist in the development of new exploration programs as well as to ensure project continuity from historical work; the first two members of this committee are Dr. Kevin B. Heather (Chief Geological Officer and Director of Aldebaran) and Mr. John Black (CEO and Director of Aldebaran).

Centauri is in active discussions with candidate additions to the board of directors, exploration advisory committee, and the management team. Announcements are expected as the company progresses towards its go-public goal in 2026.

Next Steps and Priorities

The completion of the seed financing round allows Centauri to immediately activate its exploration and commercial programs in parallel. Key initiatives and priorities include:

Technical Report update – already in discussions with independent consultants to complete update of NI 43-101 Technical Report for the Rio Grande Project in preparation for go-public requirements.

Human Resources – led by Sam Leung, Centauri will build out a management and exploration team with a strong emphasis on in-region technical and cultural experience to advance the exploration portfolio.

Geophysical and geochemical field programs – the Centauri team is actively considering and will select several state-of-the-art geophysical and geochemical technologies that could be advantageously applied to Rio Grande and Aguas Calientes to increase the probability of future drilling success. Members of the Centauri team have extensive experience with these modern tools within Argentina and across the Americas, including a network of reputable service providers.

Administration in Argentina – completion of subsidiary and project portfolio transfers and filings with regulators, as well as renewal of drill permit for the Rio Grande project, expected in 2026.

Go-public plan – Centauri has begun work on its plan to become a public company in 2026, with a focus on commercial and legal requirements as well as investor and social media strategy.

Communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the People's Republic of China

Updated: October 23, 2025 22:24

The 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded its fourth plenary session on Thursday in Beijing with a communique issued.

The following is the full text of the communique:

Communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of

the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

Adopted at the fourth plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of

the Communist Party of China on October 23, 2025

The 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened its fourth plenary session in Beijing from October 20 to 23, 2025.

A total of 168 members and 147 alternate members of the Central Committee attended the session. Members of the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and leading officials from other relevant departments were present at the meeting in a non-voting capacity. Some of our primary-level colleagues and a number of experts and scholars who served as delegates to the 20th National Party Congress also attended the meeting in a non-voting capacity.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee presided over the meeting. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Central Committee, delivered important addresses.

Participants at the session listened to and discussed a report on the work of the Political Bureau, presented on its behalf by Xi Jinping. They also deliberated over and adopted the Recommendations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. Xi Jinping made explanatory remarks on the draft recommendations.

At the session, the Central Committee fully affirmed the work of the Political Bureau since the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee. It was unanimously agreed that the Political Bureau has secured notable progress in the following respects: earnestly implementing the guiding principles from the Party's 20th National Congress and the plenary sessions of the 20th Central Committee; adhering to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability; fully and faithfully applying the new development philosophy on all fronts; implementing the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy in a coordinated way; balancing domestic and international imperatives; ensuring both development and security; further deepening reform comprehensively; delivering tangible results in high-quality development; advancing socialist democracy and rule of law; improving public communication and cultural work; ensuring the people's wellbeing and protecting the environment; safeguarding national security and social stability; launching a study campaign for fully implementing the central Party leadership's eight-point decision on improving work conduct and further strengthening full and rigorous Party self-governance; modernizing national defense and the armed forces; carrying out work related to Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan; pursuing major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics; and promoting sustained economic recovery and growth. As a result of these efforts, China is now on the verge of accomplishing the major objectives and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. It was also noted that we had recently commemorated the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. This occasion has greatly lifted the national spirit, inspired a strong sense of patriotism among our people, and further pooled strength for our country's collective endeavors.

Participants at the session gave a positive assessment of China's major development achievements during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), which has marked a momentous and extraordinary period in our country's development. In the face of a complicated international landscape and the challenging domestic tasks of advancing reform, promoting development, and ensuring stability, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has united the entire Party and Chinese people of all ethnic groups and led them in meeting difficulties head-on and forging ahead with determination. This has allowed us to withstand the severe shocks from a once-in-a-century Covid-19 pandemic, respond effectively to many major risks and challenges, and secure significant new achievements in the cause of the Party and the country. With China reaching new heights in terms of economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, and composite national strength, we have made solid new strides in advancing Chinese modernization and gotten off to a successful start on our new journey toward the Second Centenary Goal.

It was pointed out that socialist modernization can only be realized through a historical process of gradual and ongoing development. It requires the unremitting hard work of one generation after another. The period covered by the 15th Five-Year Plan will be critical in this process as we work to reinforce the foundations and push ahead on all fronts toward basically achieving socialist modernization by 2035. It will thus serve as a key link between the past and the future. In this period, China's development environment will face profound and intricate changes.

At present, China remains in a phase of development where strategic opportunities exist alongside risks and challenges, while uncertainties and unforeseen factors are rising. Our economy is on solid foundations, demonstrating advantages in many areas, strong resilience, and great potential. The conditions and underlying trends supporting long-term growth remain unchanged. More and more, we are seeing the strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics, China's enormous market, its complete industrial system, and its abundant human resources all coming to the fore.

All of us in the Party must acquire a deep understanding of the decisive significance of establishing Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and of establishing the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era; become more conscious of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership; stay confident in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics; and uphold Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and uphold the Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership.

We must maintain strategic resolve and enhance our confidence of success. We must proactively identify, respond to, and steer changes, demonstrate the courage and competence to carry forward our struggle, and dare to brave high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms. We must seize the historical initiative to overcome difficulties, combat risks, and confront challenges, focus on managing our own affairs, and write yet another chapter on the miracles of rapid economic growth and long-term social stability, opening up new horizons for Chinese modernization.

It was stressed that in pursuing economic and social development during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, we must stay committed to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, and fully implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We must thoroughly apply the guiding principles from the Party's 20th National Congress and the plenary sessions of the 20th Central Committee.

To move toward the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through Chinese modernization, we must implement the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy in a coordinated way. Keeping in mind both domestic and international imperatives, we must fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy on all fronts, move faster to create a new pattern of development, and adhere to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability.

We must continue to pursue economic development as our central task, with high-quality development as our main focus, reform and innovation as the fundamental driving force, meeting the people's ever-growing needs for a better life as our fundamental goal, and full and rigorous Party self-governance as the fundamental underpinning for all our efforts. We must promote higher-quality economic growth while achieving an appropriate increase in economic output and make solid headway in promoting well-rounded personal development and common prosperity for all. All of this will allow us to secure decisive progress toward basically achieving socialist modernization.

At the session, the Central Committee established the following guiding principles for economic and social development during the 15th Five-Year Plan period: upholding the Party's overall leadership; putting the people first; pursuing high-quality development; comprehensively deepening reform; promoting interplay between an efficient market and a well-functioning government; and ensuring both development and security.

The Central Committee also set the following major objectives for the 15th Five-Year Plan period: significant achievements in high-quality development; substantial improvements in scientific and technological self-reliance and strength; fresh breakthroughs in further deepening reform comprehensively; notable cultural and ethical progress across society; further improvements in quality of life; major new strides in advancing the Beautiful China Initiative; and further advances in strengthening the national security shield. Building on this, we will work hard for a further five years to see that by the year 2035 China's economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense capabilities, composite national strength, and international influence will all be markedly stronger, that its per capita GDP will be on a par with that of a mid-level developed country, that its people will live better and happier lives, and that socialist modernization will be basically realized.

It was noted that we should build a modernized industrial system and reinforce the foundations of the real economy. To this end, we should keep our focus on the real economy, continue to pursue smart, green, and integrated development, and work faster to boost China's strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace. The share of manufacturing in the national economy should be kept at an appropriate level, and a modernized industrial system should be developed with advanced manufacturing as the backbone. We should upgrade traditional industries, foster emerging industries and industries of the future, promote high-quality, efficient development in the service sector, and develop a modernized infrastructure system.

It was stated that we should achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology and steer the development of new quality productive forces. We must seize the historic opportunity presented by the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation to boost China's strength in education, science and technology, and human resources in a well-coordinated manner. We should enhance the overall performance of China's innovation system, raise our innovation capacity across the board, strive to take a leading position in scientific and technological development, and keep fostering new quality productive forces. We should promote advances in original innovation and breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields, facilitate full integration between technological and industrial innovation, pursue integrated development of education, science and technology, and talent, and advance the Digital China Initiative.

It was noted that we should build a robust domestic market and work faster to foster a new pattern of development. Guided by the strategy of expanding domestic demand, we should work toward improving living standards while increasing consumer spending and coordinate investments in physical assets and human capital. We should see that new demand drives new supply, that new supply helps create fresh demand, and that positive interactions are fostered between consumption and investment and between supply and demand. All this will help enhance the dynamism and reliability of the domestic economy. To this end, we should boost consumption, expand effective investment, and eliminate bottlenecks and obstacles hindering the development of a unified national market.

It was stated that we should move faster to develop a high-standard socialist market economy and boost the momentum for high-quality development. We should uphold and improve China's basic socialist economic systems, better leverage the leading role of economic structural reform, and improve the macroeconomic governance system. This will help ensure steady and sustained progress in high-quality development. We should stimulate the vitality of all market entities, work faster to improve the institutions and mechanisms for market-based allocation of production factors, and make macroeconomic governance more effective.

It was also stated that we should promote high-standard opening up and create new horizons for mutually beneficial cooperation. We should continue to expand opening up at the institutional level, safeguard the multilateral trading system, and promote broader international economic flows. We should advance reform and development through greater openness and seek to share opportunities and achieve common development with the rest of the world. We should take the initiative to open China wider, promote the innovative development of trade, create greater space for two-way investment cooperation, and pursue high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.

It was noted that we should accelerate agricultural and rural modernization and take solid steps to advance all-around rural revitalization. We must continue to place issues related to agriculture, rural areas, and rural residents at the top of our Party's work agenda. We need to promote integrated urban-rural development, continue to consolidate and expand our achievements in poverty alleviation, basically ensure modern living conditions in rural areas, and secure faster progress in building up China's strength in agriculture. We should enhance the overall production capacity, quality, and performance of agriculture, build a beautiful and harmonious countryside for people to live and work in, and ensure that policies aimed at strengthening agriculture, benefiting farmers, and achieving rural prosperity deliver greater outcomes.

It was stated that we should refine China's regional economic layout and promote coordinated regional development. We should give full play to the synergies between the coordinated regional development strategy, major regional strategies, the functional zoning strategy, and the new urbanization strategy, improve the distribution of major productive forces, and ensure that key regions play their role as growth poles. Our goal is to develop a regional economic layout and a territorial space system that enable regions to leverage their complementary strengths in pursuit of high-quality development. We should promote more coordinated regional development, boost interconnected development between regions, improve the development of territorial space, move forward with people-centered new urbanization, and strengthen marine development, utilization, and protection.

It was noted that we should inspire the cultural creativity of our entire nation and foster a thriving socialist culture. We must uphold the guiding role of Marxism in the ideological domain, remain firmly rooted in the broad and rich Chinese culture, and follow the trends of information technology. On this basis, we should develop a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics for the new era that has the power to guide, unite, and inspire our people and enjoys strong international influence. Tangible steps should be taken to build China into a country with a strong culture. We should promote and put into practice the core socialist values, make effective moves to boost cultural programs, accelerate the development of cultural industries, and extend the reach and appeal of Chinese civilization.

It was stated that we should work harder to ensure and improve public wellbeing and promote common prosperity for all. In line with the principle of doing everything within our means, we must ensure that public services are inclusive, meet essential needs, and provide a cushion for those most in need, while working to resolve the pressing difficulties and problems that concern the people most. The channels of social mobility should remain unimpeded, and living standards should be further improved. We should promote high-quality and full employment, refine the income distribution system, develop education that meets the people's expectations, improve the social security system, and facilitate high-quality development of the real estate sector. We should also work to advance the Healthy China Initiative, promote high-quality population development, and take solid steps to ensure equitable access to basic public services.

It was pointed out that we should accelerate the green transition in all areas of economic and social development in an effort to build a Beautiful China. We must unwaveringly uphold the principle that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets and put it into concrete action. Guided by our goals of achieving peak carbon and carbon neutrality, we should make concerted efforts to cut carbon emissions, reduce pollution, pursue green development, and boost economic growth. We must reinforce our ecological security shields and strengthen our green development drivers. We should press ahead with the critical battle against pollution and the drive to upgrade ecosystems, move faster to develop a new energy system, work actively and prudently toward peak carbon emissions, and accelerate the shift to eco-friendly production practices and lifestyles.

It was noted that we should modernize China's national security system and capacity and advance the Peaceful China Initiative to a higher level. We must remain steadfast in pursuing a holistic approach to national security and follow a socialist path of social governance with Chinese characteristics to ensure that our society is both full of vitality and in good order. We should establish a sound national security system, build up national security capacity in key sectors, enhance public safety governance, and improve the social governance system.

It was also noted that we should work to achieve the centenary goals of the People's Liberation Army on schedule and modernize national defense and the armed forces. We should act on Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the Military and carry out the military strategy for the new era. We must ensure that the Party exercises absolute leadership over the people's armed forces, and the system of ultimate responsibility resting with the chairman of the Central Military Commission must be implemented. We are pursuing the new, three-step strategy for modernizing national defense and the armed forces. On this basis, we should continue to enhance political loyalty in the military, strengthen the military through reform, scientific and technological advances, and personnel training, and run the military in accordance with the law. We should simultaneously carry out operations, boost combat preparedness, and enhance military capabilities, and accelerate integrated military development through mechanization, informatization, and the application of smart technologies. All this will enhance our military's strategic capacity to defend our national sovereignty, security, and development interests. We should speed up the development of advanced combat capabilities, modernize military governance, and consolidate and improve integrated national strategies and strategic capabilities.

It was stressed that the whole Party and all Chinese people should be united in a concerted endeavor to fulfill the 15th Five-Year Plan. We must use the Party's self-reform to steer social reform and stay committed to strengthening full and rigorous Party self-governance. We should see to it that our Party becomes better at providing political leadership and theoretical guidance, organizing the people, and inspiring society, while also improving its ability to lead China's economic and social development endeavors. All this will enable us to gather a mighty force for advancing Chinese modernization. We must uphold and strengthen the Party Central Committee's centralized, unified leadership, advance socialist democracy and rule of law, and fully mobilize the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the whole society to advance Chinese modernization. We should work for long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, promote the peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait and advance the cause of national reunification, and secure further progress in building a community with a shared future for humanity.

It was pointed out that studying and implementing the guiding principles from this plenary session represent a major political task for the entire Party and nation both at present and in the period to come. We must employ a variety of means to organize study activities, instruction lectures, and communication initiatives, so as to make sure that the whole Party and society acquire a thorough understanding of the session's guiding principles. In effectively implementing these principles, we must stay firmly committed to high-quality development, step up efforts to foster a new development pattern, make solid strides toward delivering common prosperity for all, better ensure both development and security, and coordinate our economic development endeavors with work in all other spheres. This will ensure that we lay a solid foundation for basically realizing socialist modernization.

It was stressed that to run the country well, we must first run the Party well; only a Party that is thriving can make our country strong. The more effective our Party is in supervising and governing itself, the better it will be able to provide guarantees for our economic and social development. We must have the resolve and tenacity to persist in the always ongoing endeavor of Party self-governance. In exercising full and rigorous self-governance, we must firmly act on the Party's requirements for self-reform, devote sustained and consistent efforts to improving conduct, and combat corruption resolutely, thereby providing a strong guarantee for fulfilling the major objectives for economic and social development in the 15th Five-Year Plan period.

Participants at the session carried out an analysis of the present situation and the tasks we face. It was highlighted that we must remain firmly focused on accomplishing this year's targets for economic and social development. To this end, we must continue to implement the decisions and plans of the Central Committee through targeted efforts. We must work to stabilize employment, enterprise operations, markets, and expectations and keep the fundamentals of the economy stable, so as to consolidate and strengthen the momentum for economic recovery and growth. We should ensure that our macro policies continue to play an effective role and intensify their implementation as necessary. We should fully implement assistance policies for enterprises, press ahead with special initiatives to boost consumption, guarantee the three priorities including people's basic wellbeing, payment of salaries, and normal government functioning at the primary level, and defuse local government debt risks through active and prudent measures.

It was noted that we should take concrete steps to safeguard the people's wellbeing and unlock potential through multiple channels. We should devote greater efforts to stabilizing and expanding employment, while promoting stable employment for key groups. We should ramp up efforts to address wage arrears, improve basic public services, and work harder to resolve the pressing difficulties and problems that concern the people most. We must do a good job in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. Appropriate arrangements should be made for disaster victims to ensure that their basic living needs are met and that they have warm shelter for the winter.

It was emphasized that we must ensure workplace safety and safeguard stability. We must make sure that all responsibilities concerning workplace safety are fulfilled and that oversight systems are rigorously implemented, and we must work with firm resolve to prevent and mitigate major and serious accidents. We should strengthen whole-of-chain supervision and administration of food and drug safety. We should intensify efforts to investigate and resolve disputes and conflicts, take a holistic approach to ensuring law and order, and crack down on illegal and criminal activities of all types in accordance with the law. Furthermore, we should improve public opinion guidance and effectively prevent and defuse risks in the ideological domain.

At the session, Zhang Shengmin was added to the Central Military Commission as Vice Chairman.

It was decided that, in accordance with the Party Constitution, empty seats on the Central Committee will be filled by alternate members Yu Huiwen, Ma Hancheng, Wang Jian, Wang Xi, Wang Yonghong, Wang Tingkai, Wang Xinwei, Wei Tao, Deng Yiwu, Deng Xiuming, and Lu Hong.

At the session, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection's report on the grave violations of Party discipline and state laws involving Tang Renjian, Jin Xiangjun, Li Shisong, Yang Fasen, and Zhu Zhisong was deliberated and adopted. The Central Military Commission's inspection report on the grave violations of Party discipline and state laws involving He Weidong, Miao Hua, He Hongjun, Wang Xiubin, Lin Xiangyang, Qin Shutong, Yuan Huazhi, Wang Chunning, and Zhang Fengzhong was also deliberated and adopted. The Political Bureau's previous decision to expel these people from the Party was confirmed.

At the session, a call was issued to the whole Party, the entire military, and Chinese people of all ethnic groups to rally more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, work hard together toward the goal of basically realizing socialist modernization, and continue to break new ground in building a great country and advancing national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernization.

[TITLE]City-States Without Limits – Part 2:
[TEXT]
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity.

In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.”

The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs.

The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain).

The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin.

By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means.

We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments.

At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring

[TITLE]Rivian agrees to pay massive $250M lawsuit settlement:
[TEXT]
Rivian agrees to pay massive $250M lawsuit settlement

The electric vehicle maker will settle a class-action case stemming from a controversial 2022 price increase on its R1 trucks and SUVs

Electric vehicle maker reaches settlement agreement

Rivian has agreed to pay $250 million to settle a class-action shareholder lawsuit filed after the company abruptly raised prices on its R1 pickup truck and SUV in 2022. The settlement requires approval from a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California before the payment can proceed.

The lawsuit centered on allegations that Rivian included misleading statements and figures in regulatory filings before its 2021 initial public offering. Shareholders claimed the company misrepresented the actual costs required to manufacture its electric vehicles, which ultimately led to the controversial price increase.

Despite agreeing to the substantial payment, Rivian maintains its position that the settlement does not constitute an admission of fault or wrongdoing. The company released a statement denying the allegations while acknowledging the agreement to resolve the legal dispute.

Breaking down the payment structure

Rivian plans to fund the settlement through two sources if the court grants approval. The company will pay $67 million through its directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage, while drawing the remaining $183 million from its cash reserves.

Insurance payment: The $67 million portion will come from liability insurance designed to protect company leadership from personal financial exposure in legal matters. Cash reserves: Rivian will use $183 million from its available funds, which totaled $4.8 billion in cash and equivalents as of June 30.

The timing of this settlement comes during a particularly challenging period for the electric vehicle manufacturer as it prepares for significant changes to its business operations and product lineup.

Company faces pivotal moment

The settlement arrives as Rivian undergoes major transitions in its business strategy and operations. The company is deeply involved in preparations to launch its second-generation electric vehicle, the R2 SUV, scheduled for release in 2026. This new model will carry a significantly lower price point than the existing R1 lineup.

Rivian expects to produce substantially higher volumes of the R2 compared to current models. The company states its Illinois factory can manufacture up to 150,000 R2 vehicles annually. Additionally, construction continues on a new Georgia facility that will produce the R2 and future vehicle models.

Meanwhile, sales of the R1 lineup have struggled to maintain momentum. The company anticipates finishing 2025 having shipped far fewer electric vehicles than it delivered in either 2024 or 2023. Multiple factors have contributed to these declining numbers, including tariff policies and the elimination of federal electric vehicle tax credits.

This week Rivian announced layoffs affecting more than 600 employees as part of a broader restructuring effort. The organizational changes also saw CEO RJ Scaringe assume the role of interim chief marketing officer, taking on additional responsibilities during this turbulent period.

The price hike that sparked outrage

The controversy began when Rivian delivered its first R1 pickup trucks in late 2021. By March 2022, the company announced plans to increase prices on both the truck and SUV by nearly 20 percent. Rivian cited supply chain shortages, inflation pressures and plans to introduce more affordable models as justification for the dramatic price adjustment.

The company initially applied the price increase to both new orders and existing customers who had placed pre-orders and remained on a waitlist. This decision to raise prices on customers who had already committed to purchases sparked immediate backlash from buyers and company supporters.

The intense negative reaction prompted Rivian to quickly reverse course for customers with existing pre-orders. However, the damage had already been done to investor confidence. The announcement caused Rivian’s stock price to plummet, resulting in substantial financial losses for shareholders.

Scaringe acknowledged the mistake in a letter to customers at the time, describing the decision as wrong and admitting it broke customer trust in the company. He characterized it as the most painful error in his more than 12 years leading Rivian.

Legal action follows market fallout

Shareholder Charles Larry Crews filed the lawsuit just days after the price hike announcement and subsequent reversal. The complaint argued that Rivian had misrepresented the true costs of building the R1 vehicles in documentation provided during its initial public offering.

These alleged misrepresentations, according to the lawsuit, directly contributed to the negative stock price impact when the company announced the price increase. The case received class-action status in July 2024, allowing it to proceed on behalf of multiple affected shareholders.

The settlement now awaits final court approval before Rivian can close this chapter of legal and financial challenges.

[TITLE]Fear of ICE Raids Drains Sales for Businesses in Oakland’s Fruitvale:
[TEXT]
After an Immigration and Customs Enforcement workplace raid, rattled undocumented workers may not show up to their jobs in construction, agriculture, hospitality, retail and other industries. The disruptions can raise costs for businesses, which then pass them to consumers. Eventually, Raisz said, most of these immigrants try to go back to work out of financial need, but cut back on spending.

“What they won’t do is go back to establishments. They won’t go eat out at restaurants that maybe they would have previously. They won’t shop locally,” Raisz said, calling it “the cost of fear.”

“That affects the business owners, who often are immigrants themselves, especially when we look at areas that are very concentrated with high shares of immigrants,” she added.

Mass deportations could reduce California’s gross domestic product by $275 billion through labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and reduced household spending, according to a June report by Raisz and other researchers at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute and UC Merced.

California has roughly 2.3 million undocumented immigrants — roughly 8% of its workforce — the most of any state. The Bay Area is home to more than 300,000 undocumented workers, with nearly half concentrated in Alameda and Santa Clara counties, according to estimates by the Migration Policy Institute.

In Los Angeles and Chicago, National Guard troops — sometimes armed with rifles — accompanied ICE agents or provided logistical support. Trump said the troops were needed to protect agents from violent protesters and address “out-of-control crime,” a claim local authorities disputed.

Gilbert Alfonso, who has operated a car transmission repair shop in the Fruitvale for 48 years, said he’s been surprised by how quiet streets have remained amid the looming threat of increased immigration enforcement. Deploying the National Guard, he said, to the neighborhood would only make things worse.

“The businesses around me — the stores, the restaurants — they have no customers. They are just not coming out,” Alfonso, who owns Transmatic Transmission, said. “I’ve been here for that many years and this is the worst I’ve ever seen it.”

He used to handle up to 15 repair jobs a week. Now he’s lucky to get one. Because he owns his building, it blunts the financial hit somewhat, but he feels for other business owners who must come up with the rent money.

“Nobody is driving up or down the streets no more. The foot traffic is hardly anything anymore. My phone doesn’t ring anymore,” he said.

The sales slump and labor disruptions compound the economic uncertainties small businesses face, said Oscar Garcia, senior vice president of the California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce.

“Inflation, cost of doing business, cost of your product or your service, gasoline, rent — all that makes it a bigger challenge,” he said, adding that many businesses also lack access to capital or grants once available during the pandemic. “There are many factors that contribute to slow business.”

[TITLE]Hyundai supports renewed US-South Korea trade talks:
[TEXT]
HMG’s exports to the US are down 7% in 2025

Hyundai Motor Group’s (HMG) executive chairman, Chung Euisun, recently visited the US to join the leaders of several other major South Korean chaebols and support the South Korean government’s renewed efforts to negotiate better access to the world’s largest economy.

A similar mission in August failed to change the US Trump administration’s decision to impose a 25% import duty on South Korean imports, while duties on imports from Japan and the EU were recently set at 15%, and at 10% for the UK. This has created a significant disadvantage for South Korean companies operating in the US market.

HMG’s Hyundai Motor and Kia Corporation, and GM Korea, are estimated to have exported a combined 1.6 million vehicles to the US last year, worth around US$ 38 billion. Hyundai and Kia together sold around 1.7 million vehicles in the US in 2024, with shipments from South Korea amounting to 1.145 million units, while GM Korea’s US exports are understood to have amounted to a further 425,000 units.

Despite the toughening trade conditions, Hyundai Motor Group’s sales in the US increased by over 10% to 1.37 million vehicles in the first nine months of 2025. Imports from South Korea dropped by almost 7% to 736,000 units in this period, as the group stepped up local sourcing. The company’s new 300,000 unit/year vehicle assembly plant in Savannah, in the US state of Georgia, became operational around this time last year, with production yet to be fully ramped up.

Key sticking points in the South Korea-US bilateral trade negotiations include US access to some key South Korean markets and South Korea’s failure to convince the US that it will follow through on its stated commitment to investing US$ 350 billion in US manufacturing. At the last count, around US$ 150-200 billion had been committed to actual investment projects.

[TITLE]Major Investor for Louisiana LNG as Construction Ramps up:
[TEXT]
Australia’s Woodside Energy has enlisted U.S.-based Williams as an investor and pipeline operator of its Louisiana liquefied natural gas plant, to tap its infrastructure experience and ease cost pressures as construction ramps up.

Under the arrangement, Williams will get a 10% stake in Louisiana LNG’s holding company and 80% of the Driftwood pipeline that will supply feed gas to the $17.5 billion project.

Williams, which operates more than 33,000 miles (53,108 km) of pipeline across 24 U.S. states, will pay Woodside $378 million and contribute $1.9 billion towards the project’s construction costs.

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill told Reuters her company had expertise with developing LNG projects, but it needed to partner with an experienced operator of onshore pipelines in the U.S. like Williams.

The Louisiana LNG venture forms part of Woodside’s major expansion strategy into North America, betting on a pro-fossil fuel U.S. administration and growing global demand for gas.

O’Neill said Woodside was “off to the races” with the project and its construction workforce had ramped up ahead of first production expected in 2029.

Woodside is looking to sell a further 10% to 20% in the holding company after the Williams deal to reduce its overall interest in the project to 50%.

“We do want to bring other investors into the project,” O’Neill said. “We’re not going to set a timeline on it. We’ll continue to be patient, but the window is narrowing.”

Williams is the first partner Woodside has added since giving Louisiana LNG the final go-ahead in April.

Before that, it sold a 40% stake in the project’s infrastructure company to U.S. investor Stonepeak for $5.7 billion.

MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said Williams was a “very strong partner” and would help ease balance sheet pressures associated with the huge project.

“It’s going to really raise the profile of the project within the U.S.,” he said. “From an investor perspective, the sell-down is viewed positively.”

But further sell-downs would be needed to affirm the project’s value, he added.

Shares in the Australian company gained as much as 4.1% to A$24.11 on Thursday.

Once Louisiana LNG is complete, Woodside is keen to tap European markets in particular as they cut LNG imports from Russia, O’Neill said.

Louisiana LNG already has a supply deal with Germany’s Uniper and a heads of agreement with Turkey’s BOTAS.

“There’s very strong interest in LNG from our project from those customers in Europe,” she said.

“They’re absolutely going to need LNG from other sources, and the U.S. is going to be one of those key sources.”

Louisiana LNG is expected to have an initial annual production capacity of 16.5 million metric tons of the super-chilled fuel.
