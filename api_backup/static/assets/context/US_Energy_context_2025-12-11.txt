[TITLE]America’s LNG Boom Is About to Spike Your Power Bill:
[TEXT]
The US is the world’s largest exporter of LNG. And efforts are apace to further increase that export capacity. As the US exports LNG at an increasing rate, this implies good news and bad news. The good news is that gas producers and owners of gas liquefaction facilities will likely enjoy higher profitability in the years ahead. The bad news is that US residential and industrial consumers will be paying those higher prices for gas while also experiencing increased price volatility. Why? Because where or how commodity prices are set makes a huge difference. At present, in the US, our natural gas commodity prices are set (mostly) domestically. This means they are influenced mainly by local supply demand imbalances, taxes, regulation (which often decides what gets built), and infrastructure constraints like pipeline availability. Those are all things our industry leaders and local politicians influence, if not control. However, when commodity prices are set internationally, like oil, prices are no longer determined by the domestic concerns above. Instead, they are set by competitive global spot markets. And there’s the problem. The global market is often much bigger than domestic markets, meaning a buyer in Europe or Japan can now outbid its American counterpart for gas. And there’s often a hurricane, tsunami, or military skirmish somewhere in the world that can now temporarily spike prices adding increased volatility to the mix.

There is little disagreement that moving from a domestic to an international commodity gas market results in higher commodity prices and more volatility. More to the point, this is not a new idea. In 2018, Trump’s DoE issued a report on the implications of increased LNG exports and wrote the following: “On the negative side, producing incremental natural gas volumes to support natural gas exports will increase the marginal cost of supplying gas and therefore raise domestic natural gas prices in general.” The study further noted that more exports meant higher gas prices for households and industry. But the DoE authors did helpfully note that if gas consumers became stock investors and purchased shares of gas liquefaction companies, the gains on these securities would help offset some of the sting from higher prices. Yes, they really said this.

Our readers know why this is a potentially huge economic problem. We are in the middle of an electrification induced power plant build cycle, which includes lots of new gas fired power plants. Substantially raising the operating costs of new gas fired power generating units soon to come on line (via higher, globalized gas prices and more commodity gas price volatility) is not, as they say, on most people’s bingo cards. This could imply much higher future electricity costs than many are expecting. In the past, utility commissions have at least insulated utility companies from the adverse financial impact of commodity price spikes via so called fuel adjustment clauses. We think they will continue to do so, not least because it lowers corporate operating risks, which makes bond raters like Moody’s happy. This means all additional gas commodity costs will pass through directly to electricity consumers.

The economic downsides of a transition to a global gas commodity market are fairly simple to state: higher society-wide energy bills, adverse industry-wide impacts via higher level of operating costs, and relatedly, an adverse impact on corporate competitiveness. We’ve already started to see what appears to be some consumer electoral pushback in response to rapidly rising electricity prices. What makes this looming gas affordability problem different to us is that it is entirely self-inflicted. Our federal government has chosen to encourage further LNG exports (raising prices) while a rapid expansion of the domestic gas power generation fleet is also occurring. More profits for gas producers and higher prices for consumers. All we can say is that an issue like this has traditionally become political, increasing public scrutiny of utility finances with an eye toward lowering utility profitability.. As for obvious losers, consider the plight of consumers in deregulated states where the price of gas effectively sets all electricity prices (whether or not the electricity is generated by burning gas). For close to 30 years, deregulation has failed to reduce prices to consumers. Now it looks as if deregulation will raise prices for consumers thanks to a tighter gas market. Well, where there are losers, there are also winners, the obvious ones being all renewable forms of power generation and new nuclear, which will benefit from higher expected power prices.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies in deal for Namibia offshore oil field:
[TEXT]
TotalEnergies will join Portuguese firm Galp to operate Namibia's Mopane oil field, which could contain at least 10 billion barrels, according to estimates - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP Andrew Harnik

TotalEnergies said Tuesday it had reached a deal to become a partner in the Mopane oil field off the coast of Namibia, where exploration remains underway.

The deal with Galp will see TotalEnergies joining the Portuguese firm as an operator as more exploration wells are drilled in view to develop the field for production.

“The transaction positions TotalEnergies as the operator of the two largest oil discoveries in Namibia and opens the way for the development of a major producing hub, generating long-term value for the country and partners,” the French firm said in a statement.

Galp said last year it estimated the Mopane field could contain at least 10 billion barrels of oil.

The deal will see TotalEnergies take a 40 percent stake in the petroleum exploration licence that includes Mopane. Galp will retain a 40 percent stake, alongside the Namibian national oil company Namcor and private firm Custos, which each hold 10 percent stakes.

In exchange, TotalEnergies will finance half of Galp’s capital expenditures for exploration and appraisal of the Mopane field, as well as initial development, with repayment to come from future cash flows from the project.

Galp will also get a 10 percent stake in the nearby Venus exploration zone, where TotalEnergies has discovered oil.

TotalEnergies said it hopes to make a final investment decision on whether to develop production at Venus next year.

TotalEnergies shares were up 0.4 percent in afternoon trading on the Paris stock exchange, where the blue-chip CAC 40 index was down 0.6 percent.

[TITLE]Claim: “lack of long-term revenue certainty” is Crashing Aussie Renewable Investment.:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

Are renewables investors worried the subsidies could cease?

Australia could miss clean energy target as solar and wind investment slumps, investors warn Expert cautions large pipeline of potential projects will not deliver required energy capacity unless companies make final investments Graham Readfearn and Adam Morton

Mon 1 Dec 2025 19.22 AEDT … Clean Energy Regulator data shows the government agency expects 2.5GW of industry-scale renewable energy capacity to reach a final investment decision this year, down from 4GW last year. The 12-month average for investment commitments on new developments is at its lowest since early 2017.

… … chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, Richie Merzian, said the lower financial investment decisions were a “symptom of deep structural issues, not just a blip”. “The structural issues include state planning delays, grid connection uncertainty, transmission constraints, rising project costs and lack of long-term revenue certainty,” he said. Merzian said the underwriting program had helped to develop a large pipeline of potential projects, but that they would not deliver the new energy capacity needed unless companies made final investments. “The contrast between the large pipeline and the limited number reaching [financial investment decision] indicates a system that is not functioning as intended,” he said. … Read more: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/01/australia-could-miss-clean-energy-target-as-solar-and-wind-investment-slumps-investors-warn

[TITLE]Where the Algo Meets the Asphalt:
[TEXT]
Geopolitically, the shift is marked by China's pivot from dominating solar panel manufacturing to cornering the green hydrogen market, and a return to "interventionist industrial strategy" in the West where governments are becoming energy shareholders.

The transition is forcing a move away from simple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) toward complex, flexible contracts and driving Big Tech to invest in on-site generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) to ensure reliability.

The rapid growth of AI is projected to push global data center power demand to 2,200 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, an "always-on" load that threatens to overwhelm the world's aging electrical grids.

There is the economy you see on the screen. And then there is the economy that runs the screen.

For the last few years, the screen has been winning.

We have been living in a "Zero Marginal Cost" fantasy…

We convinced ourselves that adding another million users to ChatGPT was free. That scaling a startup was just a matter of writing better code. That "The Cloud" was an infinite, weightless place where business happened by magic.

But today, S&P Global Energy dropped a bucket of ice water on that fever dream.

I’ve spent the morning reading through their new Horizons Top Trends 2026 forecast. It’s dense. It’s technical. It’s written in the polite, measured language of analysts who don't like to shout. But if you translate the data into plain English, they are shouting.

The bottleneck isn't the code anymore. It’s the copper. It’s the transformers. It’s the sheer, raw wattage required to keep the simulation running. And right now? We don't have enough of it.

Adding Another India to a Grid That Can’t Handle It

Let’s look at the raw numbers, because they are wild.

S&P projects that by 2030, global data center power demand could hit 2,200 terawatt-hours (TWh).

It is easy to glaze over a number like that. We hear stats

[TITLE]Federal judge overturns Trump ban on wind energy projects:
[TEXT]
Federal judge overturns Trump ban on wind energy projects

States challenging the president’s January executive order win a battle in court

President Trump suffered a significant legal defeat on Monday, when a federal judge declared his sweeping ban on new wind energy projects unlawful, delivering a victory to environmental advocates and more than a dozen states that challenged the directive.

US District Judge Patti Saris ruled that the executive order signed by Trump in January was arbitrary, capricious and violated federal law. The decision strikes down a policy that effectively halted all federal approvals for wind farms across the country, both onshore and offshore, while the administration conducted what it called a necessary review of approval processes.

The ruling arrives less than a year after Trump signed the controversial order within hours of beginning his second term in office. That directive immediately froze dozens of clean energy projects in various stages of development, including massive offshore installations planned along the Eastern seaboard that represented billions of dollars in potential investment.

Wind projects caught in political crossfire

The executive order created immediate chaos within the renewable energy sector. Project developers warned that the freeze would eliminate thousands of jobs and force companies to abandon investments already years in the making. Several large offshore wind farms planned from Massachusetts through Maryland found themselves in limbo, unable to proceed with construction despite having secured necessary permits under the previous administration.

Trump justified the ban by claiming the government’s approval process for wind projects contained serious legal deficiencies that required immediate attention. His administration has since indicated in court documents that it may move to revoke permits already granted to several offshore wind developments.

The legal challenge brought by states and clean energy organizations argued that the president lacked authority to unilaterally suspend an entire category of energy projects without following proper administrative procedures. Judge Saris ultimately agreed with that assessment, finding the order exceeded presidential powers.

A broader war on renewable energy

The wind ban represents just one front in Trump’s campaign against renewable power sources. Since returning to office, the president has systematically worked to reverse climate policies established during the Biden administration, which had prioritized transitioning American electrical grids toward cleaner energy sources.

Trump has instead focused on bolstering traditional fuel industries, including coal, natural gas and nuclear power. His administration argues these conventional sources provide more reliable around the clock electricity, particularly important as data centers drive unprecedented growth in power demand nationwide.

The policy whipsaw has created uncertainty throughout the energy sector. Companies that invested heavily in wind and solar projects based on Biden era incentives now face an administration openly hostile to their business model. The dramatic shift has complicated long term planning for utilities, developers and investors alike.

Competing visions of energy future

White House officials defended the executive order even after Monday’s ruling, characterizing Biden administration renewable energy policies as providing unfair advantages to wind projects while burdening other energy sectors with excessive regulation. A spokesperson suggested offshore wind developments received preferential treatment that distorted the energy marketplace.

Environmental organizations celebrated the court decision as vindication for clean energy advocates. Groups that challenged the ban described the ruling as a win for consumers, workers, businesses and environmental protection efforts. They urged the administration to abandon what they characterized as illegal interference with renewable energy expansion.

The decision also carries implications for union workers whose jobs depend on wind project construction. Thousands of positions in manufacturing, installation and maintenance hung in the balance while the ban remained in effect.

What happens next

The administration must now decide whether to appeal Judge Saris’s ruling or allow wind project approvals to resume. Even if officials choose not to contest the decision, the months long freeze has already disrupted project timelines and potentially scared off investors wary of future policy reversals.

The case highlights the vulnerability of energy policy to political winds. Projects requiring years of planning and billions in capital face tremendous uncertainty when presidential administrations hold dramatically different views on which power sources deserve government support.

For now, wind energy proponents can claim a meaningful legal victory, though the broader political battle over America’s energy future remains far from resolved.

COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina’s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.

The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.

The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.

Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.

The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site

[TITLE]Transmission oversight gives project managers ‘eyes in the field’:
[TEXT]
(Credit: ATK Energy Group)

Contributed by Bill Perry

Last summer, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released a report showing that 334 miles of new 345 kV transmission lines and 554 miles of new 500 kV lines were constructed in 2024. The expansion of transmission lines will require not only engineering, material, equipment, and construction crews but also oversight.

“Oversight prevents redlines and go-backs, and oversight inspectors make sure a project is built correctly,” says the vice president of construction for an engineering, procurement, and construction firm focused on transmission lines.

The vice president notes, “Field oversight is at the front line–the eyes in the field–and raises the issues to fix before they become a problem.”

Extra eyes in the field will be necessary along with other resources if the current speed of transmission construction is to keep pace with experts’ projections. For example, this summer, Grid Strategies LLC wrote that “the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2024 National Transmission Planning Study calls for at least a doubling of the current regional transmission capacity and quadrupling of interregional transmission capacity by 2050.”

“The big improvement that comes through transmission oversight is an objective, third-party view of the work at hand,” says Bill Chesney, director of Client Solutions for Victory Powerline Services, part of ATK Energy Group.

The oversight professional’s goal, says Chesney, is to come to the job, provide expert feedback, and offer a qualified perspective to identify shortfalls. Before joining Victory, Chesney managed planning and scheduling for a major utility’s substation group. Chesney adds, “Utilities benefit when they bring in a neutral party to stay on top of capital projects, construction, and safety.”

Overseeing Safety

Many utilities have their own oversight inspectors. But experts say these people may have multiple jobs to inspect in a day. With time spent driving between job sites, inspectors might have a little more than an hour per day, or perhaps every other day, to check work.

When a third party augments oversight, they can shoulder some of the burden carried by a utility’s own transmission inspectors. A continual presence on a job site is critical to coaching crews to perform better, safer ways of working.

“Guys are now taught to ground a line with insulated gear when they have a clearance; some of us used to grab grounds with our bare hands,” says a veteran transmission lineman working in the Southeastern U.S. “We used to cut poles with chainsaws and wear gloves and a hard hat, but now it’s all those things plus a face mask and ear protection. Oversight guys point this out for everyone’s betterment.”

Safety issues often involve clearances and maintaining minimum approach distance, or MAD, says Chesney. For example, a crew might maneuver their truck into position to untap some bushings. But if they don’t have the proper MAD for getting under the energized line, that’s when an oversight inspector can step in to redirect the crew, adds Chesney. Oversight is
