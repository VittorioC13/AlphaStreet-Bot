Senior U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie threw out criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James yesterday. Currie said Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who led the indictments, was invalidly appointed. Both cases were dismissed "without prejudice," meaning the charges could be filed again. The rulings mark a loss for President Donald Trump, who pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against his political foes. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNBC that "this will not be the final word on this matter."

Amazon became the latest tech company to throw eye-popping sums behind AI buildout initiatives. The e-commerce giant said it will invest as much as $50 billion to expand its capacity to provide AI and high-performance computing capabilities for its cloud unit's U.S. government customers. The project is expected to begin in 2026 and will add close to 1.3 gigawatts of capacity. With the investment, government clients will also have access to Anthropic's Claude models and Nvidia chips, in addition to Amazon hardware and software. Also yesterday, Amazon said it will let businesses test its internet-from-space service, which was recently renamed Leo from Project Kuiper. As CNBC's Annie Palmer notes, the product competes with SpaceX's Starlink.

CNBC Sport is out this morning with its new NHL team valuations for 2025. The average franchise has seen its value rise 15% to $2.2 billion, driven by pricier media rights deals. The Toronto Maple Leafs remained at the front of the pack with a valuation of $4.3 billion, up 8% from last year. The New York Rangers is the runner-up, rising by 9% year over year to $3.8 billion.

[TITLE]This Holiday Shopping Season, Consumers Are Extra Divided as Retailers Push Sales – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
If you noticed holiday decor going up and “All I Want for Christmas Is You” playing in stores well before Halloween this year, that was no coincidence.

Retailers are pushing holiday sales — including Black Friday deals — earlier than ever before, largely due to economic uncertainty caused by tariffs, inflation and changing consumer spending habits. The uncertainty, too, is leading to a certain bifurcation in retail.

“I’m shocked every year at how much earlier sales come,” said Shaun Pappas, an attorney at Midtown-based law firm Starr Associates, which focuses on retail. “But this year seems like it’s as early as it’s been. At some point we’ll be shopping for Christmas in August.”

Indeed, stores like Best Buy, Target, Walmart and Kohl’s rolled out early-season promotions as soon as late September this year (and Black Friday discounts way before the post-Thanksgiving shopping stampede). It’s crazy, but it also seems to be working — early sales have already driven a decent amount of foot traffic to stores and malls.

Retail foot traffic in U.S. downtowns rose 0.8 percent month-over-month in October, while shopping malls saw an increase in foot traffic of 2.4 percent, offering retailers some “holiday hope,” according to a recent report from MRI Software.

“Promotionality is going to be the key driver for consumers this holiday season,” said Elizabeth Lafontaine, a retail analyst at foot traffic tracker Placer.ai. “That’s really going to be when consumers want to come out. … Consumers are really trying to be keyed and glued into when those promotions are going to be taking place to try to make sure that they’re driving as much value as possible.”

Plus, the earlier retailers start pushing holiday sales, the more money they could make. In fact, the National Retail Federation predicted retail sales in November and December will grow between 3.7 percent and 4.2 percent from 2024, translating to total spending between $1.01 trillion and $1.02 trillion. That’s compared to last year’s total spending of $976.1 billion.

So, whether you’re already stuffing your Christmas stocking with gifts or you’re taking after the Grinch this holiday season, it seems like there’s no stopping early holiday sales.

But we also can’t forget why those sales are happening in the first place. The threat of higher costs and delayed shipments caused by ever-changing tariffs are all but forcing small retailers and low-income consumers to save money and prioritize big-box sales and early discounts.

Meanwhile, a lot of higher-income consumers are taking a different approach amid all the hubbub — they’re essentially kicking back and relaxing, as those financial burdens don’t really fall on their shoulders.

“Holiday sales will likely surpass last year’s by a low single-digit margin, but capturing that growth in today’s highly bifurcated consumer environment will be more challenging than ever,” said Brandon Svec, national director of U.S. retail analytics for CoStar.

In that lies possibly the biggest obstacle facing today’s retailers — what Placer.ai calls a “two-tier economy” among consumers.

According to a new report from Placer.ai, affluent shoppers are driving profit growth in the luxury sector, while budget-conscious shoppers seek deals at value-oriented stores. In other words, the bifurcation between the two classes of consumers will grow even starker this year as low-income shoppers are forced to balance “needs versus wants” amid unsteady financial conditions.

“The two-tier economy essentially references a phenomenon that we started to see emerging in early 2025 that has really kind of exploded over the past few months, and it’s really similar to what we’ve called the bifurcation of consumers,” said Lafontaine, an author of the report.

“We see [affluent consumers] continue to have high levels of discretionary and disposable income and high levels of price elasticity, meaning that even as prices are going up, we’re not necessarily seeing them change their consumption habits,” Lafontaine added. “On the opposite end of the spectrum, what we’re seeing with lower- and middle-income household shoppers is that they are becoming much more financially constrained as the year has gone on, leading them to start to change some of their retail behaviors and look for high levels of value orientation.”

That consumer divide is clear in store performance, as both luxury and off-price apparel retailers are currently outpacing overall retail.

High-end spots like luxury department stores, specialty grocery stores and fine-dining restaurants are experiencing “steady traffic” this year compared to last year, Placer.ai’s report said. Luxury department stores saw a year-over-year increase in visits of 3.8 percent during the second quarter of 2025, while speciality grocery stores saw an 8.1 percent increase and upscale restaurants saw a 4 percent increase.

Meanwhile, off-price retailers and dollar stores are also seeing large increases in visits, at 6.6 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, according to the report. Value-driven grocery chain Aldi has even seen total visits rise from 4.3 percent in 2022 to 5.7 percent in 2025 to-date, Placer.ai said.

Plus, a retail report from Newmark found that secondhand and consignment clothing stores saw a 10.7 percent increase in visits year-over-year during the third quarter, largely due to younger shoppers “trading down” and turning to more affordable resale and consignment options.

It’s all a result of money-conscious consumers plagued by financial burdens — such as skyrocketing credit card debt and worsening home affordability — increasingly looking for the lowest prices amid tariff-related cost increases.

“Consumers are entering the season both price-sensitive and well-informed, and retailers must navigate an earlier promotional calendar while driving sales and protecting already razor-thin margins,” Svec said. “That’s a tough balancing act and one that demands a highly strategic approach to markdowns.”

For now, though, retailers seem to be doing fairly well, especially if demand for space in New York City is any indication. Popular Manhattan shopping neighborhoods such as SoHo and the Upper East Side have continued to see steady leasing, with SoHo seeing a total of 45,022 square feet leased during the third quarter of 2025 and the Upper East Side seeing the most deals completed with 11 transactions, according to a report from CBRE.

“New York City’s retail environment has been extremely vibrant, and we’ve seen a lot of lease-up,” said Jackie Totolo, a senior managing director at Newmark. “There’s demand from every sector. Prices have been driven up so high where it becomes unaffordable, but I think that we’ve seen stabilization, which has created tremendous more demand. … I think that good areas keep getting better, and we continue to see that grow.”

In terms of retail tenants signing those leases, food and beverage tenants have dominated Manhattan’s retail market lately in both lease volume and number of deals, according to CBRE’s report. The category saw more than 121,000 square feet leased across 35 transactions during the third quarter, with the largest being bakery Bread & Butter’s deal for 12,000 square feet at 525 Lexington Avenue.

But one of the largest recent retail leases in the city came just after that third quarter, when Chelsea Piers Management, which manages the sprawling Chelsea Piers Sports & Entertainment Complex, signed a lease for 48,833 square feet at GFP Real Estate’s 200 Varick Street in Hudson Square in early October.

“Experiential types of retail have also been big, like membership clubs or gyms,” Pappas said. “But, just in general, it seems like brick-and-mortar is coming back to the point where even online stores want a physical footprint. During COVID, a lot of those stores shut down, and there was a lot of vacancy. But if you look down Madison Avenue and at the Upper East Side, a lot of those vacancies are being filled.”

Still, the growing bifurcation of consumers is also evident in the city’s recent retail leasing, in that both luxury brands and off-price brands are taking chunks of space off the market.

For example, high-end health and wellness brand Life Time took 52,000 square feet at 10 Bryant Park, while Swiss luxury watchmaker Rolex is opening a new store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. On the other end, Mott Haven Discount signed a deal for roughly 10,000 square feet for its first Bronx location, while dollar stores — specifically Dollar Tree — are doing better than ever in terms of sales.

While the gap between consumers deepens, it remains to be seen which end consumers in the middle of the market — i.e., in New York, those households that make between $56,385 and $168,156 annually as of this year — will shop on. Do they splurge and go for luxury brands, or guard the piggy bank and stick to deals and discounts?

“It’s definitely macroeconomics driving all of this,” Totolo said. “We’ve seen prices increase, and consumers are sensitive to that. What we will see in the holiday season — which has been pulled forward — is steeper discounts driving sales from a gross perspective. … The aspirational category may not be getting hit because the top is only shopping at the top, and the bottom is shopping at the lower ends.”

So the question remains: How can retailers appeal to all types of consumers, no matter their income level? There’s a lot of possible answers, but according to Svec, retailers need to create a sense of urgency to get all kinds of shoppers through their doors.

“While the value shopper is focused on price and timing, the affluent consumer continues to prioritize experience and quality,” Svec said. “This widening divide makes it difficult to appeal to both ends of the spectrum, but retailers that can create a sense of buying urgency, while staying relevant to both audiences, will be the biggest winners of this holiday season.”

Early holiday sales — especially ones that have an expiration — are a good way to create that sense of urgency, but they also pose the risk of overwhelming customers, according to David Wachs, founder of handwritten notes service Handwrytten.

“We saw holiday jingles come before October,” Wachs said. “It’s frightening. We’re all going to be so burnt out on ‘Have a Holly Jolly Christmas.’ I think if you push sales super early, you’re going to be drowned out by the cacophony of everybody else pushing sales super early.”

Wachs’s answer on how retailers can appeal to all consumers this year is simple: Get creative.

“Brands really need to get very creative to find ways to appeal to the consumer on an emotional level, and throwing more against the wall is not an emotional connection,” Wachs said. “You have to do multiple things to get in front of that consumer, and you have to pivot right when everybody’s pivoting left.”

One of the ways to do that is by sending handwritten notes to customers to show appreciation and loyalty, which Wachs’s Handwrytten company helps to provide.

Handwrytten works with a variety of companies, ranging from large fashion houses to department store chains to dog food brands. Through its personalized handwritten notes, Wachs said his company has generated a 17 times greater response rate from customers compared to emails or print advertisements.

And, while creating a sense of urgency and getting creative with branding certainly works, Lafontaine said she thinks the best way for retailers to appeal to all customers this holiday season is to provide them with a sense of value or experience.

[TITLE]U.K. Retail Industry Finds Little Cheer in Labour Government’s Latest Budget:
[TEXT]
LONDON — Retail, beauty and luxury organizations reacted with dismay to the 2025 budget delivered by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves on Wednesday and accused the government of failing, once again, to support business.

Although Reeves kept the Labour party’s electoral promise of not raising income tax, she instead offered a package laden with loads of other taxes that will hit middle-earners, homeowners, businesses, employees and tourist-dependent industries such as retail and hospitality.

The government announced plans to freeze income tax thresholds, meaning that more people will be dragged into higher brackets as their salaries increase.

It will also slap extra taxes on employees’ pension contributions, and the funds that employers pay into pension pots, and jack up the National Living Wage for workers, and the minimum wage for teenagers, putting further pressure on employers.

Selfridges is among the larger stores that will continue to be impacted by soaring business taxes in the U.K. David Parry/Courtesy

Reeves is also giving local mayors across the country powers to impose a “tourist tax” on overnight stays. She has largely preserved the stiff taxes that companies pay on their physical stores, hotels and other brick-and-mortar properties, especially in the big cities.

That “business rates” tax has long been a bone of contention here, with companies accusing government of de facto favoring online retailers over physical stores. Under Reeves’ new proposals, some businesses with smaller premises will be eligible for lower tax rates.

Helen Brocklebank, chief executive officer of U.K. luxury lobby Walpole, called the budget “a missed opportunity. Instead of introducing measures that would boost growth and help businesses thrive, the Chancellor chose the opposite.”

She said Britain’s 81 billion pound luxury sector “remains a resilient driver of growth for the U.K. economy and supports 454,000 jobs across the country. Luxury businesses want to invest and grow, but this budget missed its chance to support this agenda. Large luxury retailers now face higher business rates, while hospitality faces a double whammy of business rates and a tourist tax.”

[TITLE]Retailers- Three Reads on Consumer Spending Ahead of the Holidays:
[TEXT]
Retail stocks were a bright spot yesterday. Shares of Kohl's Corp. (KSS) soared after the retailer increased its forecast for the second straight quarter. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) also surged on the back of better results and a boosted forecast, notes Amber Kanwar, host of the In the Money with Amber Kanwar podcast.

To get more articles and chart analysis from MoneyShow, subscribe to our Top Pros’ Top Picks newsletter here.)

Sales at KSS are still expected to fall, just not as bad as previously thought. This comes after a period of tumult at the discount retailer with the abrupt departure of the CEO in May when it was discovered he had an undisclosed personal relationship with a vendor.

A graph of stock market AI-generated content may be incorrect.

There is a big short position – with 27% of shares sold short. That means much of the rally is likely those investors being squeezed and forced to cover.

At ANF, third-quarter net sales hit a record, powered by strength in its Hollister brand. Sales there were up 16% on a strong back-to-school season.

Best Buy Co. (BBY) didn’t get the same exuberant treatment despite raising its outlook for full-year sales. Same-store sales and profit also advanced more than anticipated. This is especially interesting because Best Buy has had to raise the price of some of its goods due to tariffs. Raising their sales forecast against this backdrop suggests customers are still willing to upgrade their tech.

[TITLE]Top consumer watchdog fines JioMart over risky walkie-talkie listings:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India's top consumer watchdog has held Reliance JioMart guilty of misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices by allowing the sale of uncertified walkie-talkies on its platform, government officials aware of the matter said, in a first such action against an e-commerce portal.

Accordingly, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹100,000 and directed JioMart to ensure that no walkie-talkies or any product requiring statutory approval is listed without full compliance with applicable laws. A compliance report has to be filed within 15 days.

The CCPA order of 21 November, reviewed by Mint, follows a months-long inquiry that began in May, when the regulator issued notices to several e-commerce platforms over illegal sales of wireless devices operating in restricted frequency bands - or radio frequencies that are reserved for emergency services like police, or ambulance communication, defence services, or aviation. Any interference with these airwaves can disrupt essential services, and also potentially raise national security concerns.

During its inquiry, the authority found that JioMart had listed walkie-talkie models without disclosing crucial information such as operating frequency, licensing requirements or proof of Equipment Type Approval (ETA) from the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing of the Department of Telecommunications.

The ETA certifies that a wireless device uses only those radio frequencies that are legally permissible in India and follows the technical standards set by the government.

May mislead buyers

The omission by JioMart could mislead buyers into assuming the devices were legal for unrestricted use, violating consumer rights under the Consumer Protection Act, particularly the right to be informed

[TITLE]Performance Food Group, US Foods end merger talks:
[TEXT]
Performance Food Group and US Foods have ended talks that would have created the largest domestic foodservice company and one of the nation’s largest private fleets.

Both companies operate more than 6,000 tractors. A combination would have created the biggest food distributor in the U.S. with over $100 billion in annual net sales. Richmond, Virginia-based Performance Food Group (NYSE: PFGC) has approximately 155 distribution centers and Rosemont, Illinois-based US Foods (NYSE: USFD) has over 70.

The combined market capitalization would have been north of $30 billion, rivaling the largest food distributor, Houston-based Sysco (NYSE: SYY), which has a $36 billion market cap.

Sysco generates over $80 billion in net sales annually through its 337 distribution centers in 10 countries. It has a fleet of over 19,000 delivery vehicles.

“Our Board of Directors is unanimous in its belief that the clearest and best path to long-term stockholder values is executing our standalone strategic plan, leveraging our diverse business segments to drive consistent revenue and profit growth,” said PFG Chairman and CEO George Holm in a news release. “The strength of our recently reported fiscal first quarter results and continued momentum supports the confidence in our ability to drive value for stockholders independently.”

PFG reaffirmed its full-year fiscal 2026 guidance of $67.5 billion to $68.5 billion in net sales and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion.

Dive Brief:

US Foods and Performance Food Group will no longer pursue a potential merger, the companies announced Monday.

The food distributors stopped discussions after formally considering the matter for months, which included analyzing synergies and regulatory matters.

“Our Board of Directors is unanimous in its belief that the clearest and best path to long-term stockholder values is executing our standalone strategic plan, leveraging our diverse business segments to drive consistent revenue and profit growth,” PFG CEO George Holm said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

US Foods CEO David Flitman said in early August that the Illinois-based company had initiated the process and probed the combination potential with PFG even earlier.

Flitman’s company has continued to have investment capital available. Its board in recent years approved billions of dollars for share repurchases.

With the merger discussions ending, US Foods’ board approved another $1 billion share repurchase program, the company said.

“We have concluded that our best path to long-term value creation is executing our Long-range Plan, including our disciplined capital allocation framework,” Flitman said in a statement.

The two companies already control major markets. US Foods has approximately 30,000 workers, and Virginia-headquartered PFG has around 43,000 workers, according to company figures.

The pair follow behind Sysco in their tractor count, per Transport Topics’ list of the largest private carriers.

[TITLE]K-shaped economy and inflation boost Black Friday sales by 4.1% from last year, online spending jumps 9.1%:
[TEXT]
US retail sales on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, climbed 4.1% compared with last year, according to data released Saturday by Mastercard SpendingPulse. Online shoppers alone spent $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from 2024, according to data collection platform Adobe Analytics.

But those gains don’t account for higher prices due to inflation, so actual spending could be flat.

“We have 3% inflation, so maybe (the 4.1% increase in spending) is a real increase of just 1% or so, which is not that much of an increase,” Rick Newman, who writes The Pinpoint Press, a newsletter on the US economy, told CNN on Friday.

There’s also a bifurcation in who’s spending. The Federal Reserve’s most recent Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes

[TITLE]Winners and losers of Black Friday 2025:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Black Friday — and the holiday shopping season in general — may be more important than ever for retailers in 2025.

But the event has evolved dramatically in recent years.

“The Black Friday that we have come to know and love has changed,” Circana’s Chief Retail Advisor Marshal Cohen told Retail Dive.

Headed into the shopping event this year, consumers were dealing with hits to federally funded support programs and continued inflation as retailers faced dropping consumer sentiment, despite continued spending.

“We've kind of put ourselves in an interesting position of making Black Friday very important, but not as engaged and not a frenzy and not as much of a purchase urgency that we've seen in years past,” Cohen added.

While the term “Black Friday” sounds focused on a singular day, the shopping event has ultimately become more of a multiday event of savings. To that point, it may be too early to tell how much consumers shopped based on early numbers, CI&T Global Director of Retail Strategy and Insights Melissa Minkow said.

“I think it’s too fluid and too confusing at this point to limit Black Friday to just one day given how frequently consumers are being offered deals,” Minkow told Retail Dive.

A clearer picture will emerge as numbers come out from the full Thanksgiving week and Cyber Monday period. Broadly speaking, however, year over year comparisons may be hard to do at the end of 2025 as well, given that 2024 was an election period and such years have historically dampened retail sales.

U.S. e-commerce sales hit $11.8 billion on Black Friday, marking a 9.1% year-over-year increase, per Adobe Analytics data. Meanwhile, Salesforce data found that online Black Friday U.S. sales grew 3% to $18 billion. Shopify’s offline sales data collected from its point of sale channel saw 26% growth year over year in the U.S.

Top line sales growth online and in store rarely tells the full story, though.

There are already insights to glean, with the biggest Black Friday loser emerging: the consumer. Here are the highs and lows from Black Friday so far.

WINNERS

Artificial intelligence usage

AI traffic to U.S. retail websites grew 805% compared to 2024 on Black Friday, per Adobe’s data. AI tools were used the most for the video games, appliances, electronics, toys, personal care and baby product categories. Adobe also found that shoppers who landed on a U.S. retail site from an AI service were 38% more likely to convert to a sale, versus coming from a non-AI traffic source.

Salesforce data found that traffic from third-party AI agent channels increased 300% in the first half of Black Friday compared to last year both globally and in the U.S. Additionally, $3 billion in U.S. online sales were driven by AI and agents during the day.

For customer service, agentic service conversations on Black Friday grew 42% compared to Thanksgiving, per Salesforce.

Retailers with exclusive store perks

With many retailers offering similar discounts on similar products, differentiation for consumers is harder to come by. Companies who offered exclusive gifts and freebies in store may have succeeded at giving shoppers a reason to make the trek to their stores versus others.

“What we saw [Friday] was the only stores that were really busy early in the morning, was basically Target,” Circana’s Cohen said.

The mass retailer offered a free limited-edition tote bag filled with giveaways to the first 100 guests in line at stores on Friday. Meanwhile, Lowe’s gave away a bucket with products to the first 50 customers along with a chance to win an in-stock appliance up to $2,000.

A lack of merchandising newness may have dampened the interest and excitement from shoppers on Black Friday as many of the hottest products are similar to last year’s, Cohen said.

“Build it and they will come, give me a gift, and I'm going to show up,” Cohen added. “So you've got to incentivize the consumer to come to you versus someone else. Now, prices aren't the answer, because everybody's got similar prices.”

LOSERS

Online order volume

Online order volume in the U.S. dropped 1% year over year on Black Friday while average selling prices increased 7%, per Salesforce data.

“Black Friday delivered an important signal for the U.S. economy,” Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce, said in a statement. “On the surface, sales were strong, hitting $18 billion, a 3% jump year-over-year. But with the average selling price for goods climbing 7%, U.S. shoppers continued to feel the bite of inflation.”

Additionally, units per transaction dropped 2% year over year according to Salesforce.

Flat online discounts for consumers

Online discount rates remained flat on Black Friday compared to 2024, Salesforce found, with average discount rates peaking at 28% in the U.S. and 27% globally.

“Most of the affordable specialty apparel retailers offered the same large percentage off deals for the 2025 Black Friday weekend as they did in 2024,” Gartner Analyst Brad Jashinsky said in emailed comments. “The non-discounted prices of some products have increased, but the overall discount messaging has been consistent for many retailers.”

In the electronics category, peak discounts online Friday in the U.S. hit 29% off the listed price compared to a peak of 30.1% in 2024, per Adobe data. Meanwhile, toys discounts peaked at 30% versus 28% last year, televisions were nearly flat at 24.3% versus 24.2%, and furniture was flat at 19%.

“It’s pretty much the deal levels and discount levels that retailers have been offering on various products throughout the year,” CI&T’s Minkow noted.

Buy now, pay later … sort of

Consumers looking to short-term financing is both good and bad. Retailers benefit from consumers making purchases during the holidays, even if it means taking on credit. However, it can have consequences later on if those consumers struggle to make payments.

Buy now, pay later usage on Black Friday was up 8.9% year over year, driving $747.5 million in online spend, per Adobe Analytics.

“There may not be as many gifts, but they're going to spend as much as they can possibly spend, and worry

[TITLE]Global e-commerce startup funding hits 2020s low, while 2025 U.S. holiday spending could break records:
[TEXT]
The Retail Super Bowl is upon us: Black Friday through Cyber Monday is here.

And 2025 is expected to be record-breaking: The National Retail Federation anticipates that, for the first time, U.S. holiday spending will cross $1 trillion. Now, a seeming contradiction—funding for e-commerce startups is at a low.

In 2021, global e-commerce-related startup funding peaked (along with so much else) and reached more than $94 billion, according to Crunchbase. Fast-forward to 2025. That number has come crashing down, lingering around $7.3 billion. (For context, in 2020, e-commerce-related startup funding came in around $31 billion.)

So, what’s going on here? I spoke to Indy Guha, general partner at VMG Partners, as we headed into Thanksgiving. First thing you need to understand, said Guha, is that the 2021 boom was buoyed by the peaks of the ZIRP era, but at the center of it all was a bet on real behavioral shifts spurred by COVID-19, some of which have stuck (like curbside pickup and increased comfort with more inventive forms of online shopping and food delivery), but many of which haven’t.

“As it turns out, as human beings, we all really enjoy experiential retail,” said Guha. “When you walk into any sort of retail location, mall or otherwise, that’s doing well today, they have a lot of pop-up shops and fun arcades… So, I think some of that explains the pullback.”

Since then, a pattern has emerged: less funding for online shops themselves (save for truly exceptional cases), and more funding for backend technologies and infrastructure.

“What’s happening with e-commerce funding, in short, is the destination side is down, enabling technology is up,” said Guha. “If you were a founder and you went to a VC today saying ‘I build email marketing for Shopify’… There’s no funding for that. But if you’re solving supply chain sell-through for the enterprise, there’s lots of funding for that, because your underlying market is just enormous.”

This year has featured some massive e-commerce-related rounds. Consider Wonder—Marc Lore’s takeout and delivery startup—which raised $600 million in May and acquired Grubhub. Then, October was a crucial month for VC-backed e-commerce funding: live shopping juggernaut Whatnot raised its $225 million Series F, while India-based Zepto raised a $450 million round at a $7 billion valuation. Simultaneously, there’s also an expanding world of AI-powered e-commerce tools, like Julie Bornstein’s Daydream.

This all gets at a natural question, one paralleling a question I’ve often asked about AI: What even is an e-commerce startup? The answer, I suspect, will over time continue to blur. In the meantime, looking into next year, VMG’s Guha expects the trends we see in the data this year to more or less continue.

“It’s going to be the same pattern,” he said. “Enterprise-focused AI applications, which definitionally will serve large retailers and brands—there will be lots of funding for that. But destination sites, you’ve got to have a really crisp reason to exist.”

See you tomorrow,

[TITLE]United States Buy Now Pay Later Business Report 2025: A $184.05 Billion Market by 2030, Driven by Consumer Demand for Flexible Payments, Strong E-commerce Momentum, and High-value Financing Agreements:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "United States Buy Now Pay Later Business and Investment Opportunities Databook - 75+ KPIs on BNPL Market Size, End-Use Sectors, Market Share, Product Analysis, Business Model, Demographics - Q3 2025 Update" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The BNPL payment market in United States is expected to grow by 12.2% on annual basis to reach US$122.26 billion in 2025. The BNPL market in the country experienced robust growth during 2021-2024, achieving a CAGR of 20.3%. This upward trajectory is expected to continue, with the market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 8.5% during 2025-2030. By the end of 2030, the BNPL sector is projected to expand from its 2024 value of USD 109.00 billion to approximately USD 184.05 billion.

This report provides a detailed data-centric analysis of the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) industry in United States, covering market opportunities and risks across a range of retail categories. With over 75 KPIs at the country level, this report provides a comprehensive understanding of BNPL market dynamics, market size and forecast, and market share statistics.

The BNPL market in the U.S. is on a strong growth trajectory, driven by increasing consumer adoption, the expansion of e-commerce, and the diversification of BNPL applications beyond retail. As more consumers seek flexible payment solutions, BNPL providers are forming strategic partnerships with merchants and service providers to meet this demand.

The BNPL market in the U.S. is expanding rapidly, driven by consumer demand for flexible financing options and strong e-commerce growth. Leading players such as Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna continue to dominate the space, forming key partnerships with retailers to increase accessibility. Recent strategic moves, including Affirm's multi-billion-dollar financing agreements and Apple's integration of Klarna into Apple Pay, highlight the market's competitive nature. These developments indicate that BNPL providers are securing long-term capital and strengthening their presence in digital payment ecosystems.

However, with increased regulatory scrutiny from the CFPB, BNPL providers must adhere to stricter consumer protection standards, including dispute resolution and refund processing requirements. While regulations aim to create a more secure and responsible BNPL ecosystem, they may also challenge providers to adapt their business models. As competition intensifies and regulations evolve, BNPL firms must innovate while maintaining compliance, ensuring long-term sustainability in the U.S. market.

Current State of the BNPL Market

The BNPL market in the U.S. has expanded significantly, fueled by increasing consumer demand for flexible payment options and the continued rise of e-commerce. As shoppers look for alternatives to credit cards, BNPL has become a mainstream payment option, particularly among younger consumers and online shoppers.

Leading providers such as Affirm, Afterpay (owned by Block, Inc.), and Klarna have established a strong foothold by partnering with major retailers to integrate BNPL options at checkout. These companies continue to expand their offerings across multiple sectors, including travel, electronics, and fashion. As competition intensifies, new entrants and traditional financial institutions are also exploring BNPL solutions, further shaping the industry's future.

Key Players and New Entrants

The U.S. BNPL market is dominated by key players such as Affirm, Afterpay (owned by Block, Inc.), and Klarna, each securing strong partnerships with major retailers to offer installment payment solutions. These companies have expanded their services beyond traditional retail, integrating BNPL options into the travel, healthcare, and electronics sectors. Their widespread adoption has fueled the growth of BNPL as a mainstream payment method, particularly among younger consumers who seek flexible financing options.

New entrants and financial institutions are increasingly entering the BNPL space to compete with established players and capture a share of the growing market. Traditional banks such as American Express and Citibank have introduced BNPL-style installment plans for credit cardholders, while fintech startups and payment platforms such as Apple Pay (through Klarna) and PayPal's "Pay in 4" continue expanding their BNPL offerings. As competition intensifies, providers focus on differentiating their services through lower fees, extended repayment periods, and seamless digital integration to attract and retain customers.

Recent Launches, Mergers, and Acquisitions

Affirm's Financing Agreements: In January 2025, Affirm expanded its partnership with Liberty Mutual Investments, securing up to $750 million to bolster its consumer lending activities. This follows a $4 billion commitment from Sixth Street Partners in December 2024 to enhance Affirm's lending capacity over the next three years.

Apple's Integration of BNPL Services: In October 2024, Apple incorporated Klarna's BNPL service into Apple Pay, providing users with interest-free installment options. This move came after Apple discontinued its Pay Later service, signaling a strategic shift towards partnering with established BNPL providers.

Outlook

This rapid growth will likely drive increased competition among existing providers, leading to further innovation in BNPL offerings. Established players such as Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna will continue to scale their services, while new entrants and traditional financial institutions will seek opportunities to capture market share.

As BNPL adoption rises, providers are expected to diversify their offerings across industries such as travel, healthcare, and education to appeal to a broader consumer base. The market's expansion will also attract greater regulatory oversight, ensuring responsible lending and consumer protection. Over the next few years, BNPL firms must balance growth, compliance, and evolving consumer preferences to maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded marketplace.

Regulatory Changes

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) introduced new regulations in May 2024, applying credit card-like protections to BNPL providers. One of the key provisions is dispute resolution, which requires BNPL lenders to investigate consumer disputes and temporarily pause payment obligations during the investigation process. This change ensures that consumers have greater protection against fraudulent or incorrect charges, bringing BNPL services in line with traditional credit card protections.

Another critical regulatory update focuses on refund processing, mandating that BNPL providers credit refunds to consumers for returned products or canceled services. This requirement addresses a growing concern among BNPL users who previously faced challenges obtaining timely refunds, particularly when dealing with multiple parties, such as merchants and lenders. These measures aim to enhance transparency and create a more consumer-friendly BNPL ecosystem.

The CFPB's approach to enforcement includes a transition period, during which BNPL lenders will not face penalties if they make a good faith effort to comply with the new regulations. This allows providers time to adjust their systems and policies while ensuring a smoother consumer transition. Over the coming months, the regulatory landscape for BNPL is expected to continue evolving, with further oversight likely as the industry expands and becomes a more significant part of the U.S. financial ecosystem.
