[TITLE]Kaltura Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire eSelf.ai, a provider of AI-based Interactive Avatars:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaltura, Inc. (Nasdaq: KLTR), the AI Video Experience Cloud, today announced it has signed on November 5th, 2025, a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf.ai, a multimodal AI lab developing technology for agentic interactions with live avatars.

eSelf.ai provides conversational photorealistic avatars that support over 30 languages and an easy-to-use studio to create, guide, and deploy them. Its proprietary technology combines AI-based live, expressive visual agents, with low-latency speech recognition and generation, screen understanding, dynamic media sharing, and an agentic enterprise-grade framework and workflows.

eSelf.ai commenced development in 2023 and was named by FastCompany as one of the “Next Big Things in Tech” in 2025. Comprised of over 15 AI experts in the fields of computer vision models, NLP, and speech technology, eSelf.ai is led by co-founders Dr. Alan Bekker and Eylon Shoshan. Dr. Bekker holds a PhD in machine learning with a specialization in speech, NLP and computer vision, and was recognized by Forbes magazine in their “30 under 30 - Europe” list. Before founding eSelf Dr. Bekker co-founded Voca.ai, a pioneer in voice-based agents, which was acquired by Snap, where he subsequently led all conversational AI efforts.

Kaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai’s immersive virtual agents technology across the Kaltura AI Video Experience Cloud, inserting avatars into its market-leading video products. This technology will also turn Kaltura’s Genies (Class, Work, CX, and TV Genies) into conversational, visually expressive agents that will hear, talk, and “see” user screens and analyze them in real time. Easy integration with enterprise systems and content repositories are planned to enable these agents to augment human roles cost-effectively, and to boost customer engagement, employee retention and business results.

Kaltura also plans to provide embeddable, stand-alone, self-served interactive avatars, expanding the company’s product-led growth (PLG) motion. In addition, eSelf’s avatar technology will serve as the foundation for a planned new video-on-demand content creation tool, designed to enable customers to automatically add speaking photorealist and animated avatars into any video. This dual capability positions eSelf as a key driver of Kaltura’s next-generation video-on-demand content creation, and live, conversational agentic experiences.

The acquisition is expected to provide upsell opportunities across Kaltura’s premium customer base, attract new large enterprise customers, and open new self-serve sale opportunities with small and medium-sized enterprises and with departmental entry points into large enterprises. The new capabilities are expected to add conversational, immersive virtual agents to the following use cases, and many more:

[TITLE]North Atlantic France SAS provides updates on the contemplated acquisition of a majority stake in Esso Société Anonyme Française SA:
[TEXT]
Paris, France, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

North Atlantic France SAS provides updates on the contemplated acquisition of a majority stake in Esso Société Anonyme Française SA

Turkish antitrust clearance obtained; transaction remains subject to French direct foreign investment authorization and EU Foreign Subsidies clearance

Transaction target closing date set for November 28, 2025

Esso S.A.F. shareholders approved extraordinary distribution of €60.21 per share

Assuming a closing on November 28, 2025, final purchase price of €26.19 per Esso S.A.F. share for the acquisition of the ExxonMobil block of shares and €28.93 per Esso S.A.F. share in the context of the tender offer

Esso S.A.F. to be renamed “North Atlantic Energies” upon completion of the transaction

Paris, FRANCE, November 10, 2025 – North Atlantic France SAS (“North Atlantic”) refers to its announcements dated May 28, 2025, September 24, 2025 and October 6, 2025 with respect to the contemplated acquisition from ExxonMobil France Holding SAS (“ExxonMobil”) of ExxonMobil’s entire stake in Esso Société Anonyme Française SA (“Esso S.A.F.”) and in ExxonMobil Chemical France SAS (the “Transaction”).

Regulatory approvals and expected closing timeline

North Atlantic has obtained Turkish antitrust clearance and continues to pursue the remaining regulatory approvals, namely the foreign investment prior authorization from the French Ministry of Economy and the decision of the European Commission under the EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation.

Subject to obtaining these approvals and finalizing certain financing arrangements, North Atlantic and ExxonMobil currently expect to close the Transaction on November 28, 2025.

Block acquisition purchase price of €26.19 per share assuming a closing on November 28, 2025

On October 6, 2025, North Atlantic announced that the price per Esso S.A.F. share of €149.19 would be reduced to €85.18 reflecting (i) a €11.01 downward adjustment for the change in the euro value of Esso S.A.F.'s inventory relative to its value as of December 31, 2024 and (ii) a €53.00 downward adjustment corresponding to the ordinary dividend and the extraordinary dividend paid by Esso S.A.F. on July 10, 2025.

In addition, taking into account the €60.21 per share extraordinary distribution to be paid on November 14, 2025 by Esso S.A.F., following shareholder approval obtained on November 4, 2025 at Esso S.A.F.’s Combined General Meeting, the €85.18 price per share will be further reduced to €24.97.

Assuming a closing on November 28, 2025, North Atlantic and ExxonMobil have agreed to definitively settle between themselves, on a lump-sum basis, the amount of the price adjustments provided for in the Share Purchase Agreement and to set the price per share to be paid to ExxonMobil at €26.19.1

On this basis, the price to be paid to Esso S.A.F.’s minority shareholders in the mandatory tender offer for the remaining Esso S.A.F. shares that North Atlantic intends to file before the end of the year is set at €28.932 per share, corresponding to a difference of approximately 10.46% over the price per share paid to ExxonMobil.

Change of corporate name of Esso S.A.F

As resolved at Esso S.A.F.’s Combined General Meeting on November 4, 2025 and subject to completion of the Transaction, Esso S.A.F. will be renamed "North Atlantic Energies."

North Atlantic reiterates its commitment to delivering a comprehensive and well-managed transition, with the intention to maintain employment and existing compensation and benefits.

[TITLE]Beyond Meat® Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) (“Beyond Meat” or “the Company”), a leader in plant-based meat, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 27, 2025.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights1

Net revenues were $70.2 million, a decrease of 13.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China.

Loss from operations was $112.3 million, or operating margin of -160.0%, compared to loss from operations of $30.9 million, or operating margin of -38.2%, in the year-ago period. Loss from operations included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. Loss from operations also included the following charges recorded in operating expenses: $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses; $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a previously-disclosed contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer; and $0.6 million in costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s campus headquarters building in El Segundo, California (the “Campus Headquarters”).

Net loss was $110.7 million, or $1.44 per common share, compared to net loss of $26.6 million, or $0.41 per common share, in the year-ago period. Net loss in aggregate included $81.2 million in expenses related to non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets, the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China, certain non-routine SG&A expenses, incremental arbitration-related legal expenses, and costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters.

Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $21.6 million, or -30.8% of net revenues, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.

Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, "As we approach the end of 2025, we’ve achieved three important building blocks for our broader transformation efforts. These are significantly reducing our overall leverage in connection with the previously announced exchange of substantially all of our 2027 convertible notes; meaningfully extending our debt maturity; and finally, adding substantial liquidity to our balance sheet.”

Brown continued “Simultaneously, we are taking equally strong measures to accelerate our path to sustainable operations, including pursuing further and sizable cost reductions, gross margin expansion investments and targeted strategic growth initiatives. Though category headwinds and an accompanying softer top-line continue to weigh on and reverberate throughout our current performance, including our Q3 results, we are closing out the year with a much improved balance sheet, important transformation spadework underway, and genuine optimism and excitement regarding our future.”

Third Quarter 2025

Net revenues decreased 13.3% to $70.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $81.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 10.3% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 3.5% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand, reduced points of distribution in the U.S. retail channel, and lower sales of burger products to Quick Service Restaurant (“QSR”) customers in the international foodservice channel. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts, changes in product sales mix and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

U.S. retail channel net revenues decreased 18.4% to $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $35.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.6% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 6.6% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and reduced points of distribution. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

U.S. foodservice channel net revenues decreased 27.3% to $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.5 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 27.1% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 0.3% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and the lapping of sales of chicken products to a U.S. QSR customer in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

International retail channel net revenues decreased 4.6% to $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $16.6 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.5% decrease in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 9.1% increase in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by reduced sales of the Company’s burger, dinner sausage and chicken products. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by higher trade discounts.

International foodservice channel net revenues increased 2.3% to $15.3 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $15.0 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by a 4.4% increase in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in net revenue per pound. The increase in volume of products sold was primarily due to higher sales of chicken products to a QSR customer, partially offset by reduced sales of burger products to certain QSR customers. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by changes in product sales mix, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, lower trade discounts and, to a lesser extent, price increases of certain of our products.

The following table presents consolidated volume of the Company’s products sold in pounds for the periods presented:

Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change (in thousands) September 27, 2025 September 28, 2024 Amount % September 27, 2025 September 28, 2024 Amount % U.S.: Retail 5,878 6,727 (849 ) (12.6 )% 17,754 22,296 (4,542 ) (20.4 )% Foodservice 1,655 2,271 (616 ) (27.1 )% 5,042 6,061 (1,019 ) (16.8 )% International: Retail 3,128 3,576 (448 ) (12.5 )% 9,202 10,416 (1,214 ) (11.7 )% Foodservice 4,328 4,144 184 4.4 % 13,687 14,219 (532 ) (3.7 )% Volume of products sold 14,989 16,718 (1,729 ) (10.3 )% 45,685 52,992 (7,307 ) (13.8 )%

Gross profit in the third quarter of 2025 was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China. Additionally, gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 were negatively impacted by increased cost of goods sold per pound and decreased net revenue per pound. The increase in cost of goods sold per pound primarily reflected higher materials costs and higher inventory provision, partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses, including depreciation, and lower logistics costs.

Operating expenses were $119.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $45.2 million in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. The Company performed a quantitative assessment in accordance with ASC 360 and concluded that an impairment of its long-lived assets existed at September 27, 2025. There were no such impairment charges in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 also included $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses, $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer and $0.6 million in costs related to the partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters. Excluding these items, the decrease in operating expenses compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by reduced marketing expenses and reduced non-production salaries and related expenses.

Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2025 was $112.3 million, compared to $30.9 million in the year-ago period. The increase in loss from operations was driven by the increase in operating expenses and the reduction in gross profit.

The following table summarizes certain charges recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the third quarter of 2025 (unaudited):

(in thousands) Charges recorded in cost of goods sold Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 1,721 Total charges recorded in cost of goods sold $ 1,721 Charges recorded in operating expenses Non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets $ 77,414 Certain non-routine SG&A expenses $ 838 Incremental legal and other fees and expenses related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer $ 662 Costs related to partial lease termination $ 555 Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 36 Total charges recorded in operating expenses $ 79,504 Total $ 81,225

Total other income, net, was $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to total other income, net, of $4.4 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in total other income, net, was primarily due to a reduction in net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and an increase in interest expense related to leases and to the Company’s delayed draw term loan facility, partially offset by benefit from the remeasurement of warrant liability and interest income.

Net loss was $110.7 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $26.6 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per common share was $1.44 in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.41 in the year-ago period. The increase in net loss in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by the increase in loss from operations and the decrease in total other income, net.

Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $21.6 million, or -30.8% of net revenues, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance, including restricted cash, was $131.1 million and total outstanding debt was $1.2 billion as of September 27, 2025. Net cash used in operating activities was $98.1 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to $69.9 million in the year-ago period.

Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 27, 2025 included draws in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million from the Company’s Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility with Unprocessed Foods, LLC, partially offset by related debt issuance costs.

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, on October 29, 2025, the Company announced the final tender results of its previously-announced exchange offer (the “Exchange Offer”) to exchange any and all of its 2027 convertible notes for a pro rata portion of: (i) up to $202.5 million in aggregate principal amount of new convertible second lien notes; and (ii) up to 326,190,370 shares of the Company’s common stock.

[TITLE]Breakfast Cereals Market Report 2025: Key Players Analysis Recent Developments, Company Strategies, Sustainability Benchmarking, Product Launches, Key Persons, and Revenue Forecasts 2024-2033:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Breakfast Cereals Market: Key Players Analysis Recent Developments, Company Strategies, Sustainability Benchmarking, Product Launches, Key Persons, and Revenue Forecasts" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Breakfast Cereals industry is expected to expand lucratively to an estimated value of US$ 95.32 Billion by 2033, from US$ 65.25 Billion in 2024. This expansion reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.30% between 2025 and 2033.

The global breakfast cereals market is growing steadily, driven by changing consumer lifestyles, increasing health awareness, and the demand for convenience. Ready-to-eat (cold) cereals dominate in most regions, with hot cereals also gaining traction. Consumers are increasingly choosing cereals fortified with fiber, protein, whole grains, and vitamins, while seeking lower sugar content and "clean label" ingredients. Innovation in flavors, textures, and formats - such as on-the-go, single-serve options - is becoming more common. E-commerce and modern retail channels are expanding access, especially in urban and emerging markets.

Regionally, North America remains a major share contributor, but Asia-Pacific and other emerging markets are among the fastest growing. In these markets, rising incomes, urbanization, and exposure to Western dietary habits are encouraging greater cereal consumption. However, manufacturers are balancing growth with challenges such as raw material cost fluctuations, regulatory scrutiny (especially around sugar and nutrition labeling), and greater demand for sustainability - both in ingredient sourcing and packaging.

SWOT Analysis of Breakfast Cereals Market

B&G Foods Inc. Strength Analysis

Strong Brand Portfolio & Distribution Reach

A core strength of B&G Foods lies in its established portfolio of trusted brands and its wide distribution network. The company owns many recognizable food labels across categories like vegetables, snacks, sauces, and seasonings, giving it customer familiarity and loyalty. Because its brands are staples in many homes, B&G is less dependent on constantly creating new consumer awareness - once it launches or repositions a product, its existing recognition helps support uptake. Moreover, B&G Foods has solid relationships with major retailers and grocery chains, ensuring its products are available in many outlets. This reach and consistency give it scale advantages in purchasing, logistics, and marketing, helping it maintain competitiveness in shelf-stable and frozen food categories.

B&G Foods Inc. Opportunity Analysis

Health & Wellness Trends and Portfolio Upside

B&G Foods has significant opportunity by aligning its product mix more closely with rising health and wellness trends. Consumers are increasingly seeking foods with better-for-you profiles - less sugar, cleaner labels, more plant-based or organic ingredients - and this shift presents scope for the company to innovate and expand into these areas. By introducing or reformulating products (snacks, frozen foods, sauces) that cater to these preferences, B&G can capture new market segments and justify premium pricing. Additionally, increasing its presence in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels could help it reach younger, health-aware consumers. Strategic acquisitions in niche health-forward brands or investing in R&D for healthier offerings will strengthen its growth potential and make its portfolio more resilient.

TreeHouse Foods Strength Analysis

Deep Position in Private Label and Supply Chain Relationships

TreeHouse Foods has a strong positioning as a leader in private-label manufacturing, supplying a wide range of products like sauces, snacks, soups, and beverages to many major retailers. Their scale gives them manufacturing efficiencies, as well as cost leverage in procurement and facility operations. They maintain high customer retention and long-standing relationships with retailers that value reliable supply, flexibility, and quality. Also, their diversified portfolio across multiple food categories helps reduce vulnerability to weakness in any single segment. Their large network of manufacturing sites allows closer sourcing, reduced shipping costs, and better responsiveness to shifting retailer demands. All of this gives TreeHouse Foods a resilient foundation, particularly as many consumers seek value in their grocery purchases.

TreeHouse Foods Opportunity Analysis

Expanding "Better-for-You" and E-Commerce Channels

An important growth opportunity for TreeHouse Foods is to deepen its offerings in the "better-for-you" food segment and to strengthen its presence in e-commerce channels. As consumers increasingly demand healthier, organic, natural, non-GMO, or reduced sugar options, there's space for the company to release new formulations or product lines that cater to nutrition and wellness trends. At the same time, online grocery and direct-to-consumer retail are expanding rapidly. TreeHouse can partner with or develop capabilities in digital platforms and online retailers to reach consumers who value convenience. By investing in healthier products and modern distribution channels, TreeHouse can broaden its market, improve margins, and build stronger consumer loyalty in changing market conditions.

Packaged Food Market Overview, Insights & Potential

The packaged food is defined as the food that is generated by classifying unfrozen or frozen food in an airtight container, which can be directly cooked by heating in a microwave or kept in a refrigerator for a longer period. The packaged food is linked to elements such as consumption, convenient cooking, and safety from external tampering. The main elements that develop the growth of packaged food are updating the lifestyle, developing health awareness, and the convenience of consumption.

Packaging materials that are utilised for food should be easy to showcase, carry, open, and close the packaged food, which is categorized as having higher water content and lower water content.

Lower water content packaged food includes pastry, bread, cereal-based products, and butter, too.

High water content packaged food includes sauces, vegetables, cheese, eggs, and milk products, and integration.

A European Union/UK agreement on food exports designed to resolve problems in existing trade between Britain and Northern Ireland could come at too high a price, a former British minister for trade has warned.

Former Conservative minister Greg Hands told The Irish Times said he was “opposed” to an agreement where London would agree to align with EU regulations on sanitary and phytosanitary rules.

“I don’t think that is the right strategy for the UK. It’s not really in the UK’s interests. A lot of the Brussels food and drink regulations are quite stifling on innovation,” he said.

Negotiations on an SPS agreement are underway, with supporters arguing that it would remove most of the difficulties affecting GB/NI trade, which have irritated many Unionists.

However, Mr Hands said: “Why would the UK voluntarily and dynamically align with rules over which we have no say? It would kill off a lot of nascent things in the UK, like some of work done on GM.”

Former British Minister for Trade, Greg Hands seen here speaking at a conference in Dublin today

Hands, who twice served as Minister for Trade between 2016 and 2018 and later from 2020 to 2024, was in Dublin to speak at a conference on international trade held by law firm Byrne Wallace Shields.

He had doubts that an SPS agreement would remove all of the GB/NI hurdles that are being claimed for it: “It’s an arguable thing. Would it increase the demand in NI for Tesco sausages? I’m not sure it would.

“An agreement would make it easier and reduce paperwork and checks, but I doubt if it would get a whole new volume of trade between GB and NI. It would ease bureaucracy on existing trade, that’s my guess.”

The SPS negotiations could take up to two years, though European Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce he thought they could finish in one.

Saying he did not understand why such negotiations should take even that long, Mr Hands said the European Commission was “treating this as a massive concession on their part”.

In reality, London is ceding ground: “The UK, the second largest economy in Europe, is aligning to your food rules. That is a bonus for the Commission, but it is treating this as a concession,” he added.

Following Brexit, South African citrus exporters have been able to ship oranges and lemons to the UK, including Northern Ireland, without a plant health certificate, or the need for an inspection.

Since 2022, however, EU rules demand that South African exporters cool fruits to limit the spread of pests and disease, such as false codling moth and citrus black spot, and supply a phytosanitary certificate.

Now, the Commission is arguing that it may “withhold” the SPS agreement unless it is satisfied, said Mr Hands, who said the Irish Government could play a useful role “to urge pragmatism”.

He was not “downplaying” the risk posed by citrus fungal disease, but doubted if imports to Britain and Northern Ireland “where neither are citrus producers” could “imperil” the Iberian citrus industry.

The Irish Government has frequently “smoothed things over” when difficulties have emerged between London and Brussels, said Mr Hands, who now works with a Czech-based industrial group.

[TITLE]Earnings live: CoreWeave revenue boosted by AI boom, Paramount stock jumps, Occidental Petroleum falls:
[TEXT]
The greater part of third quarter earnings results are in the rearview mirror, though investors this week are looking to reports from CoreWeave (CRWV), The Walt Disney Company (DIS), and Alibaba (BABA).

So far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start. As of Nov. 7, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts are expecting a 13.1% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year.

Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30.

Source: FactSet

Last week, investors heard from tech and AI players such as Palantir (PLTR), AMD (AMD), Supermicro (SMCI), and Constellation Energy (CEG), as well as from Uber (UBER), Spotify (SPOT), Snap (SNAP), and Airbnb (ABNB).

This week, quarterly results arrive from The Walt Disney Company, Applied Materials (AMAT), CoreWeave, Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Rocket Lab (RKLB), Oklo (OKLO), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Alibaba (BABA), among others.

[TITLE]CLAR Q3 Deep Dive: Outdoor Apparel Growth and Margin Actions Amid Tariff Pressure:
[TEXT]
Outdoor lifestyle and equipment company Clarus (NASDAQ:CLAR) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2025, with sales up 3.3% year on year to $69.35 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.05 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

Is now the time to buy CLAR? Find out in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).

Clarus (CLAR) Q3 CY2025 Highlights:

Revenue: $69.35 million vs analyst estimates of $66.51 million (3.3% year-on-year growth, 4.3% beat)

Adjusted EPS: $0.05 vs analyst estimates of $0.06 (in line)

Adjusted EBITDA: $2.80 million vs analyst estimates of $2.70 million (4% margin, relatively in line)

Operating Margin: -4.4%, up from -8% in the same quarter last year

Market Capitalization: $124.8 million

StockStory’s Take

Clarus’ third quarter results drew a positive market response, as the company’s revenue growth exceeded Wall Street expectations while profitability metrics held steady. Management credited the performance to strong demand for outdoor products in North American wholesale, notable success with the revamped Black Diamond apparel line, and the onboarding of new adventure customers in Australia. Executive Chairman Warren Kanders highlighted that the company’s shift toward a more focused product mix, as well as reductions in discontinued merchandise and operational expenses, were central to the quarter’s incremental improvements.

Looking forward, Clarus’ leadership remains cautious due to persistent macroeconomic headwinds, ongoing tariff and currency impacts, and uncertainty in consumer sentiment. President of Diamond Equipment Neil Fiske pointed to further tariff mitigation plans, ongoing supply chain rebalancing, and a renewed emphasis on product innovation as key to future margin improvement. Fiske stated, “Our outlook is more cautious. Consumer sentiment remains low. Promotional activity seems to be on the rise as the broader market struggles to balance cash and working capital requirements.”

Key Insights from Management’s Remarks

Management attributed the quarter’s performance to a healthier revenue mix, focused cost control, and improvements in product and channel strategy, even as tariffs and FX losses weighed on margins.

[TITLE]Disney Store Revs Up F1 Partnership With First-Ever Racing-Inspired Merch and Apparel Collection:
[TEXT]
Disney is going full throttle into Formula 1. As part of the newly announced multi-year “Fuel the Magic” collaboration between the two global powerhouses, Disney Store is debuting its first F1-themed capsule collection this week — a 25-piece drop that blends the prestige of the motorsport with the legacy characters of Mickey & Friends.

Launching Nov. 8 online at DisneyStore.com and in person at the F1 Las Vegas Hub inside the Venetian Resort, the line serves as the first consumer product expression of the Disney-F1 deal, which will roll out across content, experiences and merchandise through the 2027 season.

Designed by Disney Consumer Products’ in-house team and led by Bobby Kim — the former Hundreds co-founder who now serves as VP of Creative — the collection adopts a red, black and white palette shared by both Mickey Mouse and Formula 1. Apparel, accessories and collectibles lean into racing cues: checkerboard trims reinterpreted as fashion accents, track-shaped graphics, athletic silhouettes and an aerodynamic, slightly edgier version of Mickey built specifically for this universe. “He was meant to look fast,” Kim tells Variety. “Not retro, not nostalgic — more sleek, more premium, more in line with the F1 aesthetic.”

That balance of heritage and futurism also appealed to Formula 1’s Las Vegas team. “This isn’t just merch — it’s an F1 lifestyle line,” Collette Gangemi, VP of Consumer Products for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, said in a statement. “We wanted the adrenaline and prestige of the sport, the neon energy of Vegas and the universal charm of Disney, all in one collection.”

The launch is timed to the sport’s splashiest U.S. stop: the Las Vegas Grand Prix, where Mickey & Friends will make an appearance during a special pit-lane walk for select grandstand ticket-holders. It’s one of several activations planned under the “Fuel the Magic” banner, a campaign Disney and F1 say is designed to bring fans “closer to the magic” through race-week programming, premium product and crossover storytelling.

“I’ve always admired F1 from afar,” Kim says. “But once you’re inside it, you understand: it’s rock-star-driven, high-stakes, global, fast — literally and metaphorically. And Disney, at its best, moves just as fast.”

SWOT Analysis of Unilever

Strength: Diverse and globally recognized brand portfolio

Unilever's greatest strength lies in its diverse and globally recognized brand portfolio. With over 400 brands - including household names like Dove, Knorr, Lipton, and Surf - Unilever enjoys widespread consumer trust across multiple sectors. This brand diversity allows it to operate successfully in over 190 countries and adapt quickly to changing market demands. Its billion-euro brands provide a strong revenue base and allow cross-leveraging of marketing, logistics, and innovation. This scale offers not only financial resilience but also the ability to drive impactful sustainability and health campaigns across the world. The sheer range of its offerings - from food to personal care - gives Unilever a significant competitive edge in both mature and emerging markets, insulating it from sector-specific disruptions.

Opportunity: Growing demand for health and wellness products

A key opportunity for Unilever is capitalizing on the growing demand for health and wellness products. Consumers worldwide are increasingly shifting toward plant-based, organic, and functional foods that support immunity, mental health, and overall well-being. Unilever is well-positioned to expand its presence in this space through innovation and acquisitions, especially in plant-based foods and vitamin-enriched personal care. Brands like Knorr and Hellmann's already have healthier product lines, and the company's investment in non-dairy ice cream and meat alternatives reflects this shift. As health-conscious lifestyles become mainstream - particularly among millennials and Gen Z - Unilever can build strong brand loyalty and increase its market share by offering credible, sustainable wellness solutions aligned with science and consumer ethics.

SWOT Analysis of Nestle

Strength: Global Brand Leadership and Product Diversification

Nestle's greatest strength lies in its status as the world's largest food and beverage company, with a highly diversified product portfolio spanning categories like coffee, dairy, baby nutrition, pet care, and health science. Its ownership of powerful, trusted global brands - such as Nescafe, Maggi, KitKat, and Purina - provides strong brand equity and consumer loyalty. This wide-ranging portfolio enables Nestle to weather market fluctuations and cater to diverse consumer needs across cultures and income levels. The company's consistent innovation and significant investment in R&D further solidify its leadership in both traditional and emerging product segments. This global presence and brand depth allow Nestle to maintain strong revenues and operational resilience in a highly competitive and evolving food industry.

Opportunity: Expanding Health and Nutrition Market

Nestle has a significant opportunity to lead in the rapidly growing health, wellness, and personalized nutrition sectors. Consumers are increasingly seeking functional foods, plant-based alternatives, and products with low sugar, high protein, or added health benefits. Nestle's Health Science division is already expanding its footprint in medical nutrition, supplements, and nutraceuticals, positioning the company to tap into the global shift toward preventive health. Additionally, Nestle's investment in plant-based innovations - such as dairy-free beverages and meat alternatives - aligns with both consumer demand and sustainability trends. By leveraging its global scale, scientific expertise, and trusted brand name, Nestle can accelerate growth in this high-potential segment and future-proof its portfolio against changing dietary and lifestyle preferences.

[TITLE]Costco's Sales Momentum Builds: What It Means for the Holiday Season:
[TEXT]
Costco Wholesale Corporation’s COST net sales grew 8.3% over the first nine weeks of fiscal 2026, reaching $48.33 billion, reflecting consistent shopper engagement and setting an optimistic tone for the holiday season. October’s performance showed an 8.6% increase in sales, driven by solid total comparable sales gains of 6.6%. The United States remained the main contributor with a 6.6% rise in comparable sales, while Canada and other international markets grew 6.3% and 7.2%, respectively.

Digitally enabled sales surged 21.6% during the nine weeks ended Nov. 2, 2025. This growth indicates that Costco has effectively captured the ongoing shift toward e-commerce and is not solely dependent on warehouse traffic. The company’s ability to leverage bulk purchasing and maintain an efficient supply chain allows it to offer competitive pricing.

Although last year’s October sales were negatively impacted by pull-forward activity related to Hurricane Helene and port strikes in September, current growth appears more organic, with stable underlying demand. This paints a promising outlook for a strong holiday quarter, assuming inflationary pressures and shifts in consumer spending patterns do not derail progress.

As the quarter progresses, focus will shift to basket sizes and category mix as consumers prioritize essentials and select discretionary items. The October and early-quarter sales data provide a positive outlook, as Costco enters the holiday season with strong momentum and a loyal customer base.

What the Latest Metrics Say About Costco

Costco, which competes with Dollar General Corporation DG and Target Corporation TGT, has seen its share decline 1.1% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 3.4%. While shares of Dollar General have rallied 30.1%, Target has dropped 40.5% in the aforementioned period.
