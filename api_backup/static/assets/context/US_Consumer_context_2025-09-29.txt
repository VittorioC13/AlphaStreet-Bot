Landmark acquisition accelerates growth with leading beverage portfolio and retail assets in Costa Rica, full ownership of HEINEKEN Panama, and expanded regional footprint

HEINEKEN has entered into binding agreements with its long-term partner FIFCO to acquire the remaining 75% of Distribuidora La Florida, as well as FIFCO stakes in certain other businesses.

The transaction will strengthen HEINEKEN’s position across attractive Central American growth markets which have large and expanding profit pools.

HEINEKEN gains ownership of a multi-category portfolio, including Costa Rica’s iconic century-old national beer Imperial and a major soft drink business with own brands and PepsiCo bottling licence.

Expanded regional presence with full ownership of HEINEKEN Panama, an equal partnership in Nicaragua’s leading beer and beyond beer business, and a diversified food and beverage operation in Guatemala.

Total cash consideration paid for the equity stakes acquired by HEINEKEN will be approximately US$3.2 billion, implying an acquisition multiple of 11.6x EV/EBITDA based on 2024 results.

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to operating margin and EPS (beia).

The transaction is subject to FIFCO shareholder and regulatory approvals. The deal has been approved unanimously by the board of directors of FIFCO, which includes representatives of FIFCO’s key shareholders. Completion is expected in H1 2026.

Amsterdam, 22 September 2025 – HEINEKEN N.V. (‘HEINEKEN’) today announced it has signed a binding agreement to acquire the multi-category beverage portfolio and proximity retail business of the Florida Ice and Farm Company S.A. (‘FIFCO’). This transaction builds on a long-standing partnership that began in 1986 and was strengthened in 2002 with the acquisition of a 25% stake in FIFCO's beverages business in Costa Rica, Distribuidora La Florida.

The deal further advances HEINEKEN’s EverGreen strategy, driving premiumisation, innovation, and growth across high-potential markets. Costa Rica will become one of HEINEKEN's top 5 operating companies by operating profit, expanding its presence with a diverse portfolio of beverage brands - including the iconic Imperial beer - and a well-established retail network.

The transaction also includes Panama, where HEINEKEN will acquire the remaining 25% of HEINEKEN Panama, securing full ownership of the country’s fastest-growing brewer. In addition, it further strengthens HEINEKEN’s regional presence through an equal partnership in Nicaragua’s market-leading beer and beyond beer company, as well as ownership of diversified food and beverage operations in Guatemala.

Upon completion, HEINEKEN will acquire the following FIFCO interests:

75% stake in Distribuidora La Florida, covering its beverages, food, and retail division - which includes more than 300 proximity retail outlets in Costa Rica (Musmanni & Musi) - and overall operations, extending into El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; FIFCO is exploring strategic alternatives for FIFCO USA.

75% stake in Nicaragua Brewing Holding, which holds a 49.85% indirect stake in Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua, Nicaragua’s leading beverage company.

25% minority interest in HEINEKEN Panama.

100% stake in FIFCO’s beyond beer business in Mexico.

Following completion, HEINEKEN and/or its affiliates will hold 100% ownership of Distribuidora La Florida, HEINEKEN Panama and FIFCO Mexico, and 49.85% of Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua. (See illustrative shareholding structure attached).

HEINEKEN Chairman of the Executive Board and Chief Executive Officer, Dolf van den Brink:

“Today marks a transformative milestone for HEINEKEN as we join forces with FIFCO to unlock new growth opportunities. By integrating FIFCO’s iconic brands, deep market expertise, and exemplary sustainability credentials, we are accelerating our EverGreen strategy and entering new profit pools across Central America. This partnership is grounded in decades of shared values and trust, providing a robust foundation for long-term value creation. I am excited to welcome FIFCO's talented team, and am confident that our shared strengths - HEINEKEN’s global best practices and FIFCO’s unmatched local knowhow - will drive excellence and deliver exceptional growth for our employees, customers, and stakeholders throughout the region.”

FIFCO Chairman of the Board, Wilhelm Steinvorth:

“This agreement honours FIFCO’s legacy and brings complementary strengths that expand the organisation’s capabilities, operational reach, and future potential. FIFCO and HEINEKEN have shared a successful long-term partnership, built on strategic alignment, shared values, and a deep commitment to sustainability. Today, we are proud to take this step forward with an admired company that respects our cultural identity and offers a global platform for our iconic brands - like Imperial - to thrive and evolve.”

Strategic rationale

The transaction builds on HEINEKEN's current exposure to attractive Central American growth markets which enjoy large and growing profit pools. Distribuidora La Florida and Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua are both strategically positioned as market-leading multi-category beverage businesses with strong margins, rivalling global best-in-class benchmarks.

Costa Rica benefits from stable macro fundamentals, including a strong currency, growing population, and approximately 3% real GDP per capita growth.

The beverage categories (beer, beyond beer, soft drinks) are among the largest and fastest-growing consumer categories in Central America, with the acquired portfolio expected to deliver solid volume growth.

Consolidating the multi-category beverage leader in Costa Rica: Well-established market leadership in beer (approximately 2.0 million hl), supported by iconic local and international brands, and an unparalleled route-to-consumer model. Leading pan-regional beyond beer portfolio (approximately 0.5 million hl) across multiple brands with leading brand power. Second largest soft drinks player (approximately 2.5 million hl), producing its own brands, such as Tropical, and being the bottling licensee for PepsiCo. The transaction will strengthen HEINEKEN's existing relationship with PepsiCo. Well-positioned adjacent businesses including wines and spirits distribution, staple foods, and a retail business with more than 300 proximity outlets.

HEINEKEN gains full ownership of HEINEKEN Panama, one of the leading brewers growing approximately 20% CAGR (2019–2024) with year-over-year market share gains.

Expansion of HEINEKEN’s footprint in Central America: Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua holds a leading beer and beyond beer portfolio with a fully integrated water and soft drinks operations, and a retail business with more than 250 proximity outlets. A food and soft drinks platform in Guatemala, and a portfolio of fast-growing beyond beer brands in Mexico.

Under HEINEKEN’s ownership, the Costa Rica business is expected to unlock revenue and cost synergies through the application of HEINEKEN's best practices across commercial execution, logistics and brewery operations.

Financial impact for HEINEKEN

Total cash consideration paid for the equity stakes acquired by HEINEKEN will be approximately US$3.2 billion implying an acquisition multiple of 11.6x EV/EBITDA based on 2024 results.

Distribuidora La Florida, which was previously accounted for as investment in associate with results reported under share of net profit/loss from associates, will be consolidated. 2024 results reported under local accounting policies amount to: Net Revenue of US$1,132m, EBITDA of US$334m and Operating Profit of US$278m (excluding FIFCO USA).

The 49.85% ownership stake in Compañía Cervecera de Nicaragua will be accounted for as investment in associates and joint ventures and the results will be treated as share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures.

The acquisition of the 25% minority interest in HEINEKEN Panama will reduce HEINEKEN's non-controlling interest in HEINEKEN Panama to zero.

Run-rate cost savings of approximately US$50 million are anticipated through the application of HEINEKEN’s proven best practices.

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to operating margin and EPS (beia).

Post-transaction, HEINEKEN’s Net Debt is expected to increase by €3.2 billion and HEINEKEN's pro-forma Net Debt / EBITDA (beia) ratio is expected to increase modestly. HEINEKEN remains committed to return to its long-term target of below 2.5x.

HEINEKEN will continue to make progress on the previously announced share buy-back programme of €1.5 billion which is not affected by the proposed transaction.

Driving sustainable economic development across Central America

In line with its EverGreen strategy, HEINEKEN is deeply committed to driving long-term, sustainable growth across its operations. Through its Brew a Better World programme, it has set ambitious goals to deliver positive environmental and social impact. Recognising the strong complementarities with FIFCO’s programme and its embedded ESG strategy (FIFCO Sostenibilidad Expansiva), HEINEKEN will continue to invest in sustainable economic development and promoting responsible consumption throughout the region.

Next steps

Completion of the transaction between HEINEKEN and FIFCO is subject to customary regulatory approvals and the approval by the general shareholders’ meeting of FIFCO, which will take place in October 2025. The transaction is expected to be completed in H1 2026.

The deal has been approved unanimously by the board of directors of FIFCO, which includes representatives of FIFCO's key shareholders.

Further announcements will be made as and when appropriate. HEINEKEN and FIFCO will work closely together towards the completion of the transaction, ensuring a smooth integration, with a joint focus on continuity for employees, customers, and partners.

[TITLE]From PepsiCo to Taco Bell, dirty soda is taking over:
[TEXT]
In this article PEP Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Utah-based drink chain Swig coined "dirty soda" back in 2010. Fifteen years later, the trend is fueling innovation everywhere from PepsiCo to McDonald's , infusing the sluggish beverage category with new life. "Dirty soda" drinks use pop as a base, followed by flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients. While Swig claims credit — and the trademark — for dirty soda, TikTok videos and the reality TV show "The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives" have helped the trend spread far and wide, outpacing even the soda chain's speedy expansion. Now, consumers can find it nearly everywhere, from grocery store aisles to fast-food chains. In a few weeks, Pepsi plans to unveil two ready-to-drink dirty soda-inspired beverages at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show in Chicago. The new drinks, the Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, follow on the heels of the Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, which hit shelves earlier this year. "I think it's a great opportunity for people like us, like PepsiCo, and for consumers to experience soda in a new way — and in some ways, an old way," Pepsi Beverages North America Chief Marketing Officer Mark Kirkham told CNBC, comparing the rise of dirty soda to root beer floats and the soda shops of yore.

Dirty soda has also drawn new interest beyond beverage players. According to Datassential, 2.7% of U.S. eateries offer a carbonated soft drink that includes cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago. Newcomers to the trend include TGI Fridays, which launched dirty soda as a limited-time menu item this summer that could be spiked with alcohol. McDonald's is testing flavored sodas, like a "Sprite Lunar Splash," at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. Yum Brands' Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.

Swig sets a trend

These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum. "I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee," Swig CEO Alex Dunn said. As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like Dutch Bros. , have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon. "It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations," Dunn said. "It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying." For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound. "It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine," said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. "Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house." On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks. "The espresso world — that's so much more complicated," Holland-Toll said. Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's "much more accessible" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video. But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty. "It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. "It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'"

A pop for beverage companies

A "fun treat" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S. As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.

[TITLE]Why More Businesses are Nearshoring and Reshoring:
[TEXT]
Global trade in 2025 is a moving target. With tariffs shifting overnight, de minimis disappearing, and geopolitical tensions rising, the global supply chain is volatile. For leaders, the real question isn’t whether to adjust strategy, but how quickly they can move. The thing is, navigating these turbulent waters and constant changes is much easier said than done.

While the end goal of ramping up U.S. production is positive, the pain points of making decisions and adjusting logistics operations are not. That said, the needle is slowly moving toward more businesses bringing their supply chains closer to home—both nearshoring and reshoring in the hopes of driving efficiency and cost savings within a rapidly changing industry.

The shift toward closer supply chains

Since the trade and tariff announcements from both the Biden and Trump administrations in 2024, companies have begun to look in earnest at the best course of action regarding their supply chain operations.

That said, it’s not a new conversation. The pandemic and lingering effects of COVID-19, rising global wages, and higher sustainability expectations opened the reshoring and nearshoring conversation several years ago.

Nearshoring : moving operations to nearby countries

: moving operations to nearby countries Reshoring: bringing production back to domestic markets

Fueled by new fire, the conversation is gaining traction yet again. Both manufacturers and retailers are looking for ways to reduce their risk, improve resilience, shorten lead times, and, of course, mitigate the impact of tariffs. Shifting manufacturing and retail supply chains closer to home can help make that happen.

The drivers behind nearshoring and reshoring

Before a business makes a supply chain shift, it’s essential to look at the full range of factors that influence the decision to nearshore and reshore. According to an article by Deloitte, they can be categorized into three types: quantitative, qualitative, and risk-related.

Global disruptions

For many, global disruptions are the most visible catalyst. Between the pandemic, global conflicts, and evolving trade policies, the global supply chain feels fragile and fraught with landmines. Add in rising shipping costs, labor shortages, weather and natural disasters, and port issues, and it’s not surprising that many businesses are rethinking their reliance on global sourcing and operations.

Customer expectations

Lead time and customer expectations have also had an influence. Today’s shoppers want fast shipping, with 86% of consumers describing “fast” as within two days. The same survey found that 80% of consumers expect retailers to offer same-day delivery; among them, 30% expect free same-day delivery. This puts pressure on retailers to have faster, more reliable fulfillment. Nearshoring and reshoring position production and inventory closer to end markets, strengthening the ability to respond to shifts in demand and cutting weeks off delivery schedules.

Risk and control

Risk management and control also play a role in the decision to nearshore or reshore. The goal is to reduce dependence on suppliers across oceans, which can help improve accountability and quality assurance. Anytime a business can mitigate exposure to risk outside of the company’s control, it reinforces stability and business continuity.

Strategic advantages of nearshoring and reshoring

While the broad advantages of nearshoring and reshoring are straightforward, there are additional, nuanced benefits for manufacturers and retailers.

For manufacturers:

Greater control over production: Closer collaboration with suppliers and factories.

Closer collaboration with suppliers and factories. Improved quality standards: Easier oversight and faster problem-solving.

Easier oversight and faster problem-solving. Innovation agility: Faster prototyping, iteration, and scaling.

Faster prototyping, iteration, and scaling. Regulatory alignment: Simplified compliance with U.S. and regional standards.

For retailers:

Lower transportation costs: Less reliance on long ocean or air freight.

Less reliance on long ocean or air freight. Faster fulfillment: Shortened replenishment cycles keep shelves and online inventories stocked.

Shortened replenishment cycles keep shelves and online inventories stocked. Omnichannel support: More agile response to shifts in demand between ecommerce and retail channels.

More agile response to shifts in demand between ecommerce and retail channels. Customer loyalty: Meeting ecommerce customer expectations for fast delivery strengthens brand experience.

The new equation: Cost vs. value

Most businesses aren’t under the illusion that nearshoring and reshoring are a perfect (or swift) solution. However, there is a growing movement that sees it isn’t

[TITLE]GameGuard Joins Forces with Killara Outdoors in Landmark Acquisition Shaping the Next Era of Outdoor Apparel:
[TEXT]
Southlake, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SOUTHLAKE, TX September 23, 2025 - -

Killara Outdoors, the pioneering operator-led brand growth platform, today announced its acquisition of GameGuard Outdoors, the legendary Texas-born outdoor apparel company renowned for its Southwest-inspired camouflage and field-tested gear. The strategic acquisition marks a powerful new chapter for two celebrated Texas brands, joining operational muscle and deep-rooted heritage to unlock fresh innovation, scale, and reach.

"GameGuard represents the heart and soul of the Southwest outdoor experience. We're humbled that Craig and the team have entrusted their legacy to Killara," said Chris Macaulay, CEO of Killara Outdoors. "Our promise is simple: preserve everything that makes GameGuard iconic, while unlocking new levels of operational excellence, retail reach, and storytelling. This is how you build enduring brands, in partnership, honoring founders, and never losing sight of what makes the community tick."

Founded in Argyle, Texas, by Craig and his late wife Stacy Smith, GameGuard has become a staple among guides, hunters, outfitters, and outdoor families, earning national recognition for durable, innovative designs and its trademark camo patterns inspired by the Southwest's rugged landscape - mesquite, yucca, cactus, and Texas brush. With its trusted technical fabrics and devoted following, GameGuard has built a robust retail presence, now available in more than 2,000 stores across the country.

"We built GameGuard as a family, with our faith, customers, and Texas roots as our guide," said Smith. "As we looked toward the next chapter, finding a partner who respects our DNA and is committed to our people was non-negotiable. Killara brings not just resources, but real-world experience and a respect for legacy. I'm proud to know GameGuard's spirit is in good hands."

Distinguishing itself from traditional corporate acquirers, Killara Outdoors is known for its founder-centric, operator-first approach. The leadership teams both committed that GameGuard's identity and design vision will remain firmly intact, while Killara deploys its operational horsepower to accelerate growth and deepen community engagement.

"GameGuard is that rare brand - instantly recognizable, regionally authentic, and beloved by outdoor enthusiasts nationwide," said Paul Albrecht, President and Chief Strategy Officer of Killara Outdoors. "Our job is to ensure Craig's vision thrives as we help expand the brand's reach and scale their operations. Customers and retailers can expect the same GameGuard spirit and commitment to quality - but in more places and for more seasons."

Karyn McKenna, Killara's Chief Supply Chain Officer, added, "The GameGuard team has built an incredibly robust operation over the last 23 years. We're excited to build upon that great foundation with Killara's logistics and operational expertise. Fans and retailers can expect more frequent product launches, more variety, and the same industry-leading quality, backed by a robust, scalable supply chain."

Effective immediately, GameGuard will continue operating with its core team and signature products, further supported by near-term investments in inventory, retailer support, digital engagement, and limited-edition capsule releases. Looking ahead, the partnership aims to broaden GameGuard's national expansion, accelerate technical innovation, and double down on service to the Southwest's passionate outdoor community.

"This is about operational lift, not loss of soul," said Macaulay. "Our goal: Make GameGuard even more available, reliable, and exciting - without losing a bit of what makes it uniquely Southwest."
