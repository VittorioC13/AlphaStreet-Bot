[TITLE]Can Advisor Departures and Legal Disputes Reshape LPL Financial’s (LPLA) Retention and Growth Narrative?:
[TEXT]
In recent days, LPL Financial Holdings has seen multiple advisor teams depart for competitors and is now facing a lawsuit from First Tech Federal Credit Union alleging misappropriation of trade secrets related to approximately US$520 million in client assets.

This series of departures and legal challenges has increased market focus on LPL's advisor retention and the operational risks associated with advisor transitions.

We'll examine how heightened advisor movement and legal scrutiny could influence LPL Financial Holdings' expected advisor growth and retention outlook.

These 10 companies survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs. Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch.

LPL Financial Holdings Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in LPL Financial Holdings, you need confidence in the firm’s ability to drive advisor growth, maintain strong client asset inflows, and leverage technology amid a consolidating industry. Recent advisor departures and a lawsuit alleging misappropriation of trade secrets have put short-term focus on LPL's advisor retention, posing a near-term risk to its advisor growth catalyst. However, unless departures become more frequent or legal issues materially disrupt ongoing business, these events do not currently appear to affect the core, long-term growth drivers discussed by most analysts.

Against this backdrop, LPL's recent onboarding of US$12 billion in assets from First Horizon Bank stands out, underscoring its continued momentum in attracting significant institutional assets. While this development adds to the firm's growth story, it also highlights how the ability to rapidly integrate new assets and relationships is central to offsetting any pressures from advisor attrition or transitions between platforms. Yet, contrasting this positive inflow, investors should be aware that …

LPL Financial Holdings' outlook projects $23.0 billion in revenue and $1.9 billion in earnings by 2028. This implies an 18.7% annual revenue growth and an increase in earnings of $0.8 billion from the current $1.1 billion.

Uncover how LPL Financial Holdings' forecasts yield a $424.79 fair value, a 26% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

LPLA Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025

Three fair value opinions from the Simply Wall St Community for LPL range from US$424.79 to US$483.69, reflecting a wide variety of investor expectations. While these diverse perspectives suggest significant potential on both sides, keep in mind that advisor retention risks could influence LPL's outlook more rapidly than anticipated by many market participants.

[TITLE]Exane BNP Paribas Starts Tesla (TSLA) at Underperform With $307 Price Target:
[TEXT]
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching Closely. On October 16, Exane BNP Paribas initiated the stock as “Underperform” and a price target of $307.00. The firm said it can’t justify the stock’s valuation.

Exane BNP Paribas’s valuation model incorporates Tesla’s artificial intelligence ventures, including Robotaxi and Optimus robot businesses. Even though these businesses currently generate no revenue, they are inflating Tesla’s valuation by accounting for an estimated 75% of their $1.02 trillion price target valuation.

Even with ambitious forecasts, Tesla’s risk/reward is unfavorable, it noted. Moreover, the 2026 cash flow is projected $4B below consensus, driven by margin and AI/software pressures.

“We are bullish on Tesla’s AI future, reflected in our quite generous base-case assumptions that see TSLA hitting over half of Elon’s 2035 $1trn comp package targets. But we still can’t justify the stock’s current valuation.”

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives.

While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Regulator Wants to Defund Investor Who Rejects Companies that Import H-1B Workers:
[TEXT]
A Wall Street trustee group wants to kill a new $40 million investment fund that refuses to invest in the companies who import risky H-1B visa workers to take jobs from trustworthy American professionals.

“They’re shutting down the fund,” James Fishback, founder of the Azoria investment fund, told Breitbart News. He continued:

There is no exit strategy. They’re not letting us transfer the assets to another entity. This is a death penalty, a debanking. First they came for President Trump’s [bank] accounts, then they came for the accounts of his family members and close friends, and now they’re coming for the investment firms … that say that they do not want to invest in companies that fund the great replacement of American workers.

Fishback has asked Paul Atkins, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to stop the delisting process pending an investigation of the trustee group’s intention.

The Wall Street pushback comes amid growing evidence that C-Suite executives divert Americans’ jobs to Indian H-1B workers because stock investors assume the mixed-skill, indentured visa workers will raise profits and boost stock values, regardless of their vast damage to productivity, security, and quality.

“If you’re outsourcing all of your [Information Technology] to a third-party [run by Indians], Wall Street interprets it as cost savings,” said Nate Sass, a Wisconsin-based technology veteran who was replaced by an Indian team in February 2025. He told Breitbart News:

The stock price goes up, but he fact of the matter is, there are no actual cost savings because what comes out of India is of such poor quality that on the best day, it takes twice as long and just as much money to execute a project that way as it would with domestic American labor. But because of the way that they can bookkeep things, [the extra expense and quality damage] is all hidden.

Top executives support the counterproductive outsourcing strategy because it helps them extract value from the shareholders, Sass said:

The reason that executives and the C-level do that is that they’re all compensated by stock, compensated in cash. Their only incentive in every quarter is to make the stock go up. Right now, they will do anything and everything they can to make Wall Street happy, no matter how bad the decision is in the long run, as long as it’s good for the next three months.

Breitbart News has extensively covered companies’ use of the allegedly nepotistic, fraud-ridden, criminal, discriminatory, incompetent, costly, and counterproductive H-1B program.

The huge inflow of foreign graduates into white-collar careers is also wrecking American-style professionalism, corporate innovation, citizens’ privacy, regulatory enforcement, and the federal government’s alleged national security priorities. Increasingly, American professionals are speaking up — and are using their hard-earned familiarity with the visa worker system to expose the mass replacement of American graduates,

For example, executives transferred Sass’s job to a supposedly cheaper Indian outsourcing team even though he quickly built an award-winning “Accounts Receivable” software program for his employer:

I designed it from the ground up, a clean sheet of paper. The entire AR process went live inside of a year, on budget, … It supports the payment processes today. It transacts a billion and a half dollars in premiums a month. There have been zero critical issues … [and the maintenance cost is] $30,000 to $40,000 a year. [If outsourced Indian teams were] writing this program, not only is it “crap on time” and way overpriced, it is just generally not worth a red cent [and] every time that it [fails], pardon my French, you would have now deal with all the customers that you screwed out of [monthly subscription] money to make them whole.

Breitbart asked Fishback to explain his $40 million investment fund:

So in July, my investment firm Azoria, launched what is called the Azoria meritocracy [Exchange Traded Fund] ETF. We launched that in July, and the premise to that fund was we would only invest in companies that are committed to meritocracy. So we would exclude 38 companies that had explicit DEI racial quotas [such as] Starbucks, Intel, Airbnb, Nike, among others … Then on October 6, we wrote [to] our [trustee] board [at Tidal Trust III] and asked them to approve our change to exclude companies that replace American workers with foreign H1Bs from India and China.

The Tidal Trust III board serves as a government-approved trustee for many funds in the chaotic stock market. The purpose is to provide small investors wth some protection against shady stock-sellers.

Fishback described the October 15 response:

They didn’t just say no, as in “We are not going to let you update your fund to exclude the H-1B abuse.” [They said] “We are going to shut down your fund altogether. So the $40 million of assets, the tens of thousands of investors that you have in your fund, they are going to be liquidated, and your fund is going to be delisted in mid December,” and they filed that with the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.

“The Chief Operating Officer and president [of Tidal], Eric Falkeis …. said this [opposition to H1Bs] was unethical,” Fishback said.

Fishback continued:

This morning, I asked SEC Chairman Paul Atkins to step in to immediately halt the delisting of our fund pending an investigation into this board for violating their fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders. They have that’s the only job they have …Their job is not to make political judgments or ideological retaliation. Their job is to look out for the shareholders.

Reuters reported on October 16: “The [trustee] board said in the filing it made the decision after ‘considering all relevant information, including without limitation recent litigation involving a principal of’ Azoria, wording that analysts said is highly unusual.”

Fishback said he has asked staffers working for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to intervene: “Bessent doesn’t have statutory authority here [but] folks in the administration have a bully pulpit … They can decide to halt this liquidation.”

His stance against corporate reliance on H-1Bs matches the pro-automation policy pushed by Trump and JD Vance, Fishback said.

“We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” he told Breitbart News in September, adding:

We don’t enough people to do it. So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically … It’s going to be big. Then, somebody is going to have to make the robots. The whole thing, it feeds on itself … we’re going to streamline things. We need efficiency.

The promise of cheap labor is ”a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vance told an audience of investors in March.

Trump and his deputies are showcasing the huge scale of visa migration and the strategic alternative of greater productivity. On September 19, for example, Trump signed a proclamation saying:

Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens … with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time. Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2019. And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa.

“Abuses of the H-1B program present a national security threat by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology, risking American leadership in these fields,” the proclamation said.

Trump also imposed a $100,000 fee on some H-1B arrivals.

“President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers wrote in a statement. “Americans have many reasons to celebrate this unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap, foreign labor.”

“Automation makes sense,” Fishback told Breitbart News. “But what’s happening now is … You’ve got 50,000 accounting graduates every single year … [yet] companies like Deloitte and Accenture, who employ entry-level accountants, are using H-1Bs for those roles.”

Big Tech is paying millions to train teachers on AI, in a push to bring chatbots into classrooms

AP News ^ | Updated 11:04 PM CDT, October 16, 2025 | JOCELYN GECKER

Posted on by E. Pluribus Unum

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day’s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.

After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: “Are we going to be replaced with AI?”

That remains to be seen. But for the nation’s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world’s largest technology companies. The two groups don’t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.

Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country’s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.

AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.

“There is no one else who is helping us with this. That’s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,” Weingarten said. “We went to them — they didn’t come to us.”

Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an “agnostic” approach that means any company’s AI tools could be used in a training session.

Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources,...

A live teacher, who can read the emotions of the students and tailor their lessons accordingly, will always be needed. They can see who is understanding the lesson and who needs the teacher to come at it from another angle. This AI crap is quite dangerous, and no substitute for a human teacher. Retired teacher here.

The teachers unions are all in on doing no work, passing it all onto AI and other stuff, teaching to the lowest common denominator so the work they do is as easy as possible and everyone gets good test scores so they never have to worry about their own standing. And the kids? Come on, the last thing they're thinking about. Didn't you learn that from COVID when they refused to teach kids and when they did finally grudgingly come back they insisted on masks and social distancing long after COVID was really an issue, and left those kids trapped with lingering developmental issues? Yeah, that happened and it shows who they care about: themselves, only themselves.

[TITLE]Devs working on Hearthstone and Warcraft Rumble join 1900 other Activision Blizzard staff in unionising:
[TEXT]
Workers in Blizzard's Hearthstone and Warcraft Rumble teams have voted to unionise with the Communications Workers of America.

Over 100 software engineers, designers, artists, quality assurance testers, and producers voted to join the CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, California, joining 1900+ other Activision Blizzard employees who have similarly chosen to unionise. Parent company Microsoft has reportedly recognised the union.

"My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals," said organising committee member and game designer Dominic Calkosz. "We chose to organise in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity which the industry cannot ignore."

The move comes shortly after CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. met with workers at Blizzard's Irvine campus to "celebrate the growing wave of organising across the industry" as unionised staff across Activision Blizzard joined the World of Warcraft Bargaining Committee "for a solidarity walk as contract negotiations continued".

Eurogamer recently spoke to members of Blizzard's story and franchise development team about their union, discussing their demands from Microsoft.

Earlier this week, EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union issued a statement against the proposed private acquisition of the company, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets". Eurogamer also spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition.

[TITLE]Trump admits China tariff threats ‘not sustainable’ as trade tensions persist:
[TEXT]
President Trump said his threatened high tariffs on Chinese goods are “not sustainable,” even as his administration presses ahead with sweeping trade penalties against Beijing in a deepening tariff standoff.

“It’s not sustainable,” Trump told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures,” when asked whether the massive levies could remain in place without hitting the US economy.

“But that’s what the number is, it’s probably not, you know, it could stand, but they forced me to do that.”

5 President Trump said his threatened high tariffs on Chinese goods are “not sustainable.” Trump is seen with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. AP

Trump also sounded a more conciliatory note in his Friday interview with Bartiromo, particularly in light of reports that the president threatened to cancel a planned meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.

“I get along great with him,” Trump said of Xi. “I think we’re going to be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal. It’s got to be fair.”

The president’s remarks came as Washington and Beijing face the steepest trade confrontation in years — with US import taxes on Chinese products climbing as high as 145% in a tit-for-tat exchange that has rattled global markets.

Trump’s latest tariff pause — a 90-day truce set to expire Nov. 10 — has kept those duties on hold while both sides attempt to reach new terms.

But with China expanding export controls on rare earth minerals and the US announcing fresh restrictions on Chinese shipping, the path to a deal remains uncertain.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business on Friday that he had “high confidence” Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “are going to be able to get together with the Chinese and get this back to a place that’s good for both countries.”

The comments followed Trump’s threat last week to impose a new 100% tariff on all Chinese goods by Nov. 1.

The remarks marked a notable shift from earlier in the week, when Trump signaled on Truth Social that tensions could escalate.

The markets plunged last week after Trump threatened to impose new levies on China. Reaction from Wall Street apparently prompted the president to put out a more conciliatory message to calm jittery investors.

Over the past three years, Washington has claimed broad power to impose global rules that bar companies anywhere in the world from sending cutting-edge computer chips or the tools needed to make them to China. U.S. officials have argued that approach is necessary to make sure China does not gain the upper hand in the race for advanced artificial intelligence.But a sweeping set of restrictions announced by Beijing last week showed that two can play that game.The Chinese government flexed its own influence over worldwide supply chains when it announced new rules clamping down on the flow of critical minerals that are used in everything from computer chips to cars to missiles. The rules, which are set to take effect later this year, shocked foreign governments and businesses, which may now need to acquire licenses from Beijing to trade their products even outside China.With its dominance over the production of these rare earth minerals and its control of other strategic industries, China may have an even greater ability than the United States to weaponize supply chains, analysts say."The U.S. now has to face up to the fact it has an adversary which can threaten substantial parts of the U.S. economy," said Henry Farrell, a political scientist at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. The United States and China are now very clearly "in a much more delicate stage of mutual interdependence," he added."China has really begun to figure out how to take a leaf from the U.S. playbook and in a certain sense play that game better than the U.S. is currently playing it," Farrell said.China's move has rekindled tensions between the world's two largest economies, with President Donald Trump threatening to increase already substantial tariffs on Chinese imports by imposing an additional 100% tax on Nov. 1 unless Beijing backs down from its new restrictions.The type of supply chain restriction that China is embarking on first came into play in 2020. Washington dusted off an obscure provision known as the foreign direct product rule to target Chinese tech giant Huawei, which the U.S. government considered a national security threat. But instead of restricting American technology exports just to Huawei, the United States said any company anywhere in the world could not ship a product to Huawei if it contained U.S. parts or was made with U.S. equipment or software.Because of the United States' key role in the global chipmaking industry, the rules basically encompassed all advanced technology. It was a broad exertion of U.S. economic power that became the basis of a series of global tech rules during the Biden administration. Although foreign governments chafed at being told what to do, many cooperated for fear of being cut off from U.S. technology.The question now is: Will the Chinese restrictions persuade the Trump administration to walk back its tariffs or long-standing technology restrictions, or will China's government fold under pressure first?The administration seemed caught off guard by China's restrictions, which could cripple American industries. Trump threatened on Friday to cancel a planned meeting with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, as well as adding a 100% tariff. After stock markets plunged, the president posted on social media on Sunday, "Don't worry

[TITLE]China has found Trump's pain point - rare earths:

China has found Trump's pain point - rare earths

3 days ago Share Save Osmond Chia Business reporter Share Save

Reuters

Last week, China's Ministry of Commerce published a document that went by the name of "announcement No. 62 of 2025". But this wasn't just any bureaucratic missive. It has rocked the fragile tariffs truce with the US. The announcement detailed sweeping new curbs on its rare earth exports, in a move that tightens Beijing's grip on the global supply of the critical minerals - and reminded Donald Trump just how much leverage China holds in the trade war. China has a near-monopoly in the processing of rare earths - crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets. Under the new rules, foreign companies now need the Chinese government's approval to export products that contain even a tiny amount of rare earths and must declare their intended use. In response, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods and put export controls on key software. "This is China versus the world. They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to have it," said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. On Thursday, China said the US had "deliberately provoked unnecessary misunderstanding and panic" over the rare earths restrictions. "Provided the export licence applications are compliant and intended for civilian use, they will be approved," a commerce ministry spokesperson added. This week, the world's two biggest economies also imposed new port fees on each other's ships. The flare-up in the trade war brings to an end months of relative calm after top US and Chinese officials brokered a truce in May. Later this month, Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are expected to meet and experts have told the BBC the rare earths restrictions will give China the upper hand. China's new controls are bound to "shock the system" as they target vulnerabilities in American supply chains, said international business lecturer Naoise McDonagh from Australia's Edith Cowan University. "The timing has really upset the kind of timeline for negotiations that the Americans wanted," he added.

Getty Images Rare earth minerals are crucial for the production of fighter jets like the F-35

Rare earth minerals are essential for the production of a whole range of technology such as solar panels, electric cars and military equipment. For example, a single F-35 fighter jet is estimated to need more than 400kg (881.8lb) of rare earths for its stealth coatings, motors, radars and other components. China's rare earth exports also account for around 70% of the world's supply of metals used for magnets in electric vehicle motors, said Natasha Jha Bhaskar from advisory firm the Newland Global Group. Beijing has worked hard to gain its dominance of the global rare earth processing capacity, said critical minerals researcher Marina Zhang from the University of Technology Sydney. The country has nurtured a vast talent pool in the field, while its research and development network is years ahead of its competitors, she added. While the US and other countries are investing heavily to develop alternatives to China for supplies of rare earths, they are still some way from achieving that goal. With its own large deposits of rare earths, Australia has been tipped as a potential challenger to China. But its production infrastructure is still underdeveloped, making processing relatively expensive, Ms Zhang said. "Even if the US and all its allies make processing rare earths a national project, I would say that it will take at least five years to catch up with China."

The new restrictions expand measures Beijing announced in April that caused a global supply crunch, before a series of deals with Europe and the US eased the shortages. The latest official figures from China show that exports of the critical minerals were down in September by more than 30% compared to a year ago. But analysts say China's economy is unlikely to be hurt by the drop in exports. Rare earths make up a very small part of China's $18.7tn a year economy, said Prof Sophia Kalantzakos from New York University. Some estimates put the value of the exports at less than 0.1% of China's annual gross domestic product (GDP). While rare earths' economic value to China may be tiny their strategic value "is huge", she said, as they give Beijing more leverage in talks with the US. Despite accusing China of "betrayal", Bessent has left the door open to negotiations. "I believe China is open to discussion and I am optimistic this can be de-escalated," he said. During a meeting with the US private equity group Blackstone's chief executive Stephen Schwarzman on Thursday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also highlighted the need for talks. "The two sides should engage in effective communication, properly resolve differences and promote stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations," Wang said, according to the ministry's website. What China has done recently is "getting its ducks in a row" ahead of those trade talks with the US, said Prof Kalantzakos. In curbing rare earth exports, Beijing has found its "best immediate lever" to pressure Washington for a favourable deal, Ms Bhaskar said.

[TITLE]Bangladesh Spectrum Auction Uncertain - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
Bangladesh Plans 700 MHz Spectrum Auction: What it Means for 4G and 5G Expansion

Exciting news for the telecommunications sector in Bangladesh! The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) is reportedly gearing up to auction 700 MHz spectrum early next year. This move could significantly impact the expansion of 4G and 5G services across the country.

According to reports, the BTRC aims to make 45 MHz of spectrum available in the 703- to 803-MHz range by January 2026. This potential spectrum auction is designed to empower telecom companies to enhance their existing 4G network capacity and accelerate the rollout of 5G coverage. This will mean faster internet speeds and more reliable mobile connectivity for consumers and businesses alike.

However, a legal hurdle exists. A portion of the 700 MHz spectrum is currently tied up in a legal dispute between the BTRC and a broadband provider, AlwaysOn Network Bangladesh Ltd. This company holds 12 MHz of spectrum in that band. The dispute stems from a 2007 allocation of the 700 MHz spectrum to AlwaysOn, which was later revoked by the BTRC. The case is currently under appeal, and the outcome could influence the amount of spectrum ultimately offered in the auction. This legal challenge could impact the interest from mobile operators.

The BTRC has already applied to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to proceed with the auction. Their current plan involves offering at least 25 MHz of the 700 MHz spectrum in January. If AlwaysOn loses its appeal, the BTRC could potentially offer the full 45 MHz. The success of this spectrum auction is crucial for telecom operators to meet the growing demand for high-speed data.

Leading telecoms like Grameenphone, Robi Axiata, and Banglalink reportedly hope that the regulator releases the entire 45 MHz block for auction. These mobile operators are eager to acquire more bandwidth. Furthermore, the potential bidders are reportedly concerned

[TITLE]Broadband forum cautions DoT against flawed parity between satcom and mobile services:
[TEXT]
Industry body Broadband India Forum (BIF) has asked the highest policy-making body of the Department of Telecommunications, the Digital Communications Commission (DCC), to reconsider its rules related to satellite communications (satcom) spectrum.

In a letter addressed to Dr. Neeraj Mittal, Chairman of DCC, the BIF argued that concerns around the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) satellite spectrum recommendations are influenced by “protectionist and anti-competitive mindsets” and violate free, fair and non-discriminatory treatment of new service providers.

Level playing field

Regarding reports of the DCC proposing satcom operators seek fresh permissions after crossing a certain number of subscribers, the BIF said such caps will constrain a satellite operator’s ability to scale, hurting investment incentives and increasing the service cost per user.

“The notion stems from the threat perception of the incumbents -- that satcom providers might amass large user bases and, thereby, cannibalise their existing markets, ostensibly without bearing equivalent regulatory burdens,” said T V Ramanchandran, Chairman of the BIF, warning of a ‘License Raj’ in case of such a cap.

The BIF also called the proposal for mid-term revision of satellite licences unfair, considering the renewal period is already set for five years as opposed to terrestrial broadband players, who have licences for 20 years. A mid-term renewal of licence would increase the capex costs for satcom players, as the entire cost would have to be amortised in a much shorter time.

Use of Bharat Nidhi

BIF supported TRAI’s recommendation of Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) for satellite user terminals and satcom services as “lawful” and “necessary,” given the high capex, steep terminal costs and lower revenues that satcom players are subject to in unserved and under-served geographies. BIF argued that should not be viewed as a subsidy, but as a national priority for bringing

[TITLE]Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market to 2030 Featuring Saudi Telecom Co, Mobily, Zain, Integrated Telecom Co, GO Telecom, Bayanat Al Oula, Detecon Al Saudia, and NourNet:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market was valued at USD 18.72 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 24.05 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.26%. The Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services market encompasses a broad range of services including mobile voice and data, fixed-line broadband, satellite communication, and enterprise network solutions.

These services are delivered by key national operators such as STC, Zain KSA, and Mobily, and are vital to enabling both consumer connectivity and business operations across the Kingdom. With the highest population in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Saudi Arabia has emerged as a digitally active economy, with increasing demand for faster, more reliable telecommunications infrastructure.

The market is poised for significant growth driven by the expansion of 5G networks, fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) initiatives, and government-led smart city projects such as NEOM and The Line. These national efforts require high-capacity, low-latency connectivity to support technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology is actively driving digital infrastructure development, aiming to increase internet speed, coverage, and digital inclusion across urban and rural areas.

Growing demand for enterprise-level connectivity solutions in sectors like banking, logistics, and manufacturing is contributing to the telecom market's evolution. Enhanced regulatory frameworks, investment in ICT infrastructure, and strategic public-private partnerships are further accelerating sector development. As Saudi Arabia continues its digital transformation journey, the telecommunication services market will remain at the core, providing the foundational layer for future technological innovation and national economic diversification.

Key Market Drivers

Nationwide 5G Deployment and Infrastructure Modernization

Saudi Arabia is rapidly expanding its fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network as part of its national digital transformation under Vision 2030. This rollout is not limited to major urban centers like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam but is extending to remote and underserved areas. Investments in 5G base stations, fiber backhaul, and spectrum acquisition are enabling the country to build one of the most advanced telecom infrastructures in the region.

This aggressive infrastructure development is improving connectivity speed, latency, and network capacity across all user categories. 5G enables use cases like smart manufacturing, autonomous transportation, and real-time healthcare diagnostics, increasing demand for advanced telecom services. The government, in collaboration with major telecom providers, is also offering incentives for private sector adoption of 5G, which in turn accelerates revenue generation for the sector and fosters innovation ecosystems across industries. As of early 2025, more than 65 percent of Saudi Arabia's population has access to 5G connectivity - up from just 23 percent in 2021. This rapid rise in coverage is driven by large-scale investments in nationwide base stations, spectrum rollout, and private-public collaboration to accelerate high-speed internet availability across both major cities and rural zones.

Key Market Challenges

Regulatory Complexity and Evolving Compliance Requirements

The regulatory environment for the telecommunication services market in Saudi Arabia is becoming increasingly complex due to the convergence of data protection, cybersecurity, localization, and international investment standards. While the Communications, Space and Technology Commission has implemented forward-looking frameworks to promote digital growth, the simultaneous application of multiple regulatory layers - especially concerning cross-border data transfer, 5G infrastructure sharing, and cloud services - creates compliance ambiguity for telecom operators. These overlapping mandates often slow down the introduction of new services or infrastructure deployments due to longer approval cycles and legal risk assessment periods.

The continuous revision of cybersecurity guidelines and national digital standards requires telecom companies to allocate substantial resources to legal, IT, and compliance functions. For smaller operators or new entrants, these burdens can restrict innovation and delay service expansion. Additionally, global technology vendors partnering with Saudi providers must also adjust to local legal frameworks, which can complicate integration timelines and strategic alliances. As the market matures and becomes more digitally interconnected, the need for unified, streamlined regulations that balance innovation with control will become increasingly vital to sustaining growth.

Key Market Trends

Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Network Optimization

Telecommunication service providers in Saudi Arabia are increasingly embedding artificial intelligence technologies across their operations to enhance network performance and customer service efficiency. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions are being used for predictive maintenance, automated network configuration, dynamic resource allocation, and anomaly detection. This has allowed operators to proactively resolve network issues, reduce service downtime, and deliver consistent, high-quality connectivity to a digitally demanding user base.

Moreover, customer experience management has benefited significantly from the application of artificial intelligence. Telecom operators are deploying virtual assistants, natural language processing systems, and intelligent analytics to personalize services, automate queries, and minimize human intervention in customer support. These tools help operators gain insights from large volumes of user data, enabling more agile decision-making. As Saudi Arabia accelerates its transition toward smart cities and digital governance, the role of artificial intelligence in automating and enhancing telecommunication services is expected to become more prominent and deeply embedded in network management strategies.

[TITLE]Matawa Chiefs Council wants Rogers to delay 3G shutdown, telling CRTC it's 'a matter of life and death':
[TEXT]
The Matawa Chiefs Council is warning that Rogers’s planned 3G network shutdown could have consequences for remote First Nations communities in northern Ontario, including putting lives at risk.

The council said it sent a letter to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) this week that calls for an urgent delay to the Dec. 31 shutdown. The CRTC regulates telecom providers, sets basic service standards, monitors access and affordability and can encourage, but not force, companies to maintain service in specific communities.

The chiefs argue the move could “pose serious risks to the safety, health and well-being” of the region’s remote communities, which already face limited access to cellular and broadband services.

The Matawa region includes nine member First Nations, several of which are remote fly-in communities located in the mineral-rich Ring of Fire area, including Eabametoong, Marten Falls, Neskantaga, Nibinamik and Webequie.

“Reliable communications infrastructure is a matter of life and death in our communities,” Chief Sonny Gagnon of Aroland First Nation said in a news release announcing the council's letter to the CRTC. “In Aroland First Nation, we don’t even have the benefit of 3G (or any other cellular services), but that could change with immediate investment in upgrades to finalize compatibility to meet today’s standards.”

The letter comes as Canadian providers gradually disable 3G networks to free up frequencies for faster 4G and 5G networks, which improve call quality and internet speeds, and support new technologies.

The Matawa Chiefs Council says the issue extends far beyond resource development.

'Reliable telecommunications are fundamental to health, safety and sustainable development in our territories,” says Chief Solomon Atlookan of Eabametoong First Nation. (Marc Doucette/CBC )

Big Tech is paying millions to train teachers on AI, in a push to bring chatbots into classrooms

AP News ^ | Updated 11:04 PM CDT, October 16, 2025 | JOCELYN GECKER

Posted on by E. Pluribus Unum

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day’s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.

After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: “Are we going to be replaced with AI?”

That remains to be seen. But for the nation’s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world’s largest technology companies. The two groups don’t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.

Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country’s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.

AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.

“There is no one else who is helping us with this. That’s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,” Weingarten said. “We went to them — they didn’t come to us.”

Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an “agnostic” approach that means any company’s AI tools could be used in a training session.

Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources,...

A live teacher, who can read the emotions of the students and tailor their lessons accordingly, will always be needed. They can see who is understanding the lesson and who needs the teacher to come at it from another angle. This AI crap is quite dangerous, and no substitute for a human teacher. Retired teacher here.

The teachers unions are all in on doing no work, passing it all onto AI and other stuff, teaching to the lowest common denominator so the work they do is as easy as possible and everyone gets good test scores so they never have to worry about their own standing. And the kids? Come on, the last thing they're thinking about. Didn't you learn that from COVID when they refused to teach kids and when they did finally grudgingly come back they insisted on masks and social distancing long after COVID was really an issue, and left those kids trapped with lingering developmental issues? Yeah, that happened and it shows who they care about: themselves, only themselves.

[TITLE]AI Startup WellTheory Raises $14 Million From General Catalyst, Accel, 7wire Ventures To Transform Autoimmune Health For Millions Of Patients:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

WellTheory, a female-founded health technology startup utilizing artificial intelligence to transform autoimmune care, announced Tuesday that it secured $14 million in Series A funding. The round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from 7wire Ventures, Ingeborg Investments, Accel, Box Group, and Up2 Opportunity Fund.

WellTheory founder and CEO Ellen Rudolph launched the company in 2022 after spending years navigating her own autoimmune diagnosis and realizing how fragmented traditional care models had become.

Rudolph said the company's mission is to "reimagine autoimmune care from the ground up" through holistic, personalized programs that address the root causes of each patient's symptoms rather than treating them in isolation.

AI-Driven Health Platform Targets The $180 Billion Autoimmune Market

According to the Autoimmune Association, more than 50 million Americans live with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis, a number that has more than doubled over the past three decades.

The association added that the economic burden of autoimmune diseases is projected to reach $180 billion in 2025 across 29 major conditions, with costs expected to double within the next 15 years if new treatments do not emerge.

WellTheory says it treats patients with over 100 distinct autoimmune diagnoses using personalized care plans that adapt to each member's symptoms and root causes, tailoring treatment to individual symptoms rather than diagnosis alone.

The company plans to expand its personalized digital platform, which utilizes proprietary AI tools, including Care Hub and Care Scribe, to streamline treatment plans and automate documentation. These systems help WellTheory's care teams personalize support for patients with autoimmune conditions while improving efficiency across operations.

Members work with a human care team that includes a registered dietitian, a certified health coach, and a care coordinator through one-on-one sessions and unlimited messaging, WellTheory says.

Women-Led Venture's Funding Marks A Milestone In Healthcare Equity

WellTheory's funding round holds deeper significance because all institutional investors involved were female partners, a rarity in venture capital where less than 2% of total funding goes to women-led startups, the company said.
