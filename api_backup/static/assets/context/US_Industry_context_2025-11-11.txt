NZX-listed hospitals and medical property specialist Vital Healthcare wants to raise $220 million to internalise management and expand Gold Coast and Sydney properties.

Current manager, Northwest Healthcare Properties Management, has struck a deal to internalise the management of the business, Vital said today.

Units will be issued at a discount to Friday’s trading price, it said.

The offer will be conducted by way of a $190m underwritten placement and a $30m unit purchase plan.

Vital chairman Graham Stuart said internalisation marked an important milestone for Vital, positioning the business to deliver stronger and more sustainable returns for Unit Holders.

[TITLE]CII Proposes India Development And Strategic Fund: 'Need Perpetual Source Of Capital Beyond Budget':
[TEXT]
The fund would comprise two distinct but coordinated arms: The Developmental Investment Arm would focus on financing long-gestation domestic priorities such as infrastructure, clean energy, MSME scale-up, education, healthcare, and urban infrastructure.

The Strategic Investment Arm would acquire and secure overseas assets critical to India’s economic and security needs, including energy resources, critical minerals, frontier technologies, and logistics assets.

According to CII, the IDSF could build a managed corpus of $1.3–2.6 trillion by 2047, mobilised through a mix of budgetary seed capital, proceeds from asset monetisation, and partial transfer of government equity in select public sector units (PSUs). The fund could also issue green, infrastructure, and diaspora bonds to raise patient domestic and global capital.

Oklahoma families face transportation barriers amid SNAP funding freeze

KOCO ^ | 11/6/25 | Olivia Hickey

Posted on by DallasBiff

As SNAP benefits remain frozen, many Oklahoma families struggle with transportation to access food pantries, while local charities offer some assistance.

Leveda Jordan Smith, a mother of three from southeast Oklahoma City, is among the over 600,000 residents who relied on SNAP benefits before the shutdown.

"Being a mother of 3, not receiving SNAP benefits has made it harder for us to figure out where our next meal is gonna come from, if we're gonna have enough to stretch by," Smith said.

Smith, who does not have a driver's license, depends on her significant other, friends, and family members for transportation. As a student on a tight budget, rideshares are not a viable option for her. The pantries in her area are typically open while she is in class or when her rides are at work. Currently, her family is stocked with canned and boxed goods, but fresh foods like meat, milk, and produce are out of reach.

A part time job should be enough to feed her and her children until the dems-13s open the government. EC

[TITLE]COP: The rise of a new influential triad:
[TEXT]
The world is gathering in Belém, Brazil, today for the 30th annual UN climate meet — Conference of Parties (COP30) — at a time when the planet edges closer to irreversible climate tipping points. Missing at the meet is the US, one of the largest emitters and a key architect of the Paris climate deal. Washington’s retreat and Europe’s political fatigue — aggravated by the Ukraine-Russia war, economic strains and energy shocks — has left a gaping hole in global climate leadership.

Finance has long been a sticking point in climate negotiations, with developing nations demanding fair, predictable, and accessible funds to support their transition. And yet, despite assurances, actual flows remain far below the trillions needed annually for mitigation and adaptation.

Host with green flex

As the Global North continues to cast a shadow of uncertainty over climate finance, this year’sCOPpresents a crucial opening for emerging powers — India, Brazil and China — to assume climate leadership owing to their size, ambition and geopolitical advantages.

This new constellation has its own set of strengths — proven track record of meeting emission pledges, taking the lead in expanding non-fossil fuel sources, framing just climate policies, and providing sustainable solutions and market mechanisms.

These attributes position this triad to become the torch bearers when the world deliberates on the model of transition countries should adopt to accelerate their shift toward cleaner, greener energy systems.

Brazil enters COP30 as the host and a leading tropical forest nation that has made significant strides in reducing deforestation.

Under President Lula da Silva, Brazil has repositioned itself as a climate mediator and forest finance innovator, with the Tropical Forests Forever Facility — a proposed long-term finance mechanism to reward forest nations for conservation — being a good example.

It has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 59-67 per cent by 2035, compared with 2005 levels. This is higher than its previous commitment of 37 per cent reduction by 2025, and 43 per cent by 2030.

Renewable sources supplied 88.2 per cent of Brazil’s electricity demand in 2024, with wind and solar covering 24 per cent.

Pluralistic push

India, on the other hand, offers a balanced and democratic model of green development. More plural and federal in nature, the model resonates with other emerging economies of not only Asia but also Africa and Latin America. It adopts a bottom-up approach, where the central government provides the framework, and the planning and action are led at the State level — tailored to regional requirements.

It represents billions in the global South who seek prosperity without following the carbon-heavy path of the North, while its domestic policies, renewable achievements, and initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure give it genuine legitimacy. India is one of the few countries that are on track to meeting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets, having already met its emission intensity goals and 50 per cent of the non-fossil fuel installed energy capacity (220.1 GW as of March 2025) target of 500 GW by 2030.

Additionally, India is likely to become the global production hub of clean fuels, thanks to ambitious projects like the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Its forest and tree cover has increased to 25.17 per cent in 2023 while its NDC already commits to creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030. In this scenario, a bold Indian NDC is likely to fill the global leadership vacuum. At the same time, India’s progress in renewables gives it an edge as nations grapple with fossil-fuel volatility.

Clean export power

China’s State-led model of transition, meanwhile, remains impressive in scale. China has announced a 7-10 per cent targeted cut in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, compared to “peak” levels.

The pace of cleantech investment remains significantly fast in China, with wind and solar under construction doubling against the rest of the world put together last year. The country is similarly advancing at break-neck speed in supplying the world with renewable technology — be it wind turbines or photovoltaic cells and electric vehicles.

The three nations must now aspire to forge new mechanisms that shift burden-sharing paradigms.

The UN’s latest adaptation gap report says developing nations need more than $310 billion annually between now and 2035 to prepare for the impacts of climate change. By highlighting smart solutions, these three economies can vigorously push richer nations to fulfil their climate finance obligations.

They can offer tailor-made solutions that satisfy the developing-country imperative of equity and justice. Given the prevailing trade tensions and supply-chain challenges, these countries can turn clean-tech manufacturing, renewable exports, green hydrogen and nature-carbon markets into strategic assets for other emerging economies to follow and ensure that the COP process remains relevant.

[TITLE]A Himalayan effort at climate change mitigation:
[TEXT]
Even as the 30th Conference of Parties (COP 30) gets underway in Belem, Brazil, negotiating ways to tackle the impact of climate change globally, in India a national treasure — the Himalayas — is on the precipice of an unprecedented human-induced disaster risk.

Last month, research consultancy Climate Trends’ report titled ‘Enhancing multi-hazard early warning and resilient settlement in the Himalayan region’ was released at a stakeholder consultation in Dehradun.

Authored by Dr Palak Balyan, with contributions by Alok Kumar and Sayalee Gulhane, the report emphasised the urgent need for an action plan to safeguard our majestic mountains, unique glaciers, rich biodiversity and local communities from utter ruin and extreme hardship.

Recent events have underscored the need to ensure that the destructive changes in the Himalayas do not become irreversible. The report states that the “Himalayan glaciers are retreating at unprecedented rates, forming unstable moraine-dammed lakes that pose significant glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) risks”.

It dwells on the flash floods in August this year that ravaged Dharali village in Uttarakhand, and the cloudburst and landslide in Kashmir that left a trail of death and distraught pilgrims. In 2023, GLOFs in Sikkim’s South Lhonak destroyed a hydropower infrastructure.

The authors also reflect on the “growing fragility” of the region and how “changing climate patterns and poorly planned infrastructure interact to amplify hazards”. This includes the unplanned settlements in the mountain towns as the population grows, amid rising migration. In recent times, dwellings have come up along the river, on steep slopes, and in spaces that are vulnerable to floods, erosion and landslides. The report calls it “unregulated construction and settlement expansion in high-risk zones”.

Course correction

So, what must India do?

The authors attempt to draw up an action plan for the Himalayas after referring to international models in Japan, Switzerland and Norway. The idea is to step up resilience among the people in the face of more frequent landslides, cloudbursts, flash floods, and GLOFs. This calls for a robust early warning system that can save lives and minimise economic loss. The report goes into the minute details of the agencies that should be involved in this exercise and the action to be taken.

With the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) as the pivot, it recommends the involvement of the India Meteorological Department; the Central Water Commission; the Geological Survey of India; the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change; the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; the National Disaster Response Force; and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

Emergency response

Calling for “strengthening governance and legal triggers”, the report suggests forming a ‘Himalayan Risk Council’ for coordination without overlaps.

Hazard warnings linked to legally binding triggers can ensure immediate emergency response such as shutting down roads, evacuating schools, and suspending rain-flooded routes, among others.

Hazard zoning must be integrated into State plans, with a ban on construction or relocation in red zones, and enforcing stricter building codes in orange or yellow zones.

To make the system more scientific, data gaps must be plugged across the region and models must be developed to convert rainfall and soil data into landslide warnings. Simulating GLOFs and avalanche dynamics, and formulating advisories in simple local language would be hugely helpful.

Effective community-based measures include installing early warning systems at the village level, and training local volunteers in siren operations, shelter management, and guiding schools, hospitals and other institutions in following standard operating procedures.

Funding support

Of course, all these measures call for adequate funds. For this, the report underscored the establishment of a ‘Himalayan Resilience Fund’, pooling international and national resources.

And this brings us back to what COP30 is trying to achieve — an enhanced flow of funds to help mitigate disaster risks of the kind facing the Himalayan range and the vulnerable communities living in its lap.

[TITLE]Six FIDs, $72 Billion: U.S. LNG’s Record-Breaking Year:
[TEXT]
Despite rising project costs, developers are successfully negotiating up to 15% higher liquefaction fees because buyers in Europe and Asia are willing to pay a premium to secure American LNG supply and reduce dependence on Russian gas.

Encouraged by market conditions, U.S. developers have made final investment decisions (FIDs) on six export projects this year, contributing to a record global LNG finance tally of $72 billion.

American LNG developers have signed sales and purchase agreements for 29.5 million metric tons per year in 2025, a volume that has more than quadrupled compared to the entirety of 2024.

Europe’s rush to shake off Russian gas dependence and Asia’s push to buy higher volumes of American energy while negotiating trade deals have created a booming export deal market for U.S. LNG exporters and developers, even at increased liquefaction fees.

Year to date, American LNG developers have signed sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) for existing and future export plants for a total of 29.5 million metric tons per year, according to data from consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group cited by Reuters.

The volume of newly contracted U.S. LNG more than quadrupled between January and October compared to the 7 million metric tons per year (mtpa) contracted for the whole of 2024.

The U.S. LNG industry is now on track to have signed the second-highest export volumes on record, trailing only 2022, when buyers in Europe turned en masse to American gas as Russian pipeline supply to Europe slumped and stopped for many EU markets, including Germany.

Encouraged by the Trump Administration’s energy policy, LNG developers are taking advantage of the market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.

So far this year, Australia’s Woodside has announced the FID for the Louisiana LNG project and plans to start production in 2029. In July, Venture Global took FID and successfully closed the $15.1 billion project financing for the first phase of the company’s third project, CP2 LNG, together with the associated CP Express Pipeline. Top U.S. exporter Cheniere has made a positive FID for the Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 and Debottlenecking Project. NextDecade has decided to invest $6.7 billion in the expansion of its Rio Grande LNG facility in Texas, in the second Rio Grande expansion announced this year, while Sempra approved a $14 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion.

U.S. developers of six export projects have made FIDs and secured financing so far this year, bringing total global LNG finance to a record of $72 billion, energy commodity shipping broker and advisor Poten & Partners said last month.

“Six US FIDs in one year is unprecedented– the highest number before this year was three US projects. The liquefaction finance tally could continue to climb in the final quarter of this year as a few more projects – also in the US – appear to be nearing FID,” Poten & Partners said.

In the near term, the U.S. is set to add 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in LNG export capacity in 2025 and 2026 alone, as Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects come online, the Energy Information Administration said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook in October. Additions to LNG export capacity are set to boost total U.S. LNG exports to 14.7 Bcf/d in 2025 and to 16.3 Bcf/d in 2026, up from 11.9 Bcf/d in 2024, according to the EIA estimates.

The surge in U.S. LNG exports and the expected jump in Qatari LNG shipments once Qatar’s mega expansion projects are completed in 2027 have stoked fears of a coming LNG glut that could depress prices.

U.S. developers appear unfazed by this prospect and are even raising their liquefaction fees as project costs soar amid persistent higher financing rates, labor shortages, and an increase in prices of materials.

In March this year, most U.S. liquefaction fees were being discussed at $2.65 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) to $2.95 per MMBtu, “as EPC cost escalations show no sign of abating,” Poten & Partners said at the time.

“Higher raw material prices, which are seeing further escalation because of tariffs, coupled with rising labor and financing costs are having a pronounced impact on US LNG liquefaction project implementation. The cost increases make it challenging for developers to keep engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts valid as they try to move ahead with their LNG export projects,” the broker and advisor said.

Now U.S. LNG exporters and developers are asking about 15% higher liquefaction fees compared to the 2023 average of about $2 per MMBtu, Poten & Partners business intelligence head Jason Feer told Reuters this week.

And they are so far getting these higher fees in new contracts. Buyers are still willing to pay higher liquefaction fees to secure American LNG, which is seen in Europe as a means to cut off Russian supply by 2027 and in Asia as a lever to pull in tariff and trade deal talks with the Trump Administration.

[TITLE]Valor's Advent Hotels to list as separate entity this month, bets big on luxury expansion:
[TEXT]
BENGALURU : Advent Hotels International Ltd, the hospitality arm carved out of Valor Estate Ltd (formerly DB Realty), will list as a separate entity on the stock exchanges on 13 November, as it seeks to build a portfolio of luxury and upscale hotels across major Indian cities through a partnership route, a top company executive said.

The move marks Valor’s diversification beyond residential real estate into high-value hospitality, at a time when India’s branded hotel supply is expanding rapidly and demand continues to outpace new capacity.

With Mumbai-based Valor already publicly listed, Advent will debut directly as an independently traded company following the demerger. Valor shareholders will get one share of Advent for 10 of Valor. Advent will be listed on the BSE and the National Stock Exchange.

While Valor will retain its residential focus through partnerships with other developers, Advent will operate as a dedicated hospitality platform, developing large-format properties in key business districts through joint ventures.

“The idea is not only to scale up Advent, but also to provide focused management and a clear capital structure," said Shahid Balwa, vice-chairman and managing director, Valor Estate, told Mint.

New luxury stays dot major cities

Currently, Advent Hotels has two operational hotels—a 171-key Hilton-branded property in Mumbai's Andheri East and a 313-room Grand Hyatt property in Bambolim, Goa. The Goa property is adding another 113 keys.

The company has two under-construction hotels at Aerocity, Delhi in equal partnership with real estate developer Prestige Group. The hotels—Marriott Marquis and St Regis—that are expected to be ready by mid-2026, will have 778 keys in all. There are two more upcoming hotels—a Waldorf Astoria hotel and branded residences and a Hilton in Mumbai's upscale Worli—with 550 keys.

“Advent's strategy is to build fairly large hotel properties in prime CBD (central business district) locations in key cities," Balwa said. "The focus is that the hotels are managed well by the operators appointed. The pipeline is significant, and there will be further expansion, going forward."

Advent's upcoming hotels are a mix of luxury and upper-upscale properties. Typically, the average room rate (ARR) between the two categories can have a 20-40% difference, depending on the season.

Advent's pipeline also includes a 1,175-key hotel project in Mumbai's business district Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), which will possibly be one of the largest in the country's financial capital. The hotel will be a part of a large mixed-use project, in which L&T Realty is the developer partner. Advent may look to build two hotels there, offering different price points.

Mid-market hotels lead next growth phase

For the first time in over a decade, India’s proposed branded supply in the sector has crossed 100,000 rooms. The active development pipeline as of March 2025 was at 114,151 rooms, with Bengaluru, Mumbai, Jaipur, and Goa leading the charge.

“There is a huge focus on growth. Advent's portfolio, with seven hotels, is on track to expand to 3,100 keys. Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) currently under ₹200 crore, will grow to over ₹660 crore as the pipeline stabilizes by FY32," said Advent Hotels' managing director and chief executive Rahul Pandit.

“The five hotels underway and in the pipeline are in high-value locations and will offer luxury and upper upscale hotel experiences. The overall hospitality industry has been performing well, with demand outstripping supply across price segments," Pandit said.

According to hospitality consulting firm Hotelivate’s recent Trends & Opportunities 2025 report, while luxury and leisure destinations continue to drive current room revenues, the future pipeline shows a clear strategic shift: mid-market and upper mid-market hotels account for nearly 50% of the future supply.

“Beyond the five (new) hotels, there is a fresh pipeline of projects we are examining that includes inorganic opportunities via acquisitions. We are looking at key metros as well as leisure locations," Pandit added. For instance, Prestige Group and Advent plan to develop a large-format resort style development, spread across over 300 acres in Lonavala, near Mumbai, that will also have a hotel.

Turkish Airlines reaches engine deal with GE Aerospace

ISTANBUL

Flag carrier Turkish Airlines has reached an agreement with GE Aerospace for the procurement of engines, spare engines and engine maintenance services for 75 Boeing airplanes.

In a filing with Borsa Istanbul on late Nov. 5, Turkish Airlines recalled that its board of directors had decided to purchase a total of 75 aircraft from Boeing, consisting of 50 firm and 25 option orders for B787-9 and B787-10 models with deliveries scheduled between 2029 and 2034.

“As a result of the tender held for the procurement of engines, spare engines and engine maintenance services for these aircraft, negotiations have been concluded and an agreement has been reached with GE Aerospace,” the carrier said in the statement.

In September, Turkish Airlines announced the purchase of 225 Boeing aircraft, consisting of 75 orders for the B787-9 and B787-10 models, and 150 for the 737-8 and 737-10 MAX models.

The airline also said at that time it finalized negotiations with Boeing for the purchase of 150 737-8 and 737-10 MAX aircraft, including 100 firm and 50 optional orders.

"Subject to the successful conclusion of ongoing discussions with engine manufacturer CFM International, orders for the 737-8/10 MAX aircraft will also be placed," it said in a statement in September.

Meanwhile, Ahmet Bolat, chairman of Turkish Airlines, said on Nov. 5 that the airline expected to meet with Boeing and CFM in the coming weeks.

“I hope that we are going to finalize there so that we don’t have to go back again and open the Airbus chapter in that part of the fleet,” Bolat told Bloomberg.

In October, Bolat said that Turkish Airlines may turn to Airbus if an agreement on engines cannot be reached.

Firefly Aerospace has completed the acquisition of SciTec, strengthening its capabilities in national security and defense technology. The purchase price included a mix of cash and Firefly common stock, with over 475 SciTec employees joining the Firefly team.

Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace, stated, "SciTec brings more than four decades of experience supporting high-stakes national security missions with industry-leading software applications and big data processing capabilities that are highly complementary of Firefly's launch, lunar, and in-space vehicles. Together, Firefly and SciTec bring the talent and tech to support the most critical national security programs and deliver the future of edge processing for dynamic space operations." The deal advances Firefly's portfolio with AI-enabled defense software in missile warning, space domain awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and autonomous command and control.

With the acquisition, Firefly gains classified infrastructure at six strategic locations and integrates additional data centers and mission operation centers. The company will deliver a suite of hardware and software for defense programs, including space-based interceptor missions, hypersonic tests, and Moon to Mars missions. Robust contracts and new service categories support intelligence and national security agencies alongside commercial clients.

Jim Lisowski, CEO of SciTec, explained, "We're proud to officially join the Firefly team and look forward to combining our software and hardware capabilities to bolster our existing services and create new industry-leading categories for space and defense customers. Both companies have become known for executing incredibly difficult missions from delivering a modernized missile warning system to successfully landing on the Moon. Together we'll be unstoppable."
