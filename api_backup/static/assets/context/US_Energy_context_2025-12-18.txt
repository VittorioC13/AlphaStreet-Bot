[TEXT]
Mr. Ran Fridrich will continue as Chief Executive Officer of the Company

Tel-Aviv, Israel, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and USA, today announced that S. Nechama Investments (2008) Ltd., Kanir Joint Investments (2005) LP and Anat Raphael, who together currently hold approximately 45.9% of the Company’s outstanding share capital (together, the “Sellers”), agreed to sell their holdings in the Company to O.Y. Nofar Energy Ltd. (“Nofar”), a public company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE: NOFR). As described below, the closing of the sale is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

Ran Fridrich, CEO and Board Member of Ellomay, said: “The transfer of control from the current controlling shareholders to Nofar is intended to ensure an orderly transition of ownership that will secure Ellomay’s future and continued growth. Ellomay will continue to operate in the ordinary course of business, while retaining its dedicated employees and management backbone, and will work to expand its activities in the future.”

Ofer Yannay, CEO and Board Member of Nofar, said: “The acquisition of the controlling stake in Ellomay constitutes a significant strategic milestone in the implementation of our growth strategy. This transaction represents not only an expansion of Nofar’s portfolio, but also the leveraging of three core principles: first, full strategic alignment with target markets in which we seek to deepen our activity; second, entry into the conventional energy sector through Ellomay’s holding in the Dorad power plant, which strengthens Nofar’s position by broadening its production mix; and third, the creation of operational synergies and asset-enhancement potential through the integration of the experience and expertise of Nofar and Ellomay. In particular, I would like to note my deep appreciation for Ellomay’s team, and especially for Rani Fridrich, who is expected to continue in his role as CEO of Ellomay.”

As noted in a report submitted to the Israel Securities Authority by Nofar (“Nofar’s Report”), the Sellers will be selling their shares based on a Company valuation of NIS 1 billion (approximately $310.4 million), subject to customary adjustments. Nofar further reports that the consummation of the sale is subject, inter alia, to receipt of regulatory approvals (including from the Israeli Electricity Authority and the Israeli Competition Commissioner) by no later than 90 days from the date of execution of the sale agreement, however, if Nofar acts in good faith to obtain the required approvals and such approvals are not received by the applicable deadline, and the Sellers receives written notice thereof, the final deadline may be extended in two stages of up to 45 days each. In addition, Nofar’s Report notes that Nofar has the right to terminate the sale agreement in the event that during the interim period until the consummation of the transaction: (i) the Company enters into a new material transaction that is not in the ordinary course of business with the Sellers or any of their related parties or any of the Company’s controlling shareholders or office holders, (ii) if the Company enters into a material new field of operations not included in the Company’s strategic plan and requires substantial investments, (iii) if the Company sells (or leases) a significant part of the Company’s real estate (owned or leased by the Company), or (iv) if the Company’s articles of association are amended, other than a technical amendment.

Based on Nofar’s Report, the sale agreement further provides that upon consummation of the transaction, and at Nofar’s discretion, up to four directors on behalf of Nofar may be appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors, and an equivalent number of directors (other than the Company’s external directors) will be replaced. Nofar’s Report notes that Mr. Ran Fridrich will continue to act as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

As noted above, the consummation of the sale transaction is subject to conditions to closing, that are not within the control of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot estimate, and there is currently no assurance as to, whether and when the transaction will be consummated. In addition, the value of the Company’s shares set forth in the Nofar Report may not be reflective of the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the NYSE American or the TASE.

[TITLE]Oil slips below $60 on Russia-Ukraine peace deal talks:
[TEXT]
Oil prices fell today to below $60 a barrel - the lowest since May this year - as prospects for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal appeared to strengthen, raising expectations of a potential easing of sanctions.

Brent crude futures fell 81 cents, or around 1.3%, to $59.75 a barrel today, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was trading at $55.98 a barrel, down 84 cents, or nearly 1.5%.

"Brent has dropped this morning to below $60 per barrel for the first time in months, as the market assesses a potential peace deal resulting in additional Russian volumes becoming available and oversupplying the market further," said Rystad analyst Janiv Shah.

The US offered to provide NATO-style security guarantees for Kyiv and European negotiators reported progress in talks yesterday to end Russia's war in Ukraine, sparking optimism that an end to the conflict was closer.

Russia, meanwhile, said it was not willing to make any territorial concessions in talks on ending the Ukraine war, state news agency TASS quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying.

"The grind in talks will be matched with the continued grind lower in prices as we enter 2026 with all its associated predictions of 'glut.' Brent will make a fresh year-to-date low, but will not break below $55 a barrel before the year is out," said PVM Oil Associates analyst John Evans.

Meanwhile, Barclays analysts expect Brent to average $65 a barrell in 2026, slightly ahead of the forward curve, due to the expected 1.9 million bpd surplus that they see as being priced into the market already.

Adding to the pressure, soft Chinese economic data released yesterday further fuelled concerns that global demand may not be strong enough to absorb recent supply growth, said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore in a note.

China's factory output growth slowed to a 15-month low, official data showed. Retail sales also grew at their slowest pace since December 2022, during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Fears of an oversupply were marginally offset by the US seizing an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week, but traders and analysts said a glut of floating storage and a surge in Chinese buying from Venezuela in anticipation of sanctions were also limiting the market impact of the move.

The government has notified the new Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, bringing into force a modern regulatory framework aimed at attracting investment and improving ease of doing business in the oil and gas sector.The rules, issued under the recently approved Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025, replace the earlier system of multiple licences with a single petroleum lease covering exploration, development and production of all hydrocarbons, including shale, according to a gazette notification.The new framework provides lease tenures of up to 30 years, extendable for the full economic life of a field, with terms protected from adverse changes. Criminal penalties for violations have been removed and replaced with higher financial penalties of Rs 25 lakh, plus Rs 10 lakh per day for continuing breaches. The rules also allow lessees to share infrastructure to improve operational efficiency.Environmental provisions have mandated time-bound plans for zero gas flaring and reduced greenhouse emissions.Applications for petroleum leases must now be decided within 180 days, and disputes may be resolved through an expedited mechanism, including a neutral arbitration seat for foreign investors.The Oil Industry Safety Directorate has been designated as the competent authority for offshore safety, audits and standard-setting in exploration and production operations.Commenting on the move, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, "In a landmark moment today, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, have been amended to offer ease of business and operations".With a broader spectrum of rights under one petroleum lease, the lessees will have the right to carry out all types of mineral oil operations under one petroleum lease, he said, adding that they may undertake decarbonisation and comprehensive energy projects at oilfields.Application for the grant of a petroleum lease will be decided within 180 days. Long-term leases of up to 30 years may be granted and may be extended up to the economic life of the field, allowing the lessee to make a planned investment decision.Lessees will make an annual declaration to the government of the installed, utilised and excess capacity of the infrastructure facilities owned by it, he said.The new rules permit lessees to jointly develop or share infrastructure facilities by mutual agreement.Seat of arbitration of lease and contractual disputes, where all lessees or contractors are companies incorporated in India, will be New Delhi. Where any member is a foreign company as defined in the Companies Act, a neutral seat of arbitration may be opted for.Rules require NOCs to promptly notify all existing and new discoveries, submit field development plans within prescribed time limits, obtain central government approval for development areas, and regularly report development and production activities. Vedanta Group chairman Anil Agarwal said, "Notifying the landmark reforms to India's oil and gas regulatory framework" is "a truly historic development"."The world has long recognised India's vast untapped hydrocarbon potential, and these new rules finally create the environment needed to unlock it," he said."India produces some of the most affordable oil and gas globally. These reforms will directly benefit consumers - especially the poorest - by enabling greater domestic production and reducing dependence on imports."He said this is the kind of bold, inclusive policy that transformed the United States from a major importer into an energy surplus nation."I never imagined I would witness such a reform in my lifetime. Our energy security is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity. With these changes, I am confident that India can produce at least 50 per cent of its energy domestically."

[TITLE]Analysis: Costly gas and infrastructure are driving Virginia’s soaring power bills:
[TEXT]
By David Kelly, EDF Senior Director – Mid-Atlantic Region

Virginians are facing rising costs on multiple fronts, and electric bills are no exception. Virginia’s electric bills are increasing at a pace faster than general inflation and, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), bills have increased nearly 30% since 2021. It’s easy to understand the growing frustration, as some Virginians are forced to choose between paying for doctor’s visits and prescription drugs – or even food – over their electric bill.

Drawing on Dominion Energy’s and Appalachian Power’s own filings at the State Corporation Commission (the agency that oversees utility investments and regulates ratemaking in Virginia), a new analysis from EQ Research underscores that volatile fossil fuel prices and skyrocketing utility investment in power system infrastructure are the primary drivers behind surging electricity costs for Virginia households.

While not explicitly addressed in this report, we’d be remiss, as we consider cost drivers, not to highlight that data centers represent a significant element of the need for new power system infrastructure. As the Joint Legislative and Review Commission (JLARC) data center report pointed out, this booming industry brings economic benefits to the state, but comes with cost impacts to Virginia’s electric customers. Just recently, the SCC issued an order aimed at corralling transmission and distribution system costs brought on by data center energy demand. By requiring data centers and other large users to pay a minimum of 85% of contracted distribution and transmission demand, and 60% of generation demand, among other requirements, the SCC order seeks to protect Virginia ratepayers from those costs.

While the SCC’s order is notable, the consequences to customers in a more fossil-fuel focused future are clear: the more utilities seek to invest in gas power plants and associated infrastructure, the more Virginia households will remain financially tethered to a price-volatile and increasingly expensive energy system. Meanwhile renewable energy, particularly solar paired with battery storage, is the most affordable, most rapidly-scalable energy resource available to meet Virginia’s energy needs while keeping electricity prices in check.

What the Numbers Say

The data, taken from Dominion and ApCo’s own filings with the State Corporation Commission, paints a clear picture of what’s driving up Virginians’ electric bills.

Analysis of utility filings between January 1, 2019, and April 1, 2025, shows:

Residential rates have increased significantly in both Dominion (20.5%) and ApCo’s (45.4%) service territories since January 2019. (See Figure 1)

While base rates have remained relatively stable, rate riders to cover the costs of powerplant fuel and grid infrastructure spending have significantly increased residential customer costs in both Dominion and ApCo’s service territories.

Fuel costs – what the utility pays for natural gas – increased 62.5% , distribution costs increased 123.1%, and transmission costs increased 82.0% in ApCo’s service territory over the analysis period (See Figure 4)

In Dominion’s service territory, non-renewable generation costs decreased 13.0% over the analysis period, but the trend in non-renewable generation costs over time shows a 73% spike in fuel costs beginning in 2022 and carrying into 2023 . Distribution costs increased by 66.0% and transmission costs increased by 49.0% in Dominion’s service territory over the analysis period.

Reliance on Gas is Fueling a Rate Hike Rollercoaster

The utilities’ own SCC filings make it clear: the cost of fuel to run fossil power plants is a primary driver of price instability and rising cost for Virginia households. Nevertheless, Dominion continues to prioritize new fossil fuel investments. This piece of the energy equation is simple: When fuel prices spike, so do customers’ bills. When gas fuel prices jumped in 2022–23, Virginia households and businesses saw their bills spike. And with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting gas prices to more than double in 2026, up from 2024 prices, that’s bad news for Virginians looking for energy affordability solutions – especially heading into cold winter months when rising demand for electricity to keep homes warm is already promising higher than usual electricity bills.

Energy Affordability and the Transition to Clean

One of the ways Virginia’s electric utilities generate a profit is through a guaranteed return on equity (ROE) for their investment in major infrastructure projects like power plants. While state policy might specify that electric power should be delivered to customers at the least cost, incentives in the electricity market encourage utilities to pursue the most expensive projects they can get the SCC to approve.

By requiring that utilities shift investment toward price-stable, affordable clean energy solutions, policies like the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) help stabilize rates in the near term and keep downward pressure on energy costs for the long haul, with the added benefit of driving down climate and health-harming air pollution from the electric power sector. Analysis of ApCo’s and Dominion’s SCC filings shows that VCEA costs make up a relatively small fraction of the average customer’s monthly bill and are dwarfed by the significant cost increases customers are experiencing due to the utilities’ reliance on gas power plants and ballooning investment in grid infrastructure build out.

Moreover, ApCo itself announced in October that they were in a rare position to lower customer bills by a whopping 24% because of a ramp-up of renewable energy use. As ApCo explained in its

[TITLE]Arizona's Mesquite Solar Hub Expands to Power 150,000 Homes:
[TEXT]
The long-term development of Mesquite and similar projects faces significant challenges for 2026 and beyond, including rising tariffs, transmission constraints in the Southwest, increasing insurance premiums, and water scarcity issues.

The complex is still expanding, with new projects like the Arlington Solar Power Plant creating a growing "solar corridor" that could eventually approach 750 MW of combined capacity, making the area a major national solar hub.

The Mesquite Solar Complex in Arlington, Arizona, is a significant utility-scale photovoltaic installation that currently delivers roughly 530 megawatts of solar capacity, supported by a 70 MW / 280 MWh battery system.

On a recent flight from Los Angeles to Phoenix, I glanced out the window as the aircraft slowly descended over the open desert west of the city. The landscape shifted abruptly from endless scrubland to an expanse of mirrored rectangles stretching to the horizon. I took several pictures, and my phone’s GPS later confirmed what I was seeing: the Mesquite Solar Complex in Arlington, Arizona—one of the largest photovoltaic installations in the United States.

From above, the site resembles an enormous geometric tapestry. On the ground, it represents something more significant: the steady evolution of utility-scale solar from a niche technology to a central component of America’s generating fleet.

A Landmark in Utility-Scale Solar

The Mesquite Solar Complex began in 2011 and has grown through five sequential development phases. Today, the facility delivers roughly 530 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity, supported by a 70 MW / 280 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery system. That combination is enough to power

LANSING, MI - Consumers Energy is again beginning the process of raising natural gas rates, on the first day it is permitted to under Michigan law and for the fourth year in a row.

The utility serving half of Michigan’s gas customers filed paperwork on Tuesday, Dec. 16 requesting to increase rates by $240 million.

Average monthly bills for residential customers would increase 8.2% if approved in full by regulators with the Michigan Public Service Commission, according to Consumers filings.

Instead, regulators often reduce utility requests after a monthslong legal process involving scrutiny from outside groups, known as a “rate case.” New rates won’t show up on customer bills until late next year.

Michigan law makes utilities wait one full year between rate hike applications. Consumers has done so down to the day. For four years running, its gas rate requests have landed on the first business day it is able to formally submit them, falling in mid-December.

Some consumer watchdogs call that pace “troubling.”

“Consumers Energy has created a revolving door of rate increases by filing annually in recent years. This case continues that trend,” said Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, a nonprofit advocating for residential ratepayers, in a statement.

Consumers is the largest gas utility in Michigan, operating nearly 31,000 miles of pipeline across the Lower Peninsula.

“Consumers Energy is committed to our customers. That means we’re upgrading the system that delivers natural gas safely and reliably to over 1.8 million homes and businesses while recognizing our responsibility to keep bills affordable,” said utility spokesperson Brian Wheeler in a statement.

The pace of its rate case filings reflects a need to invest in its gas system for safe and affordable service for customers, he added. Gas rates today are below Midwest and national averages, Wheeler said.

The utility request comes two and a half months after regulators approved its last rate hike, effective Nov. 1 and totaling $157 million.

That amount was 36% less than Consumers’ initial $248 million ask. It amounted to an 8.1% monthly increase, or $6.44, for a residential customer with typical usage.

If approved in its entirety, the latest rate increase request would mean the average residential natural gas customer would pay $3.14 per day for service in 2027, according to Consumers filings.

Utilities have tripled spending in recent years as they replace decades-old gas infrastructure.

If the trajectory continues, the three largest gas providers — Consumers Energy, DTE Energy and SEMCO Energy Gas Co. — are on track to invest nearly $60 billion through 2050, according to a Citizens Utility Board report that warned the hefty sum could burden customer bills.

Environmental groups have also used rate cases to question whether the spending could also lock Michigan into reliance on natural gas, a fossil fuel composed primarily of methane, with potent planet-warming effects.

Consumers has argued replacing legacy piping with modern materials reduces methane leaks, cutting emissions.
