[TITLE]Alphabet to buy Intersect Power to bypass energy grid bottlenecks:
[TEXT]
In Brief

Google parent Alphabet has agreed to buy Intersect Power, a data center and clean energy developer, for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of the company’s debt.

The acquisition, which was announced Monday, will help Alphabet expand its power-generation capacity alongside new data centers without having to rely on local utilities that are struggling to keep up with the demand of AI companies. Securing access to energy that powers data centers has become a critical part of training AI models.

Alphabet previously held a minority stake in Intersect Power after Google and TPG Rise Climate led an $800 million strategic funding round in the company last December. That partnership set a target of $20 billion in total investment by 2030.

The acquisition includes Intersect’s future development projects but excludes its existing operation, which will be bought out by other investors and managed as a separate company.

Intersect’s new data parks, which are essentially locations next to wind, solar, and battery power, are expected to be operational late next year and fully completed by 2027, Google said when it announced its minority investment.

The transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year.

Google will be the primary user. However, Intersect’s campuses are designed as industrial parks that can host other companies’ AI chips alongside Google’s.

[TITLE]Shell, INEOS Energy Discover Oil In The Gulf of America:
[TEXT]
Shell and INEOS Energy have struck oil at a deepwater exploration well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, confirming a new discovery in the high-pressure Norphlet formation. Shell and INEOS Energy said the Nashville exploration well encountered high-quality oil more than 26,000 feet below the seabed, according to industry reporting

The well was drilled in deepwater acreage targeting the Norphlet play, a technically demanding formation associated with extreme pressure and temperature conditions that require advanced well design, specialized drilling fluids, and careful completion techniques to manage reservoir risks and costs.

“This is a good result for INEOS Energy and an important step in building our presence in the U.S. Gulf where world-class resources are to be found and developed responsibly,” INEOS Energy CEO David Bucknall said in a company statement.

INEOS Energy entered the U.S. offshore sector through its acquisition of upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico, while Shell remains one of the basin’s largest operators with a long track record in deepwater exploration, development, and production. The Nashville well adds to ongoing exploration activity aimed at extending the commercial life of existing offshore infrastructure.

The U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains the country’s primary offshore oil province, hosting large, long-life deepwater developments operated by Shell, BP, and Chevron. Recent exploration results have underscored the continued role of ultra-deep, high-pressure drilling as operators pursue complex reservoirs at greater depths.

U.S. oil supply growth has increasingly tilted toward offshore production as shale basins mature and capital discipline tightens, with long-cycle deepwater projects gaining relative weight compared with shale

Shell and INEOS Energy did not disclose estimated recoverable volumes or a development timeline for the Nashville well, noting that further appraisal work will be required.

[TITLE]What Would A Peace Deal In Ukraine Mean For The Global Oil Market?:
[TEXT]
The prospect of a peace deal in Ukraine has been gaining momentum in the global oil market over the past few days, stripping away part of the geopolitical risk premium that has kept prices elevated since Russia’s invasion on 24 February 2022. Following meetings last week in Berlin with Ukrainian and European officials, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner stated that consensus was reached on around 90% of the issues within a 20-point peace plan. Ukraine has indicated that it may drop its NATO membership bid in exchange for legally binding U.S. and European security assurances, similar to NATO’s Article 5. This states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to assist, potentially with armed force, to restore security. The U.S. has now said that it is offering ‘Article 5-like’ assurances, with President Donald Trump now reportedly willing to submit to the Senate for approval. Meanwhile, Russia has indicated it could accept Ukraine joining the European Union (E.U.) of 27 countries as part of a settlement, a major shift from its earlier stance. However, it continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from parts of Donetsk still under Kyiv’s control, while Ukraine rejects ceding territory. Talks continue, with Trump saying in the last few days that “we’re closer now [to a peace deal] than we have been,” so what would it mean if such an agreement was reached tomorrow?

Even if a full peace agreement were reached tomorrow – freely agreed by both Ukraine and Russia -- it would likely take months for any significant rolling back of U.S. sanctions on Russia to occur, and years before all such prohibitions were removed. “Literally thousands of sanctions have been imposed on Russia since [24 February] 2022, involving codification through multiple executive orders, Treasury designations, and sometimes congressional legislation, so removing them doesn’t just mean a signature,” a senior Washington-based source who works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “Removing each one will require a formal review process, inter?agency coordination, and sometimes Senate approval if treaty?level commitments are involved,” he noted. “Don’t forget that these sanctions often also feed into similar ones on third-country firms and individuals that are connected to Russia, so getting rid of those would require another level of legal process and negotiations with allies in Europe and Asia, which would be very time consuming,” he underlined. “And on top of that any major rollback could be challenged every step of the way by the lawmakers, which would take it out of the control of the executive,” he told OilPrice.com. Ultimately, sanctions are seen as the tangible sign of U.S. resolve, and any rapid removal – absent a clear milestone achieved by Russia – would risk being read by allies and adversaries alike as a reward for aggression. Given this, any substantive longer-term effects on the global oil market would likely be muted.

Even more so, as it is highly likely that such an initiative would involve a graduated process, as with Iran, according to the Washington source. Indeed, once the U.S. had agreed to the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’ (JCPOA, or colloquially ‘the nuclear deal’) on 14 July 2015, sanctions relief for Iran was phased in over years, contingent on verified compliance milestones, with Treasury and State monitoring implementation before easing restrictions, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. “It’s pretty clear that the Europeans would want to see this sort of a rollback, and Ukraine too, with [sanctions] relief charted against benchmarks, not a blanket lifting overnight,” said the Washington source. “In this case [Ukraine], we’d be looking for proof that Russia is not continuing with military support for its occupied territories, or a further build-up of Russian military in those regions, and this would require international monitoring,” he observed. Moreover, as seen in the E.U.’s recent ‘Sanctions Snapback’ on Iran, any relief programme for Russia would almost certainly contain a similar mechanism to re?impose measures if Moscow breached peace terms. Judging from the Snapback on Iran, and the likely terms for Russia of any peace deal, such a snapback for Moscow would involve a quick and broad-based reimposition of sanctions on it and third parties relating to military hardware, dual-use (civilian and military) technology, and finance as monitored through the lens of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF enforces 40 standards against money laundering and nine against terrorist financing, with sweeping powers to sanction individuals, firms, or states that fall short. Its grey? and black?list designations trigger escalating restrictions, making it an aggressive enforcement tool.

In any event, Europe – both the E.U. and other countries, including Great Britain – looks even less likely than the U.S. to start rolling back sanctions on Russia any time soon. After years of effectively bankrolling the Russian war machine through vast imports of the country’s oil and gas, the message finally appears to have sunk in: the rest of Europe is in President Vladimir Putin’s sights after Ukraine. He laid the groundwork for what was to come back in his second state?of?the?nation speech after his 2004 re?election, broadcast live on Russian television, when he said: “The demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century. As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.” Following that, his tentative first military incursion into a sovereign European country – Georgia in 2008 – showed him that he could get away with more, in the classic ‘salami slicing’ strategy of territorial advancement that he has used since. This was because of the ineffectual response from Europe to this aggression – itself a result of the fact that the continent, particularly Germany, was unwilling to jeopardise its cheap Russian gas and oil supplies, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. When the same meek response met his 2014 invasion of Ukraine, and subsequent annexation of Crimea, it was game on for the full invasion of Ukraine in 2022. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte laid it out bare for Europe just over a week ago: “We are Russia’s next target. And we are already in harm’s way.” With this view now widespread among Europe’s top leaders, the meaningful rollback of sanctions on Moscow looks unlikely, with the corollary lack of long-term follow-through in the global oil market.

President Trump has further fuelled Europe’s determination to take its own path on Russia, having made it clear early in this presidency that NATO members who did not dramatically increase their defence spending could not rely on U.S. military support in the event of attack from Russia. The last time NATO met, members agreed to increase their defence spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, up from an average of 2% last year. Against this backdrop, it would be too obscene even for Germany to advocate the resumption of oil and gas imports in size from Russia. Indeed, around two weeks ago, the E.U. fully agreed to implement its ‘REPowerEU Roadmap’, which European Commission (E.C.) President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted as enabling the continent to: “Enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia [as] Today, we are stopping these imports permanently.” She underlined: “By depleting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.” E.C. Commissioner, Dan Jørgensen, put it even more plainly: “We [the E.U.] will “never go back to our dangerous dependence on Russia, we will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation, and we will never go back to energy blackmail and economic exposure.” As such, the agreement contains bans on E.U. imports of pipelined natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and oil from Russia, as analysed fully by OilPrice.com. As one senior source in the EU’s security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week: “Regardless of what the Americans do, and regardless of any peace deal in Ukraine, we’re not rolling back anything on Russia.”

[TITLE]Africa Needs $100 Billion in Refining Investment as Oil Demand Soars:
[TEXT]
Africa’s crude oil demand is set to more than double to 4.5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2050, which will need more than $100 billion in investment in refining over the next decades, according to the African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA).

Thanks to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization, Africa’s crude oil consumption is expected to jump from 1.8 million bpd in 2024 to as much as 4.5 million bpd by 2050, ARDA Executive Secretary, Anibor Kragha, has said, as carried by African news outlets including Arise News.

The expected surge in demand positions Africa’s refining industry as one of the world’s biggest untapped investment frontiers, according to the association.

Despite the growth in consumption, Africa remains reliant on fuel imports, which expose many of the countries on the continent to price swings, supply disruptions, and reduction of their foreign exchange (forex) reserves, ARDA’s Kragha said.

“Downstream investment has stagnated even as upstream production grows, leaving Africa stuck in the costly paradox of exporting crude and importing refined products at a premium,” ARDA’s Kragha said.

To boost domestic fuel supply, Africa will need more than $100 billion in upgrades of mothballed or dilapidated refineries, expansion of existing refining capacity, and new greenfield projects to supply fuels, the African refiners’ association reckons.

A key hurdle to Africa-made fuels is the lack of harmonized fuel specifications, Kragha noted, adding that out of 54 countries in Africa, as many as 46 maintain various national fuel standards. All these mean there are 12 different gasoline and 11 diesel varieties being sold across Africa.

“Africa’s downstream sector is one of the world’s last large-scale, high-growth energy investment frontiers. The demand curve is defined by demographics. The supply deficit is structural. The capital requirement exceeds $100 billion. And the economic upside is transformative,” Kragha said.

[TITLE]U.S. Snatches Venezuela Oil Tanker in Dark‑Hour Strike on Narco‑Terror Funding:
[TEXT]
In a stealth operation carried out before dawn on Dec. 20, the U.S. Coast Guard—working alongside the Department of War—seized an oil tanker last seen in the terrorist state of Venezuela. The United States accused the ship’s operators of moving sanctioned crude to fuel narco‑terror activity. Officials issued a stark warning to traffickers: “We will find you, and we will stop you.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem released a video on social media showing a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter landing on the deck of an oil tanker in international waters off the coast of Venezuela. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump declared the government of Venezuela to be a Foreign Terrorist Organization and ordered the complete naval blockade of the country.

“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” Noem posted on X. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”

DHS called the seizure a “lightning strike operation to seize the Motor Tanker Centuries. Officials stated the ship was carrying oil subject to U.S. sanctions.

U.S. and Venezuelan officials report that the seizure of the Panamanian-flagged “Centuries” tanker took place in international waters near the coast of Venezuela. The ship was reportedly bound for Asia, possibly China, reports indicate.

NBC News reported on the Venezuelan reaction, writing:

Venezuela’s minister of the interior, Diosdado Cabello, condemned the operation in a Saturday post on Instagram. “The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela denounces and rejects the theft and hijacking of a new private vessel transporting Venezuelan oil, as well as the forced disappearance of its crew, committed by military personnel of the United States of America in international waters,” Cabello said.

In a post on social media, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth added to the U.S. actions, writing, “President Trump has been clear: the blockade of sanctioned oil tankers departing from, or bound for, Venezuela will remain in full force until Maduro’s criminal enterprise returns every stolen American asset.”

Earlier this month, Breitbart’s John Hayward reported that the Trump administration ordered the seizure of another tanker carrying sanctioned Venezuelan oil. This vessel was reportedly headed to Cuba.

In a speech where he did not directly respond to the tanker’s seizure, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said, in a speech, that the Venezuelan military is “prepared to break the teeth of teh North American empire, if necessary.”

[TITLE]Crude oil prices fall on Russia-Ukraine peace hopes, Venezuela supply cues:
[TEXT]
Crude oil futures traded lower on Friday morning following reports that raised hopes of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

At 9.59 am on Friday, February Brent oil futures were at $59.71, down by 0.18 per cent, and February crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $55.89, down by 0.20 per cent. January crude oil futures were trading at ₹5074 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Friday against the previous close of ₹5114, down by 0.78 per cent, and February futures were trading at ₹5098 against the previous close of ₹5134, down by 0.70 per cent.

Quoting US President Donald Trump, a Reuters report said he believes talks toward ending the war in Ukraine are ‘getting close to something’.

Citing a White House official, the report said the US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are set to meet a Russian delegation in Miami this weekend. Referring to the recent Russian gains on the battlefield, Trump said, “I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there.”

A peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will ease concerns over global crude oil supply disruptions. Russia is one of the world’s major crude oil producers.

Meanwhile, reports said that Venezuela has authorised two unsanctioned very large crude carriers to set sail for China.

Trump had recently announced that the US would impose a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country. This had put at risk around 600,000 barrels of oil per day in exports. China is the major buyer of this crude.

January natural gas futures were trading at ₹329.20 on MCX during the first hour of trading on Friday, down 1.99 per cent from the previous close of ₹335.90.

On the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), January guargum contracts traded at ₹9910 in the first hour of trading on Friday, up 0.22 per cent from the previous close of ₹9888.

January jeera futures were trading at ₹21035 on NCDEX in the initial hour of trading on Friday, down 0.47 per cent from the previous close of ₹21135.

[TITLE]Alphabet to buy Intersect Power to bypass energy grid bottlenecks:
[TEXT]
In Brief

Google parent Alphabet has agreed to buy Intersect Power, a data center and clean energy developer, for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of the company’s debt.

The acquisition, which was announced Monday, will help Alphabet expand its power-generation capacity alongside new data centers without having to rely on local utilities that are struggling to keep up with the demand of AI companies. Securing access to energy that powers data centers has become a critical part of training AI models.

Alphabet previously held a minority stake in Intersect Power after Google and TPG Rise Climate led an $800 million strategic funding round in the company last December. That partnership set a target of $20 billion in total investment by 2030.

The acquisition includes Intersect’s future development projects but excludes its existing operation, which will be bought out by other investors and managed as a separate company.

Intersect’s new data parks, which are essentially locations next to wind, solar, and battery power, are expected to be operational late next year and fully completed by 2027, Google said when it announced its minority investment.

The transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year.

Google will be the primary user. However, Intersect’s campuses are designed as industrial parks that can host other companies’ AI chips alongside Google’s.

[TITLE]Tech Behemoth Gobbles Up Power Company In $5 Billion Deal To Juice Data Centers:
[TEXT]
Google’s parent company, Alphabet, announced on Monday that it will acquire the data center and energy infrastructure company Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash and “the assumption of debt.”

Though Google already owns a majority stake in the company, the deal will further support the Big Tech company’s build-out of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure while keeping Intersect’s operations separate, according to Alphabet. As America’s energy demand climbs while projected AI data center needs skyrocket, Big Tech has been searching for reliable electricity sources — with some companies looking to resurrect nuclear plants.

“Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership. We look forward to welcoming Sheldon and the Intersect team,” CEO of Google and Alphabet Sundar Pichai said in a statement Monday.

Alphabet notes that this acquisition “will augment Alphabet and Google’s ongoing commitment to partnering with utilities and energy developers across the sector to unlock abundant, reliable, affordable energy supply that enables the buildout of data center infrastructure without passing on costs to grid customers.”

“Intersect has always been focused on bringing innovation to the industry and we look forward to accelerating at scale as part of Google,” Sheldon Kimber, Intersect founder and CEO, said in a statement Monday. “Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI. We share Google’s conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.”

The Trump administration has advanced similar messaging promoting U.S. dominance in the AI industry, signing an executive order on Dec. 11 that decrees a “national policy framework for AI.”

“We remain in the earliest days of this technological revolution and are in a race with adversaries for supremacy within it,” the Dec. 11 executive order reads.

While President Donald Trump stresses the vitality of building out data center infrastructure to keep America’s competitive edge in the AI race, some local communities have been protesting data center development over concerns the facilities will spike electricity costs, take up rural land and drain water resources.

States like California, Florida and New York have recently advanced or signed AI policies in moves their governors argue shield the public from Big Tech. Democrats and Republicans are split on AI messaging headed into the 2026 midterms, with prominent politicians on both sides of the aisle vowing to shut down data center development until clearer consumer and local protections are established.

Notably, some recent reports have referenced quiet data center deals between tech companies, developers and utilities that defy local communities’ wishes. Protesters have gathered to fight what they call “secret deals,” fearing that Big Tech companies will reap financial benefits at the expense of local communities, often without residents’ knowledge or consent.

Dr Arun Kumar Nayak, until recently head of the Nuclear Control and Planning Wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, makes the case for the SHANTI Bill, 2025, arguing that private sector entry into nuclear power is an imperative, not a choice.Speaking to ET, Nayak said Articles 17(b) and 46 of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) created widespread ambiguity among suppliers, preventing the nuclear business from progressing. He noted that the revised framework on right to recourse and liability is now aligned with the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) and international practice.India is targeting a $35 trillion economy over the next 25 years. To achieve this, experts estimate that the country will require at least 30,000 billion units of energy annually.At present, India consumes just over 10,000 billion units a year, with nearly 90% sourced from fossil fuels. The maximum potential of renewable energy is also estimated at no more than 4,000-8,000 billion units annually. This leaves a deficit of at least 20,000 billion units of clean energy per year, which can only be bridged through nuclear power.In this context, the target of 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047 is merely a starting point; substantially higher capacity will be required to meet India's net-zero commitments.Such a nuclear energy transition is impossible under the existing legal and business framework, which restricts operations largely to central government nuclear utilities or public sector undertakings operating through joint ventures, and remains heavily dependent on government funding.Opening up the nuclear sector to private participation is therefore not a matter of choice but an imperative. Without the SHANTI Act, the goal of a decarbonised Viksit Bharat risks remaining unattainable.In the SHANTI Act, the three key controls - safety, security and safeguards - vest with the Centre, not with the operator, whether a PSU or a private entity. All nuclear facilities will be licenced only after meeting stringent requirements prescribed by the AERB and the Centre on these three aspects.Under the new Act, private entities may build nuclear plants subject to compliance with Government Quality Assurance norms. However, operation of any plant - whether private or PSU - will require safety licencing by the AERB. Security of nuclear facilities will be designed, implemented and maintained by the Centre, at the cost of the operator. Every gram of nuclear material handled by an operator will remain under the Centre's surveillance and control in accordance with IAEA requirements. Moreover, all irradiated fuel will be handed over to the central government, effectively ruling out any risk of proliferation.The conferral of statutory status on the AERB is also timely and reinforces its functional autonomy.Taken together, these provisions ensure that there is no compromise at any stage or on any aspect of nuclear governance. The apprehensions surrounding private participation are therefore misplaced and need to be dispelled.In the CLND Act, 2010, similar provisions existed; however, Articles 17(b) and 46 created significant ambiguity in the minds of suppliers. While the government sought to clarify these provisions through FAQs, suppliers remained unconvinced, as such clarifications did not carry the force of law. As a result, nuclear business could not be pursued at scale. Legal clarity was essential.On liability, there is currently only one operator- NPCIL. In the event of a serious accident causing damage to the public, NPCIL bears the liability. NPCIL also owns the PHWR technology and therefore functions as the supplier as well.However, the manufacturing and construction of nuclear power plants in the country are carried out by private utilities, not NPCIL. Do these private utilities assume supplier liability for equipment or construction in the event of a nuclear accident? They do not. NPCIL alone bears liability, both as operator and as supplier.Indirectly, even today, the Government of India is ultimately liable in the event of a nuclear accident in the country. Under the new regime, there is no change in the fundamental framework of operator liability, whether the operator is public or private.Operator liability is clearly defined, with liability amounts graded according to the type of nuclear activity and the capacity of the reactor involved. The maximum liability of the central government is also specified, along with provisions for the creation of a nuclear liability fund.Where the supplier is distinct from the operator, the operator retains a right of recourse. Accordingly, the supplier-whether domestic or foreign-is liable through contractual arrangements with the operator. In addition, the operator has a right of recourse against suppliers if a nuclear incident occurs due to an act of commission or omission involving malevolent intent. This right of recourse applies equally to Indian and foreign suppliers.These provisions are fully aligned with the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC), to which India is a signatory.In the event of an accident, affected members of the public are entitled to compensation under the law of the land. Once compensation is determined, the operator is required to pay within prescribed time limits. If the amount exceeds the operator's liability cap, the central government is obliged to compensate the balance. Should the compensation exceed the government's limit as well, the remaining amount is covered through the CSC mechanism.In this framework, there is no gap in public protection, and no basis for the concern that victims would be left uncompensated.
