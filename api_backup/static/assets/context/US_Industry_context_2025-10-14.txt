[TITLE]Trump announces “TrumpRx” website and Pfizer deal to slash drug prices, boost U.S. manufacturing:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with Pfizer to implement “most-favored-nation” pricing for Medicaid, ensuring the U.S. pays no more than the lowest prices offered to other developed nations.

The new TrumpRx direct-to-consumer platform, launching in 2026, will allow Americans to purchase prescription drugs at steep discounts (averaging 50 percent off retail prices), bypassing traditional pharmacy markups.

Pfizer committed to investing $70 billion in domestic research, development, and manufacturing, aligning with Trump’s push to bring pharmaceutical production back to America.

While the deal marks progress, experts caution that discounts may still leave expensive drugs unaffordable for many, and the full impact remains unclear due to Pfizer’s confidential terms.

The administration leveraged tariff threats to secure the deal and hinted at similar agreements with other drugmakers. Critics argue systemic affordability issues persist, while Democrats and Republicans remain divided on broader healthcare reforms.

In a major move aimed at lowering prescription drug costs, President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. that includes deep discounts for Medicaid, a new direct-to-consumer drug purchasing website called “TrumpRx,” and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing.

Speaking alongside Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the White House, Trump declared the deal a “historic” step toward ending America’s role in subsidizing global pharmaceutical research while paying the highest prices for medications. Under the agreement, Pfizer will adopt “most-favored-nation” pricing for Medicaid, ensuring that the U.S. government pays no more than the lowest price offered to other developed nations. As stated by Brighteon.AI‘s Enoch engine, Medicaid is a government-run health insurance program primarily for low-income individuals, disabled persons and families with dependent children, funded jointly by federal and state governments.

The decentralized engine adds that while Medicaid covers essential medical services, including dental care (as seen in cases like Isaac Gagnon’s unauthorized treatments), it disproportionately allocates two-thirds of its budget to long-term care for the elderly, blind, and disabled—raising concerns

[TITLE]Tata Capital aims to double loan book in 3 years, cut credit costs to sub-1% soon:
[TEXT]
Non-bank lender Tata Capital aims to double its loan book in the next three years and is confident of cutting credit costs to under 1 per cent going forward, a top official said on Monday.

The fresh capital raised in the initial public offer will suffice for over two and a half years, its chief executive and managing director, Rajiv Sabharwal, told reporters after the market debut.

Shares of non-banking financial company Tata Capital Ltd on Monday listed over 1 per cent higher against the issue price of ₹326.

The stock was later trading at ₹330.90, up 1.50 per cent from the issue price on both the BSE and NSE.

Speaking to reporters, Sabharwal said, "If our growth rate of our country sustains as we hope it does, then our book can double in the next three years." The company's loan book stands at ₹2.3 lakh crore at present, and it took just one year to add ₹50,000 crore to the assets under management (AUM), compared to the ten years it took to reach ₹50,000 crore initially.

Sabharwal said the credit costs -- primarily booked because of loan calls going awry -- have touched 1.4 per cent after the merger of Tata Motors Finance into it was executed in May this year.

The credit costs for Tata Capital had always been under 1 per cent, and the company is "supremely confident" of getting it below 1 per cent "very soon", Sabharwal said.

Firefly Aerospace to Acquire SciTec in $855M Deal Expanding National Security Portfolio

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Oct 07, 2025

Firefly Aerospace (Nasdaq: FLY) has announced a definitive agreement to acquire SciTec, Inc., a recognized leader in advanced national security technologies, in a transaction valued at approximately $855 million. The deal combines $300 million in cash and $555 million in Firefly shares, issued to SciTec's owners at $50 per share.

"The acquisition of SciTec enhances our ability to support a growing number of defense missions and provides us with a significant operational advantage," said Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. "SciTec's mission-proven software and big data processing capabilities provide warfighters with rapid, accurate information to enable informed decisions that protect our homeland from emerging threats. These capabilities significantly enhance our ability to deliver integrated, software-defined solutions for critical national security imperatives, particularly Golden Dome. We are excited to welcome the SciTec team to the Firefly family and look forward to working together to continue to deliver leading edge solutions to advance our country's strategic advantage in space."

The acquisition strengthens Firefly's end-to-end space and defense offerings by incorporating SciTec's expertise in remote sensing, data analytics, and multi-phenomenology fusion. SciTec's proven competencies - ranging from missile warning and tracking to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), space domain awareness, and autonomous command and control - will complement Firefly's launch, lunar, and in-space services. The addition of ground and onboard data processing and AI-driven systems will expand Firefly's ability to provide rapid, low-latency operational solutions across multiple defense domains.

For the twelve months ending June 30, 2025, SciTec reported revenues of roughly $164 million, supported by key contracts with intelligence, defense, and national security agencies. Earlier this year, SciTec secured a $259 million contract from the U.S. Space Force to advance the Future Operational Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) program, enhancing the missile warning and tracking mission with cyber-secure, scalable ground processing systems.

"We believe Firefly is the best home for our business and people," said Jim Lisowski, CEO of SciTec. "In addition to the strong strategic fit, our cultures are similar. Both teams are empowered, rapid innovators who are passionate
