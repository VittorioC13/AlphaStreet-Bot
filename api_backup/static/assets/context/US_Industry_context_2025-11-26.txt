[TITLE]Alico, Inc. Announces Financial Results for the Fourth:
[TEXT]
Diversified Land Company Strategy Proceeding as Expected: Company Completes Final Major Citrus Operations

Development Projects Advance Through Entitlement Process with Corkscrew Grove Decision Expected in 2026

Net loss attributable to Alico, Inc. common stockholders fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 of $147.3 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $22.5 million, Exceeding $20 Million Guidance

Land Sales of $23.8 million, Exceeding $20 Million Guidance

Strong Cash Generation Delivers $38.1 Million Cash and cash equivalents with total debt of $85.5 million, resulting in $47.4 million of Net Debt, Outperforming Balance Sheet Targets

Company Ends Fiscal Year 2025 with Enough Cash to Meet Expected Operating Expenses Through Fiscal Year 2027

FORT MYERS, Fla., Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alico, Inc. (“Alico” or the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) (Nasdaq: ALCO) today announces financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2025.

Management Comment

John Kiernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “Fiscal year 2025 was a pivotal year in Alico's strategic evolution as we successfully made our transformation from a traditional citrus producer to a diversified land company. Our disciplined execution has positioned us well for the next phase of our transformation. With approximately 25% of our land holdings identified for strategic development opportunities and 75% remaining in diversified agriculture, we've created a balanced platform for both near-term returns and long-term growth. As we enter fiscal 2026, we believe Alico is well-capitalized, strategically focused, and positioned to deliver sustainable value creation for our shareholders. Our goals during the next phase are to optimize the agricultural leasing programs on all of our landholdings in the near term, continuing to maintain rigorous corporate and operational cost controls, and enhancing our properties that have strategic development potential as quickly as possible.

We delivered on the commitments we made to shareholders this year by completing our final major citrus harvest and exceeding our $20 million land sales guidance with $23.8 million in land sales proceeds. Net loss attributable to Alico, Inc. common stockholders was $147.3 million; however we had Adjusted EBITDA of $22.5 million also achieving our $20 million target. We ended the year with $38.1 million in cash and reduced our net debt to $47.4 million, providing us with the financial flexibility to fund operations through fiscal year 2027 while advancing our high-value land development projects.”

Mr. Kiernan continued, “The progress of Corkscrew Grove Villages, with milestones toward regulatory approvals approaching and a final decision expected from Collier County in 2026, demonstrates the significant value creation potential within our portfolio. The establishment of the Corkscrew Grove Stewardship District and our strategic partnership with the Florida Department of Transportation and its construction contractor to design and construct a wildlife underpass as part of a planned expansion of State Road 82 are significant milestones achieved this year. The entitlement progress with our Bonnett Lake property is also progressing well. There is much for Alico to proud of accomplishing this year.”

NM = Not meaningful

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, the Company reported a net loss attributable to Alico common stockholders of $(147.3) million, compared to net income attributable to Alico common stockholders of $7.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The net loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, is principally attributable to accelerated depreciation of $162.7 million, the impairment of our young trees and the impairment of certain long lived assets at one of our groves, of $25.0 million, as a result of our Strategic Transformation and lower gains on the sale of property and equipment of $21.8 million, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $81.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by lower inventory adjustments of $9.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2025, compared to $48.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, $20.4 million of crop insurance proceeds received during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, in connection with Hurricane Milton and a change in income taxes to a benefit of $(38.4) million from a provision of $4.6 million, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, the Company had a loss of $(19.29) per diluted common share, compared to earnings of $0.91 per diluted common share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.

When both periods are adjusted for certain items, including the impairment of long-lived assets and restructuring and other changes, the Company had an Adjusted EBITDA loss for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 of $22.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively.

The majority of the Company’s citrus crop is harvested in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year. Consequently, most of the Company's gross profit and cash flows from operating activities are typically recognized in those quarters. Working capital requirements are typically greater in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year ended September 30.

Alico Citrus Division Results

Citrus production for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is summarized in the following table.

(in thousands, except per box and per pound solids data) Fiscal Years Ended

September 30, Change 2025 2024 Unit % Boxes Harvested: Early and Mid-Season 944 1,194 (250 ) (20.9 )% Valencias 1,305 1,855 (550 ) (29.6 )% Total Processed 2,249 3,049 (800 ) (26.2 )% Fresh Fruit 37 35 2 5.7 % Total 2,286 3,084 (798 ) (25.9 )% Pound Solids Produced: Early and Mid-Season 4,224 5,364 (1,140 ) (21.3 )% Valencias 6,622 9,365 (2,743 ) (29.3 )% Total 10,846 14,729 (3,883 ) (26.4 )% Pound Solids per Box: Early and Mid-Season 4.47 4.49 (0.02 ) (0.4 )% Valencias 5.07 5.05 0.02 0.4 % Price per Pound Solids: Early and Mid-Season $ 3.69 $ 2.71 $ 0.98 36.2 % Valencias $ 3.64 $ 2.88 $ 0.76 26.4 %

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, Alico Citrus harvested 2.3 million boxes of fruit, a decrease of 25.9% from the prior year. This decrease in harvested production was driven by an increase in fruit drop driven by Hurricane Milton in October 2024. However, the Company also benefited by its average realized price per pound solids rising from $2.81 per pound solids in the year ended September 30, 2024 to $3.66 per pound solids in year ended September 30, 2025, because of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana.

Land Management and Other Operations Division Results

Land Management and Other Operations includes lease income from farm leases (including leases of our citrus groves), grazing rights and hunting, as well as royalties received for mining and oil extraction rights, and other miscellaneous income.

Gross profit for the Land Management and Other Operations Division increased for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, by $1.1 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in rock and sand royalty income, sod sales and farm lease revenue, partially offset by lower grazing and hunting lease revenues due to the sale of the Alico Ranch.

Other Corporate Financial Information

General and administrative expenses increased $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2024, driven by the acceleration of depreciation on certain administrative assets and an increase in personnel and legal costs, as a result of our Strategic Transformation, partially offset by lower employee costs associated with our reduced workforce.

Other income, net, for the years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $18.0 million and $78.4 million, respectively. The decrease in other income, net was primarily due to the sale of 2,796 acres of land for approximately $23.8 million which resulted in a gain of $20.3 million, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2024, when we sold approximately 18,354 acres of land for $86.2 million and recognized a gain of $81.4 million (including 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida).

Dividend

On October 10, 2025, the Company paid a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its outstanding common stock to stockholders of record as of September 26, 2025.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity

The Company continues to demonstrate financial strength within its balance sheet, as highlighted below:

The Company’s working capital was $49.2 million at September 30, 2025, representing a 9.56 to 1.00 current ratio.

The Company maintains a solid debt to total assets ratio. At September 30, 2025 and 2024, the ratios were 0.43 to 1.00 and 0.23 to 1.00, respectively.

Available borrowings under our line of credit were $92.5 million, at September 30, 2025.

Real Estate Development or Land Development

In March 2025, the Company announced the creation of Corkscrew Grove Villages located on approximately 4,600 acres at the northwest corner of Collier County on the border of Lee and Hendry counties. As envisioned, Corkscrew Grove Villages is expected not only to provide future residents with ample opportunities to live, work and play in a growing part of Collier County, but will also enhance public infrastructure, permanently protect thousands of acres of sensitive land, and enhance wetlands and water resources. The villages are anticipated to provide significant economic benefits to the region, and improvements are expected to come at no additional cost to Collier County taxpayers. This plan consists of two 1,500-acre villages accompanied by more than 6,000 acres of permanent conservation areas. There could be approximately 9,000 homes in total, or 4,500 homes per village. Offerings will include a variety of options suitable for working families, essential workers and retirees. Corkscrew Grove Villages will also include approximately 375 income-restricted units per village, with the goal of ensuring that the local essential workforce will be able to live and work in Collier County. With approximately 560,000 square feet in total commercial space, or 280,000 square feet expected per village, Corkscrew Grove Villages is expected to offer a dynamic blend of retail, dining, office, medical and light industrial opportunities. Designed as a complete, connected community, Alico plans to thoughtfully integrating residential, commercial and civic spaces to create a place where people can live and work, all aiming to ease traffic congestion and enhance convenience. Collier County and Southwest Florida continue to experience significant growth, particularly in eastern Collier County. We believe Corkscrew Grove Villages are ideally situated at the intersection of Collier, Lee and Hendry counties, providing future residents with easy access to Naples, Fort Myers, Miami and Tampa through links to I-75 in Collier and Lee counties and State Road 80 in Hendry County.

Alico launched its multi-year entitlement approval effort for Corkscrew Grove Villages by submitting an application to Collier County for local approval for the first of two villages. While the long-term vision for Corkscrew Grove Villages includes two villages, Alico’s current application with Collier County only seeks approval for the East Village as a first step. This process is anticipated to take approximately one year, with the final decision by the Collier Board of County Commissioners expected in 2026. Additionally, Alico has submitted permits to the South Florida Water Management District and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for both villages which are undergoing agency review; timing and outcomes remain uncertain. Construction on the first village could begin in 2028 or 2029, if all approvals are granted.

As part of the Company’s long-term planning efforts, Alico took the proactive step in January 2025 to seek legislative approval from the Florida Legislature to establish the Corkscrew Grove Stewardship District, and in June 2025 it was established. The Corkscrew Grove Stewardship District assists Alico in its efforts to effectively finance infrastructure, help restore and manage natural areas and oversee the administration of the master planned communities and lands within the District. Stewardship districts like The Corkscrew Grove Stewardship District are special districts authorized to plan, finance, construct, operate and maintain public infrastructure in planned developments. These kinds of districts are common, and are used in a variety of communities, such as Ave Maria and Lakewood Ranch, to support high-quality and efficient infrastructure. Stewardship districts are created around the concept of growth paying for itself.

In November 2025, the Company announced a strategic partnership with the Florida Department of Transportation (“FDOT”) and its construction contractor to design and construct a wildlife underpass as part of a planned expansion of State Road 82 to four lanes in Collier County. The wildlife underpass will align with a proposed wildlife corridor connected to the Company’s Corkscrew Grove Villages project. Alico has committed approximately $5 million toward design and construction costs related to the wildlife underpass. Construction of the underpass is expected to begin before the end of 2025, subject to final approvals, in conjunction with the current State Road 82 widening project, with work currently expected to be completed in 2027. Alico plans to support construction through the Corkscrew Grove Stewardship District and expects to be reimbursed for these costs by the District once it raises funds.

Alico remains deeply committed to regional conservation efforts and has a long history of working with state and local governments, as well as environmental organizations to protect environmentally sensitive land. Over the past 40 years, Alico has transferred lands that have become part of the Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem Watershed (CREW), Tiger Creek Preserve and Okaloacoochee Slough Wildlife Management Area. Alico’s legacy of commitment to conservation continues as part of the Corkscrew Grove Villages project as we place another 6,000 acres of sensitive land into permanent conservation.

In 2023, Alico sold more than 17,000 acres of land, commonly referred to as Devil’s Garden, to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection as part of the Florida Forever program. Located in Hendry County, the Devil’s Garden provides critical connectivity between existing conservation lands. Since Devil’s Garden was added to the Florida Forever Priority List in 2003, Alico has either sold or entered into easements to protect more than 46,807 acres. This land, combined with the more than 6,000 acres expected to be placed in conservation as part of the Corkscrew Grove Villages proposal, supports the implementation of the Florida Wildlife Corridor.

Alico’s regional conservation strategy is also consistent with the Collier Rural Land Stewardship Area (the “RLSA”). The RLSA is a planning and zoning overlay district approved by Collier County in 2002 for approximately 185,000 acres of land in eastern Collier County. The RLSA is an innovative, incentive-based approach to planning and implementing sustainable long-term growth in rural regions. The program has received national recognition and served as a model for rural lands stewardship program elsewhere in Florida. Specifically, both Stewardship Sending Area 11 and SSA 22 permanently preserve significant segments of the Florida Wildlife Corridor, with SSA 22 adding 1,295 acres and being approximately 2.8 miles long, north to south, and more than 1.8 miles wide at its widest point with an average width of 0.7 miles. This critical portion of the Florida Wildlife Corridor is expected to be added at no cost to the taxpayer.

[TITLE]Report: Tech-enabled litigation and AI threaten to destabilize insurance industry:
[TEXT]
Tech-driven search engines, scam emails and data scraping are threatening to destabilize the property insurance marketplace nationwide if left unchecked, a new report finds.

The research project, by Ohio-based financial analysis firm Demotech, finds that “tech-enabled litigation instigation” is growing into a predatory, covert business model that pushes insured property owners into the litigation process often before a claim has even been filed.

In existence since 2017, the practice is growing again thanks to artificial intelligence capabilities, which can harm property owners by forcing them into a pricey lawsuit process that requires big payouts to law firms and threatens the collapse of insurance companies operating in risk-prone areas, such as Florida.

Tactics under the practice include search engine optimization and pay-per-click advertising that pushes property owners to litigants rather than to insurance companies where the insured person can file a claim. The report found the practice increases the time it takes for property owners to receive a claim and the number of claims closed without payment.

The threat has drawn the attention of U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene battered mountainous regions in the western part of the state last year, and U.S. Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, which also faces inland hurricane threats. The lawmakers have developed a proposal to impose a federal tax on the third-party litigation funding profits, which seeks to make litigation financing less attractive and therefore mitigate the growing trend.

“These coordinated, high-tech scam and email attacks exploit post-storm confusion, capitalize on consumer crises, and accelerate carrier litigation to unsustainable levels. Alarmingly, it is not just homeowners who are being victimized. It is the entire insurance industry and the U.S. transportation economy — industries which serve as a critical safety net for property owners and business stability nationwide — that are subjected to an online, covert business model built on systematic online instigation to secure contested or litigated claims,” Demotech President Joe Petrelli said.

“In one recent time period in Florida, a group of carriers that failed had a 3% market share of premiums, yet saw their market share of new, annual litigated claims grow to nearly 20%. I knew that this phenomenon of meteoric growth in new, annual litigated claims was caused by ‘something new,’ a realization that led to this groundbreaking research project, and Todd’s discoveries.”

The report highlights threats that had already existed, including “nuclear verdicts” — awards exceeding $10 million that drive insurance premiums — and “social inflation,” with a rise in insurance costs that outpaces real inflation.

But it points out the threats are mounting with the insurgence of “tech-enabled litigation instigation,” a practice that targets insured property owners seeking a claim through various business tactics and often through third-party non-lawyers. The cost to settle a claim through the litigation process can be up to 360% higher than a non-litigated claim, according to an Office of Insurance Regulation study.

Already, this litigation practice has attracted tens of billions of dollars in third-party litigation funding, the Demotech study found.

Petrelli developed the study, which was then conducted by Todd Kozikowski, a digital risk intelligence consultant and CEO of 4Warn.

The study calls for litigation reform and its authors describe the proposal from Tillis and Hern viral in addressing current litigation practices. In the meantime, the report also calls for consumer vigilance, by contacting an insurance provider directly about a claim rather than clicking a link in a pop-up or unsolicited email.

[TITLE]United Construction Buys Queens Property From Madison Realty Capital for $64M – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
United Construction and Development Group, a prolific developer in Queens, has acquired an office and retail building in the borough’s Flushing neighborhood.

United Construction, run by Chris Jiashu Xu, purchased the three-story, 104,292-square-foot property at 41-60 Main Street from Madison Realty Capital for $64.25 million, according to the seller’s broker, JLL.

The building on the corner of Main Street and Sanford Avenue is fully occupied and hosts office tenants Capital One Bank, Preferred Bank and MassMutual Insurance. Retail tenants at the property include Chinese bakery Fay Da Bakery and JD Drug Store.

JLL’s Ethan Stanton, Michael Mazzara, Drew Isaacson and Brendan Maddigan brokered the deal for the seller, while no brokers represented the buyer.

Spokespeople for United Construction and Madison Realty Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Crain’s New York Business first reported the news.

News of the deal comes after Madison Realty Capital acquired the Flushing property in February 2024, as Commercial Observer previously reported.

Bankrupt developer Jeffrey Wu handed off the building to Madison Realty Capital — a creditor — for $80 million after filing a Chapter 11 petition in 2020 to initiate bankruptcy proceedings for his company, Flushing Landmark Realty. Madison Realty Capital had previously provided a $66 million bridge loan for Wu to refinance two Flushing properties in 2014.

It’s unclear what Xu intends to do with his new property, but the developer already has a lineup of projects planned for Queens.

Over the summer, Xu filed plans to build a 39-story, 387-unit residential tower at 23-07 43rd Avenue in Long Island City, as well as a two-tower, 630-unit residential property at 61-06 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park, Crain’s reported.

[TITLE]Cemtrex Enters into Agreement to Acquire Invocon, Adding Proven Aerospace & Defense Engineering Capabilities:
[TEXT]
Hauppauge, NY, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- - Cemtrex, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETX), a diversified industrial and technology company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Invocon, Inc., a Texas-based systems-engineering firm with a 40-year history designing, manufacturing, and supporting mission-critical instrumentation, wireless sensing systems, and flight hardware for aerospace, defense, and advanced government programs

Invocon’s technologies have been deployed across satellites, launch vehicles, target missiles, space shuttles, and the International Space Station, including 17 shuttle systems, 10 ISS systems, and numerous next-generation flight programs for major primes and government agencies.

Invocon also holds a deep intellectual property portfolio, including multiple U.S. patents related to hypervelocity impact detection, gridless lethality assessment, acoustic and RF sensing, and advanced flight-system telemetry. Invocon’s systems have been used in over 40 shuttle flights, over 30 target missile flights, and a range of high-reliability space and defense missions requiring precise sensing in extreme environments.

This acquisition represents a significant strategic expansion for Cemtrex, bringing in capabilities in high-reliability electronics, flight instrumentation, wireless data acquisition, lethality assessment systems, and complex system design, all supported by a long-standing and experienced engineering team.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cemtrex will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Invocon for $7.06 million, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close on or around January 1, 2026.

Cemtrex Chairman and CEO Saagar Govil commented, “Invocon brings nearly four decades of experience building flight-proven hardware and advanced sensing systems for some of the most demanding aerospace and defense applications. Their technologies have supported shuttle missions, ISS systems, target missiles, and major prime-led flight programs. This is a highly specialized engineering organization with capabilities that are extremely difficult to replicate, and it fits directly with our long-term strategy of expanding into high-reliability and mission-critical technologies.”

Govil continued, “This acquisition provides the foundation for Cemtrex’s new Aerospace & Defense segment and positions us to participate in a wider range of engineering programs that require precision, durability, and deep technical expertise. Invocon’s heritage in flight hardware, wireless telemetry, impact detection, and high-reliability electronics aligns with opportunities across traditional aerospace, defense modernization efforts, and emerging commercial-space markets over the long term.”

Following the closing, Cemtrex expects to establish a new reporting segment, Aerospace & Defense, with Invocon serving as the cornerstone for expanding into advanced engineering programs for government agencies, prime contractors, and next-generation commercial-space customers.
