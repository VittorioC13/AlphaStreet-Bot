[TITLE]O5 Group Buys Retail Building Across From Penn Station for $30M:
[TEXT]
O5 Group, a real estate investor and manager, has acquired a retail building across the street from Midtown’s Penn Station.

New York-based O5 Group, which rebranded from Oved Group in 2022 and specializes in apparel, real estate and finance, purchased the three-story building at 425 Seventh Avenue from United Pacific Development for $30 million, according to city records made public Wednesday.

Ralph Dweck, an attorney at Wachtel Missry, signed the deal for the buyer, which used the entity FO 425 Seventh Avenue, while Sze Chan signed for the seller, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. A spokesperson for O5 Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Chan could not be reached for comment.

United Pacific bought the property between West 33rd and West 34th streets — and across Seventh Avenue from Penn Station — in 2006 for $4.1 million, property records show. The low-rise building’s ground-floor retail space is currently home to Rose’s Pizza.

It’s unclear what O5 Group plans to do with its new property, but the company owns nearly 10 other retail properties throughout New York City in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, according to its website.

News of the deal also comes after a slew of big leasing news near Penn Station, an underground train and subway hub in New York City that is said to be the busiest transportation facility in the Western Hemisphere.

Earlier this month, fintech firm Robinhood signed a sublease for 125,392 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust’s Penn 2, which sits above the train hall, as Commercial Observer previously reported. At the same time, Dick’s Sporting Goods signed a lease for 125,284 square feet of office space at Penn 2, while fintech firm Current took more than 62,000 square feet at the property.

Announced planned exit of non-core businesses (Kincaid and American Drew casegoods and Kincaid upholstery)

Announced proposed closure of UK manufacturing facility

Strategically realigned leadership and corporate staffing to focus on core businesses

To be substantially completed by the end of the fiscal year, these initiatives combined will reduce sales by approximately $30 million, net, and increase margins by 75-100 bps

MONROE, Mich., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in the retail and manufacture of residential furniture, today reported second quarter results for the period ended October 25, 2025. For the quarter, sales totaled $522 million, up slightly against the prior year comparable period, reflecting growth in Retail and Wholesale segments, offset by a decline in Joybird sales. Operating margin was 6.9% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and 7.1% on an adjusted(1) basis. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.70 on a GAAP basis and $0.71 on an adjusted(1) basis.

Second quarter total written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) grew 4% versus a year ago and written same-store sales (which exclude the impact of both newly opened stores and newly acquired stores) were down 2%. This represents a continued sequential improvement in written same-store sales trends over the last two quarters against a challenging consumer and macroeconomic environment.

Melinda D. Whittington, Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We were pleased to deliver modest sales growth, particularly in our Wholesale segment where we also again delivered margin expansion, continuing to create our own momentum in what remains a choppy landscape. We are investing in the business for the long term, as highlighted by the opening of 15 new company-owned stores in the last 12 months and the advancement of our distribution and home delivery transformation project. Furthermore, in the beginning of our third quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of a 15-store network in the southeast U.S. region. Our Century Vision strategy to grow our Retail store footprint and expand brand reach is working and positions us to disproportionately benefit when overall industry volumes rebound.”

Whittington added, “In addition to investing in our core, vertically integrated North American upholstery business, we are proactively taking steps to optimize our portfolio. We have announced plans to exit our non-core wholesale casegoods and upholstery businesses in the back half of the fiscal year, announced the proposed closure of our U.K. manufacturing facility, and strategically realigned our commercial leadership and corporate staffing to enhance operating efficiency. On top of this, leveraging our North American manufacturing base with ~90% of finished goods produced in the U.S., we are successfully navigating the current trade and tariff volatility. Our iconic brand, well positioned manufacturing base, strong balance sheet, and talented team provide the foundation for continued growth and margin expansion.”

Third Quarter Outlook :

Taylor Luebke, SVP and Chief Financial Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We expect fiscal third quarter sales to be in the range of $525-545 million (growth of 1-4% year-over-year) and adjusted operating margin(2) to be in the range of 5.0-6.5%, reflecting advancement of our Century Vision initiatives, friction costs related to portfolio and supply chain optimizations, and a measured view on the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.”

[TITLE]Inside Crocs marketing: What they do differently on social media (and why it works):
[TEXT]
If there’s any brand that understands the power of the comeback, it’s Crocs. Its most recognizable product—lightweight, perforated clogs—were a fashion staple in the early to mid-2000s. However, the fallout from the 2008 global recession paired with overproduction left the American footwear business in a precarious state.

But nearly 20 years later, Crocs has emerged stronger than ever.

With the help of a new executive team and a refreshed marketing strategy (including social media marketing), Crocs increased its annual global revenue from $1.2 billion in 2014 to $4.1 billion in 2024.

The number of Crocs stores worldwide also hit its highest point in seven years as of 2024, with a total of 390 stores. Although the United States has the highest proportion of Crocs storefronts, the brand has expanded globally, with most of its international retail shops in South Korea (95), China (51) and Japan (21).

Crocs’ revival is undeniably impressive, and its social strategy has been a driving force in its overall marketing success.

In this guide, we’ll break down Crocs’ approach to social media and what you can learn from it.

Crocs’ marketing strategy is embedded in their brand ethos

Although its style can be polarizing, Crocs is unapologetic

[TITLE]Hot, Fast and Everywhere: The Rise of the Air Fryer in the American Kitchen:
[TEXT]
It's Wednesday, around 6 p.m. It's been a busy day, but I'm already carving a perfectly roasted chicken on my favorite ebony cutting board, the bird's juices spilling out from under crispy skin and filling up the board's reservoir like a moat.

For years, Ina Garten's roasted chicken — or some variation of it — has been something of a Sunday tradition for me. It's not particularly decadent or overly involved, but it's reserved for Sundays because of its 2-hour total cooking time. Now, the same recipe, but adapted for the air fryer, hits the table in well under an hour.

After months of owning an air fryer and experimenting mostly with versions of traditionally fried foods, such as wings, fries and chicken cutlets, I made my first air fryer roast chicken on a whim. Stunned by the speedy cooking time — 25% faster than traditional roasting — tender meat and impossibly crispy skin without the usual tablespoon of butter, I haven't put a bird in the oven since.

Of all the kitchen tools I've collected, and there are many, the air fryer has shifted my cooking paradigm the most, making cooking easier, faster and more foolproof. Few and far between are air fryer fails, and frequent are the discoveries of something I'd been "making wrong" all along until I roasted it quickly under spiraling superconvection heat.

Save for the rare batch of cookies or large cut of meat for a dinner party, the air fryer has all but replaced my oven. I plan meals around it: If a recipe calls for the use of my oven — meat loaf, roasted salmon, charred cauliflower — I consider how I might adapt it for the air fryer.

Celebrated chef and restaurateur Stephanie Izard shares my enthusiasm. "It's such a versatile tool," the James Beard Award winner tells me. "I use mine all the time for dinners," she adds, naming fried rice, marinated chicken and salmon as a few of her go-tos. "It's like making one-pot meals — but roasted!"

We're not alone.

According to a CNET survey, over 70% of US adults either own or plan to own an air fryer within the year. Additional studies estimate that

[TITLE]Gap ties viral marketing to retail results as Gen Z relevance rises:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Gap saw comparable sales, an important measure of retail health, rise 7% year over year to $951 million for the fiscal Q3 period ended Nov. 1, according to an earnings statement from parent Gap Inc. Momentum for the Gap brand was propelled by a viral ad campaign which achieved 8 billion media impressions and more than 500 million views across platforms.

The music-oriented “Better in Denim” effort, which sees girl group Katseye dance to Kelis’ 2003 song “Milkshake,” generated significant traffic and double-digit growth in the denim category. Gap is now the No. 6 adult denim brand in the U.S., up two spots from 2024. The earnings report marked Gap’s eighth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth.

Executives described “Better in Denim” as one of Gap’s most successful campaigns to date and emblematic of a revamped marketing strategy that has won Gen Z over to an apparel maker that for years seemed in the wilderness in its bids to retain cultural relevance and find solid business footing.

“This campaign demonstrated the power of the playbook in action, featuring trend-right product, amplified by culturally relevant storytelling,” said Richard Dickson, CEO of Gap Inc., on a call discussing the Q3 results with investors. Dickson later reiterated prior comments that the Katseye collaboration was a “true cultural takeover” relying on a methodology Gap will continue to build on in the future.

By the numbers 7% Year-over-year comparable sales growth for the Gap brand during its fiscal Q3 8B Amount of media impressions generated from Gap's viral "Better in Denim" fall campaign with Katseye No. 6 Gap's ranking among adult denim retailers in the U.S., up two spots from 2024

“Better in Denim” did not appear out of the blue. Gap has run several seasonal marketing pushes that star on-the-rise musicians as they dance to established hits by different artists. Pop singer Troye Sivan led Gap’s fall-focused denim campaign in 2024, with elaborate choreography set to Thundercat’s “Funny Thing.” Gap earlier this month also debuted its 2025 holiday marketing campaign, centered on a cover of Miley Cyrus’ “The Climb” by Sienna Spiro. “Give Your Gift” extends Gap’s mission to connect different generations through “music, creativity and culture,” Dickson said of the seasonal blitz, and promotes products made with a proprietary CashSoft fabric as gift ideas.

Gap’s musical selections try to tap into trends on platforms like TikTok, reflecting a larger shift in the retailer’s approach to media. While more social-first marketing has been successful for Gap, it also requires higher quality and higher volumes of creative, according to Dickson. To link social content closer to transactions, Gap and sister brands Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta last month launched a creator affiliate and advocacy platform.

“We’re driving digital dialogue messages, with social media as the No. 1 platform for our consumers,” said Dickson. “Influencer content is among the most common product discovery methods amongst Gen Z and millennials, which we’ve been performing incredibly well with.”

Beyond appealing to younger cohorts, Gap is also attracting more high-income shoppers, bolstered by designer collaborations like its recent work with Sandy Liang. Gap joins other retailers that have deployed savvy marketing and culturally impactful partnerships to stave off some of the expected disruptions caused by tariffs and associated pullbacks in consumer discretionary spending.

American Eagle, a Gap rival, also went viral and scored new customers with a fall ad campaign themed around denim that featured actor Sydney Sweeney. Unlike Gap, American Eagle’s campaign garnered national attention for criticism that its messaging — which equated good genetics with good jeans — could be interpreted as problematic.

[TEXT]
Online fashion retailer Myntra ’s rapid commerce arm, M-Now, is driving 10% of orders in locations where the service is live. The service is currently available in some pincodes in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Pune. Launched last November , M-Now has scaled to 80 dark stores and reached customers in over 940 pincodes. The service has achieved 20% customer penetration within active locations, according to the company.“The introduction of M-Now has been pivotal in providing elevated shopping experiences to digital-first shoppers who value convenience and speed,” said Nandita Sinha , chief executive, Myntra, in a statement.The platform has reported over 35 million unique visitors so far. M-Now promises delivery within 30 minutes to two hours for categories such as fashion, beauty and home decor.“...our focus will be to sharpen the offerings … while addressing the last-minute fashion needs of customers,” Sinha added.Walmart-owned Myntra launched M-Now last year, at a time when quick commerce players were expanding beyond groceries to include apparel, appliances, makeup, and other items to increase their average order value (AOV).Fashion and beauty brand Nykaa has also expanded its quick commerce service , called Nykaa Now, to seven cities. It has 53 stores for Nykaa Now from where it makes these deliveries, which take between 30-120 minutes.Other companies in the segment include Nexus Venture Partners-backed Slikk, TDV Partners-backed Zulu Club and Kae Capital-backed Knot.Myntra has been pouring in funds to expand its presence in the highly competitive and investment-heavy rapid-delivery segment. Indeed, the company's parent noted in its June quarter earnings that Walmart International’s gross profit rate was weighed down by rising investments in India’s fast-growing quick commerce market through Flipkart and Myntra.

[TITLE]Grisso Launches Clinically-Validated, Precision Probiotic Line Amid Growing Consumer Demand for Science-Backed Wellness Solutions:
[TEXT]
ONTARIO, CA, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ONTARIO, CA - October 20, 2025 - -

Grisso, a microbial science company, today announced the launch of its clinically-validated, precision probiotic product line, entering a market increasingly defined by consumer skepticism and demand for clinical validation. The launch comes as the global probiotic supplement market faces mounting criticism over efficacy claims, with consumers expressing frustration over generic formulations that fail to deliver measurable results.

Recent industry research indicates that consumer trust in the supplement industry has reached a critical juncture. A growing segment of health-conscious consumers is actively seeking products backed by rigorous clinical evidence rather than marketing claims. This shift in consumer behavior has created an opening for brands that can demonstrate both scientific rigor and manufacturing transparency. Grisso's entry into this landscape represents a response to what founder Pamela Garcia describes as "the probiotic industry's trust problem."

"Consumers are overwhelmed by vague claims and products that don't deliver," Garcia said. "We're focused on transparency—showing the research, controlling the manufacturing process, and targeting specific health outcomes rather than making broad wellness promises." This philosophy underpins the company's product development strategy, which centers on addressing specific health concerns rather than offering general wellness support.

The company's initial product portfolio includes G-Serein, formulated to support sleep quality and stress management, G-Sylph, designed specifically for women's gut health, and G-Serene 4-In-1 Women's Health Prebiotic + Probiotic, a clinically studied formulation for vaginal health, urinary tract wellness, and yeast balance. Each formulation delivers 100 billion CFU per serving and is built around Weizmannia coagulans BC99, a patented probiotic strain and an international award winner at the 2025 NutraIngredients Awards. The strain has been the subject of multiple clinical studies examining its effects on digestive health, metabolic function, and athletic performance. By centering its product line around a single, extensively researched core ingredient rather than combining multiple strains with limited individual evidence, Grisso aims to offer what it terms "precision probiotic solutions" with clear, targeted biological objectives.

What distinguishes Grisso's approach from many competitors is its operational structure. Unlike most supplement brands that rely on contract manufacturers and third-party suppliers, Grisso operates its own integrated research and manufacturing facility. This vertical integration model, more commonly associated with pharmaceutical production than dietary supplements, allows the company to maintain direct oversight of every stage of development and production. From initial strain cultivation through final product testing and packaging, all processes occur under the company's direct supervision. This end-to-end control structure addresses one of the most significant pain points in consumer trust: the lack of transparency in supplement supply chains.

Industry observers note that this manufacturing approach, while capital-intensive, may resonate with an increasingly sophisticated consumer base. As wellness consumers become more educated

[TITLE]Meesho in talks for pre-IPO placement ahead of listing next month:
[TEXT]
Mumbai: Social e-commerce platform Meesho is in early talks with domestic and foreign institutional investors for a pre-IPO placement as it prepares for a public listing next month, three people familiar with the matter said.

"The company is looking to raise anywhere between $50-70 million as part of the pre-IPO placement," one of these people said, adding that the size of the company's IPO would change once the pre-IPO placement went through. "The company is talking to several global sovereign wealth funds who are keen to come in pre-IPO," this person added.

“Meesho is in active discussions with institutional investors as there is a lot of demand for the asset," said a second person, adding that the conversations would progress based on price discovery over the next 7-10 days. Meesho decline to comment.

The company is set to join a number of new-age startups including Groww, Lenskart, Pine Labs and PhysicsWallah that have gone public this quarter, marking one of the busiest periods in the capital markets this year.

Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter, that the company was in talks with SBI Funds Management Ltd. for a pre-IPO placement, seeking a valuation of $6 billion.

IPO details

Meesho, which filed updated draft IPO papers on 18 October after a confidential filing earlier this year, is expected to raise ₹4,250 crore in fresh capital, and sell 175.6 million existing shares under an offer for sale (OFS). Shareholders who will sell shares include Elevation Capital, Peak XV Partners, Y Combinator, Vidit Aatrey, Sanjeev Kumar, Man Hay Tam and VH Capital. It has appointed Kotak Mahindra Capital, Axis Capital, Morgan Stanley India, JPMorgan and Citigroup to help with the issue.

Meesho, which switched its base from the US to India in May, was among the firms that received approval for its IPO from Sebi last month.

The company said it would use the proceeds for cloud infrastructure in its subsidiary Meesho Technologies Pvt. Ltd, to pay salaries to its existing and replacement hires for the machine learning and AI and technology teams, for branding and marketing, and to fund acquisitions.

Founded in 2015 by Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal, Meesho’s operating revenue jumped 25% to ₹9,390 crore in FY25, while net loss widened to ₹3,941 crore from ₹327.6 crore in FY24. Its platform offers small businesses and individual entrepreneurs access to millions of customers, pan-India logistics, payment services, and customer-support capabilities.

Meesho, which focuses on online shoppers in tier-2 and tier-3 towns and beyond, has raised more than $1.3 billion in private funding in total, and is backed by prominent investors including Softbank, WestBridge Capital and Fidelity Investments. The company was last valued around $4 billion in 2023.
