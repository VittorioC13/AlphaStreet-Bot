[TITLE]Huel’s global marketing director: ‘Not everything needs to look beautiful and polished’:
[TEXT]
William Paterson tells Tim Healey why authenticity beats perfection, why sometimes a “weird, rough-looking ad” performs best, and how the nutrition brand is shifting from direct response to long-term brand building.

You’ve worked at Deutsche Telekom, M&C Saatchi, AKQA and UDG. Since 2017 you’ve led global marketing at Huel and you also sit on the advisory board at Meta. Can you give us a quick tour of your career so far?

I studied visual communication and advertising at UDK in Berlin. Like most graduates, I dreamed of landing a junior creative role at a top ad agency, but I struggled. I didn’t have the right connections, and the competition was fierce.

Then, by chance, I was offered a role at Deutsche Telekom. I was completely underqualified, but because I was bilingual and a native English speaker, they took a chance on me. It wasn’t a creative job. It was marketing, and it completely changed my trajectory.

That’s where I first got into the nuts and bolts of digital. PPC, SEO, online funnels, campaign analytics. I was fascinated by how it all worked to drive real results. I was hooked. I even studied for a second degree in online marketing while working full-time. That was when I knew this was what I wanted to do.

I still loved the creative side, but what really excited me was performance. Seeing numbers move. Understanding how to scale something. That’s what led me into agency life. I started at M&C Saatchi. I was the only digital person there and probably one of the most junior. But it didn’t matter. I was in the room, and I was learning fast.

These days everything is integrated, but 15 years ago it was different. I was “the digital guy,” so I was across all their social media campaigns, running Facebook fan pages for brands like Kinder Chocolate and Ferrero. I did that for a few years and found I really enjoyed the client services side of things.

Next, I moved to AKQA, where everyone was very digitally savvy. I worked on brands like Nike and Rolls-Royce. The role was much more focused on the technical delivery side of things.

I soon realized that wasn’t creative enough for me. I wanted to do more than just project management. That’s when I joined UDG. I worked solely on Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, creating campaigns for their wearables and smartphone devices. The work was all

[TITLE]AXIL Brands, Inc. Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AXIL Brands, Inc. (“AXIL” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: AXIL), an emerging global consumer products company for AXIL® hearing protection and enhancement products and Reviv3® hair and skin care products, announces its financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2025 (“1Q26”).

Financial Highlights for the Quarter Ended August 31, 2025

Net sales in 1Q26 were $6.9 million, as compared to $5.9 million in the prior year period, an increase of 17.2%

Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 67.6% in 1Q26, compared to 71.0% in the prior year period

Operating expenses were 61.6% of net sales in 1Q26, an improvement from 73.4% in the prior year period

Operating income improved to $0.4 million, or 6.0% of revenue, in 1Q26, from an operating loss of $0.1 million, or (2.4%) of revenue, in the prior year period

Net income was $0.3 million in 1Q26, compared to a net loss of $0.1 million in the prior year period

Adjusted EBITDA in 1Q26 was $0.7 million, a 291.3% increase from $0.2 million in the prior year period

Net cash used in operating activities for 1Q26 was $0.7 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $0.9 million in the prior year period

Cash on hand as of August 31, 2025 was $4.1 million, compared to $4.8 million as of May 31, 2025

Basic and diluted earnings per share for 1Q26 were $0.05 and $0.04, respectively, compared to a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.02 in the prior year period

Recent Business Highlights

Expanded into Costco with the introduction of the XCOR SE earbud (in-store and online at Costco.com) and the X30i filtered earplug bundle pack (Costco.com only)

Launched the full Reviv3 Procare® product line in Chatters, Canada’s largest salon retailer with more than 115 salons

“Our first quarter results reflected a revenue mix more heavily weighted to the retail channel than any of our previous quarters. Initial shipment of our AXIL® hearing products to a new national membership-based retail chain was a key driver of this mix shift and helped our total revenue grow 17% year-over-year,” commented Jeff Toghraie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AXIL.

“The combination of a slight increase in sales and marketing expenses to support this incremental offline retail business, combined with fiscal discipline in managing other corporate expenses, allowed us to demonstrate significant operating leverage in the quarter. Despite the $1 million in revenue growth – or 17% total revenue growth and 25% revenue growth from AXIL-branded hearing products only – in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, operating expenses were flat year-over-year and declined as a percentage of sales to 62% in the quarter from 73% in the prior year period. The result was an increase of $0.4 million in net income from a net loss of $0.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to net income of $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and an increase of $600,000 in EBITDA on a year-over-year basis and a swing to positive EBITDA for the quarter. The combined effect of higher revenue, a greater wholesale mix, and expense control led to solid profitability and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 versus a diluted loss per share of $0.02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

“Over the last 18 months, our strategic focus has been to diversify our revenue channel mix and develop a more stable and balanced mix of online sales via our own e-commerce website, offline retail, and international distribution. Historically, our e-commerce channel has accounted for an overwhelming majority of our revenue, but in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we saw clear signs that our strategy is working, and our financial results reflect this progress. An increased mix of wholesale retail revenue should continue to benefit the Company, as this channel offers greater profitability and operating leverage than our online e-commerce channel. While gross margins alone are slightly higher in the e-commerce channel than in the wholesale channel, our online sales also carry with it greater sales and marketing expenses and customer acquisition costs than the offline retail channel.

“We continue to look for additional retail distribution channels for our advanced hearing enhancement and protection products. An increased retail presence, along with the benefits of our historical and current online marketing efforts, should help raise customer awareness and turn AXIL products into a sought-after hearing protection and enhancement brand on the market.

“Along with a goal of increased retail presence, we will continue to innovate to deliver high-performance, ergonomic, and desirable products. Our product roadmap includes the introduction of numerous new products or next-generation products in the coming two to three quarters, beginning with the next generation GS Extreme 3.0 product that is set to launch in time for the holiday season.

“Turning to the balance sheet, inventory increased appreciably, though that was expected given the increased product supply needed to service our wholesale segment and an initial purchase order from a new customer. We expect that to normalize over time. Cash at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was $4.1 million, which we believe is sufficient for us to internally fund our strategy and growth objectives.

“Lastly, I’d like to provide some insights on our hair and skin care segment that sells our flagship Reviv3® line of hair care products. While much of our resources over the last few years have been focused on growing the hearing protection segment, we see a pathway for the hair and skin care segment to become more than just a dormant or hidden asset for the Company. We have already made strategic leadership additions to that business segment and expect to further bolster the team with additional experienced leaders with proven success in the beauty industry. Our new relationship with Chatters, Canada’s premier salon chain, was established shortly after bringing on a new leader, indicating that leadership can make a meaningful impact. We are optimistic that making leadership additions to this segment will be accretive to the Company and deliver sustainable shareholder value, especially in the professional beauty channel.

“We remain focused and disciplined in our execution as we strive for meaningful long-term growth across both of our product segments. We have built a strong foundation that supports sustainable growth and operational efficiencies and are encouraged by our first quarter results and the business trends seen thus far in fiscal 2026,” concluded Mr. Toghraie.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company calculates EBITDA by taking net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), and adjusting for income taxes, interest income or expense, and depreciation and amortization. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted for stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is also presented as a percentage of revenue, which is calculated by dividing the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and management considers EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA important indicators in evaluating the Company’s business on a consistent basis across various periods for trend analyses. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management

[TITLE]Meeting of 10-11 September 2025:
[TEXT]
Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Wednesday and Thursday, 10-11 September 2025

1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options

Financial market developments

Ms Schnabel started her presentation by noting that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 23-24 July 2025, interest rate markets in the euro area and the United States had been pulled in different directions, leading to a convergence of policy rate expectations. In the euro area, expectations for interest rates had shifted higher, with reduced uncertainty around the rate outlook, as a consensus had formed that interest rates were currently in a “good place” and close to or at the end of the monetary policy cycle. Markets had fully priced out any rate cut at the current meeting and assigned a significantly lower probability to another 25 basis point rate cut by year-end. The median participant in the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts anticipated no further rate cuts in 2025, while the median respondent in both the Bloomberg and Reuters surveys did not expect any further rate cut in the current cycle. In the United States, market expectations of a quicker easing cycle had increased after weak labour market data. As a result, the gap between the one-year rate one year ahead in the euro area and the United States had narrowed to its lowest level since September 2024.

The bulk of the adjustment in market expectations for ECB monetary policy since June 2025 had occurred after the Governing Council’s June and July monetary policy meetings, which had been interpreted as signalling that no further rate cuts were imminent. Subsequent data releases had confirmed and reinforced this new baseline path. Moreover, uncertainty around the expected rate path had decreased. This stood in contrast to developments in the United States, where option-implied probabilities suggested that US rate uncertainty remained elevated.

The key fundamental driver of the gradual convergence in policy rate expectations had been the narrowing gap in the economic outlook between the euro area and the United States. Consensus Economics growth expectations for the euro area in 2025 were now well above their levels prior to the US tariff announcement on 2 April, and expectations for 2026 had declined only mildly. By contrast, growth expectations for the United States for both 2025 and 2026 had been revised down sharply. Developments in the inflation outlook seemed to be less in line with the converging rate outlook. In the euro area, investors’ inflation expectations had stabilised at around the ECB’s inflation target. By contrast, medium-term inflation compensation in the United States had trended higher after the drop in April, despite the substantial downward revision in US growth expectations over the same period.

Market pricing of looser US monetary policy could be explained by pointing to the fact that, over the past year, US interest rates had become far more sensitive to surprises in US non-farm employment figures than in previous years. Sensitivity to US inflation surprises had, however, fallen to close to zero, indicating that investor focus in the United States had shifted towards real economic data.

In the euro area, medium and longer-term interest rates had remained broadly stable over recent months. In the United States, the slight decline in the ten-year rate since April 2025 had been due to offsetting factors. Investors expected a more accommodative monetary policy stance in the United States, but at the same time demanded higher compensation for the various risks surrounding that scenario, including potential risks to US public debt sustainability.

Yields on 30-year bonds had reached historically high levels in some advanced economies. This had contributed to a steepening of the yield curve at the very long end. However, from a longer-term perspective, this steepening appeared to be a normalisation after a long period of compressed term premia, as yield curves remained much less steep than before the start of large-scale asset purchases across most major central banks.

In spite of the narrowing interest rate differential, the exchange rate had remained broadly constant. The largest part of the appreciation of the euro in 2025 could be explained by relative demand and sentiment. Important drivers of exchange rate developments had been the announcements of tariffs and the subsequent trade agreements. A comparison of bilateral exchange rate movements of a broad set of currencies against the US dollar showed that the initial depreciation of the US dollar against almost all currencies after the April tariff announcement had been followed by an appreciation after the July tariff agreements, partly reversing the April moves.

Despite political uncertainty in France, sovereign bond spreads vis-à-vis the German Bund had remained range-bound for euro area countries, with the euro area GDP-weighted sovereign spread having steadily declined since its peak in the autumn of 2022. The dispersion of ten-year sovereign spreads across euro area countries stood at its lowest level since 2007, before the global financial crisis. This showed that fragmentation in euro area sovereign bond markets had declined in spite of the ongoing reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet and higher short and long-term rates.

One factor supporting euro area government bond markets had been the renewed interest of foreign investors. Since Eurosystem net asset purchases had ended, the euro area had seen a sharp increase in foreign inflows. Two main factors explained this renewed foreign demand for euro area assets. First, euro area government bonds currently offered more attractive yields than US Treasuries or Japanese government bonds when adjusted for currency hedging costs. Second, the narrowing gap in the economic outlook between the euro area and the United States as well as concerns

[TITLE]The tangled Greek-Cypriot cables, the populism over Rouchi, Telis and the media rumors, the Arabs in ONEX, Alessandra at the Spetses Marathon:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 6 03:38

-Greetings, let’s agree that yesterday’s announcement by the Cypriot President Christodoulides wasn’t exactly… an announcement from a Cypriot leader to Greece, i.e., his “little brother,” and a bit of restraint wouldn’t hurt—especially when it’s clear to everyone that if anyone is putting roadblocks in the way, it’s not Athens. That the Crete-Cyprus electricity interconnection project had festered is well known, with the risk not only of the project being canceled and causing a significant financial burden on ADMIE and, by extension, the Greek consumer, but also of putting in question the unbreakable front between Athens and Nicosia, ultimately serving Turkey’s goal of derailing the project. Now, at Maximos Mansion yesterday, they kept their cool, and common sense along with the national line of “Greece and Cyprus are always together” prevailed. K. Mitsotakis and N. Christodoulides met in New York and agreed, as stated in the joint communiqué, on the next steps for the GSI.

Viability…

-The project will, of course, move forward once the fundamental doubts

[TITLE]Levi’s Q3 Profits Top Estimates as CEO Michelle Gass Grows More Bullish on the Year:
[TEXT]
Levi Strauss & Co. is riding the denim cycle higher — and continuing to bust out of its traditional role as a men’s jeans brand.

Adjusted third-quarter profits inched up 1.5 percent to $136 million, with earnings per share of 34 cents coming in 3 cents ahead of the 31 cents analysts forecast, according to Yahoo Finance.

Revenues for the three months ended Aug. 31 rose 7 percent to $1.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations and enough for chief executive officer Michelle Gass to boost Levi’s outlook for the year.

“Our strategies are working and this is giving us the confidence to raise our top- and bottom-line guidance,” Gass told WWD. “We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of high-single-digit organic growth. [Produced] record gross margin once again, despite the impact [of] the tariffs. This was now our 14th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth.”

Gass, who’s been CEO at Levi’s since January 2024, has been building on and sharpening the company’s efforts to expand its own direct-to-consumer business, which currently accounts for 46 percent of sales, and bring in more women shoppers.

It’s been a very step-wise approach-building quarter after quarter, but investors wanted something more at first blush and traded shares of the company down 5.8 percent to $23.10 in after-hours trading on Thursday, retrenching some after a 40 percent increase this year.

But Gass’ focus is clearly on the business.

“This pivot from being a jeans company to a head-to-toe denim lifestyle company is well underway and resonating,” Gass said. “We still have growth across genders — men’s up 5 percent, women’s up 9 percent. The brand has never been stronger.”

The company just wrapped up a yearlong marketing campaign with Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and is now featuring Grammy-nominated country artist Shaboozey in its ads, rounding out what’s been a year focused on Levi’s connection to music.

“We enter holiday with confidence,” Gass said. “It is an uncertain environment, but I will tell you that we are really focused on executing our strategy.”

That strategy has seen the company close the Levi’s footwear business, exit the lower-priced Denizen brand and sell Dockers in July.

“Now it’s all

Whether you’re on the market for a knit blazer to pair with your baggy jeans or maxi skirt; have a soft-spot for the viral Mary Jane style from Rothy’s, made of recycled water bottles; want to treat your face to some stylishly oval sunglasses from Celine; or are looking to stand out from the crowd with a raincoat that swaps the traditional tans and blacks for an invigorating shade of blue, all this and more is possible to shop on nordstrom.com right now.

That being said, we urge you to shop early for the very best chance at amping up your fall wardrobe with the outerwear, footwear, dresses, and even cozy pajamas that will make you even more excited for the seasonal shift.

This is a particularly great opportunity to get your hands on the luxe brands that have long been on your wishlist (but were a tad bit too pricey to invest in).

[TITLE]Ireland Embedded Finance Market Databook 2025 Tracks 100+ KPIs Across Embedded Payments, Lending, Insurance, Banking and Wealth in Ireland:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Ireland Embedded Finance Market Size & Forecast by Value and Volume Across 100+ KPIs by Business Models, Distribution Models, End-Use Sectors, and Key Verticals (Payments, Lending, Insurance, Banking, Wealth) - Databook Q4 2025 Update" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The embedded finance market in Ireland is expected to grow by 7.6% on an annual basis to reach US$1.90 billion by 2025.

Ireland's embedded finance market has experienced robust growth during 2021-2025, achieving a CAGR of 10.9%. This upward trajectory is expected to continue, with the market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2026 to 2030. By the end of 2030, the embedded finance market is projected to expand from its 2024 value of US$1.77 billion to approximately US$2.36 billion.

Key Trends and Drivers Shaping Embedded Finance in Ireland

Ireland's embedded finance ecosystem is evolving through sector-specific entry points - retail credit, travel, insurance, and payments - driven by consumer demand for convenience and businesses' need for new monetization channels. Regulatory and infrastructure frameworks are still maturing, particularly in areas such as lending and BaaS, but recent activity signals growing momentum.

Over the next 2-4 years, embedded finance in Ireland is likely to transition from isolated use cases to more structured, compliance-aligned ecosystems anchored in partnerships between platforms, regulated entities, and embedded finance infrastructure providers. The pace and scope of this evolution will be shaped by regulatory clarity, digital adoption patterns, and the role of multinational platforms operating in the Irish market.

Consumer Credit Is Being Embedded into Online Retail and Travel Ecosystems

Ireland is witnessing increasing integration of credit and financing options directly into e-commerce and travel platforms, allowing consumers to access point-of-sale lending during their purchase journey. BNPL offerings are being embedded by both local and international players in retail and ticketing ecosystems. Notably, Humm, a regulated point-of-sale finance provider, has expanded its partnerships with travel platforms such as Sunway Travel and airlines like Ryanair to offer installment-based payment options to Irish consumers.

The shift is being driven by strong consumer demand for flexible payment models amid rising cost-of-living pressures. According to the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), Irish households are becoming more price-sensitive and budget-conscious, especially in the 18-35 age group. Merchants are embedding credit at checkout to reduce cart abandonment and improve conversion metrics, while fintechs and banks are leveraging APIs to integrate financing options directly into retail environments.

Embedded consumer credit is expected to intensify in sectors beyond retail and travel, including education, elective healthcare, and home improvement. Growth will be shaped by further e-commerce digitization and regulatory oversight of BNPL, especially as the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) finalizes its stance on proportional regulation. Market expansion will depend on ecosystem partnerships and the ability of providers to manage credit risk in a higher interest rate environment.

Insurance Is Being Embedded into Car Sales, Property Platforms, and Gig Platforms

General insurance products, especially auto, property, and gig-related cover, are increasingly being embedded at the point of sale across digital platforms in Ireland. Similarly, platforms like Daft.ie have begun integrating home insurance referrals during property listing journeys, while gig platforms are offering embedded personal accident and liability covers.

Consumer preference for seamless, bundled services and insurers' interest in reducing acquisition costs are driving this shift. Additionally, regulatory clarity from the Central Bank of Ireland on digital distribution of insurance products has created room for platform-led experimentation. Cross-sector partnerships between InsurTech firms and aggregators like Chill Insurance and Coverinaclick.ie are further facilitating embedded offerings.

Embedded insurance is likely to stabilize and expand into niche verticals such as mobility-as-a-service (e.g., shared scooters) and freelancer platforms. Adoption will be conditional on platform scale, consumer trust, and regulatory compliance. Growth will also depend on the ability of insurers to leverage data partnerships for dynamic pricing and claims automation.

Embedded Payments Are Expanding Across Mobility, Retail, and Subscription Commerce

Ireland's embedded payments ecosystem is deepening, with digital wallets, in-app payments, and contactless integrations embedded across services such as ride-hailing (Bolt), food delivery (Just Eat), and media platforms (Spotify). Embedded payment rails are also being developed in the offline space, with QR-based and mobile-based checkout options integrated into Irish retail outlets through providers like Stripe and Square.

Embedded payments will intensify, particularly within subscription commerce and IoT-based experiences (e.g., connected cars and appliances). Real-time payments infrastructure enhancements under the EU's Instant Payments Regulation may enable new forms of embedded bill payment and merchant settlement models. The landscape will also be shaped by PSD3 compliance and emerging rules on consumer data access and protection.

Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) Platforms Are Enabling New Entrants to Embed Financial Products

Ireland is seeing the early adoption of Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) models that allow non-financial companies to offer white-labeled accounts, cards, and payment features. While not as mature as in the UK or Germany, local activity has picked up through platforms like Fire Financial Services, which offers embedded accounts and card services to Irish SMEs and platforms. International BaaS providers such as Railsr and Solaris have also entered the Irish market via cross-border licenses.

Ireland's Fintech ecosystem - centered around Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) - has created a supportive environment for financial API providers. Moreover, Ireland's role as a European hub for multinational tech companies has encouraged the localization of embedded financial services. Regulatory sandbox support and alignment with European open banking norms under PSD2 have lowered integration barriers for startups and platforms.

The BaaS model is expected to expand gradually, especially in the SME sector and niche verticals like B2B SaaS platforms and e-commerce infrastructure providers. Growth may be tempered by licensing complexity, especially if the Central Bank of Ireland tightens oversight of non-bank license holders in line with evolving European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines.

Regulatory Friction Around Consumer Lending and Data Use Is Influencing Embedded Finance Models

Regulatory scrutiny around BNPL, consumer data use, and digital distribution is influencing how embedded finance products are structured and offered in Ireland. The Central Bank of Ireland's increased focus on consumer credit regulation and fair lending practices is prompting providers to reassess underwriting models and customer disclosures. The ongoing EU Data Act and Digital Markets Act are also influencing API access norms and third-party data sharing.
