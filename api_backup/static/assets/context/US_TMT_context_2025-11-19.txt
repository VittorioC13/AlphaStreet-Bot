[TEXT]
FORT WORTH, Texas, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SEGG Media Corporation (Nasdaq: SEGG, LTRYW) (“SEGG Media” or “the Company”) today announces it has signed a binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) to acquire Triggy.AI (“Triggy”), an artificial intelligence technology company specializing in dynamic ad‑revenue formats and gamified engagement solutions. The proposed acquisition is scheduled to close on or before November 28 and will represent a significant advancement in SEGG Media’s technology capabilities to strengthen recurring revenue, deepen audience engagement and scale monetization across its global digital ecosystem.

Founded more than five years ago by experienced gaming and sports‑technology entrepreneurs, Triggy has developed an advanced AI engine used by multiple international brands that drives engagement and advertising optimization for several international brands. Its proprietary platform delivers personalized, real‑time user interactions that increase dwell time, engagement, and conversion which contribute to predictable monthly recurring revenue from enterprise clients.

Integrating Triggy’s technology across SEGG Media’s portfolio, including flagship brands Sports.com, Lottery.com and Concerts.com, will strengthen the Company’s ability to deliver next-generation content formats, data‑driven advertising, and immersive fan experiences at scale.

Tim Scoffham, CEO of Sports.com Media Group and Lottery.com International, said:

“Dynamic and adaptive technology is essential to the future of SEGG Media. Adding Triggy enhances our ability to deliver responsive and personalized user experiences while equipping our partners with powerful monetization tools. This marks another major step in how we leverage AI to differentiate our digital ecosystem and unlock new revenue streams.”

Stefen Thurnberg, Founding Partner of Triggy, added:

“This is an exciting milestone for Triggy. Joining SEGG Media will give us the scale, reach, and strategic support to accelerate the evolution and impact of our technology across multiple global brands.”

Matt McGahan, President, CEO, and Chairman of SEGG Media, said:

“Artificial intelligence sits at the heart of SEGG Media’s long‑term strategy. Embedding AI into our core operations ensures we remain globally competitive, technologically differentiated, and focused on sustained shareholder value. Acquiring Triggy reinforces our commitment to investing in advanced technology that drives both innovation and profitability.”

The acquisition of Triggy will strengthen SEGG Media’s position at the intersection of sports, gaming, and entertainment technology. Triggy’s platform will serve as a foundational revenue engine powering higher CPMs, deeper user engagement, scalable SaaS-style recurring revenue, and cross-platform monetization opportunities across Sports.com, Concerts.com and Lottery.com.

[TITLE]The software companies most likely to be acquired as AI eats the world:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for "opportunistic" buyers.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.

According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.

"We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity," the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

A chart showing software M&A activity RBC Capital Markets

While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.

While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.

Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

Asana (ASAN): Under pressure amid rising AI-native competition and ongoing industry consolidation, the workplace and project management company remains a potential takeover target despite its founder-controlled voting structure.

Box (BOX): With growth stagnating and shares undervalued, the cloud content management company could attract private equity buyers seeking to reset expectations or strategic acquirers interested in its horizontal content platform.

Confluent (CFLT): Positioned attractively in the data streaming layer, Confluent could appeal to a strategic buyer seeking deeper data infrastructure capabilities.

Coursera (COUR): Despite headwinds in EdTech, Coursera's large learner base and AI partnerships make it an appealing target for strategic buyers or as a cornerstone for a PE-led rollup.

Dropbox (DBX): Lacking the scale advantages of larger cloud storage rivals, Dropbox could become a target if new products underperform, with greater value realized as part of a bigger platform.

DocuSign (DOCU): If the e-signature company's identity access management pivot fails to gain traction, DocuSign could attract private equity interest, though its valuation may deter many bidders.

Elastic (ESTC): Elastic's GenAI momentum and leadership in search make it a logical target for strategic consolidation.

Five9 (FIVN): With strong contact-center-as-a-service (CCaaS) technology and margin improvement potential, Five9 could appeal to enterprise companies such as Salesforce or Cisco, or to private equity once leadership stabilizes.

Fastly (FSLY): Its solid edge-computing technology and reasonable valuation could make Fastly an attractive target to acquirers such as Google or Cisco.

Gen Digital (GEN): With stable margins, strong cash flow, and revenue synergies, the cybersecurity and fintech platform could be a compelling buyout candidate for private equity.

GitLab (GTLB): GitLab's growing presence in developer security operations and GenAI developer tools positions it as an appealing strategic acquisition.

ZoomInfo (GTM): This company's valuable customer relationship management data and integration potential make it a fit for large platforms such as Salesforce or a PE candidate for operational optimization.

N-Able (NABL): Its foothold in the fragmented managed service provider and small and medium-sized enterprise market makes N-Able an attractive consolidation play for private equity.

NICE (NICE): Misunderstood by markets and undervalued, NICE's CCaaS and compliance businesses could unlock value through a takeover or breakup.

Nutanix (NTNX): As hybrid-cloud adoption grows, Nutanix's scale and SaaS shift could make it a strategic target for major IT vendors.

PagerDuty (PD): PagerDuty fits as a logical acquisition to strengthen an integrated IT operations platform.

Qualys (QLYS): High margins and leadership in vulnerability management make Qualys an attractive consolidation target within the cloud security sector.

Rapid7 (RPD): Following restructuring and a pivot from cybersecurity toward DevSecOps, Rapid7's improved cash profile could appeal to private equity buyers.

Teradata (TDC): Its progress in cloud analytics positions Teradata as a potential acquisition target for large vendors or PE firms.

Varonis (VRNS): Focused on data security and governance, Varonis is well placed for a strategic GenAI-driven acquisition.

Zoom (ZM): While a sale is unlikely soon, Zoom's best-in-class video platform could entice acquirers seeking synergies in AI and collaboration.

[TITLE]How Peak XV's Shailendra Singh is building the firm for the next decade:
[TEXT]
Mumbai: Riding on its outsized successes of being one of the earliest backers of recently listed firms such as Groww and Pinelabs, India-focused venture capital firm Peak XV is building its strategy for the next decade. Estimates suggest the firm has taken home more than $3.5 billion in exits over the past 24-30 months, clocking more than 10x returns. A large part of this has come from the listing of its marquee portfolio companies, such as Mamaearth, GoDigit, Awfis, Ixigo, Bluestone and Mobikwik.

Marking two decades of its existence in India, Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India) plans to continue backing category-defining companies and corner large stakes by doubling down. In an interview with Mint, Shailendra Singh, managing director and one of the founding members of the firm, talks

[TITLE]Bone AI raises $12M to challenge Asia’s defense giants with AI-powered robotics:
[TEXT]
South Korea’s major defense giants have amassed roughly $69 billion in order backlogs as of late 2024, according to media reports. Seoul is also accelerating investment in advanced weapons systems and expanding its defense ties, particularly with Europe. With the new EU-South Korea Security and Defence Partnership in 2024 and growing exports of vehicles and artillery, the country has become the second-largest arms supplier to European NATO members.

Yet despite that enormous industrial footprint, remarkably few startups have emerged to match or challenge the incumbents. The country’s defense-tech startup scene is still nascent, exposing a wide gap between Korea’s manufacturing strength and its early-stage innovation.

Bone AI, a new startup based in Seoul and Palo Alto, California, launched earlier this year with an ambitious plan to build a fully unified AI platform that ties together software, hardware, and manufacturing.

The company develops next-generation autonomous air (UAVs), ground (UGVs), and marine (USVs) vehicles for defense and government clients, focusing largely on B2G contracts. While it ultimately aims to operate all three types of systems, Bone is starting with its defense-focused aerial drones, which are designed to streamline missions such as logistics support, wildfire detection, and anti-drone defense.

The company, founded by DK Lee (who also co-founded MarqVision), has raised a $12 million seed round led by Third Prime with participation from Kolon Group, a South Korean strategic investor that has expertise in developing advanced materials and manufacturing. Kolon is an ideal strategic partner for Bone, which operates across AI, robotics, and next-generation manufacturing, Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.

The startup is already generating revenue, landing a seven-figure B2G contract and pulling in $3 million in its first year of operation, Lee noted. In addition, Bone has been selected as a winner in a South Korean government-backed end-to-end logistics program that will deploy UAVs and UGVs powered by its autonomy stack.

When asked how a company less than a year old is already securing contracts and generating revenue, Lee told TechCrunch that Bone acquired a South Korean drone company called D-Makers, and its intellectual property (IP), just six months after launch. Originally focused on AI models for robotics, Bone is now integrating its existing AI division with the newly acquired company, and more acquisitions are on the horizon, he added.

Lee personally committed more than 10% of the round, approximately $1.5 million, he told TechCrunch. “That was important to me because I wanted to show both investors and my team that I’m fully invested, financially and emotionally, in this mission,” he said.

A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree

Since 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications. But the rules weren't always so strict. In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity. "Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'" he remembers. "I was astonished!" In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership. US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned. Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.

Jeff Stein's story brought a swift reaction in Washington

In the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret. But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: "There was nothing illegal

[TITLE]Growth in China's tech stocks just getting started, JPMorgan banker says:
[TEXT]
The recovery of China's tech stocks from their trough is still at an early stage, as the country's emergence as an artificial intelligence superpower reshapes global platforms and lures Western capital back, according to a senior investment banker at JPMorgan.

As Chinese entrepreneurs expanded their businesses globally and deepened their involvement in AI, their companies and fundraising plans were once again drawing the attention of international investors after years of stagnation, said Mark Fiteny, the US bank's head of Asia-Pacific technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) and new economy.

"Investors hold a lean-forward sentiment because they are underexposed in their portfolios to these AI trends in China," Fiteny said in an interview ahead of the firm's annual TMT conference in Asia, which concludes in Hong Kong on Tuesday.

[TITLE]Deal restores Cornell's federal grants, reviving research on infant artificial heart:
[TEXT]
Deal restores Cornell's federal grants, reviving research on infant artificial heart

After a deal with the White House, researchers at Cornell will receive their federal grants. For one scientist, that means resuming work on an implantable artificial heart for babies and toddlers.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We have an update this morning on the story of a researcher at Cornell University who is developing an artificial heart for babies and toddlers.

JAMES ANTAKI: It's about the size of a AA battery, and it's so close to being used to save lives and children.

INSKEEP: James Antaki was among the researchers who had their federal grants canceled by the Trump administration as it tried to impose its power on universities.

ANTAKI: We feel like collateral damage.

INSKEEP: And then, Cornell became the third elite college to make a deal with the administration over claims of antisemitism and accusations that diversity programs are racial discrimination. NPR's Elissa Nadworny brings us up to date.

ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: I spoke to James Antaki a few days after he got the email officially restarting decades of work on the PediaFlow - an implantable artificial heart.

ANTAKI: I think the overwhelming reaction was this relief and maybe disbelief.

NADWORNY: Antaki's grant was among about $250 million in federal grants restored after Cornell made a deal with the White House, formally accepting the administration's interpretation of civil rights laws. Part of the deal requires the Ivy League school to pay the government $30 million and also invest $30 million in agriculture over the next three years. Now the rebuilding has to begin, which Antaki says is daunting.

ANTAKI: Every time I feel sorry for myself, I have to catch myself and say, This is not about me. It's so much bigger than me.

NADWORNY: About 1 in 100 babies in the U.S. are born with congenital heart defects. Antaki's device would help young kids with the most serious conditions, like Caleb, the 4-year-old boy and his mom, Nora Strickland, that we met in our original story. I called them to share the news.

Dr. Antaki's grant was unfrozen.

NORA STRICKLAND: Oh, my God. Are you serious? Wow. I just got goosebumps.

NADWORNY: This renews her hope for families like hers. Caleb is on an artificial heart called a VAD, awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Caleb's VAD hangs outside his skinny little body, and it has to be plugged into the wall, meaning he and his family can't go home.

How is Caleb doing in general?

STRICKLAND: He's good. He's doing really well. Doesn't let the VAD keep him from being him.

NADWORNY: She sends me a video of Caleb building a volcano with Magna Tiles.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CALEB STRICKLAND: We're going to have another mini volcano. Record the eruption.

STRICKLAND: Alright.

(SOUNDBITE OF MAGNA TILES COLLAPSING)

STRICKLAND: Whoa.

NADWORNY: He knocks the creation over. Later, Nora tells Caleb the news of Antaki's grant.

STRICKLAND: How does that make you feel that you changed the course of medical history?

CALEB: Good.

STRICKLAND: Yeah?

CALEB: So did I change, like, the wall or something?

STRICKLAND: You did, Bubby (ph). Because one day, kids aren't going to have to stay in the hospital when they have a VAD. One day, they're going to have a VAD that they can go home on.

CALEB: Now can we play video games?

STRICKLAND: (Laughter) Yeah. I'm just really proud of you.

NADWORNY: Back in Ithaca, New York, Dr. Antaki has a long road ahead. He has to rehire a team, line up a manufacturer for the prototype, and then prepare to test the pump in animals.
