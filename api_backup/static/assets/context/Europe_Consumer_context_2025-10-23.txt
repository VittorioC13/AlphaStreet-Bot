The annual membership cost to enter Costco’s big-box warehouses and stock up on bulk groceries — not to mention the free food samples — has gone up. But that’s not stopping fans from becoming or remaining loyal members.

Since September 2024, individual members in the U.S. pay $65 per year, a $5 increase from past dues. Executive memberships have been $130 per year, up from $120.

But loyalists of the Issaquah, Washington-based retailer weren’t dissuaded: 68.3 million people held individual memberships by the end of fiscal 2025 — an upsurge from 63.7 million in 2024 and 58.8 million in 2023, according to Costco’s annual report filed this month with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The number of business memberships also increased to 12.7 million in 2025 from 12.5 million in 2024 and 12.2 million in 2023.

Despite the increases, the growth rate of total paid members has slowed slightly, with a 6% increase year over year, compared to a 7% increase in 2024 from 2023.

Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business,” the company wrote in the report.

So far, it has maintained that faith. Costco boasted a membership renewal rate in the U.S. of

Market Overview

The global yoga clothing market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, evolving from a niche segment into a multi-billion dollar industry. The market's valuation increased substantially from USD 19,252.97 million in 2018 to USD 33,341.52 million in 2024, reflecting a period of intense consumer interest and brand investment. Looking ahead, the forecast period of 2025 to 2032 is poised for continued strong performance, with a projected CAGR of 8.23% leading to an estimated market size of USD 65,660.34 million by 2032. This growth is not merely a consequence of more people practicing yoga; it is intricately linked to the broader wellness movement and the "athleisure" phenomenon.

Modern consumers demand apparel that offers performance-enhancing features like moisture-wicking, four-way stretch, and breathability, without compromising on aesthetic appeal. Brands are responding with versatile collections that cater to both athletic pursuits and casual, everyday wear. For instance, the rise of remote work has further boosted demand for comfortable yet presentable clothing, with yoga pants and tops becoming staples in the work-from-home wardrobe. This convergence of fashion, fitness, and lifestyle continues to broaden the consumer base for yoga apparel far beyond dedicated yoga practitioners, solidifying its position as a significant and enduring category in the global apparel industry.

Key Growth Determinants

The proliferation of health and wellness consciousness on a global scale is the primary determinant of growth for the yoga clothing market. Consumers are increasingly proactive

New Delhi [India], October 19 (ANI): With consumers in both urban and rural areas showing greater flexibility in spending, driven by GST reforms and easing inflation, Fast-Moving Consumer Goods ( FMCG ) companies have begun setting more ambitious growth targets Firms want to utilise the enhanced consumer spending by developing products and solutions that align with evolving consumer preferences while contributing to a responsible and resilient supply chain."As we step into the next chapter, our focus remains on innovation, inclusivity, and sustainability, shaping a stronger, more future-ready FMCG business," said Salloni Ghodawat, CEO, Ghodawat Consumer Limited as the firm set an ambitious goal to reach the Rs 1,500 crore revenue milestone over the next three years. The company has already surpassed Rs 1,200 crore in revenue, maintaining consistent double-digit growth.GCL, with its twenty-three years of operations, has solidified its presence in key markets, such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, backed by celebrity endorsements, regional campaigns, and a strong digital-first approach. With over Rs 25 crore invested annually in marketing, GCL leverages data-driven insights and real-time performance tracking to maximise campaign impact.The company further says that it is actively utilising e-commerce as the stream is showing impressive growth because consumers are making online purchases more than ever.Observing the trend, the Union Bank of India , in its report, added that new GST reforms have set the stage for the consumption-led growth of India. GST 2.0 has been hailed as a "GST booster shot" for consumption-led growth, with major reliefs announced for sectors including FMCG, among other sectors. Bank of Baroda , in a report, observed that the consumption in India is expected to register a net gain of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore from September onwards, driven by the recent Goods and Services Tax (GST) rationalisation, which will help the firms.The report estimated that the net gain to consumption would be in the range of Rs 0.7-1 lakh crore, which amounts to around 0.2-0.3 per cent of the country's GDP.

[TITLE]AI and online shopping: how Shein, Temu and others get you hooked:
[TEXT]
In recent years, several websites selling ultra-low-cost goods have appeared on the French market. Shein, Temu and AliExpress, to name but a few, are shaking up the online retail landscape. According to a study conducted by BPCE Digital & Payments, the number of payment cards recording at least one monthly transaction on a discount site increased by 20% between the first quarters of 2022 and 2023.

This is hardly surprising given that Temu’s website has millions of French visitors every month, according to data from the Federation of E-commerce and Distance-Selling (FEVAD). In mid-July 2025, low-cost platforms accounted for 22% of parcels handled by the French postal service, compared with 5% five years ago. This increase is set to continue, with the sector expected to grow by a total of 6.5% in 2025.

Of course, the rampant inflation in France in recent years partly explains this craze. But this is not the only explanation for these developments. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is at the heart of the business model of these platforms, helps to build consumer loyalty.

Read more: The secret behind Temu’s rock-bottom prices

Behavioural profiling

In our latest articles on Shein and Temu, we analysed how these platforms operate behind the scenes. By analysing user behaviour data, the AI tools used by the platforms can identify the customers most likely to make a purchase and tailor the advertising messages they receive.

Predictive algorithms also analyse user behaviour to offer personalised recommendations. This approach aims to create a need before it even arises, by playing on feelings of scarcity and urgency. This is the famous Fomo, or “fear of missing out”.

These predictive algorithms have been around for many years, but their new capabilities, “augmented” by AI tools, are ushering in a new era, adapting even more finely and quickly to each Internet user. At the bottom of each page, there is a list of “items also viewed” by other users, which are similar to the product being searched for. This classic marketing technique is taken a step further: algorithms constantly submit new content to the customer to study their reaction. Every reaction (such as a click to add an item to a basket) is analysed in real time. The algorithm, supported by AI, then uses this data to encourage the user to buy other products that they did not initially come to look for.

Using play to sell

Gamification refers to the use of game mechanics for marketing purposes to capture customers’ attention.

On the Temu app, the interfaces are inspired by gambling games, which are known to be particularly addictive: wheels of fortune, countdowns highlighting limited-time offers, gifts and promotional codes to unlock, etc. These constant stimuli create a sense of urgency in the user, while disrupting the biochemical mechanism of the reward circuit. AI allows for greater precision and diversification of the “games” offered, to the detriment of buyers (and without their full awareness).

On Temu, mini-games integrated into the mobile app (such as Farmland and Fishland) promise free items and discount coupons. Points and voucher systems are used to encourage users to return to the site as often as possible, and personalised notifications are also sent at opportune moments, based on data collected

[TITLE]Retail giant Muji halts online sales after ransomware attack on supplier:
[TEXT]
Japanese retail company Muji has taken offline its store due to a logistics outage caused by a ransomware attack at its delivery partner, Askul.

On Sunday evening (Japan timezone), Muji said that the issue caused all retail services were affected, including browsing or making purchases on online stores, viewing order histories via the Muji app, and displaying some web content.

Although the company did not specify a timeline for restoring the systems, an update on Monday afternoon stated that only purchases from the online store and applying for a monthly flat-rate service continued to be impacted.

Muji also said that it was investigating which shipments were impacted to determine the orders placed before the attack and send email notification to customers.

A retailer of minimalist household goods, clothing, and furniture, Muji operates more than a thousand stores in Japan, China, Singapore, Europe, Australia, and North America.

The company has an annual revenue of roughly $4 billion, and it employs over 24,500 people worldwide.

Askul is a large business-to-business and business-to-consumer office supplies and logistics e-commerce company owned by Yahoo! Japan Corporation.

The company issued a statement yesterday, informing that it was targeted by ransomware that caused operational disruptions.

“Currently, a system failure has occurred on the Askul website due to a ransomware infection, and we have suspended orders and shipping operations,” reads the announcement (machine translated)

“We are currently investigating the scope of the impact, including the leakage of personal information and customer data, and will notify you as soon as we know.”

Product return applications, receipt mailing, catalog shipping, and collection services have been suspended, while Askul’s customer service desk is also unreachable right now, by phone or through the website.

Given that Askul only handles Muji’s Japan sales, the disruption only impacts that region, and Muji’s shops in other countries are available and operating normally.

At the time of writing, no ransomware gangs have announced Askul on their extortion portals.

This incident comes shortly after another ransomware attack on Japan’s largest beer producer, Asahi, that forced it to suspend production operations and delay scheduled product launches.

The attack was claimed by Qilin ransomware. The company confirmed in a statement that the hackers stole data from its systems.

Recent Announcement

As previously reported, during the third quarter, NBHC announced the execution of a definitive agreement and plan of merger, dated September 15, 2025, with Vista Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation and the holding company for Vista Bank (“Vista”), whereby NBHC will acquire Vista in a transaction with an aggregate transaction value of approximately $365.4 million based upon NBHC’s closing price of $37.96 on September 15, 2025.

Upon completion of the transaction and on a pro forma basis, the combined company will have approximately $12.4 billion in assets and $10.4 billion in deposits.

Net income increased $1.3 million to $35.3 million or $0.92 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2025. Fully taxable equivalent pre-provision net revenue increased $0.2 million to $43.6 million. The return on average tangible assets increased five basis points to 1.54%, and the return on average tangible common equity increased three basis points to 14.21%. Adjusting for $1.7 million of pre-tax acquisition-related expenses, net income increased $2.6 million, or 30.3% annualized, to $36.6 million, or $0.96 per diluted share. Adjusted, the fully taxable equivalent pre-provision net revenue totaled $45.4 million, an increase of $1.9 million or 17.5% annualized. The adjusted return on average tangible assets was 1.60%, an increase of 11 basis points, and the adjusted return on average tangible common equity was 14.72%, an increase of 54 basis points.

Net Interest Income

Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $0.9 million to $90.2 million due to one additional day during the third quarter. The fully taxable equivalent net interest margin widened three basis points to 3.98%, driven by a four basis point increase in earning asset yields, partially offset by a one basis point increase in the cost of funds.

Loans

Loans totaled $7.4 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $7.5 billion. We generated quarterly loan fundings of $421.2 million, led by commercial loan fundings of $288.0 million. The third quarter’s weighted average rate on new loans at the time of origination was 6.9%, compared to a weighted average yield of 6.5% on the loan portfolio.

Asset Quality and Provision for Credit Losses

The Company recorded a provision release of $1.5 million, compared to no provision in the previous quarter. This quarter’s provision release was primarily driven by the recovery of one previously charged off credit. Annualized net recoveries totaled 0.05% of average total loans, compared to annualized net charge-offs of 0.05% in the previous quarter. Non-performing loans improved nine basis points to 0.36% of total loans at September 30, 2025, and non-performing assets improved eight basis points to 0.37% of total loans and OREO at September 30, 2025. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 1.19% at September 30, 2025, consistent with the previous quarter.

Deposits

Average total deposits remained consistent with the prior quarter at $8.2 billion, and average transaction deposits (defined as total deposits less time deposits) remained consistent at $7.1 billion. The loan to deposit ratio totaled 87.7% at September 30, 2025, compared to 90.5%. The mix of transaction deposits to total deposits was 86.3% at September 30, 2025, compared to 87.0%.

Non-Interest Income

Non-interest income increased $3.6 million, or 21.2%, to $20.7 million during the third quarter. Unrealized gains on partnership investments increased $3.5 million, and mortgage banking income increased $0.3 million.

Non-Interest Expense

Non-interest expense totaled $67.2 million, compared to $62.9 million in the second quarter, and included $1.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the recent launch of 2UniFi. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $2.9 million primarily driven by 2UniFi’s software asset depreciation. The third quarter’s salary and benefits expense included one additional payroll day in the quarter, a $0.7 million fair value adjustment on the deferred compensation liability, and $0.1 million higher mortgage commissions as a result of increased mortgage production.

Income tax expense totaled $7.9 million, compared to $7.5 million in the previous quarter, as a result of higher pre-tax income in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.2%, consistent with the second quarter.

Capital

NBHC executed $8.8 million of share buybacks in the third quarter as part of its ongoing capital strategy. Capital ratios continue to be well in excess of federal bank regulatory agency “well capitalized” thresholds. The tier 1 leverage ratio totaled 11.49%, and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio totaled 14.69% at September 30, 2025. Shareholders’ equity increased $22.4 million to $1.4 billion at September 30, 2025, primarily driven by $23.8 million of growth in retained earnings from net income after covering the quarter’s dividend, and a $4.9 million improvement in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to changes in the interest rate environment. These increases were partially offset by the impact of share buybacks.

Common book value per share increased $0.81 to $36.36 at September 30, 2025. Tangible common book value per share increased $0.81 to $27.45 driven by the quarter’s earnings after covering the quarterly dividend and a $0.13 improvement in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These increases were partially offset $0.07 by the impact of share buybacks.

Year-Over-Year Review

(All comparisons refer to the first nine months of 2024, except as noted)

Net income increased $2.9 million to $93.5 million or $2.43 per diluted share, compared to $90.6 million or $2.36 per diluted share. Adjusting for acquisition-related expenses, net income increased $4.2 million, or 6.3% annualized, to $94.9 million, or $2.47 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2025. Fully taxable equivalent pre-provision net revenue increased $8.5 million, or 7.1%, to $129.0 million. Adjusting for non-recurring acquisition-related expenses, the fully taxable equivalent pre-provision net revenue increased $10.3 million, or 11.4% annualized, to $130.8 million. The return on average tangible assets increased five basis points to 1.38%, and the return on average tangible common equity was 13.05%, compared to 14.14%. Adjusted, the return on average tangible assets increased seven basis points to 1.40%, and the return on average tangible common equity totaled 13.23%.

Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $7.6 million to $268.1 million. The fully taxable equivalent net interest margin widened 15 basis points to 3.95%, driven by a 22 basis point improvement in the cost of funds, partially offset by a seven basis point decrease in earning asset yields.

Loans outstanding totaled $7.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, compared to $7.7 billion. New loan fundings over the trailing twelve months totaled $1.5 billion, led by commercial fundings of $997.3 million.

The Company recorded $8.7 million of provision expense for credit losses, compared to $4.8 million in the same period prior year. Annualized net charge-offs totaled 0.27% of average total loans, compared to 0.13% in the same period prior year. Non-performing loans improved ten basis points to 0.36% of total loans at September 30, 2025, compared to December 31, 2024, and non-performing assets improved ten basis points to 0.37% of total loans and OREO at September 30, 2025, compared to December 31, 2024.

Average deposits totaled $8.2 billion, compared to $8.3 billion in the same period prior year, and average transaction deposits totaled $7.1 billion, compared to $7.3 billion in the same period prior year. The mix of transaction deposits to total deposits was 86.3% at September 30, 2025, compared to 87.6%.

Non-interest income increased $3.0 million to $53.1 million primarily due to $3.3 million of unrealized gains on partnership investments, a $0.9 million increase in the gains on sales of previously consolidated banking center properties, and a $0.7 million increase in trust income. These increases were partially offset by decreases in SBA and swap fee income.

Non-interest expense totaled $192.2 million, compared to $190.1 million in the same period prior year. Excluding $1.7 million of acquisition-related expenses primarily included within professional fees, non-interest expense totaled $190.5 million. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $2.9 million primarily driven by the depreciation of the 2UniFi software asset in connection with the recent launch of 2UniFi in the third quarter of 2025. The fully taxable equivalent efficiency ratio, excluding other intangible assets amortization and adjusted for acquisition-related expenses improved 1.82% to 57.46% compared to the same period prior year.

Income tax expense totaled $21.0 million, compared to $19.9 million in the same period prior year, as a result of higher pre-tax income in the current period. The effective tax rate was 18.3%, compared to 18.0% in the same period prior year.

GLENVILLE, N.Y., Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

TrustCo Bank Corp NY (TrustCo, NASDAQ: TRST) today announced strong financial results for the third quarter of 2025 highlighted by a substantial increase in net interest income, continued margin expansion, and sustained loan and deposit growth across key portfolios. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, net interest income increased 11.5% year over year to $43.1 million, fueled by the continued repricing of the loan portfolio to higher yields and careful control of deposit costs, despite persistent competitive challenges. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, net interest margin expanded to 2.79% from 2.61% in the prior year period, driven by enhanced asset yields and disciplined deposit pricing strategies. This resulted in third quarter 2025 net income of $16.3 million or $0.86 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $12.9 million or $0.68 diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2024; and net income of $45.6 million or $2.41 diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to net income of $37.6 million or $1.97 diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loan balances expanded throughout the quarter, with total average loans increasing $125.9 million or 2.5% for the third quarter 2025 over the same period in 2024. Following a period of sustained growth, TrustCo remains confident in the quality of its loan portfolio amid broader market concerns. Our continued focus on solid underwriting within our loan portfolio and conservative lending standards positions us to manage credit risk effectively in the current environment.

Overview

Chairman, President, and CEO, Robert J. McCormick said, “Solid strategic vision accompanied by effective tactical decisions throughout the year are combining to create exceptional results and build momentum that we expect will continue to yield favorable returns to our shareholders. Our strategy is to deliver market-leading loan and deposit products, treat people fairly, and build lasting customer relationships. Tactically, we have held the line on cost of funds, grown loans and deposits, and meaningfully impacted our customers and communities through our service to food banks, the Ronald McDonald House Charities, various Veteran groups, and hospitals. The impact is dramatic. Return metrics are up significantly year to date, with ROAA, and ROAE up 18%, and 15%, respectively. Perhaps most dramatically, we impacted shareholder value by executing our share repurchase program, acquiring 467 thousand shares, with authorization remaining. This contributed to earnings per share growth of 22% year to date. A lesser company would be proud to have results like these for the entire year. Staying true to strategic vision consistently yields dividends, literally.”

Details

As the year progresses we expect to continue to see meaningful net interest income upside for quarters to come. The Bank’s loan and investment portfolios continue to reprice upward as lower yielding assets mature and are replaced with higher rate loan originations and bond purchases, driving steady improvement in overall asset yields. We believe that this ongoing repricing reflects disciplined loan production aligned with current market conditions. Complementing this, the Bank maintains a strong liquidity position, providing flexibility to support future growth while navigating evolving funding dynamics. Together, these factors position the Bank to sustain healthy net interest income growth in the coming quarters and deliver long-term value to shareholders. Net interest income was $43.1 million for the third quarter 2025, an increase of $4.4 million, or 11.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2024, driven by loan growth at higher interest rates, and an increase in interest income on federal funds sold and other short-term investments. The net interest margin for the third quarter 2025 was 2.79%, up 18 basis points from 2.61% in the third quarter of 2024. The yield on interest earnings assets increased to 4.25% in the third quarter of 2025, up 14 basis points from 4.11% in the third quarter of 2024. The cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to 1.90% in the third quarter 2025, down from 1.94% in the third quarter 2024.

Average loans were up $125.9 million, or 2.5%, in the third quarter 2025 over the same period in 2024. Average residential loans and HECLs, our primary lending focus, were up $34.0 million, or 0.8%, and $59.9 million, or 15.7%, respectively, in the third quarter 2025 over the same period in 2024. Average commercial loans also increased $34.6 million, or 12.4%, in the third quarter 2025 over the same period in 2024. We believe that this upward trend reflects improving economic confidence among borrowers, strong credit quality, and the Bank’s focus on relationship lending. The sustained growth in the loan portfolio will likely enhance net interest income in the quarters ahead. Average deposits were up $251.1 million, or 4.8%, for the third quarter 2025 over the same period in 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in time deposits, interest bearing checking accounts, and demand deposits. The Bank’s continued emphasis on relationship banking, combined with competitive product offerings and digital capabilities, has contributed to a stable deposit base that supports ongoing loan growth and expansion.

During the third quarter of 2025, the Bank has remained a prudent steward of capital, steadfastly committed to enhancing shareholder value through a disciplined strategic share repurchase program. This reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the franchise and our focus on capital optimization. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, TrustCo purchased 298 thousand, or 1.6%, and 467 thousand, or 2.5%, respectively, of total shares outstanding of TrustCo common stock under the previously announced stock repurchase program. As a result, we have 533 thousand, or 2.8%, of outstanding shares available for repurchase remaining in this program, which if completed will represent a repurchase of one million shares, or 5.3%, of total outstanding shares. Our approach ensures every dollar of capital is working to generate solid returns, strengthen customer relationships, and enhance shareholder value. As of September 30, 2025, our equity to asset ratio was 10.90%, compared to 10.95% as of September 30, 2024. Book value per share as of September 30, 2025 was $37.30, up 6.0% compared to $35.19 as of a year earlier.

Asset quality remains strong and has been consistent over the past twelve months. TrustCo recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $250 thousand in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $500 thousand for the same period in 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 the provision for credit losses was the result of a provision for credit losses on loans of $450 thousand, and a benefit for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $200 thousand. The ratio of allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.00% and 0.99% as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on loans was $51.9 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $50.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) were $18.5 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $19.4 million as of September 30, 2024. NPLs were 0.36% and 0.38% of total loans as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The coverage ratio, or allowance for credit losses on loans to NPLs, was 280.8% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 256.9% as of September 30, 2024. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) were $19.7 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $21.9 million as of September 30, 2024.

Market Overview

The global yoga clothing market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, evolving from a niche segment into a multi-billion dollar industry. The market's valuation increased substantially from USD 19,252.97 million in 2018 to USD 33,341.52 million in 2024, reflecting a period of intense consumer interest and brand investment. Looking ahead, the forecast period of 2025 to 2032 is poised for continued strong performance, with a projected CAGR of 8.23% leading to an estimated market size of USD 65,660.34 million by 2032. This growth is not merely a consequence of more people practicing yoga; it is intricately linked to the broader wellness movement and the "athleisure" phenomenon.

Modern consumers demand apparel that offers performance-enhancing features like moisture-wicking, four-way stretch, and breathability, without compromising on aesthetic appeal. Brands are responding with versatile collections that cater to both athletic pursuits and casual, everyday wear. For instance, the rise of remote work has further boosted demand for comfortable yet presentable clothing, with yoga pants and tops becoming staples in the work-from-home wardrobe. This convergence of fashion, fitness, and lifestyle continues to broaden the consumer base for yoga apparel far beyond dedicated yoga practitioners, solidifying its position as a significant and enduring category in the global apparel industry.

Key Growth Determinants

The proliferation of health and wellness consciousness on a global scale is the primary determinant of growth for the yoga clothing market. Consumers are increasingly proactive

[TITLE]Why the L’Oréal-Kering Tie-in Could Change the Playbook for Armani:
[TEXT]
Updated 3:24 p.m. ET Oct. 21

The playbook for Giorgio Armani could change now that L’Oréal has a blooming partnership with Kering.

As previously reported, news broke Sunday night that Kering Beauty is being sold to L’Oréal for 4 billion euros. Concurrently, Kering and L’Oréal are forming a long-term strategic partnership in beauty and wellness.

Might this partnership expand into fashion? Only time will tell. But it could make good sense when it comes to Armani.

Wills of the late designer Giorgio Armani, who died on Sept. 4 at age 91, opened the possibility of L’Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and EssilorLuxottica as potential buyers of his namesake company.

RELATED: L’Oréal’s Sales Growth Accelerated in Q3

L’Oréal and EssilorLuxottica are licensees for fragrance and beauty, and eyewear, respectively.

“I continue to expect L’Oréal and EssilorLuxottica as the most probable acquirors of their respective Armani businesses,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein. “With apparel and leather goods likely licensed to a third party long-term — same as Estée Lauder has done with Tom Ford.

“I wonder if in this context Kering could be the third-party licensee,” Solca continued. “Having said that, Kering is more likely to concentrate on getting its core business back on an even keel.”

Armani’s two wills, dated March 15 and April 5, were made public Sept. 12. After 12 months from their opening and within 18 months at the most, an initial 15 percent of his company could be sold to either L’Oréal, LVMH or Essilor Luxottica, they stipulate. Armani did not rule out other companies, as long as they are operating in the world of fashion and luxury, and of equal standing.

The same buyer would have the right to purchase a 30 percent to 54.9 percent stake in Armani between the third and fifth years, or in five years and within eight to consider a public listing in Italy as a priority or on other markets of equal standing.

Following even a potential listing, the Armani Foundation would keep a 30.1 percent stake of the group to ensure its control.

Regarding the Armani company, Nicolas Hieronimus, chief executive officer of L’Oréal, during a call Tuesday evening with analysts and journalists to discuss third-quarter and nine-months results reiterated sadness in the passing of Giorgio Armani, with whom the group collaborated for 40 years.

“We are very honored that in his success and in the instructions that he left with his heirs, L’Oréal is considered as a potential acquirer, at least of the first 15 percent,” Hieronimus said. “We said we would consider all the options. It’s a bit too soon. The family is mourning and focused also on driving this business.

“The only important thing that I can confirm today is that the deal we just did with Kering does not prevent us from considering any of the options that are on the table with Armani,” he continued. “So we will rediscuss it in the future.”

L’Oréal generally sticks with its core competency of beauty, but has ventured into fashion in the past — first with Lanvin, which it owned between 1994 and 2001, and more recently with Mugler, which became part of the French giant’s portfolio as part of the deal when it acquired the Mugler brands and Azzaro fragrances from Groupe Clarins in 2020.

Most recently, in early February, L’Oréal joined forces with Jacquemus, linking a long-term beauty license and taking a 10 percent stake in the fashion business.

Fashion and beauty are very different animals, even if they share some brand DNA, so it is considered unlikely L’Oréal would want to run Armani fashion itself.

No doubt, L’Oréal desires to keep the Armani fragrance and beauty license past 2050. That’s where the partnership with Kering could come in. And in the late ’90s, rumors swirled for years that Gucci wanted to buy Armani, although a deal never materialized.

The Armani fragrance and beauty license is a jewel in the crown of L’Oréal’s Luxe division, where it has been a “billionaire” brand since 2017. Blockbuster Armani products such as Sì fragrances and Maestro foundation have attracted A-list brand ambassadors like actress Cate Blanchett and Hanni, the lead singer of NewJeans, who helped transform Armani beauty into a sustainable, global powerhouse.

In March 2018, L’Oréal and Armani renewed that license until 2025, after having worked together since 1988. It was among Armani’s first licenses.

At the time of the renewal, Giorgio Armani said in a statement that “over the years our mutual trust has constantly generated excellent results.”

Kering, for its part, could merit from adding at least one more powerful fashion holding at this time when it’s struggling to turn around its star Gucci brand. Gucci has Demna as a new designer, which energized buyers with his debut display there at the recent Milan Fashion Week in September. But a turnaround at Gucci will take time.

Meanwhile, Kering’s newly appointed CEO Luca de Meo has sprung into action to revive the ailing company. The Kering Beauty announcement — coming just one month after his official arrival — was a surprise to the beauty and fashion industries. But financial analysts have lauded the move.

The Kering Beauty deal will be a windfall for Kering, whose net debt amounted to 9.5 billion euros on June 30. However, whether Kering would want to make a major acquisition like Armani remains to be seen.

HSBC cited 2024 filings that show Armani generated 2.3 billion euros in sales from fashion and

Launching exclusively in 12 Dick’s House of Sport stores this week, the retailer becomes Gymshark’s first-ever U.S. wholesale partner, marking a major milestone for both brands. The news comes hot on the heels of the opening of the U.K.-based gym and fitness brand’s first permanent U.S. retail store at Roosevelt Field mall in New York last weekend.

Starting on Friday, Dick’s will offer a range of Gymshark apparel and accessories, including the brand’s signature Power and Vital lines, in a range of gym-ready colorways inside a fully branded collab space at each participating House of Sport location.

Dick’s noted that the space will feature fixtures that have been designed and clad to display the Gymshark branding, incorporating mannequins modeled on Gymshark athletes – such as three-time Mr. Olympia men’s physique champion Ryan Terry – and specialty mannequin stands made from actual weight plates.

“Gymshark is redefining what modern training apparel looks like with high-performance, stylish pieces rooted in real gym culture,” Kirk noted. “House of Sport is the perfect place to bring that experience to life.”

[TITLE]AI and online shopping: how Shein, Temu and others get you hooked:
[TEXT]
In recent years, several websites selling ultra-low-cost goods have appeared on the French market. Shein, Temu and AliExpress, to name but a few, are shaking up the online retail landscape. According to a study conducted by BPCE Digital & Payments, the number of payment cards recording at least one monthly transaction on a discount site increased by 20% between the first quarters of 2022 and 2023.

This is hardly surprising given that Temu’s website has millions of French visitors every month, according to data from the Federation of E-commerce and Distance-Selling (FEVAD). In mid-July 2025, low-cost platforms accounted for 22% of parcels handled by the French postal service, compared with 5% five years ago. This increase is set to continue, with the sector expected to grow by a total of 6.5% in 2025.

Of course, the rampant inflation in France in recent years partly explains this craze. But this is not the only explanation for these developments. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is at the heart of the business model of these platforms, helps to build consumer loyalty.

Read more: The secret behind Temu’s rock-bottom prices

Behavioural profiling

In our latest articles on Shein and Temu, we analysed how these platforms operate behind the scenes. By analysing user behaviour data, the AI tools used by the platforms can identify the customers most likely to make a purchase and tailor the advertising messages they receive.

Predictive algorithms also analyse user behaviour to offer personalised recommendations. This approach aims to create a need before it even arises, by playing on feelings of scarcity and urgency. This is the famous Fomo, or “fear of missing out”.

These predictive algorithms have been around for many years, but their new capabilities, “augmented” by AI tools, are ushering in a new era, adapting even more finely and quickly to each Internet user. At the bottom of each page, there is a list of “items also viewed” by other users, which are similar to the product being searched for. This classic marketing technique is taken a step further: algorithms constantly submit new content to the customer to study their reaction. Every reaction (such as a click to add an item to a basket) is analysed in real time. The algorithm, supported by AI, then uses this data to encourage the user to buy other products that they did not initially come to look for.

Using play to sell

Gamification refers to the use of game mechanics for marketing purposes to capture customers’ attention.

On the Temu app, the interfaces are inspired by gambling games, which are known to be particularly addictive: wheels of fortune, countdowns highlighting limited-time offers, gifts and promotional codes to unlock, etc. These constant stimuli create a sense of urgency in the user, while disrupting the biochemical mechanism of the reward circuit. AI allows for greater precision and diversification of the “games” offered, to the detriment of buyers (and without their full awareness).

On Temu, mini-games integrated into the mobile app (such as Farmland and Fishland) promise free items and discount coupons. Points and voucher systems are used to encourage users to return to the site as often as possible, and personalised notifications are also sent at opportune moments, based on data collected
