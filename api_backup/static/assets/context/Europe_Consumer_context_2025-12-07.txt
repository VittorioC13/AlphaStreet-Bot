[TITLE]BasicNet Plans to Relocate Woolrich Corporate Employees to Turin, Trade Unions Push Back:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Less than a month after BasicNet acquired Woolrich from Luxembourg-based fund L-Gam in a deal that valued the storied outerwear player at 90 million euros, the new owner is facing a dispute with trade unions.

The latter are claiming that the company has decided to shut corporate operations in Bologna and Milan, where Woolrich employs 109 and 30 workers, respectively, leaving them with no other option than accept a relocation to the BasicNet headquarters in Turin to avoid being laid off.

The move would not affect retail employees in those cities, where Woolrich operates two of its 25 flagships in Europe.

BasicNet’s portfolio of brands also comprises Kappa, Robe di Kappa, K-Way, Superga, Sebago and Briko, in addition to Woolrich and beachwear specialist Sundek. The latter’s acquisition was revealed Thursday.

On Friday, BasicNet issued a statement clarifying its position, saying that “this is not a closure, but rather a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring job continuity. The decision to move the headquarters and its employees to Turin is designed to strengthen Woolrich’s brand value by investing in a central hub that can support future growth and create beneficial synergies.”

The company said it is committed to safeguarding jobs and will resort to any available welfare measure to ensure a smooth transition for employees unable to relocate to Turin.

“People are the heart of the company, and we are excited to welcome all employees into the big BasicNet family,” said Alessandro Boglione, co-chief executive officer of BasicNet, in the statement. “We are committed to following all the right procedures, which is why we are working closely with trade unions to provide clear and timely answers to employees who have sought clarity.”

“We hope to find shared solutions quickly so we can provide certainty and ensure the transition respects everyone involved,” added Lorenzo Boglione, co-CEO of the company.

The BasicNet transaction, revealed in November, involved the acquisition through a wholly owned subsidiary of the rights to the Woolrich brand for Europe and 100 percent of Woolrich Europe SpA, the company managing its distribution and retail activities. Its revenues for fiscal year 2025 are expected to be around 90 million euros.

Through the deal L-Gam exited Woolrich seven years after acquiring the brand in 2018 from its former owner, WP Lavori in Corso. Last December L-Gam forged a deal with Chinese apparel group Baoxiniao Holding Co. Ltd., which acquired Woolrich’s intellectual property rights for all territories outside Europe.

Woolrich was founded in 1830 by John Rich in Pennsylvania, and is one of the oldest American producers of wool fabrics and outdoor clothing. The company was created to provide durable and functional garments for hunters, lumberjacks and railway workers.

In 1850, Woolrich introduced its signature Buffalo red and black check pattern. In 1940, responding to the needs of workers building oil pipelines in Alaska, the Arctic Parka was born — designed to withstand extreme temperatures and another signature garment for the brand.

BasicNet was founded by Lorenzo and Alessandro Boglione’s father, Marco Boglione, who created the group in 1994 as a marketplace and publicly listed it on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1999.

Stemming from the storied traditional clothing company Maglificio Calzificio Torinese, which was founded in 1916, BasicNet doesn’t produce or distribute the collections of its brands. Billing itself as a “fully web-integrated company” through a digitally advanced platform, it acts as a marketplace where manufacturers and distributors meet to do business.

In particular, BasicNet designs and develops its labels’ collections, signs licensing agreements with international producers and distributors, which receive from BasicNet all they need to manufacture and sell the products, from research and development to global marketing.

[TITLE]Crowd Farming Market Trends and Industry Outlook Report 2025-2030 by Agri-Commodity, Platform and Region:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Crowd Farming Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Crowd Farming Market will grow from USD 122.45 Million in 2024 to USD 177.77 Million by 2030 at a 6.41% CAGR. This market is primarily driven by escalating consumer demand for organic and sustainably produced goods, a heightened desire for food traceability and supply chain transparency, and the widespread adoption of digital technologies enabling accessible online engagement.

Key Market Drivers

The rising consumer demand for organic and sustainable products significantly influences the global crowd farming market by providing a direct and growing base of conscious consumers. This demographic actively seeks transparency and ethical sourcing, aligning directly with the crowd farming model's core offerings. Consumers are increasingly willing to invest in food production methods that minimize environmental impact and support responsible agricultural practices, which fuels participation in platforms that connect them directly to farmers.

Key Market Challenges

The global expansion of the crowd farming market is primarily impeded by a prevalent lack of public awareness concerning this innovative agricultural funding and procurement method. This limited understanding directly restricts both farmer adoption and consumer engagement. The concept of crowd farming, which involves consumers directly funding farmers' projects or pre-purchasing shares of harvests through digital platforms, remains largely unfamiliar to many potential participants, despite growing interest in sustainable food systems.

Key Market Trends

Increased investment in regenerative agriculture initiatives signifies a strategic shift within agricultural investment towards practices that improve soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Crowd farming platforms are increasingly acting as conduits for capital flow into these specific initiatives, attracting investors keen on both financial returns and environmental impact. This growing commitment to ecological restoration within food production systems is transforming investment portfolios, demonstrating a substantial market appetite for funding agricultural models that emphasize long-term sustainability and resilience.

[TITLE]Sportsman’s Warehouse Holdings, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
Announces Opening of its Newest Store in Surprise, Arizona

Same store sales increased 2.2% over last year; outperforms the Q3 Adjusted NICS data

Gross margin up 100 basis points versus last year

Updates its full year 2025 Outlook

WEST JORDAN, Utah, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (“Sportsman's Warehouse” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPWH) today announced financial results for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025.

“This quarter we delivered our third consecutive period of positive same-store sales growth, driven by strong performance in our hunting, fishing, firearms, and personal protection categories, while continuing to gain share in a highly promotional and challenging retail environment,” said Paul Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Sportsman’s Warehouse. “We were also pleased in early November to open our new Surprise, Arizona location — our 11th store in the state — which marks our first personal protection-focused concept in a market where we have a proven track record of strong performance. This strategically located store represents our only planned opening for both 2025 and 2026 and reflects our commitment to thoughtful capital management.”

“In mid-October we started to see a softening in consumer spending from external disruptions which is weighing on our early fourth quarter sales,” continued Mr. Stone. “While still early, we are carefully navigating these consumer headwinds, and remain focused on disciplined execution, prudent cost management, and improving inventory productivity.”

For the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025:

Net sales were $331.3 million, an increase of 2.2%, compared to $324.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales in our Hunting and Shooting, Fishing and Apparel departments as we continue to emphasize inventory in-stocks, and our focused strategy to win the seasons in hunting and fishing to ensure we have the right inventory at the right location at the right time. In addition, the sales growth was driven by our strategic decision to lean into personal protection, including less-lethal alternatives.

Same store sales increased 2.2% during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily as a result of the same factors noted above that drove net sales growth and new digital marketing efforts.

Gross profit was $108.7 million, or 32.8% of net sales, compared to $103.1 million or 31.8% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. This 100 basis-point improvement, was largely driven by stronger product margins from healthier inventory, improved shrink, and increased sales in the Fishing department, which has an overall higher margin profile.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to $104.5 million, or 31.5% of net sales, compared to $100.0 million, or 30.8% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, due to a reinvestment into customer facing and sales driving areas of the business including store and support area labor and digital marketing to drive sales and improve omni-channel traffic.

Net income was $0.0 million, compared to a net loss of $(0.4) million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted net income was $3.0 million, compared to adjusted net income of $1.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Adjusted EBITDA was $18.6 million, compared to $16.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Diluted earnings per share were $0.00, compared to diluted loss per share of $(0.01) in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.08, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.04 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2025:

Net sales were $874.3 million, an increase of 2.0%, compared to $857.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales in our Hunting and Shooting, Fishing and Apparel departments as we continue to emphasize inventory in-stocks, and our focused strategy to win the seasons in hunting and fishing to ensure we have the right inventory at the right location at the right time. In addition, the sales growth was driven by our strategic decision to lean into personal protection, including less-lethal alternatives.

Same store sales increased 2.1% compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily as a result of the same factors noted above that drove net sales growth and new digital marketing efforts.

Gross profit was $278.3 million or 31.8% of net sales, compared to $266.9 million or 31.1% of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. The margin improvement was primarily driven by stronger product margins from healthier inventory, improved shrink, and increased sales in the Fishing department, which has an overall higher margin profile. These gains were partially offset by a sales mix shift toward lower-margin firearms and ammunition, which have a lower gross margin, and lower Camping department sales, which has a higher gross margin, and increased freight expense tied to our strategic inventory pull-forward.

SG&A expenses increased to $296.9 million or 34.0% of net sales, compared to $288.7 million or 33.7% of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, due to a reinvestment into customer facing and sales driving areas of the business including store and support area labor to drive sales and improve omni-channel traffic.

Net loss was $(28.3) million, compared to net loss of $(24.3) million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted net loss was $(17.4) million, compared to adjusted net loss of $(21.8) million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Adjusted EBITDA was $17.9 million, compared to $15.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Diluted loss per share was $(0.74), compared to diluted loss per share of $(0.65) in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted diluted loss per share was $(0.45), compared to adjusted diluted loss per share of $(0.58) in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Balance sheet and capital allocation highlights as of November 1, 2025:

The Company ended the third quarter with net debt of $179.7 million, comprised of $137.9 million of borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility, $44.0 million of net borrowings outstanding under the Company’s term loan facility, and $2.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $424.0 million.

Total liquidity was $111.9 million as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, comprised of $109.7 million of availability under the Company’s revolving credit facility and term loan facility and $2.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.

Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook:

“During the third quarter, we remained focused on strengthening our balance sheet and improving working capital efficiency in a challenging operating environment,” said Jennifer Fall Jung, Chief Financial Officer of Sportsman’s Warehouse. “We reduced total inventory by $14.2 million year-over-year and by $19.5 million sequentially, while ensuring our stores were appropriately positioned for the fall hunting, fishing, and holiday selling seasons. Our inventory strategy continues to prioritize core, seasonally relevant, and higher-turning products, and we remain committed to reducing overall inventory levels as we drive improved efficiency in our operating model.”

Fall Jung continued, “We also remain focused on enhancing liquidity, paying down $13.2 million in debt during the quarter and generating positive momentum toward year-end free cash flow. Given ongoing macroeconomic pressures, external disruptions since mid-October weighing on sales, and a highly promotional retail environment, we are adjusting our full year guidance. While visibility remains limited, we believe our continued focus on inventory discipline, cost control, and positive free cash flow generation positions us to navigate near-term challenges while working toward more sustainable profitability over time.”

The Company is adjusting its sales guidance for fiscal year 2025 and now expects net sales to be flat to up slightly and anticipates adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $22 million to $26 million, reflecting a tough fourth quarter environment due to a challenged US consumer. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2025 to be less than $25 million, primarily related to strategic technological investments, such as planogramming, merchandising and replenishment and store scheduling tools, and general store fleet maintenance. Additionally, the company anticipates to end the year with less than $330 million in inventory and lower debt, reflecting working capital efficiency.

The Company has not reconciled expected adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2025 to GAAP net income because the Company does not provide guidance for net (loss) income and is not able to provide a reconciliation to net (loss) income without unreasonable effort. The Company is not able to estimate net (loss) income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

[TITLE]Zumiez Inc. Announces Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Results:
[TEXT]
Third Quarter Earnings Per Share Increased to $0.55 from $0.06 last year

Third Quarter Comparable Sales Increased 7.6%

North American Third Quarter Comparable Sales Increased 10.0%

Fourth Quarter To-Date Comparable Sales Up 6.6%

LYNNWOOD, Wash., Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zumiez Inc. (NASDAQ: ZUMZ) a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for young men and women, today reported results for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025.

Net sales for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025 (13 weeks) increased 7.5% to $239.1 million from $222.5 million in the third quarter ended November 2, 2024 (13 weeks). Comparable sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025, increased 7.6% on top of a 7.5% increase in the year ago period. Net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $9.2 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.06 per share, in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025 we benefitted from one-time discrete tax items which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09.

Total net sales for the nine months (39 weeks) ending November 1, 2025 increased 4.5% to $637.7 million from $610.0 million reported for the nine months (39 weeks) ending November 2, 2024. Comparable sales increased 5.3% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2025. Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was $6.2 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to a net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 of $16.5 million, or $0.86 per share. The first nine months of 2025 was negatively impacted by $3.6 million, or approximately $0.15 per share related to the settlement of a wage and hours lawsuit in California.

On November 1, 2025, the Company had cash and current marketable securities of $104.5 million compared to cash and current marketable securities of $99.3 million on November 2, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by $50.5 million of cash flow from operations and the release of $3.0 million in restricted cash, partially offset by $38.3 million related to share repurchases and $12.5 million of capital expenditures. The Company repurchased 0.3 million shares during the third quarter of 2025 at an average cost including commission of $18.61 per share and a total cost of $5.4 million. Fiscal year-to-date through November 1, 2025, the Company has repurchased 2.7 million shares at an average cost including commission of $14.18 per share and a total cost of $38.3 million. $1.7 million remains on the current open repurchase authorization.

“We achieved our best third quarter in several years,” said Rick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer of Zumiez Inc. “High-single digit comparable sales growth and strong full price selling drove meaningful gross margin expansion, which combined with good expense management, resulted in a significant improvement in profitability. The work we have done enhancing our brand and merchandise assortments continues to resonate with our consumers, especially in North America, evidenced by the sharp sequential increase in the region’s comparable sales trends to double digits. Importantly, the holiday season is off to a strong start with overall comps up 6.6% fourth quarter-to-date and up 8.7% over the Black Friday to Cyber Monday timeframe. While the overall consumer environment remains choppy, we are encouraged by the pace of our business and are increasingly confident in delivering a solid finish to fiscal 2025 and building on our progress next year.”

Fourth Quarter To-Date

Fourth quarter-to-date total sales for the 31 days ending December 2, 2025 increased 7.5%, compared with the same 31-day period in the prior year ended December 3, 2024. Total comparable sales for the 31-day period ending December 2, 2025, increased 6.6% from the comparable period in the prior year.

Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Outlook

The Company is introducing guidance for the three months ending January 31, 2026. Net sales are projected to be in the range of $291 to $296 million representing sales growth of 4.0% to 6.0%. Consolidated operating margins are expected to be between 8.0% and 8.5% resulting in earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.97 to $1.07.

The Company opened 6 new stores in fiscal 2025, including 5 stores in North America and 1 store in Australia.

[TITLE]I founded community bank in US to help minorities — Nigerian engineer, Ajimotokan:
[TEXT]
Chief Executive Officer, Heritage Hub Federal Credit Union, Houston, United States, Bolaji Ajimotokan, tells BIODUN BUSARI why he started a community bank, among other issues

How did your childhood experience look like?

Nigeria was a functioning country when I was growing up. I went to the University of Lagos at a time when we paid less than N1,000 for school fees. We spent like N15 on food. So, it was a time when things were okay.

However, jobs were frozen in the country. I can say we had a fairly decent country at the time. There were challenges, but things were not rough.

I graduated from the University of Lagos in 1993. I proceeded to do my master’s at Cardiff University, United Kingdom. I got a Master’s in Business Administration in Information Systems. So, my background was interesting.

Did you have any experience with the military regime?

The military era shaped some of my childhood experiences. The government usually closed schools, especially universities, and the peak of that was the June 12 crisis, when former military president Ibrahim Babangida annulled the presidential election.

At that time, some of us, as young chaps, were thinking of contributing to the Nigerian economy, but the military guys made it so tough. That was the beginning of our mindset to go abroad and further our education.

I thought I would just have my MBA and return to the country, but as God would have it, while in Cardiff, I got a job in the United States. Instead of going back to Nigeria after my education, I just crossed over to the US.

How convenient was it for graduates to finish their first degree and move abroad for their master’s at the time?

In my situation, it was self-funded. I think it’s more complicated now. But during my time, when you had your certificate and met the requirements for admission into any school, you got your admission. You could either pay the school fees or get a scholarship.

It was straightforward, nothing complicated. Once you got admission from the school you wanted to go to, you went to the embassy, applied for a visa, and that was it.

What kind of job made you cross from the UK to the US?

My first degree is in civil engineering. But while doing my MBA in Information Systems in Cardiff, I got a job as an information systems analyst at St. John’s University in the US. The job came at a time when the whole world was concerned that companies might collapse in 1999.

So, American companies and institutions were hiring many computer-knowledgeable people to come to the US to better manage information systems. I got the job around that time.

What was your experience in your first job?

At St. John’s University, we were setting up computers and networks. Primarily, we were upgrading what we called the BIOS of the computers, making sure the computers were compatible with the Year 2000 problem, which was the slogan at the time.

I worked there for

[TITLE]Zamfara Unveils 10-Year Development Plan for Growth:
[TEXT]
Zamfara State Governor, Dauda Lawal, has described the State Development Plan from 2025 to 2034 as a long-term roadmap that reflects a collective goal to transform the state.

In a statement shared with Saturday PUNCH by the governor’s spokesperson, Sulaiman Idris, Lawal launched the 10-year development plan at the JB Yakubu Secretariat in Gusau on Friday.

He revealed that the state government had engaged KPMG Advisory as the lead consultant to develop the plan.

The governor noted that KPMG collaborated with Zamfara Executive Council members and all stakeholders, including traditional rulers and religious leaders, over a period of eight months to develop the plan.

He added that the development plan would become a benchmark for economic growth—not merely for Nigeria, but for the continent of Africa.

“We will use resources, innovation, and governance to promote inclusive growth, stability, and opportunity. The plan is built on six pillars: Economy; Infrastructure; Social Welfare; Human Capital; Governance; and Environmental Sustainability.

“The development plan is built on robust data, wide stakeholder engagement, and alignment with national and global development frameworks, including the Sustainable Development Goals, Nigeria’s National Development Plan 2050, and the African Union Agenda 2063.

“Zamfara’s strength in agriculture and natural resources will be maximized through partnerships like the MoFI agreement and African Development Bank funding. This aims to boost mechanized farming, agro-processing, and value chains, creating jobs, improving food security, opening markets, and reducing poverty-driven insecurity,” the governor said.

Lawal said Zamfara stood on a favourable pedestal with the State’s plan.

He stated, “We are not merely dreaming—we are preparing to deliver. We are redefining the fate of our state. We are rekindling hope for the young, dignity for the vulnerable, opportunity for the enterprising, and stability for all.

“Let the launch of the Zamfara State Development Plan 2025–2034 mark not a mere political ambition, but a turning point in the history of our state. Let it be said that when Zamfara was at its lowest, we rose not with rhetoric, but with resolve; not with empty promises, but with purposeful plans; not with despair, but with vision.”

[TITLE]Egypt’s economy stabilises, but poverty challenges persist:
[TEXT]
Egypt found itself back on the international front pages in the second half of this year. The country played host to the Sharm el-Sheikh conference in October when US President Donald Trump rallied global and regional powers alike behind his ceasefire plan for the Gaza Strip. Shortly after, in November, Cairo invited world leaders to attend the spectacular opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum next to the pyramids.

Amid these eye-catching events, other domestic developments have received less attention. Most notable were Egypt’s parliamentary elections, with the first round held in November, and runoffs planned for early December.

The elections have been dominated by a coalition of pro-government parties running unopposed for the party list seats, which are half of the parliamentary seats being voted for. Individual candidates can run for the other half of the seats in contention, but those seats are difficult to win for candidates without the necessary financial resources and connections.

Critics, therefore, believe that the race is essentially only between loyalists to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, with a group of Egyptian human rights groups saying that the elections had occurred “under chronic and severe restrictions on meaningful political participation”.

With that context in mind, the elections have not attracted a groundswell of attention from Egyptians, continuing a pattern since el-Sisi took power in the country more than a decade ago, after a coup against Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi.

“They are even less important than under [former President Hosni] Mubarak, it is not the talk of the day,” said a businessman in the textile industry, who did not wish to give their full name for fear of reprisals. “There are fewer banners and posters than during previous elections.”

Capital injections

In the shadow of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, it is often forgotten that less than two years ago, Egypt experienced the worst economic crisis seen under el-Sisi. Billions of dollars worth of capital injections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Union, and massive investment pledges from the UAE in early 2024 prevented an economic crisis in Egypt.

Leading to the question, how is Egypt’s economy faring now? On paper, the picture looks promising. Recently, Egypt’s credit rating was upgraded, GDP growth is increasing, skyrocketing inflation rates that battered the population for years have cooled down, and investment from the Gulf continues. For example, Qatar is planning to develop a prime coastal strip near el-Alamein on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, not far from a similar UAE-funded project now under construction.

Earlier this year, the IMF completed its fourth review of Egypt’s economic reforms as part of conditions attached to its loan, and distributed a further $1.2bn – part of a loan worth $8bn in total, of which Egypt has now withdrawn $3.2bn.

The IMF continues to voice concern

[TITLE]BasicNet Plans to Relocate Woolrich Corporate Employees to Turin, Trade Unions Push Back:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Less than a month after BasicNet acquired Woolrich from Luxembourg-based fund L-Gam in a deal that valued the storied outerwear player at 90 million euros, the new owner is facing a dispute with trade unions.

The latter are claiming that the company has decided to shut corporate operations in Bologna and Milan, where Woolrich employs 109 and 30 workers, respectively, leaving them with no other option than accept a relocation to the BasicNet headquarters in Turin to avoid being laid off.

The move would not affect retail employees in those cities, where Woolrich operates two of its 25 flagships in Europe.

BasicNet’s portfolio of brands also comprises Kappa, Robe di Kappa, K-Way, Superga, Sebago and Briko, in addition to Woolrich and beachwear specialist Sundek. The latter’s acquisition was revealed Thursday.

On Friday, BasicNet issued a statement clarifying its position, saying that “this is not a closure, but rather a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring job continuity. The decision to move the headquarters and its employees to Turin is designed to strengthen Woolrich’s brand value by investing in a central hub that can support future growth and create beneficial synergies.”

The company said it is committed to safeguarding jobs and will resort to any available welfare measure to ensure a smooth transition for employees unable to relocate to Turin.

“People are the heart of the company, and we are excited to welcome all employees into the big BasicNet family,” said Alessandro Boglione, co-chief executive officer of BasicNet, in the statement. “We are committed to following all the right procedures, which is why we are working closely with trade unions to provide clear and timely answers to employees who have sought clarity.”

“We hope to find shared solutions quickly so we can provide certainty and ensure the transition respects everyone involved,” added Lorenzo Boglione, co-CEO of the company.

The BasicNet transaction, revealed in November, involved the acquisition through a wholly owned subsidiary of the rights to the Woolrich brand for Europe and 100 percent of Woolrich Europe SpA, the company managing its distribution and retail activities. Its revenues for fiscal year 2025 are expected to be around 90 million euros.

Through the deal L-Gam exited Woolrich seven years after acquiring the brand in 2018 from its former owner, WP Lavori in Corso. Last December L-Gam forged a deal with Chinese apparel group Baoxiniao Holding Co. Ltd., which acquired Woolrich’s intellectual property rights for all territories outside Europe.

Woolrich was founded in 1830 by John Rich in Pennsylvania, and is one of the oldest American producers of wool fabrics and outdoor clothing. The company was created to provide durable and functional garments for hunters, lumberjacks and railway workers.

In 1850, Woolrich introduced its signature Buffalo red and black check pattern. In 1940, responding to the needs of workers building oil pipelines in Alaska, the Arctic Parka was born — designed to withstand extreme temperatures and another signature garment for the brand.

BasicNet was founded by Lorenzo and Alessandro Boglione’s father, Marco Boglione, who created the group in 1994 as a marketplace and publicly listed it on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1999.

Stemming from the storied traditional clothing company Maglificio Calzificio Torinese, which was founded in 1916, BasicNet doesn’t produce or distribute the collections of its brands. Billing itself as a “fully web-integrated company” through a digitally advanced platform, it acts as a marketplace where manufacturers and distributors meet to do business.

In particular, BasicNet designs and develops its labels’ collections, signs licensing agreements with international producers and distributors, which receive from BasicNet all they need to manufacture and sell the products, from research and development to global marketing.

REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Victoria’s Secret & Co. (“VS&Co” or the “Company”) (NYSE: VSCO) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025.

Hillary Super, VS&Co Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a standout third quarter, with outperformance on net sales and earnings per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Net sales increased 9% over last year, driven by strength across Victoria’s Secret, PINK and Beauty, and supported by momentum across channels and geographies. These outstanding results reflect disciplined execution of our Path to Potential strategy. Building on the third quarter’s outperformance as well as the solid start to our fourth quarter, we are raising our full year outlook and are well positioned for a successful holiday season and finish to our fiscal 2025.”

As we continue to advance our Path to Potential strategy, we are accelerating global growth, elevating brand distinctiveness, and unlocking greater value across our ecosystem to drive long-term profitable growth.”

Scott Sekella, VS&Co Chief Financial and Operating Officer, said, “Building on strong first-half results, our third quarter exceeded expectations. We delivered robust adjusted gross margin expansion of 170 basis points, driven by a reduced promotional approach and higher regular-priced selling, while leveraging the strength of our business model. We remain focused on managing costs while prioritizing investments in product innovation, brand strength, and customer experience. These efforts, along with the solid operational foundation we have built enables us to scale effectively and support the Company’s growth, giving us confidence in delivering a strong finish to the year and positioning VS&Co for long-term success.”

[TITLE]PVH Stock Drops 11.8% as Wall Street Waits for Fundamentals to Improve:
[TEXT]
Updated 4:13 p.m. ET Dec. 4

Wall Street is still waiting for PVH Corp. to take off.

Shares of the company fell 11.8 percent to $77.21 on Thursday, after the company beat its third-quarter earnings estimates, but didn’t raise its outlook for the year, signaling that business will be spread out between the two quarters.

“PVH shares look cheap, but they sure aren’t making it easy for value investors to step in,” said Tom Nikic, an analyst at Needham. “Trends continue to be very volatile.”

The Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent company saw third-quarter revenues increase 2 percent to $2.3 billion, making for a drop of less than 1 percent in constant currencies. PVH expects revenues to be flat to slightly positive for the year, in constant currencies.

Nikic zeroed in on the company’s “negative inflection” in the Europe, Middle East and Africa division, which trended down 2 percent in constant currencies.

“This was expected to be one of the growth drivers of the business following last year’s reset of the market — a gross margin miss didn’t help either,” the analyst said. “We continue to believe that shares are too cheap, particularly since they can probably buy back a high-single-digit percent of the float annually at these levels, if not more.

“Third-quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points, missing guidance by 25 basis points, driven by tariffs (110 basis point negative impact), the impact of bringing licenses in-house (50 basis points) and higher promotional mix, partially due to the … Calvin Klein product shipment delays,” he said.

PVH has been busy taking back licenses for its North American wholesale business from G-III Apparel Group, absorbing some of the businesses and finding other licensees for some categories, including dresses.

In conjunction with that take-back, the company set up a “global product kitchen” for Calvin Klein in New York, a complicated switch that had an uneven start.

Stefan Larsson, chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call Thursday that the “delays from the transitory Calvin global product challenges put extra strain on our European distribution center, impacting shipments for both Calvin and Tommy, which made us lose a few critical weeks of full-price selling.”

But Larsson, who’s been busy remaking the company since stepping into the corner office in 2021, suggested it was growing pains the company was feeling.

“We are on track both from on-time delivery coming into spring ’26 and the margin recapture that we set out to take back. On both fronts, we are on track, which is really good,” he said. “It’s painful now, but we had to do it because in order to build premium products, differentiated product franchises with innovation, we need the global capability to do that. And now we have it for both Calvin and Tommy. And so do all of our best competitors in the premium space also have it. But we had to build that. And now you start to see it.”

But Wall Street is still waiting.

Matthew Boss, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said: “While we see multiyear brand ‘unlock’ underway with the new leadership team focused on driving increased desirability of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands through improved product design and marketing, we see an elongated path to reaching management’s mid-teens operating margin target given a slower top-line recovery with continued macroeconomic challenges globally, in addition to a competitive external promotional backdrop, and foreign exchange pressures.”

This year, PVH expects its adjusted operating margin to come in at about 8.5 percent.

[TITLE]Global luxury apparel market to rebound slowly after 2024 setback – analysis:
[TEXT]
Louis Vuitton remained the largest luxury apparel brand in 2024, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Credit: Peter_Fleming/Shutterstock.

The global luxury apparel market will undergo a gradual recovery after a 2.4% contraction in 2024, analysis indicates.

According to GlobalData Global Luxury Apparel Market to 2029 report, growth will return in 2025, but it is expected to be largely fuelled by price increases rather than higher sales volumes.

Macro pressures including inflation across Europe and the US and a sharp slowdown in China dented consumer spending last year, producing the market’s first material setback in several years. GlobalData’s report forecasts that the sector will grow by 2.0% in 2025 as brands raise prices to protect margins, even as volumes continue to decline.

Free Sample Download sample pages of selected reports Explore a selection of report samples we have handpicked for you. Get a preview of the insights inside. Download your free copy today.

Over the 2024–29 period, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 2.8% and to begin outperforming the broader apparel market from 2028 as the finances of aspirational shoppers improve.

Clothing is projected to be the strongest category through 2029, with a 3.1% CAGR driven by ultra-wealthy consumers who remain willing to spend on trend-led pieces; womenswear is expected to outperform menswear. Accessories – led by luxury handbags as enduring status symbols – should record a 2.9% CAGR. Footwear looks set to be the weakest area, with a modest 1.0% CAGR, as strong demand for trainers from premium and mass-market specialists limits growth for high-end shoe categories.

Asia-Pacific will be the growth engine, posting the strongest regional CAGR of 4.0% between 2024 and 2029, supported by the recovery of China and robust growth in emerging Asian markets. In contrast, Europe and the Americas are forecast to experience softer growth – 1.8% and 1.5% CAGRs respectively – hampered by sluggish economies and the lingering effects of US tariffs. The Middle East and Africa will increase its share of the global market, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates benefiting from tourism and strong domestic spending.

Luxury heavyweights retained power in 2024. Louis Vuitton remained the largest apparel brand, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Hermès was the standout performer, expanding share by 0.7 percentage points to 6.0% as its exclusivity and craftsmanship held strong appeal among the ultra-wealthy. Chanel also gained share, largely through strategic price increases. By contrast, brands such as Gucci and Burberry lost ground amid unclear positioning and weaker product offerings.

Luxury apparel rebound drivers

Several structural factors underpin the recovery outlook. Ultra-wealthy customers continue to provide a stabilising base for top-tier luxury houses, maintaining demand and preserving brand equity. Meanwhile, improvements in broader macroeconomic conditions and rising consumer confidence should gradually bring back aspirational shoppers – the expanding middle and upper-middle segments whose purchasing power was most affected during the downturn.

Social media and influencer marketing are playing an increasingly important role in engaging younger buyers. Luxury brands are courting content creators and leaning into platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to capture Gen Z’s appetite for luxury. Collaborations with celebrities, entertainment franchises and other brands continue to deliver cultural moments that drive excitement and sales.

At the same time, the booming resale market presents both opportunity and challenge. Resale apparel is expected to grow sharply – by nearly 48% between 2024 and 2028 – with luxury items particularly coveted as more affordable options. Some houses have partnered with resale platforms to reclaim share, but secondhand channels remain a threat to full-price sales, especially among budget-conscious aspirational shoppers.

China’s 2024 slowdown – driven in part by its real estate crisis – hit the market hard, and while stimulus should support a recovery in 2025, Chinese shoppers are likely to remain cautious, amplified by government messaging discouraging ostentatious displays of wealth. Online luxury retail also faces challenges: the collapse of major multi-brand platforms in 2024 has reinforced the importance of brick-and-mortar boutiques, where premium service and in-store experience are key to selling high-priced items.

Impact of AI on the Plant-Based Alternatives Market

Artificial intelligence is reshaping the plant-based alternatives market by improving ingredient selection, refining texture and flavor development, and strengthening operational efficiency across the value chain. One major shift comes from AI-driven formulation tools that evaluate thousands of plant proteins, fats, and fibers to identify combinations that best replicate the functional properties of meat, dairy, and egg products. These systems analyze solubility, emulsification behavior, heat stability, and amino acid balance, allowing developers to fine-tune products without long cycles of physical testing. As a result, plant-based burgers, cheeses, milks, and yogurts can achieve more realistic textures and more stable nutritional profiles.

Flavor development has also become more targeted. Machine learning models map plant-based ingredients to specific sensory attributes, helping key players identify which compounds create metallic or beany notes and how to neutralize them. This approach supports cleaner labels by reducing reliance on masking agents and unnecessary additives.

AI also optimizes extrusion conditions, fermentation parameters, and homogenization processes. Real-time sensors track moisture, viscosity, and particle size, while predictive analytics adjust equipment settings to maintain batch consistency. This reduces waste and improves the scalability of plant-based manufacturing lines.

[TEXT]
After years of fending off allegations of labor violations at its warehouses and distribution centers, Amazon has found itself in the crosshairs of another segment of its workforce: delivery service providers.

The e-commerce titan is now being challenged by a coalition of small businesses that fulfill deliveries across the country, which have come together under the moniker “DSPs for Equitable and Fair Treatment,” or DEFT.

The group, which has retained legal representation with Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, aims to create what it sees as a more sustainable business model for the more than 2,000 DSPs that make up Amazon’s delivery network. It is currently accepting applications from these enterprises. In its eyes, improvements are needed when it comes to wages, bonus payouts and reimbursements for vehicle usage.

DEFT, which made its public debut on Black Friday, has identified other specific areas of focus, including rate cards that keep pace with rising inflation, simplified scorecards with metrics controlled by the DSPs and added compensation for initiatives aimed at “raising the bar.”

Through its legal counsel, the group—which aims to keep its individual members anonymous, for now—will negotiate with Amazon to remediate what it sees as inadequate compensation and benefits.

This isn’t the first time Amazon has run into trouble with the DSPs; in fact, tension has been building in recent months.

Amazon was forced hit pause on a proposal to redistribute its delivery vans after the small businesses that operate them pushed back. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, DSPs, which lease branded grey delivery vans from Amazon, must pay for repairs to the vehicles before they’re returned and re-deployed. Those DSPs reported receiving subsequent surprise bills from Amazon after sending the vans back, even though they’d already paid for the repairs themselves.

With insurance and fuel costs also on the rise, the cost of doing business is mounting for DSPs. Amazon’s compensation isn’t on par with the accelerating costs, DSPs told the Journal; the company said it would increase per-package payments by just 2 cents in September, though it promised to raise the minimum wage for drivers.

DEFT, which is a chapter of the longstanding American Association of Franchisees and Dealers (AAFD), aims to advocate for higher fee increases that it sees as commensurate with the changing economic landscape.

The group’s formation follows multiple efforts (only one successful) made by warehouse workers to unionize; efforts that the company has opposed and discouraged. But workers, and especially independent support providers, continue to rise up to challenge the company. In September, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Amazon illegally terminated 150 union-protected third-party drivers working out of a warehouse based in Queens, New York when it cut contracts with the DSPs that employed them. Amazon disputed the claim.

For its part, Amazon said it’s been working with a group of DSP owners to evolve the program, incorporating their feedback into the changes. The company told Sourcing Journal that it increased the profit range for prospective DSP owners to $100,000 to $400,000 per year, and is increasing its per-package rate by 20 percent beginning in January.

The web-based mega-retailer said DSPs currently have access to a number of revenue streams beyond their hourly rates and per-package rates, including compensation for training, monthly fleet payments and performance bonuses.

“The vast majority of Delivery Service Partners in our program are running successful, profitable businesses, and claims to the contrary are factually inaccurate. Our data shows DSP profitability is strong and has consistently improved year over year,” spokesperson Dannea DeLisser said. “DSPs have full control over their operations—from hiring to capacity planning and route assignments.”

DeLisser said the company has invested $16.7 billion into improvements for the DSP program over the past seven years. “These entrepreneurs are building scalable businesses that make a positive impact in their communities, and the feedback we receive reflects that success,” she added.
