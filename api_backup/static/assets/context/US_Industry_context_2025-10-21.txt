[TITLE]Lyten Completes Acquisition of Northvolt BESS Manufacturing Facility in Poland:
[TEXT]
Lyten announces it has completed the acquisition of Northvolt Dwa in Gdańsk, Poland, the largest Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) manufacturing facility in Europe.

Lyten is immediately restarting production and product development from Northvolt Dwa and targets sales before year end.

Lyten is on track to complete the acquisition of the remaining Northvolt assets in Sweden and German in the 4Q 2025.

SAN JOSE, Calif. & GDAŃSK, Poland — Lyten, the global leader in lithium-sulfur batteries and energy storage, announced this week that it has completed its acquisition of Northvolt Dwa in Gdańsk, Poland. Northvolt Dwa is a 25,000-square meter (270,000-square foot) battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturing and R&D facility that was opened in 2023. The facility includes equipment to ramp up to 6 GWh of energy storage manufacturing capacity and the ability to expand to up to 12 GWh in the future.

The Northvolt Dwa acquisition accelerates Lyten’s entry in the rapidly growing BESS market. The Gdańsk location will serve as a major EU hub for Lyten’s BESS manufacturing and will export products to countries throughout the EU and across the world. Lyten intends to initiate the restart process immediately and to produce first commercial units off the line prior to year-end 2025.

“The Northvolt Dwa facility in Gdańsk is a world-class asset servicing the rapidly growing and strategically important BESS market. As demand for electricity continues its rise throughout the world to support AI and economic development, distributed energy storage will become increasingly critical,” said Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and Co-Founder. “We are seeing demand from across the world and are restarting production immediately to begin fulfilling orders before the end of the year.”

Lyten acquired Northvolt’s BESS product portfolio and intellectual property in the third quarter 2025. The first product to be produced at Northvolt Dwa is the Voltpack Mobile System (VMS). The 3rd generation family of modular BESS products is optimized for the rapidly growing commercial, industrial, and evolving data center markets.

Robert Chryc-Gawrychowski was recently announced as CEO of Lyten Poland and will lead operations at Northvolt Dwa. Robert was previously CEO of Northvolt Poland and led Northvolt’s efforts in Poland through the planning, construction, and startup of Northvolt Dwa.

Robert stated, “BESS is now a critical technology for energy security and economic development, and it is increasingly important that Europe is able to manufacture batteries locally. We are appreciative of the support of this acquisition by the Polish government at the city, provincial and national level and for their shared enthusiasm for Gdańsk as an important BESS hub for Europe.”

Andrzej Domański, Poland Minister of Finance and Economy, stated, “Lyten’s operations in Gdańsk are part of a broader process of developing advanced energy technologies in Poland and across Europe. International cooperation in this field supports knowledge transfer, innovation, and the growth of local industrial expertise. We support projects that contribute to building a sustainable and competitive economy.”

Aleksandra Dulkiewicz, President of Gdańsk, added, “For Gdańsk, Lyten’s activities represent an opportunity to collaborate on the creation of energy innovation centers. We see many opportunities for cooperation – from research and development partnerships with universities, through pilot projects, to other activities aligned with Gdańsk’s development strategy and national and regional economic specializations.

On August 7th, Lyten announced binding agreements to acquire all remaining Northvolt operations in Sweden, Poland, and Germany, with manufacturing assets totaling approximately $5 billion in book value. Close of the remaining Sweden and Germany acquisitions are expected to continue through the 4Q 2025.

Auto giant Stellantis invests $13B in U.S. manufacturing expansion

Stellantis (parent company of Jeep, Dodge and Fiat) announced a $13 billion U.S. manufacturing expansion, creating 5,000 jobs across Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana by 2029.

The move aims to offset $1.7 billion in tariffs on vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico, highlighting geopolitical trade war pressures.

Despite promises of new jobs, Stellantis is shifting production (including a midsize truck) from Illinois to Ohio, continuing a trend of layoffs and automation under the guise of EV progress.

While CEO Antonio Filosa claims the investment will "strengthen our manufacturing footprint," critics see it as profit-driven restructuring, following decades of outsourcing and automation that harm American workers.

The push for EVs ignores affordability issues, reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains and safety risks (like immobility when batteries die). Meanwhile, automakers take taxpayer subsidies while slashing jobs – raising concerns

[TITLE]India’s equity capital market volumes to see heightened activity next year, Citi Group says:
[TEXT]
“We have already done close to $15 billion of IPOs since the beginning of 2025, and we have a few more in the pipeline. I think this year the volumes have largely increased, and the sizes have been bigger," Arvind Vashistha, head of Citi India’s equity capital markets, told Mint. He added that Indian companies could raise over $20 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs) by the end of this year.

“We are seeing IPOs of different sizes and scales from companies across sectors, including financials & fintech, infrastructure and healthcare, come to market, and that is keeping the public market activity steady. There’s still a lot more to happen in November and December, and we expect it to remain a busy period," added Rahul Saraf, Citi India’s head of investment banking. He further said that the firm is seeing more instances of private equity-backed firms exploring IPOs.

Key Takeaways India’s Equity Capital Market volumes are expected to exceed $46 billion next year, suggesting a significant increase in capital raising activity.

The IPO market is the main driver and is expected to generate over $20 billion by the year end.

The current IPO pipeline consists of a high-quality, diverse set of companies that are described as being scaled and profitable.

The activity is supported by rising domestic capital and global factors, like geopolitical issues prompting MNCs to list Indian subsidiaries for liquidity or debt paring.

M&A is seeing a mix of foreign strategic inflow and increasing outbound acquisitions by Indian companies, who are taking advantage of their unlevered balance sheets and lower valuations in some international markets.

Some of the IPOs where Citi India was mandated include the listings of Tata Capital, LG Electronics India and Hexaware Technologies, among others. Its other anticipated IPOs for this year include Lenskart, Meesho, Groww and Pinelabs.

“There is a very high-quality pipeline of companies that want to go public, and as we come into the latter part of this year, we are seeing that the number of assets which are looking to tap for an IPO are reasonably scaled and profitable," Vashistha said. He also anticipates an increase in Qualified Institutional Placements (QIPs), which is a way for listed companies to raise capital, with higher average ticket sizes for firms to meet their growth ambitions.

The investment bank facilitated State Bank of India’s QIP, one of the largest transactions of this year. It was also involved in British American Tobacco’s stake sale in ITC.

Domestic capital

The increase in activity also comes on the back of rising domestic capital, fueled by higher retail investor participation coupled with a mix of geopolitical issues that have prompted many multinational companies to list their Indian subsidiaries to pare debt, reduce exposure and get some interim liquidity.

Saraf added that mergers and acquisitions have also seen differentiated strategies play out, with foreign strategic money coming into India even as global MNCs evaluate options for sale in some entities. “The deals we are seeing today don’t have one central theme. It has been purely on a case-to-case basis, and there have been varying sentiments across companies and sectors," he said, adding that the firm is also seeing more instances of “collaborations, partnerships, and alliances" with Indian companies.

Some of the prominent M&A transactions that Citi India was involved with include Akzo Nobel's sale to JSW Paints, SMBC’s acquisition of stake in Yes Bank, IHC's controlling stake acquisition in Sammaan Capital, the sale of Blackstone's minority stake in VFS Global to Temasek, UC Regents and others and Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS.

Indian companies are also more actively exploring acquisitions in different geographies to diversify their exposure and de-risk themselves on the back of the ongoing tariff war.

“Many of our Indian clients have an unlevered balance sheet, and there is a lot of liquidity in the system. This, coupled with a stable government and some international geographies having lower multiples and valuations, has made acquiring companies seem like an attractive option," Saraf said.

“It is also encouraging that there is a lot of capital available in India. Private equity firms are hungry, and they are keen to buy or pay a premium for a good asset," he said, adding that deals have also become more complex with domestic strategics also becoming more acquisitive in nature. “In recent times, we have also seen 2-3 situations when domestic strategics have taken a longer-term view and won against private equity."

[TITLE]‘Ether Caught Fire’: ETH Surged as Capital Fled Bitcoin in Q3, CoinGecko Report Finds:
[TEXT]
Ethereum ETH $ 3,986.80 emerged as the frontrunner in crypto’s third-quarter recovery, leaving bitcoin BTC $ 110,525.27 behind as capital flowed into altcoins, DeFi protocols, and a new wave of tokenized assets, a report by CoinCecko found.

The broader market added over half a trillion dollars in value, its second straight quarter of meaningful growth, but this time, it wasn’t bitcoin leading the charge. Instead, investors looked to ethereum ETH $ 3,986.80 and other large-cap tokens to carry momentum forward, a report by CoinCecko found.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

At the start of July, it looked like bitcoin would again set the pace. Its price hit new highs early in the quarter, buoyed by retail interest and institutional inflows through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

But by September, the narrative had changed. While bitcoin cooled off, ether caught fire.

A combination of ETF demand, growing interest in tokenized real-world assets, and renewed attention from corporate treasuries helped ETH hit a fresh all-time high before settling back.

That shift in focus was one of the quarter’s defining trends, analysts at CoinGecko wrote.

Trading activity, which had fallen for two straight quarters, snapped back with strength. Spot volumes surged across centralized and decentralized exchanges. But the story wasn’t just about volume, it was about where that volume was going.

Meme coins, long considered fringe, made a dramatic return with tokens like M climbing the charts. Stablecoins like USDe gained ground, and lesser-known altcoins entered the top 30 by market cap. DeFi, which had faded from the spotlight in late 2024, mounted a comeback as total value locked in lending and staking protocols climbed alongside Ethereum’s rise, according to the report.

A shift in investor appetite

Behind the scenes, structural shifts were taking shape.

Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market declined, a sign that investor appetite had moved toward other narratives. Ethereum gained ground, but so did categories that had struggled to break through in previous years, particularly tokenized assets.

A new generation of on-chain stocks and bonds began to take hold, and protocols like Ondo and Backed Finance gained traction with investors looking to bridge traditional and decentralized finance.

Bitcoin also became less tied to legacy markets. Its price movement decoupled from the S&P 500 for the first time in over a year. That could be read as a positive, the report stated, and proof that crypto is becoming a more independent asset class. But it also reflects how investor attention has fragmented, the report stated.

Even the mining sector reflected this changing dynamic. Bitcoin’s hashrate hit record highs, and miner-focused ETFs posted strong returns.

However, the spotlight was elsewhere: on emerging tokens, Ethereum’s momentum, and the rebirth of DeFi, the report found.

[TEXT]
Craig : Your efforts were certainly validated when Trimble acquired 10-4 in 2017. What was that acquisition process like for you?

Travis: Certainly. The journey was anything but a straight line. For example, we initially positioned 10-4 as a kind of “LinkedIn for truckers,” but we quickly realized the market needed something more comprehensive. Over time, we honed in on building a platform that not only offered real-time shipment tracking but also facilitated collaboration between all supply chain participants. This pivot was crucial, especially because many of our prospective clients were accustomed to traditional methods like phone calls and faxes. It was a big shift for them to adopt real-time digital visibility.

[TITLE]Why Automakers Are Racing to Adopt Wireless Charging:
[TEXT]
Both static and dynamic charging methods are under development, with government initiatives like the U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and federal tax credits further accelerating the deployment and adoption of wireless EV charging infrastructure.

The global market for wireless electric vehicle (EV) charging is progressing towards widespread commercial adoption, supported by international standards, significant performance enhancements, and substantial government funding.

Wireless charging for electric vehicles (EVs) is quickly becoming a serious commercial option, backed by global safety standards, proven technology, and major funding from governments.

This "park and charge" technology is now an official part of the growing EV market, aiming to make owning an electric car much simpler for consumers.

The core idea is simple: charge a car just by parking it over a special pad. Industry experts view this hands-free approach as a key way to boost EV adoption because it solves the hassle of plugging in cables. A study showed that giving consumers a wireless charging option could increase the chance of them buying an EV by 40 percent.

Standardization and Technology Drive Adoption

A crucial step toward market acceptance was the creation of a universal standard. SAE International J2954 is the global guideline that ensures different brands of vehicles and charging pads can work together smoothly. This standard sets power levels for passenger cars at 3.7 kW, 7.7 kW, and 11 kW, with charging efficiency reaching up to 93 percent, which is comparable to plug-in chargers.

The standard also includes a special tool called the Differential Inductive Positioning System. This system helps vehicles automatically line up perfectly over the charging pad, even in bad weather. This is especially important for the future of self-driving (autonomous) EVs that will need to charge themselves without any human help. SAE is already working on a future standard, J2954/2, to handle much higher power levels, up to 500 kW, for larger, heavy-duty vehicles.

Performance tests confirm the technology is ready for real-world use. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) recently developed a static system that delivered 100 kW of power to an EV with 96 percent efficiency. This level of power can add a 50 percent charge in just 20 minutes, demonstrating that wireless charging can match or exceed the speed of many traditional chargers.

Static and Dynamic Charging

The electric car technology is splitting into two main applications:

Static Charging: This is the most developed form, where an EV charges while parked. It is the focus of the SAE J2954 standard and is best suited for homes, public parking spots, and commercial depots.

Dynamic Charging: This revolutionary method involves putting charging coils directly into roadways to charge vehicles while they are driving. Projects around the world are testing this, including a quarter-mile electric road in Detroit, Michigan, using technology from Electreon. The project successfully charged a Ford E-Transit van while it was moving. Similarly, Italy's "Arena of the Future" project is testing this process for vehicles made by companies like Stellantis and IVECO. Dynamic charging aims to eliminate the stress of "range anxiety" and could lead to smaller, lighter, and cheaper EV batteries.

Key Players and Government Support

The industry involves a mix of specialized tech companies and major automakers. Key companies that provide the underlying technology include WiTricity, which was spun out of MIT and provides foundational technology for the SAE standard, along with InductEV, Electreon, and HEVO Inc. Large global corporations like Samsung, Qualcomm, Toyota, and BYD are also heavily involved, working to secure their place in the market through intellectual property and patents.

Related: Why Gold Continues to Shine Brighter Than Stocks

Government funding is a major driver of market growth.

In the United States, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law set aside a total of $7.5 billion for EV charging infrastructure. This includes $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program.

While the cost of setting up wireless charging systems is still higher than for typical plug-in chargers, the promise of convenience and automation is a strong selling point. As more companies adopt the universal standard and the manufacturing process becomes more efficient, experts predict that costs will drop after two thousand twenty-five.

The usefulness of the technology extends beyond passenger cars. For commercial fleets—such as electric delivery vans and public transit buses—wireless charging allows vehicles to charge automatically and continuously, reducing labor costs and minimizing downtime. This broad range of applications suggests that wireless charging is on track to become a standard feature in the electric transportation sector.

[TITLE]Chicago suburb is joining a quiet revolution in paratransit service:
[TEXT]
The EV revolution isn’t just happening on the main routes of big cities, it’s increasingly happening in the commercial vehicle space – and paratransit services offer a nearly ideal use case for battery-powered rides.

Paratransit is a demand-responsive mobility service for people with limited mobility who can’t access tradiational public transit options. EVs work great in this space, thanks to their smoother operation, quiet running, and the lack of surface-level carbon emissions that could cause immediate damage to these vulnerable passengers. That makes electric vans and buses ideally suited to the quieter, more community-focused world of paratransit, where the shift is gaining steady momentum.

The latest evidence comes from Schaumburg, Illinois, where the Chicago area suburb is testing a new fleet of electric buses dedicated to serving older adults and other people with disabilities, demonstrating that the push for zero-emission transportation can be as much

[TITLE]To hit back at the United States in trade war, China borrows from the US playbook:
[TEXT]
China has expanded its export rules on rare earths, requiring foreign firms to get approval for exporting products containing even small amounts of China-originated materials

To hit back at the United States in trade war, China borrows from the US playbook

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — China likes to condemn the United States for extending its arm too far outside of its borders to make demands on non-American companies. But when it sought to hit back at the U.S. interests this month, Beijing did exactly the same.

In expanding export rules on rare earths, Beijing for the first time announced it will require foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even tiny amounts of China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology.

That means a South Korean smartphone maker must ask for Beijing's permission to sell the devices to Australia if the phones contain China-originated rare earth materials, said Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative. “This rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy in the technology supply chain,” he said.

For anyone familiar with U.S. trade practice, China is simply borrowing a decades-long U.S. policy: the foreign direct product rule. It extends the reach of U.S. law to foreign-made products, and it has been used regularly to restrict China's access to certain U.S. technologies made outside of the United States, even when they are in the hands of foreign companies.

It is the latest example of Beijing turning to U.S. precedents for tools it needs to stare down Washington in what appears to be an extended trade war between the world's two largest economies.

“China is learning from the best,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. “Beijing is copying Washington’s playbook because it saw firsthand how effectively U.S. export controls could constrain its own economic development and political choices."

He added: “Game recognizes game."

It was in 2018, when President Donald Trump launched a trade war with China, that Beijing felt the urgency to adopt a set of laws and policies that it could readily deploy when new trade conflicts arise. And it looked to Washington for ideas.

Its Unreliable Entity List, established in 2020 by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, resembles the U.S. Commerce Department's “entity list” that restricts certain foreign companies from doing businesses with the U.S.

In 2021, Beijing adopted the anti-foreign sanction law, allowing agencies such as the Chinese Foreign Ministry to deny visas and freeze the assets of unwelcome individuals and businesses — similar to what the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Treasury can do.

Calling it a toolkit against foreign sanctions, intervention and long-arm jurisdiction, the state-run news agency China News in a 2021 news report cited an ancient Chinese teaching, saying Beijing would be “hitting back with the enemy's methods.”

The law “has combed through relevant foreign legislation and taken into consideration the international law and the basic principles of international relations,” said the Chinese scholar Li Qingming as quoted in the news report. He also said it could deter the other side from escalating.

Other formal measures Beijing has adopted in the past several years include expanded export controls and foreign investment review tools.

Jeremy Daum, a senior research scholar in law and senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, said Beijing often draws from foreign models in developing its laws in non-trade, non foreign-related areas. As China seeks capabilities to retaliate in kind in trade and sanctions, the tools are often “very parallel” to those of the U.S., he said.

Both governments also have adopted a “holistic view of national security,” which expands the concept to justify restrictions on each other, Daum said.

When Trump launched his trade war with China shortly after he returned to the White House earlier this year, Beijing readily deployed its new tools in addition to raising tariffs to match those imposed by the U.S. president.

In February, in response to Trump's first 10% tariff on China over allegations that Beijing failed to curb the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl, the Chinese Commerce Ministry put PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the biotechnology company Illumina, on the unreliable entity list.

That barred them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Beijing also announced export controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, which are elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products.

In March, when Trump imposed the second 10%, fentanyl-related tariff, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list and added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others, asserting that they “endanger China’s national security and interests.”

Then came the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, when Beijing not only matched Trump's sky-high tariff of 125% but also blacklisted more U.S. companies and announced export controls on more rare earth minerals. That led to a pause in the shipment of magnets needed in manufacturing a wide range of products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, jet planes and missiles.

While the new tools have allowed China to stare down the United States, Daum said they are not without risks.

“The dangers in such a facially balanced and fair approach are, one, what one side sees as reciprocity the other might interpret as escalation,” he said. And second, "in a race to the bottom, nobody wins.”

ASELSAN shines as defense stocks ride global rally

ISTANBUL

Defense and aerospace companies have delivered strong returns to investors as countries increase defense budgets and continue major projects, with Türkiye's ASELSAN standing out for its remarkable performance.

Following the Russia-Ukraine war and heightened security threats, many European nations have decided to boost defense investments. This surge in spending has fueled rapid gains in the share prices of defense and aerospace firms. NATO leaders’ decision to raise defense expenditures to 5 percent of GDP by 2035 has further strengthened the sector’s momentum in global markets.

Against this backdrop, stock performance over the first nine months of the year shows significant gains for investors: South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace rose 239 percent, Germany’s Rheinmetall 221.9 percent, Türkiye’s ASELSAN 196.6 percent, Sweden’s Saab 145.8 percent, the U.K.’s Rolls-Royce 109.3 percent, Italy’s Leonardo 108.3 percent and the U.K.’s BAE Systems 79.3 percent.

ASELSAN continues to play a pioneering role in the development and transformation of Türkiye’s defense technologies while also impressing with its financial results. The company became the first listed firm on Borsa Istanbul to surpass a market capitalization of 1 trillion Turkish Liras.

ASELSAN is working toward its goal of ranking among the world’s top 30 defense companies by 2030. Currently, it holds the highest market value within the BIST 100 index.

Meanwhile, on Borsa Istanbul, shares of Onur Yüksek Teknoloji remained unchanged, while SDT Space and Defense fell 3.1 percent and Altınay Defense dropped 11.8 percent. Other Turkish defense companies also showed mixed performances over the nine-month period. Papilon Savunma gained 26.2 percent, Otokar advanced 5.8 percent, Onur Yüksek Teknoloji ended flat, SDT Uzay ve Savunma declined 3.1 percent and Altınay Savunma recorded a sharper loss of 11.8 percent.
