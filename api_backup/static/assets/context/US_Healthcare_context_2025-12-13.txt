[TITLE]Citi Asserts Buy Rating on Summit Therapeutics Inc. (SMMT) on Pipeline Development:
[TEXT]
Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMT) is one of the best biotech stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts. On December 4, Citi analyst Yigal Nochomovitz reiterated a Buy rating on Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMT) and set a $131.90 price target.

Citi Asserts Buy Rating on Summit Therapeutics Inc. (SMMT) on Pipeline Development

The positive stance follows the Jefferies London Healthcare Conference 2025, during which the company showcased its strategic advancements, including the development of ivonescimab, a novel PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody. Ivonescimab has already been given to more than 3,000 patients in clinical trials and over 40,000 patients in both commercial and clinical settings, including in China, demonstrating its widespread use.

The Harmony 3 study continues to move forward, with pivotal readouts expected in 2026 and 2027, and a BLA filing for EGFR second-line therapy planned this quarter. Early clinical data have been encouraging. The Harmoni 6 trial reported a hazard ratio of 0.60, a 40% improvement versus standard care in squamous NSCLC, while updated Harmony A results showed an overall survival hazard ratio of 0.74. The squamous cohort of Harmony 3 is more than 80% enrolled and should finish in the first half of 2026, with the non-squamous cohort expected to complete later that year.

Summit has also started a new colorectal cancer study, and its partnership with Revolution Medicine aims to combine ivonescimab with RAS inhibitors, with patient dosing expected to begin early next year. PFS and interim survival readouts planned for 2026 could further support ivonescimab’s potential role in cancer treatment.

With more than $750M in cash from recent financing, the company says it has enough capital to support operations and key milestones for the next 12 to 18 months.

Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMT) is a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for serious unmet medical needs, primarily in oncology, with its lead drug, ivonescimab, a bispecific antibody.

[TITLE]Rutland Regional Medical Center withdraws request to close pediatric beds:
[TEXT]

Updated at 5:54 p.m.

Rutland Regional Medical Center has voluntarily withdrawn its request to close five pediatric inpatient beds following a bruising public hearing and over 150 public comments in opposition to the decision.

The hospital says it still intends to pursue a redesign of its pediatric services, but it will work directly with the Vermont Agency of Human Services to continue this transformation work rather than going through the state’s main health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board.

Last Friday, the care board held the first hearing of its kind to evaluate the potential closure.

During that meeting, regulators interrogated the hospital’s confusing financial reports, whether its administrators had assessed the true cost of the closure to families and the state’s health care system and if it had considered alternatives — like having fewer beds or more adaptable ones.

Rutland’s desire to close the inpatient beds is part of a broader challenge rural hospitals across the state are facing as they struggle to balance low patient volume while maintaining care quality and still balancing their budgets.

In Friday’s hearing, care board member David Murman distilled the issue to a question.

“How do we as a rural state balance access to essential services that are needed in communities with the reality that some of these services are fairly low volume, and we have very few options for admitting pediatrics in Vermont?” he asked.

The hospital is not alone in this push to close pediatric services. Thursday’s news comes the same week as a high-profile paper landed in the journal Pediatrics finding a much broader trend of hospitals around the country drastically reducing their pediatric inpatient services over the last 20 years. The authors found that hospitals providing no pediatric care beyond the emergency department more than doubled.

If the Rutland hospital had closed its pediatric inpatient beds, most of the region’s children would have needed to receive care through extended stays in the emergency department or through a transfer to a larger, academic hospital, like University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington,

[TITLE]Cycle Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Applied Therapeutics:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLT; “Applied”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to creating transformative treatments for rare diseases, today announced a definitive agreement for Cycle Group Holdings Limited (“Cycle”) to acquire Applied Therapeutics.

Applied Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the development of novel drug candidates against validated molecular targets in rare diseases. Applied’s lead drug candidate, govorestat, is a novel central nervous system (CNS) penetrant Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) for the treatment of CNS rare metabolic diseases, including Classic Galactosemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency (CMT-SORD) and phosphomannomutase 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG).

“We are confident that Cycle has the resources and capabilities to move govorestat forward towards the ultimate goal of bringing a life-changing treatment to the patients suffering from Classic Galactosemia, CMT-SORD and PMM2-CDG, who have always been at the center of everything we do at Applied,” said Les Funtleyder, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Applied. “I want to thank the entire Applied team for their perseverance and commitment. We are also grateful to the investigators and patients who have contributed to the development of govorestat.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cycle will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock for a per share price of $0.088 per share in cash payable at closing plus one non-transferrable contingent value right (CVR) that entitles the holder to receive potential additional payments.

The CVR provides payments based on the following:

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for any galactosemia indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for the CMT-SORD indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.20 per CVR in cash payable upon the first achievement of worldwide net sales of any product covered by the CVR by Cycle, its affiliates or licensees equal to or exceeding $200 million dollars in any four-quarter fiscal period prior to the tenth anniversary of closing.

Each CVR holder will also be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any cash of Applied in excess of $500,000 at closing (capped at $1.5 million) (“Closing Cash Payment”).

Each such CVR and Closing Cash Payment will be paid only once, if at all.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions contained in the merger agreement that will be filed with the SEC, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock. The merger agreement does not include a financing condition. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions. If the tender offer closes, then Cycle would acquire untendered shares of Applied through a second-step merger for the same consideration.

Applied also issued a Promissory Note (the “Promissory Note”) to Cycle. The Promissory Note is unsecured and enables Applied to receive loans aggregating up to $8.5 million from Cycle, to fund Applied’s working capital needs under an approved budget. Cycle’s funding obligations cease, and amounts borrowed immediately becomes repayable, if the transaction is terminated for certain reasons. Absent funds provided by Cycle under the Promissory Note or from another source, Applied would be unable to continue to fund its activities for more than a limited number of days and Applied would anticipate proceeding to wind down operations.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Applied Board of Directors following an extensive evaluation of strategic alternatives. This evaluation process included numerous discussions with potential counterparties. The Applied Board of Directors determined that entering into the merger agreement with Cycle represented the path that best advanced the interests of Applied and its stockholders.

For Cycle, Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as legal counsel. For Applied, Aquilo Partners, L.P. provided a fairness opinion, and Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel.

The price target hike follows the company’s agreement to acquire Bluejay Therapeutics for $620 million in cash. With the acquisition, the company gains worldwide rights to brelovitug, a monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis D, a rare and aggressive liver condition.

“This acquisition fits squarely with what we do best—advancing high-impact medicines for patients with rare diseases through disciplined development, regulatory innovation, and commercial excellence,” Mirum CEO Chris Peetz said in the release.

The acquisition of Brelovitug comes on the heels of 100% HDV RNA response in Phase 2 clinical trials, with Phase 3 results expected in the second half of next year.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley have also reiterated an Overweight rating on Mirum Pharmaceuticals with an $81 price target. The investment bank views the deal as a smart strategic move for Mirum, saying it bolsters the company’s position in rare liver diseases while offering clear synergies with its current commercial setup. The firm also projects that the enlarged pipeline could generate more than $4 billion in peak sales.

Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIRM) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering treatments for rare and debilitating liver diseases, especially those affecting children, by transforming scientific discoveries into therapies such as their key drug LIVMARLI (maralixibat) for cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC).

While we acknowledge the potential of MIRM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Effectiveness of 2024–2025 COVID-19 Vaccines in Children in the United States — VISION, August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025:
[TEXT]
Methods

Data Source

The Virtual SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Other respiratory viruses Network (VISION) is a multisite electronic health record (EHR)–based network including ED/UCs and hospitals in nine states used to estimate VE. Methods for VE analyses in both adult and pediatric populations within VISION have been described (3–6). In VISION VE analyses, eligible encounters at participating health care systems are those among patients who have received molecular testing (e.g., real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction) or antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the 10 days before or ≤72 hours after an eligible ED/UC encounter or hospital admission for COVID-19–like illness.§§ This analysis included encounters among eligible immunocompetent children and adolescents aged 9 months–17 years who visited a participating ED/UC during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025. COVID-19 vaccination history is ascertained from state or jurisdictional registries, EHRs, and, in a subset of sites, medical claims data.¶¶

Data Analysis

Eligible encounters from seven participating health care systems, including 256 ED/UCs, during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025, were included. Case-patients were those with an ED/UC encounter for COVID-19–like illness and receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular or antigen test result; control patients were those with an ED/UC encounter for COVID-19–like illness and receipt of a negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result.***

Children were excluded from analyses if they received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose <7 days before their index date††† or received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose <2 months after receiving any previous COVID-19 vaccine dose, unless part of an initial series. COVID-19 case-patients were also excluded if they received a positive test result for influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus at the time of their SARS-CoV-2 ED/UC encounter. To reduce bias from overlapping vaccination patterns, control patients who received a positive or indeterminant influenza test result were excluded from the primary analysis (7). Previous SARS-CoV-2 infections are incompletely documented in medical records; therefore, children were included regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Primary VE analyses were conducted by age groups 9 months–4 years and 5–17 years due to differences in the recommended COVID-19 vaccination schedule. In primary VE analyses, children aged 9 months–4 years were considered vaccinated if they completed an initial series with at least 1 2024–2025 dose as part of that series or completed an initial series and then received a 2024–2025 dose as an additional vaccine. The 9 months–4 years comparator group comprised children who had completed the initial COVID-19 vaccine series but had not received a 2024–2025 dose or had no recorded COVID-19 vaccination. Children aged 9 months–4 years with an incomplete initial series were excluded from the primary analysis to assess the ACIP-recommended schedule for this age group. A sensitivity analysis among children aged 9 months–4 years compared children who received at least 1 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with children who did not, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination history. Among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, primary VE analyses compared those who received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with those who did not, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination history. Results were also stratified by age groups of 5–11 years and 12–17 years.

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, comparing persons who received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with those who did not among case-patients and control patients, as described in this report. Models were adjusted a priori for age in years, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day (days since August 29, 2024, to account for variability in COVID-19 circulation), and geographic region with age and calendar day included as natural splines.§§§ VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted OR) x 100% during the first 7–179 days since receipt of the most recent 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Sensitivity analyses in both the 9 months–4 years and 5–17 years age groups examined VE during the 7–299 days since receipt of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose.

Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.2; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶

[TITLE]Rutland Regional Medical Center withdraws request to close pediatric beds:
[TEXT]

Updated at 5:54 p.m.

Rutland Regional Medical Center has voluntarily withdrawn its request to close five pediatric inpatient beds following a bruising public hearing and over 150 public comments in opposition to the decision.

The hospital says it still intends to pursue a redesign of its pediatric services, but it will work directly with the Vermont Agency of Human Services to continue this transformation work rather than going through the state’s main health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board.

Last Friday, the care board held the first hearing of its kind to evaluate the potential closure.

During that meeting, regulators interrogated the hospital’s confusing financial reports, whether its administrators had assessed the true cost of the closure to families and the state’s health care system and if it had considered alternatives — like having fewer beds or more adaptable ones.

Rutland’s desire to close the inpatient beds is part of a broader challenge rural hospitals across the state are facing as they struggle to balance low patient volume while maintaining care quality and still balancing their budgets.

In Friday’s hearing, care board member David Murman distilled the issue to a question.

“How do we as a rural state balance access to essential services that are needed in communities with the reality that some of these services are fairly low volume, and we have very few options for admitting pediatrics in Vermont?” he asked.

The hospital is not alone in this push to close pediatric services. Thursday’s news comes the same week as a high-profile paper landed in the journal Pediatrics finding a much broader trend of hospitals around the country drastically reducing their pediatric inpatient services over the last 20 years. The authors found that hospitals providing no pediatric care beyond the emergency department more than doubled.

If the Rutland hospital had closed its pediatric inpatient beds, most of the region’s children would have needed to receive care through extended stays in the emergency department or through a transfer to a larger, academic hospital, like University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington,
