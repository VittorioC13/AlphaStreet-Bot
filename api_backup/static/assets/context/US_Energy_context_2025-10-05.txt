TDK Ventures, Inc., has announced that it is investing in geothermal power-generation company Rodatherm, which is primarily focused on the Great Basin region in the Western United States. Geothermal energy doesn’t get a lot of press; perhaps that is because it is mostly out of sight and solar power and wind power are far more visible to most people. Geothermal does have great potential to “fill in” where intermittent renewable energy has some gaps.

As such, when combined with hydropower, pumped storage, and batteries for backup electricity, geothermal could provide great service to electrical grids. In fact, if it can be utilized fully, it might be enough on its own. Although, that may not be necessary. “The USGS has estimated that with advances in technology, nearly 520,000 MWe could be generated in high-temperature but low-permeability rock formations. This is more than enough energy to power every home in the U.S.”

How to get there is not entirely clear at this point, but some companies are working to develop more geothermal resources. TDK Ventures just announced an investment in one.

David Delfassy, Investment Director, and Adam Erlichman, Investment Analyst, who both work at TDK Ventures, answered some questions for CleanTechnica.

What is Rodatherm Energy Corporation and what does it do?

Rodatherm is a geothermal energy company, with a novel, next-gen design. They will generate electricity from their system and sell it to offtakers. Recent offtakers in the next-gen geothermal space have been utilities and hyperscalers.

Why is TDK investing in it?

TDK Ventures formed an investment in the geothermal space over the past year or so (see some of our writing here).

We found that Rodatherm fit our thesis exceptionally well and had a unique ability to generate venture-like returns in the space.

How does its patented advanced geothermal system (AGS) work?

Its system is actually quite unlike existing AGS systems, which we chose to not invest in due to their thermodynamic limits. We believe their CAPEX costs (relative to their power output) will be prohibitively high and unable to be economical.

Rodatherm’s system is fully cased and pressurized, uses a novel working fluid, has a modular well design, and has a direct-drive turbine. There are also some other critical system design aspects that aren’t public, and some finer points readers can learn about through Roda’s public patents.

What will Rodatherm use the $38M Series A funding for?

Rodatherm is focused on building its first commercial-scale system. It hopes to validate its system through this capital to open the door for more traditional project finance. Of course, Rodatherm is also continuing to build out its team, land portfolio, and technical abilities.

When will the first pilot project be completed and what will its electricity capacity be?

Rodatherm is tentatively hoping to have its first site completed and operational by the end of 2026. Of course, this is a very aggressive deadline and would be uniquely fast in the geothermal space.

When expanded, what will the potential electricity capacity of the full power project be?

Their first commercial site is targeting 100 MW of output.

In theory, how long could one of their geothermal power installations produce electricity, in years?

There are hopes the system could run for decades, perhaps even 40 (or more) years. Our firm underwrote to a 20-year lifetime, but we felt this was a very conservative assumption. Rodatherm’s system projects to be best-in-class for reliability.

Is their geothermal technology cost competitive with other forms of new electricity generation?

While the system has not been built yet, and there are currently a number of unknowns, we do believe it will be. Management projects to reach $40–50/MWh, even in early projects, and we believe there is upside from even that low point. Of course, this is much lower than other forms of clean, firm energy. And much lower than early deployments from other newer clean, firm technologies like nuclear SMRs.

We will have hard data here once the system is built, and will defer to those actual results.

[TITLE]Clean Energy Technologies’ Waste Heat to Power & RPG Energy Group Delivers Breakthrough ORC Project in Martin, Tennessee:
[TEXT]
IRVINE, CA., Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETY) (the “Company” or “CETY”), a clean energy technology company delivering complete lifecycle solutions & technologies in power generation, storage, waste-to-energy, and heat-to-power, announced today that its Clean Cycle II™ Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology has been deployed in Martin, Tennessee. The project, led by RPG Energy Group, was one of the most challenging — and rewarding — projects in its history: designing and delivering a waste heat recapture system using ORC technology for a Fortune 100 company. The project is one of the first of its kind in U.S. industrial manufacturing and sets a new benchmark for efficiency and corporate stewardship.

In today’s industrial landscape, corporations face relentless pressure to protect margins, reduce operating costs, and achieve environmental goals. One of the most overlooked threats to profitability is also one of the least visible: energy inefficiency. By bringing CETY’s technology to life in Martin, RPG proved that U.S. manufacturers can tackle these inefficiencies head-on and generate measurable returns.

Manufacturing plants release vast amounts of waste heat into the environment every day. For this Fortune 100 company , a recognized global leader in efficiency and sustainability, leaving that energy untapped was unacceptable. By working with CETY and RPG, they turned that liability into an opportunity — transforming waste heat into clean, usable electricity.

“The Martin project sets an example for industrial America. Waste heat recovery is complex, but it is achievable with the right partners, technology, and vision. RPG Energy Group is proud to have led this effort alongside CETY, paving the way for more projects that merge profitability, resilience, and sustainability,” said Jami Krynski, CEO of RPG.

“This installation demonstrates how industrial manufacturers can turn an untapped liability into a strategic advantage,” said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. “Our ORC solution not only reduces energy costs but also advances sustainability commitments — and it does so in a way that is replicable across industrial America.”

Partnership with RPG Energy Group

CETY partnered with RPG Energy Group to integrate the ORC system. RPG provided project development and integration support, guiding the process from feasibility through delivery. Together, the companies overcame the integration challenges that have historically slowed ORC adoption in the U.S.

“We value RPG’s role in bringing their expertise in development and integration,” Mahdi added. “This project reflects the strength of our combined efforts and the importance of collaboration in advancing clean energy solutions.”

[TITLE]U.S. Backs Historic Deal to Keep Kurdish Oil Moving:
[TEXT]
The U.S. Administration wants to ensure that the just-restarted oil exports from Iraq’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan continue to flow via pipeline to Turkey in the long run, an anonymous official at the U.S. Department of State told Bloomberg on Friday.

The Trump Administration is working toward the goal of keeping Kurdistan’s crude flowing in the long term to boost the Iraqi economy, counter Iran’s influence in the region, and benefit U.S. companies operating in Iraq, according to the official.

The U.S. has played a role in the deal that allowed the resumption of the exports from Kurdistan, the official told Bloomberg.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented last week on the agreement to restart exports, saying on X “We welcome the announcement that the Government of Iraq has reached an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government and international companies to reopen the Iraq-Türkiye pipeline. This deal, facilitated by the United States, will bring tangible benefits for both Americans and Iraqis while reaffirming Iraq’s sovereignty.”

Kurdistan’s oil exports resumed on Saturday, September 27, following a two and a half year suspension of the flows via the pipeline from northern Iraq to the Turkish Mediterranean coast.

Eight foreign companies operating in Kurdistan have signed agreements with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Federal Government of Iraq to enable the restart of international crude exports from Kurdistan.

This agreement paved to way to the restart of exports, which were halted for two and a half years, after they were shut in in March 2023 due to a dispute over who should authorize the Kurdish exports.

The federal government in Baghdad and the regional Kurdish government in Erbil squabbled for more than two years over who should be responsible for the oil exports and the subsequent revenue distribution.

Under the agreement, hailed as historic by Iraq’s federal government, KRG is delivering about 190,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to Iraqi state marketing company SOMO. Kurdistan is also entitled to keep 50,000 bpd to use for local consumption.

[TITLE]BP Invests in New $5 Billion U.S. Gulf Oil Project:
[TEXT]
BP has reached the final investment decision on its estimated $5 billion Tiber-Guadalupe project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as part of its strategy to grow upstream production and boost its U.S. output to more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030.

Tiber-Guadalupe, 100%-owned by the UK-based supermajor, will be BP’s seventh operated oil and gas production hub in the Gulf of America, featuring a new floating production platform with the capacity to produce 80,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

Production from the project is expected to start in 2030 and is one of the 8-10 major projects that BP plans to start up globally between 2028 and 2030.

The estimated $5 billion Tiber-Guadalupe project is fully accommodated within BP prudent financial framework, which the supermajor geared toward the upstream business earlier this year in a major strategy reset to slash investments in renewables and focus on its core business of producing oil and gas.

Under the new strategy, BP will aim for 10 new major upstream projects to start up by the end of 2027, and a further 8–10 projects by the end of 2030. Production is also expected to grow to 2.3–2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in 2030, with capacity to increase to 2035.

In the United States, together with its 100%-owned Kaskida project, BP expects to invest around $10 billion to deliver its Gulf of America Paleogene projects.

Tiber-Guadalupe and Kaskida will help BP to boost its capacity to produce more than 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from the U.S. offshore region by 2030. The major aims to increase its offshore and onshore production in the United States to more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030.

“Along with its sister project Kaskida, Tiber-Guadalupe will play a critical role in bp’s focus on delivering secure and reliable energy the world needs today and tomorrow,” said Andy Krieger, BP’s senior vice president, Gulf of America and Canada.

Just last week, BP said that global oil demand is set to rise through 2030 amid weaker-than-expected efficiency gains. In its 2025 Energy Outlook, BP ditched its forecast from last year that oil demand could peak as soon as this year.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies sells half of US solar portfolio, invests in natural gas assets:
[TEXT]

As anti-renewables sentiment swirls in the United States, French international energy giant TotalEnergies is offloading half of its North American solar portfolio in a transaction with an enterprise value of $1.25 billion. At the same time, the company has signaled its commitment to expanding natural gas production stateside, acquiring a 49% interest in assets owned and operated by Continental Resources in the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma.

The moves are part of a plan to cut annual capital spending by $1 billion and sell more power assets. However, the market still seems concerned with TotalEnergies’ recent rise in debt. Shares fell 2% after CEO Patrick Pouyanne hosted an investor day on Monday, according to Reuters. The company’s capex cut, to $15–17 billion a year for 2027 to 2030, is part of a drive to save $7.5 billion.

Selling Solar

On Monday, TotalEnergies signed an agreement with insurance vehicles and accounts managed by KKR, a leading global investment firm, for the sale of a 50% stake in its 1.4 gigawatt (GW) solar portfolio in North America. TotalEnergies expects to receive a total of $950 million at closing, following refinancing.

The transaction includes six utility-scale solar assets with a combined capacity of 1.3 GW and 41 distributed generation assets totalling 140 megawatts (MW), primarily in the United States. The electricity production of each project has either been sold to third parties or will be commercialized by TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies will keep a 50% stake in the assets and continue to operate them after the closing of the transaction.

“We are pleased to enter into this new strategic partnership with KKR in North America, a key deregulated electricity market, to expand our integrated business model”, said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables & Power at TotalEnergies. “Aligned with our strategy, this transaction unlocks value from newly commissioned assets and further strengthens the profitability of our Integrated Power business.”

TotalEnergies has committed more than $23 billion to date in energy transition investments.

“TotalEnergies’ North American solar portfolio is a great fit for us, representing high-quality renewable energy assets with long-term contracts,” observed Cecilio Velasco, managing director at KKR.

Buying Natural Gas

TotalEnergies also announced an agreement Monday with Continental Resources to acquire a 49% interest in natural gas-producing assets owned and operated by Continental Resources in the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma. This acquisition of low-cost and long-plateau assets, well connected to Henry Hub through existing midstream infrastructure, further strengthens TotalEnergies’ integration across the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain in the United States, according to the company.

The assets have the potential to reach a gross production of around 350 MMscfd by 2030 and to sustain this production level over the long term. They will enable TotalEnergies to secure a net gas production of around 150 MMscfd. This acquisition of non-operated shale gas assets complements the Dorado and Constellation acquisitions that TotalEnergies completed in 2024 in the Eagle Ford Basin. TotalEnergies also operates a technical production of around 500 MMscfd in the Barnett.

“This acquisition will further increase our natural gas production in the United States and consolidate TotalEnergies’ integrated LNG position with a competitive low-cost and low-emission gas production”, said Nicolas Terraz, President, exploration & production at TotalEnergies. “We are delighted to partner with Continental Resources, a reference operator in the Anadarko Basin, recognized for its strong technical expertise and operational excellence.”

[TITLE]Vistra announces Comanche deal, plan to add 860 MW of natural gas:
[TEXT]
Vistra Corp. has reached a final investment decision to expand gas capacity at its Permian Basin Power Plant, locking in a plan to build two new natural gas power units totaling 860 MW, the company said Monday.

“This expansion more than triples the site's current capacity from 325 MW to 1,185 MW,” Vistra said in a release. The decision to expand was “based on customer demand and to meet West Texas' growing power needs, particularly the state's expanding oil and natural gas industries.”

“As the leading competitive generator in Texas, customers from residential to commercial and industrial are turning to Vistra to help them meet their energy needs,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “We recognize that energy is critical to powering this economic opportunity, and we expect Texas will play an outsized role.”

Vistra also filed an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, confirming that it “has entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement (with options to extend for up to an additional 20 years) with a large, investment grade company ... pursuant to which the Company has agreed to supply to the Customer 1,200 MW of carbon-free power from the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant.”

Vistra said it “anticipates power delivery to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027 and ramp to full capacity by 2032.” The company received permission last year from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the operation of Comanche through 2053, an additional 20 years beyond its original licenses.

On Sept. 22, Jefferies downgraded Vistra’s stock to “hold” based on the lack of a deal up to that point and their view that the company’s stock, which rallied based on excitement

RBC Capital Maintains Its $31.00 PT on Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC) with Outperforming Rating

On September 26, 2025, RBC Capital maintained its $31.00 price target for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC) and retained its Outperforming rating. Growth visibility for the renewable energy company is “stronger than ever,” according to analyst Nelson Ng, demonstrating confidence in its long-term expansion plan. The rating follows weeks after Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC) reported lower-than-anticipated Q2 2025 profits, with EPS of -$4.16 versus an expected $0.01 and sales of $991 million against a prediction of $1.77 billion. Nevertheless, its hydropower and distributed energy companies made significant contributions to Funds From Operations, which increased 10% year over year to $371 million. A pipeline of U.S. M&A opportunities and investments in grid reliability technology support management’s continued goal of double-digit annual FFO per unit growth and 12–15% long-term total returns.

Hydro, wind, solar, storage, and other sustainable energy assets are owned and operated globally by Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC). It is one of the most promising stocks.
