[TITLE]Oil steadies on reports of US-Russia deal but ends week about 5% lower:
[TEXT]
SINGAPORE (Reuters): Oil held steady on Friday as markets awaited a meeting in the coming days between Russian president Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, but prices marked their steepest weekly losses since late June on a tariff-hit economic outlook.

Brent crude futures settled 16 cents, or 0.2%, higher at US$66.59 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were unchanged at US$63.88.

Brent fell 4.4% over the week, while WTI finished 5.1% lower than last Friday's close.

US crude fell over 1% earlier in the session after Bloomberg News reported that Washington and Moscow were aiming to reach a deal to halt the war in Ukraine that would lock in Russia's occupation of territory seized during its military invasion.

US and Russian officials are working towards an agreement on territories for a planned summit meeting between Trump and Putin as early as next week, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The potential meeting raises expectations of a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine, which could lead to eased sanctions on Russia, and comes as trade tensions have been on the rise between Trump and buyers of Russian oil.

This week, Trump threatened to increase tariffs on India if it kept purchasing Russian oil. Trump also said China, the largest buyer of Russian crude, could be hit with tariffs similar to those levied against Indian imports.

"Various non-oil considerations are at play, including fears over the impact of tariffs and the headlines flying over the last few days regarding a Trump and Putin meeting in the near term," said Neil Crosby, an energy market analyst at Sparta Commodities.

"Headline risk is particularly strong currently with flip-flopping regarding who will turn up to a meeting over Ukraine and under what circumstances."

Higher U.S. tariffs on imports from a host of trade partners went into effect on Thursday, raising concern over economic activity and demand for crude oil, ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.

OPEC+ agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, adding to supply.

The U.S. oil rig count, an indicator of future supply, rose by one to 411 this week.

"Bearish sentiment has returned this week as key OPEC+ members announced a second 'quadruple' output unwind for September (thus fully restoring their extra voluntary cuts of 2.2 mmb/d) and President Trump's sweeping import tariffs took effect against most countries," analysts at FGE NexantECA said.

Trump on Thursday also said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a newly vacant seat at the Federal Reserve, fuelling expectations of a more dovish policy ahead.

Lower interest rates reduce consumer borrowing costs and can boost economic growth and demand for oil.

The dollar firmed on Friday but headed for a weekly fall. A stronger dollar hurts demand for dollar-denominated crude from foreign buyers.

Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to August 5, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.

[TITLE]Surprisingly diverse innovations led to dramatically cheaper solar panels:
[TEXT]
The cost of solar panels has dropped by more than 99 percent since the 1970s, enabling widespread adoption of photovoltaic systems that convert sunlight into electricity.

A new MIT study drills down on specific innovations that enabled such dramatic cost reductions, revealing that technical advances across a web of diverse research efforts and industries played a pivotal role.

The findings could help renewable energy companies make more effective R&D investment decisions and aid policymakers in identifying areas to prioritize to spur growth in manufacturing and deployment.

The researchers’ modeling approach shows that key innovations often originated outside the solar sector, including advances in semiconductor fabrication, metallurgy, glass manufacturing, oil and gas drilling, construction processes, and even legal domains.

“Our results show just how intricate the process of cost improvement is, and how much scientific and engineering advances, often at a very basic level, are at the heart of these cost reductions. A lot of knowledge was drawn from different domains and industries, and this network of knowledge is what makes these technologies improve,” says study senior author Jessika Trancik, a professor in MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society.

Trancik is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Goksin Kavlak, a former IDSS graduate student and postdoc who is now a senior energy associate at the Brattle Group; Magdalena Klemun, a former IDSS graduate student and postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University; former MIT postdoc Ajinkya Kamat; as well as Brittany Smith and Robert Margolis of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The research appears today in PLOS ONE.

Identifying innovations

This work builds on mathematical models that the researchers previously developed that tease out the effects of engineering technologies on the cost of photovoltaic (PV) modules and systems.

In this study, the researchers aimed to dig even deeper into the scientific advances that drove those cost declines.

They combined their quantitative cost model with a detailed, qualitative analysis of innovations that affected the costs of PV system materials, manufacturing steps, and deployment processes.

“Our quantitative cost model guided the qualitative analysis, allowing us to look closely at innovations in areas that are hard to measure due to a lack of quantitative data,” Kavlak says.

Building on earlier work identifying key cost drivers — such as the number of solar cells per module, wiring efficiency, and silicon wafer area — the researchers conducted a structured scan of the literature for innovations likely to affect these drivers. Next, they grouped these innovations to identify patterns, revealing clusters that reduced costs by improving materials or prefabricating components to streamline manufacturing and installation. Finally, the team tracked industry origins and timing for each innovation, and consulted domain experts to zero in on the most significant innovations.

All told, they identified 81 unique innovations that affected PV system costs since 1970, from improvements in antireflective coated glass to the implementation of fully online permitting interfaces.

“With innovations, you can always go to a deeper level, down to things like raw materials processing techniques, so it was challenging to know when to stop. Having that quantitative model to ground our qualitative analysis really helped,” Trancik says.

They chose to separate PV module costs from so-called balance-of-system (BOS) costs, which cover things like mounting systems, inverters, and wiring.

PV modules, which are wired together to form solar panels, are mass-produced and can be exported, while many BOS components are designed, built, and sold at the local level.

“By examining innovations both at the BOS level and within the modules, we identify the different types of innovations that have emerged in these two parts of PV technology,” Kavlak says.

BOS costs depend more on soft technologies, nonphysical elements such as permitting procedures, which have contributed significantly less to PV’s past cost improvement compared to hardware innovations.

“Often, it comes down to delays. Time is money, and if you have delays on construction sites and unpredictable processes, that affects these balance-of-system costs,” Trancik says.

Innovations such as automated permitting software, which flags code-compliant systems for fast-track approval, show promise. Though not yet quantified in this study, the team’s framework could support future analysis of their economic impact and similar innovations that streamline deployment processes.

Interconnected industries

The researchers found that innovations from the semiconductor, electronics, metallurgy, and petroleum industries played a major role in reducing both PV and BOS costs, but BOS costs were also impacted by innovations in software engineering and electric utilities.

Noninnovation factors, like efficiency gains from bulk purchasing and the accumulation of knowledge in the solar power industry, also reduced some cost variables.

In addition, while most PV panel innovations originated in research organizations or industry, many BOS innovations were developed by city governments, U.S. states, or professional associations.

“I knew there was a lot going on with this technology, but the diversity of all these fields and how closely linked they are, and the fact that we can clearly see that network through this analysis, was interesting,” Trancik says.

“PV was very well-positioned to absorb innovations from other industries — thanks to the right timing, physical compatibility, and supportive policies to adapt innovations for PV applications,” Klemun adds.

The analysis also reveals the role greater computing power could play in reducing BOS costs through advances like automated engineering review systems and remote site assessment software.

“In terms of knowledge spillovers, what we've seen so far in PV may really just be the beginning,” Klemun says, pointing to the expanding role of robotics and AI-driven digital tools in driving future cost reductions and quality improvements.

In addition to their qualitative analysis, the researchers demonstrated how this methodology could be used to estimate the quantitative impact of a particular innovation if one has the numerical data to plug into the cost equation.

[TITLE]Securing the supply chain at scale: Starting with 71 important open source projects:
[TEXT]
When the Log4j zero day broke in December 2021, everyone learned the same lesson: One under-resourced library can send shockwaves through the entire software supply chain. Today the average cloud workload includes over 500 dependencies, many of them tended by unpaid volunteers. The need to support and secure this ecosystem has never been more urgent.

In response, GitHub launched the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund in November 2024, which provides maintainers with financial support to participate in a three-week program that delivers security education, mentorship, tooling, certification, community of security-minded maintainers, and more. By linking this funding to programmatic security outcomes, our goal is to increase security impact, reduce risk, and help secure the software supply chain at scale.

Already, we’re seeing measurable impact from proactive work. Our first two sessions brought together 125 maintainers from 71 important and fast growing open source projects Early outcomes include:

Remediated over 1,100 vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL, reducing their risk surfaces.

with of projects enabling three or more GitHub-based security features Prepared projects for the future of development, as 63% said they have a better understanding of AI and MCP security.

Maintainers found novel ways to partner with and use AI to accelerate learnings and implement solutions, with many consulting GitHub Copilot to conduct vulnerability scans and security audits, define and implement fuzzing strategies, and more.

These results show direct security impact immediately from the sessions, and the momentum is just beginning. Maintainers have embraced a culture of security, built out security backlogs, and are actively sharing insights with the maintainers in the community, and with their direct project contributors and consumers. As a result, the entire ecosystem benefits — and the security impact will continue to grow.

And we’re not done. Session 3 starts in September 2025, and we want to bring more maintainers that work deeper in the dependency tree and those that manage critical dependencies by themselves. To see the immediate impact following Sessions 1 and 2, let’s look at what changed inside the categories of code that power almost everything you build.

How the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund works Each session is a three-week sprint and engagement for a total of 12 months. The three-week sprint is designed and curated by the GitHub Security Lab, and delivered by security experts from GitHub and our partners. The training is structured into different focus areas per week. These include: Foundations of open source security

Threat modeling and secure coding

Vulnerability management and AI security Throughout this program, each project receives $10,000 USD via GitHub Sponsors (which breaks down to $6,000 USD during the sprint and $2,000 USD at 6- and 12-month security check-ins). Projects are also invited to a new security focused community, and office hours with the GitHub Security Lab, that they can take advantage of during the full 12 months. They also receive security resources to immediately implement in their project and Azure credits for cloud infrastructure. Learn more >

AI and ML frameworks / edge-LLM tooling 🤖

Ollama • AutoGPT/Gravitasml • scikit-learn • OpenCV • CodeCarbon • Zeus • Cognee • CAMEL-AI • Ruby-OpenAI

These projects are the bedrock of the current AI work with LLMs, agents, orchestration layers, and model toolchains. Together they rack up tens of millions of installs and git clone commands each month, and they’re baked into cloud notebooks like Jupyter, Google Collab, AWS SageMaker, and Microsoft Azure ML. A prompt-injection flaw or poisoned weight file here could spill into thousands of downstream apps overnight, and the teams who rely on them often won’t even know which component failed.

Why it matters 🤔 Think of an LLM agent that deploys new micro-services automatically; if its dependency graph gets hijacked, the attacker gains instant “remote DevOps” powers. Hardening these projects helps to protect everyone further up the stack.

Project spotlight: Ollama

This project makes running large language models locally possible.

Ollama is the easiest way to chat and build with open models. They used this opportunity to threat-model every moving part of their system – from their use of GitHub Actions, DNS security, model distribution, how the models are executed in Ollama’s engine, auto-update checker, and more — then they pruned unused dependencies.

The GitHub Secure Open Source Program is a safe space to ask leading experts security questions, and learn how other high-impact projects address similar challenges.

Project spotlight: GravitasML by AutoGPT

GravitasML is an MIT licensed XML parser for LLMs, built by the team that launched AutoGPT to be simple and secure by design.

Fresh out of the sprint, the AutoGPT team wired CodeQL into every pull request across the AutoGPT Platform and GravitasML, and built a lightweight “security agent” that nudges contributors to tighten controls as they code. This helped turn passive checks into continuous coaching. The maintainers overhauled their security policy, stood up a formal incident-response workflow, and mapped out 28 follow-up tasks (from fuzzing their XML parser to completing the OSS Scorecard) to build a durable roadmap for safer LLM agents at large.

The AI-agent ecosystem is safer — and will keep getting safer — because of the Secure Open Source Fund.

Front-end and full-stack frameworks / UI libraries 📚

Next.js • Nuxt • Svelte • NativeScript • Bootstrap • shadcn/ui • Path-to-RegExp • WebdriverIO

These frameworks ship the pixels users touch and often bundle their own server-side routing. Their install bases number in the millions, and improving their security posture closes off potential XSS, template-injection, and supply-chain hop points. The Bootstrap project alone powers nearly 17.5% of the world’s websites, and Next.js drives the frontends for Notion and Adobe, among many others.

Why it matters 🤔 A single vulnerable commit in a component kit can leak JWTs or session cookies from every SaaS dashboard that copied that code. By giving maintainers tools like CodeQL, we help them catch those bugs before they land on prod sites.

Project spotlight: shadcn/ui

This React component library is trusted by leading organizations, like OpenAI’s cookbook, and was able to turn security learning into an interactive practice.

Over the three-week sprint, this project audited every GitHub Actions workflow and secret, refreshed SECURITY.md , licenses, and dependencies, and following a Secure by Design UX workshop — created a framework of how malicious threat actors might attack their project and developed strategies to reduce risks or block entirely. They turned on CodeQL (the first scan caught an unsafe dangerouslySetInnerHTML path), and drafted a formal vulnerability-reporting flow and threat model — laying a clear, public security roadmap that future contributors must follow.
