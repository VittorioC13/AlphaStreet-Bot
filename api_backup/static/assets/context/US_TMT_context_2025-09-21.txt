[TEXT]
Acquisition of leading cannabis company marks major milestone in InterCure’s commercial expansion strategy, bringing access to premium American brands and state-of-the-art cultivation technologies

Transaction comes as Trump administration confirms it is exploring cannabis rescheduling, creating unprecedented potential opportunities for international operators like InterCure

InterCure encouraged by recent regulatory momentum and positioned to capitalize on evolving U.S. cannabis landscape

NEW YORK & HERZLIYA, Israel, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InterCure Ltd. (Nasdaq: INCR) (TASE: INCR) ("InterCure" or the "Company") today announced the strategic acquisition of Botanico Ltd., also known as ISHI ("ISHI"), a premium medical cannabis technology and brand company that delivers immediate access to advanced cultivation technologies and established partnerships with leading American cannabis operators. The acquisition comes as the U.S. cannabis market stands at a historic potential inflection point, with the Trump administration reportedly exploring the rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III1 – a transformative regulatory shift that could unlock unprecedented opportunities for international cannabis companies such as InterCure.

ISHI brings an exclusive partnership with a top tier indoor facility, sophisticated AI-driven cultivation optimization systems, automated production capabilities, and exclusive partnerships with premium U.S. cannabis brands, including established operators like The Flowery, a leading vertically integrated medical cannabis company. The Flowery operates state-of-the-art cultivation and GMP manufacturing facilities alongside the largest delivery system in Florida's medical market. The Flowery also operates the largest retail chain in NY state and has roadmap to continue its aggressive growth in other U.S. markets. Through these partnerships, ISHI has developed exclusive access to highly sought-after American genetics, cult brands and proven cultivation methodologies that have established loyal consumer followings across multiple U.S. markets. The acquisition provides InterCure with immediate access to these award-winning genetics consistently setting U.S. quality standards, advanced operational technologies, and creates substantial competitive advantages as the global medical cannabis market increasingly demands pharmaceutical-grade standards and regulatory frameworks evolve to favor established, compliant operators with proven international capabilities.

"By acquiring ISHI, we gain immediate access to some of America's most sought-after cannabis genetics and proven operational technologies at exactly the moment when we are encouraged by the reported recent momentum in the U.S. around potential cannabis rescheduling.

Today, InterCure is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this historic potential regulatory shift and deliver substantial value to our shareholders."

"Joining InterCure represents the culmination of years building relationships with America's finest cannabis brands," said Omer Layani, CEO of ISHI. "InterCure's global platform and pharmaceutical-grade standards provide the perfect vehicle to scale these partnerships internationally as regulatory tailwinds create unprecedented opportunities for strategic partnerships between U.S. and international operators."

Elad Kohen, Founder and CEO of The Flowery commented: “At The Flowery, our mission is to deliver the highest expressions of Cannabis quality while creating cultural experiences that reflect and elevate the community that built us. Achieving this requires partners who share our uncompromising standards for the plant and embrace a humble, forward-thinking approach. We’ve worked alongside ISHI for years on this project and found deep alignment on the principles that matter most. Today’s announcement strengthens that partnership with greater access and resources, empowering us to expand into new markets the right way-and continue growing our community.”

The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

US stock markets hit a wall after an extraordinary run-up adding $15 trillion in value, reaching record levels. This rally was driven largely by expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve's anticipated rapid interest rate cuts, which have pushed major indexes like the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 to new highs.The Russell 2000 outperformed, rising 3% on the week and on pace for its seventh consecutive weekly gain—its longest rally since late 2020.President Trump indicated progress in US-China trade negotiations, boosting investor confidence in multinational companies and exporters. While details are still emerging, markets interpreted the signals as positive, raising hopes for a resolution that could ease tariffs and reduce global supply chain uncertainty.The US president described the conversation as productive, noting progress on trade, fentanyl, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the approval of the TikTok deal. While Trump indicated that a full trade agreement may not be finalized immediately, he suggested the current tariff truce could be extended under “pretty good terms.”A potential trade breakthrough could support corporate earnings and long-term investor sentiment. Companies exposed to international trade, especially tech and manufacturing, may see improved profitability if a deal reduces barriers or regulatory risks.Currently, small-cap stocks generally offer higher growth potential compared to large-cap stocks but come with greater volatility and risk. Small caps typically represent younger, less mature companies with market capitalizations between $300 million and $2 billion, often operating in emerging or rapidly growing industries. Because of their smaller size, they can grow revenues and profits faster, thus providing investors with the possibility of higher returns.In contrast, large-cap stocks, which include well-established companies with market caps above $10 billion, tend to be more stable and less volatile. They often operate in mature industries, have stronger balance sheets, and may pay dividends, offering more reliable profits but slower growth. Large-cap companies benefit from more market liquidity, extensive research coverage, and broader investor interest.In 2025, small caps have been showing stronger performance in sectors like specialty chemicals, renewable tech, and capital goods due to improved domestic demand and lower inflation, but with sharper price swings. Meanwhile, large caps have shown steadier but modest gains, favored for their stability amid global uncertainties and monetary policy impacts.Bridgewater founderhighlighted risks to the US monetary system amid rising debt, recommending 10% portfolio allocations in gold and other non-fiat assets.

Oracle would manage US user data on its Texas servers, keeping TikTok operational in the US despite potential regulatory restrictions.Oracle shares rose 1.88% on Friday, marking a 28% gain for the month, as investors anticipate increased cloud revenue from TikTok’s data management. Morningstar estimates that TikTok accounts for roughly 5% of Oracle’s Cloud Infrastructure business, highlighting the deal’s significance.The transaction, if completed, could also reinforce Oracle’s strategic positioning in the US cloud computing market while giving investors confidence in the company’s growth trajectory amid its broader AI partnerships, including OpenAI.Earlier in the week, the, marking its first cut since December. Markets reacted to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s description of the move as a “risk management” adjustment, highlighting caution amid economic uncertainty.Lower borrowing costs are likely to stimulate business investment and consumer spending.

[TITLE]What Makes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) an Investment Bet?:
[TEXT]
Macquarie Asset Management, an investment management company, released its “Macquarie Core Equity Fund” investor letter for the second quarter of 2025. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The US large-cap equity market surged in Q2 2025, with the S&P 500® Index rising 10.94%. The equity market’s strength was due to reduced concerns over the possibility of President Trump quickly imposing harsh tariffs. Later, the administration put a pause on the tariff implementation. In this environment, the Macquarie Core Equity Fund’s Institutional Class returned 11.94% surpassing the benchmark, the S&P 500 Index. Eighty percent of the relative performance was driven by sector selection, and individual security selection accounted for the remainder. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2025.

In its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, the Macquarie Core Equity Fund highlighted stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates through Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The one-month return of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was -5.87%, and its shares gained 1.26% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 18, 2025, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock closed at $157.92 per share, with a market capitalization of $256.279 billion.

"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and manufactures semiconductors, including central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and other high-performance computing solutions for various markets like gaming, data centers, and AI. The company currently maintains a small market share for GPUs used for AI applications though by 2027, we believe the company will have product on par with the market leader, NVIDIA. Hyperscale customers with deep programming expertise may increasingly decide to dual-source high-end chips leading to much larger revenue and profit gains in coming years for AMD than investors currently expect."

[TITLE]“Earthquake” in Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia invests $5 billion in Intel, shaking up the balance:
[TEXT]
Newsroom September 18 03:34

Nvidia and Intel have entered into a “mega-deal,” with Nvidia announcing a $5 billion investment in Intel. Both companies will collaborate on developing microchips for computers and data centers, in a surprising move since it strengthens a key competitor.

Nvidia will purchase Intel shares at $23.28 each. Intel will integrate Nvidia’s graphics technology into upcoming PC chips and will supply its processors for data center products based on Nvidia hardware.

The two companies have not provided a timeline for the release of the first products and clarified that this announcement does not affect their future plans.

Intel’s stock “soared” as much as 26% in pre-market trading.

This new funding for Intel follows an approximately 10% investment by the U.S. government in August, with Donald Trump taking on a role as “backer.” In addition, Japan’s SoftBank made an emergency $2 billion investment last month, while Intel has also been raising capital through asset sales. Intel’s current operations are struggling from market share losses and cannot bear the costs of producing advanced chips.

This collaboration highlights the shifting power dynamics in the computer and artificial intelligence industries. Intel gains financial backing and access to top-tier technology from a company it once considered “second-rate.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the partnership links Nvidia’s AI ecosystem with Intel’s x86 architecture, creating “a foundation for the next era of computing.”

Intel will provide PC microchips that combine general processing with Nvidia’s powerful graphics in order to compete with AMD, Nvidia’s main graphics rival. In data centers, Intel will supply processors for products incorporating Nvidia’s AI units.

Nvidia continues to design its own processors using Arm Holdings technology, with no changes to its corporate roadmap. With a market cap exceeding $4 trillion, Nvidia’s investment in Intel represents less than 5% of its value.

Nvidia is largely defining the industry’s future through its dominance in AI computing. The demand for new chips to power services such as ChatGPT was anticipated and executed by Nvidia before its competitors. In 2025, Nvidia is projected to generate about $200 billion in revenue, gradually surpassing Intel’s annual performance.

Intel, which once dominated the industry through its advanced manufacturing technology, has failed to develop competitive AI accelerators and now relies on TSMC for producing its top products. Under the leadership of Lip Boo Tan, Intel is moving toward a more open strategy, seeking partnerships and offering third parties access to its manufacturing facilities.
