[TITLE]AMCS losses triple to €60m as it books costs linked to takeover:
[TEXT]
Revenues soared in 2024 at Limerick-based tech firm

Limerick-based tech firm Advanced Manufacturing Control Systems (AMCS) saw its losses almost triple to €60.4m last year as it incurred a total of €45m in transactions associated with the sale of a majority stake in the business in November 2024.

Last year, Swedish private equity firm EQT bought a majority stake in AMCS in a deal that valued the Irish company at €2.1bn.

The Irish business, which employs more than 1,200 people, is a supplier of cloud-based AI-enabled planning, performance and safety software that is used in the waste management and recycling sectors, as well as in other resource-intensive industries.

As part of the deal with EQT, AMCS co-founder and CEO Jimmy Martin, management and other existing investors, including Insight Partners, Clearlake Capital, Highland Europe and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, all retained minority stakes.

Newly-filed accounts for AMCS show that turnover jumped to €68.3m last year from €56.5m in 2023.

Recently-filed accounts for the group holding company, Arctic Topco, note that AMCS delivered a “robust financial performance” in 2024, underpinned by what it said was impressive growth in both annual recurring revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), “signalling sustained momentum and operational discipline”.

The adjusted Ebitda for AMCS last year was €7.9m. That was a 47pc increase compared to 2023. The adjusted figure excludes foreign exchange gains and losses and includes the margin on revenues flowing through from opening deferred revenue on acquisitions made during the year.

AMCS reported a 15pc year-on-year increase in annual recurring revenue (ARR) last year, reflecting new customer acquisition, high retention rates and strong upsell activity within its existing customer base.

“This surge in recurring revenue underscores the resilience of AMCS’ business model and the value of its solutions provided in the market,” note the Arctic Topco accounts.

Those accounts note that the margin improvement seen during 2024 reflects disciplined cost management, optimised sales and marketing spend, and increasing operating leverage as the business grows.

“With a strong ARR base and improving Ebitda margins, AMCS is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory,” they added.

Last year, AMCS acquired US-based solutions provider Qv21 Technologies. Qv21 Technologies is a software service solutions provider for short-haul, bulk commodity transportation.

In April this year, AMCS acquired Selected Interventions and Mandalay Technologies. Selected Interventions is a UK-based, global resource management software company and Mandalay Technologies is an Australia-headquartered provider of modular cloud-based weighbridge and data management solutions.

New Delhi: India is considering waiving customs duty on pharmaceutical products made in special economic zones and sold in the domestic tariff area, a move that would allow drugmakers in these zones to supply vaccines and other critical medicines locally without paying the current 10% levy, people familiar with the matter said.The proposal, aimed at lowering costs and boosting domestic availability of essential drugs, may be announced in the Union budget for FY27, they said."There is a thinking to allow pharma companies to sell their products in the domestic tariff area without paying the duty...However, this will not be a blanket exemption and will be restricted to few products," a senior official told ET.Initially, the exemption will be restricted to select vaccines, few critical drugs, and a list of products decided by the government at regular periods.The Centre is also considering a similar exemption to some of the medical device manufacturers and biotech firms to encourage the startup ecosystem, the official added.This is part of re-examination of SEZ policies to incentivise the export sector, the official said, adding that this would encourage companies to invest in areas where India relies on imports."Pharma sector is our sunshine sector and with many states coming up with pharma SEZs, this will help in bringing investment in this," the official said.Currently, units in SEZs are allowed to sell their products in the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA or domestic market) on payment of customs duty of 10% on an output basis.Pharma companies were seeking this relief after the US announced a 100% tariff on imported branded and patented drugs with effect from October 1.Some of the export drugs include tablets, capsules, and injectable medications for treating conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, for which there is a sizeable demand in the domestic market as well.India's domestic pharma market is estimated at $60 billion, accounting for about 20% of the global supply of generic drugs and 60% of global vaccines.Pharma exports stood at $30.47 billion in 2024-25, a growth of 9.4% over the previous year, supported by a strong manufacturing base and expanding global outreach, latest commerce ministry data showed.Currently there are around 800 medical device manufacturers in the country and about 11,000 startups in the biotech sector.

[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital urges LKQ to sell its European auto parts business:
[TEXT]
Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: 0.39%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

Behind the scenes

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers.

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers.

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint.

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount.

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000 . However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock.

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment.

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries.

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA.

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA.

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price.

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone , and Genuine Parts , may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that.

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time.

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders.

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]Davis Commodities Limited: First Half of Fiscal Year 2025 Unaudited Financial Results:
[TEXT]
SINGAPORE, Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Davis Commodities Limited (Nasdaq: DTCK) (the "Company" or "Davis Commodities"), an agricultural commodity trading company that specializes in trading sugar, rice, and oil and fat products, today announced its financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2025.

Ms. Li Peng Leck, Executive Chairperson and Executive Director of Davis Commodities, commented, “Our performance is shaped by fluctuations in commodity prices and shipping costs. We view certain unfavorable circumstances as transient. Through our well-established logistics supply chain, our goal is to alleviate the effects of these fluctuations. Moreover, we are committed to broadening our market presence, not only by reinforcing our market shares in the existing markets but also by considering venturing into new territories in an effort to expand our market share and reduce regional risks. Additionally, we intend to leverage the longstanding relationships we have with our business partners to capitalize on opportunities in emerging markets.”

First Half of Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Highlights

• Revenue was $95.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $66.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Gross profit was $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $2.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Loss from operations was $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 116.6% from $1.1 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Net income was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.3 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. • Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.01 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0.05 for the same period of the last fiscal year.

Revenue

Total revenue was $95.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 42.11% from $66.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. This increase was mainly attributable to a increase in demand for liquid sugar from our customers, compared to the same corresponding period.

For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 (US$’000) 2025 (US$’000) ($ thousands) Revenue Cost of Revenue Gross Margin Revenue Cost of Revenue Gross Margin Sale of sugar 44,891 43,760 2.5 % 60,772 59,851 1.5 % Sale of rice 13,964 12,965 7.2 % 19,732 18,833 4.6 % Sale of oil and fat products 8,021 7,234 9.8 % 14,519 13,714 5.5 % Sale of others - - - 13 8 38.5 % Total 66,876 63,959 4.4 % 95,036 92,406 2.8 %

• Revenue from sales of sugar was $60.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 35.4% from $44.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly due to stronger sales of liquid sugar in the China market and higher demand for Brazilian sugar from the Africa region. • Revenue from sales of rice was $19.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 41.3% from $14.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly attributable to market development efforts in the Africa region, as well as lower rice prices from the end of last year to mid-2025, which encouraged higher sales volume. • Revenue from sales of oil and fat products was $14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 81.0% from $8.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to lower oil prices during the first half of 2025, which stimulated demand and sales growth. • Revenue from sales of others was $0.01 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to nil for the same period of the last fiscal year. The sale of others represented random sales of creamer based on customer requests and orders.

A breakdown of revenue in terms of geographic regions for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2025 is summarized below:

For the six months ended June 30, (US$’000) ($ thousands) 2024 % 2025 % Variance Change (%) Africa $ 40,112 60.0 $ 66,162 69.6 26,050 64.9 China 5,762 8.6 15,232 16.0 9,470 164.4 Vietnam 2,734 4.1 1,252 1.3 (1,482 ) (54.2 ) Thailand 8,662 13.0 1,589 1.7 (7,073 ) (81.7 ) Singapore 4,923 7.4 4,825 5.1 (98 ) (2.0 ) Other countries 4,683 7.0 5,976 6.3 1,293 27.6 Total revenue $ 66,876 100.0 $ 95,036 100.0 28,160 42.1

• Revenue from Africa was $66.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by $26.1 million, or 64.9%, from $40.1 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The growth was primarily due to the Company’s continued market development efforts and successful engagement of new customers, particularly in the West and East African regions. These initiatives expanded the customer base and strengthened the Company’s market presence. • Revenue from the China was $15.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which rose significantly by $9.5 million, or 164.4%, from $5.8 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The sharp increase was mainly attributed to the Company’s growing market share in liquid sugar, which continues to gain traction among food and beverage manufacturers in China. The Company also benefited from improved supply chain efficiency and strong customer retention in this segment. • Revenue from Vietnam was $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by $1.5 million, or 54.2%, from $2.7 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to regulatory changes following China’s ban on premix sugar imports from Vietnam in March 2025. • Revenue from Thailand was $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased sharply by $7.1 million, or 81.7%, from $8.7 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease was mainly due to regulatory changes following China’s ban on premix sugar imports from Thailand effective December 2024, which significantly affected trading activities. • Revenue from Singapore was $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased slightly by $0.1 million, or 2.0%, from $4.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The Company’s local operations remained relatively stable, supported by steady customer demand in its home market. • The overall global prices and regulatory changes can significantly impact the revenue.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue was $92.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 44.5% from $64.0 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the increased in revenue as described above, which was contributed by higher demand for the Company’s sugar, rice and oil products from customers.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit was $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 9.8% from $2.9 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. Sugar prices held relatively firm during the period; however, rising purchase and transportation costs compressed margins, leading to a decrease in gross profit despite continued demand strength. Global supply for rice hit record highs, pushing prices down. Many traders still held older, higher-cost inventories, and logistics and packaging costs stayed elevated, which leading to narrower profit margins even though raw rice costs weren’t rising. Production of oils and fats products increased and demand softened, causing weaker selling prices while increased in upstream costs has narrowing the margin.

Overall gross margin was 2.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to 4.4% for the same period of the last fiscal year. Although sales volume increased, gross profit and gross margin decreased as higher raw material and logistics costs were not fully passed on to customers. Lower selling prices for rice and oils and fats products further squeezed margins, resulting in a decline in overall profitability despite revenue growth.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses were $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 57.9% from $1.8 million for the same period of the last fiscal year.

• Selling and marketing expenses were $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 92.5% from $0.4 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to increase in sales commissions payable arising from the increase in revenue, along with business developments cost and the amortization of prepaid consultancy fees. • General and administrative expenses were $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increased of 46.6% from $1.3 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The increase was mainly attributable to higher legal and professional fees incurred in connection with additional regulatory filings and fees paid to external consultants for listed-company and capital market advisory services, amounting to approximately $0.5 million. In addition, the Company recorded approximately US$0.2 million in impairment losses, primarily relating to provision of expected credit loss, reflecting a more prudent assessment of credit risk during the period.

Other Income and Interest Expense

Other income was $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 27.8% from $0.6 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. The decrease in other income was mainly attributable to the absence of ECL reversals and a reduction in government grants recognized during the year. This was partially mitigated by write-back of trade credit balances no longer payable.

Interest expense was $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which increased by 113.3% from $0.1 million for the same period of last fiscal year. The increase was mainly as a result of interest and associated charges from newly activated bank facilities that began at the beginning of the year.

Profit before Tax and Income Tax Expense

Profit before tax was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.6 million for the same period of the last fiscal year. Correspondingly, income tax was nil for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by $0.3 million from $0.3 million for the same period of last fiscal year.

Net Income

Net income was $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which decreased by 96.9% from $1.3 million for the same period of last fiscal year.

Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.002 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0.05 for same period of the last fiscal year.

Financial Condition

As of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 million, compared to $0.7 million as of December 31, 2024.

Net cash used by operating activities was $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025. The cash outflow from operating activities primarily reflected (i) non-cash adjustments of approximately $0.1 million, mainly comprising depreciation of property, plant and equipment, unrealized gain on derivative contracts, allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, unpaid interest expenses and interest income, and (ii) changes in working capital that resulted in a net outflow of approximately $2.3 million. The movements in working capital were mainly due to a significant increase in accounts payable and accruals of $17.4 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts and other receivable of $20.0 million, as well as a decrease in inventories and increase in margin call amounting to $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities was $0.001 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily attributable to the purchase of property, plant and equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025. The cash inflows were mainly contributed by new bank borrowings of $12.6 million and proceeds from a related party of $0.4 million, partially offset by repayment of bank borrowings of $9.1 million, repayment of amount due to related parties of $0.6 million, and principal payments on finance lease liabilities.

[TITLE]AMCS losses triple to €60m as it books costs linked to takeover:
[TEXT]
Revenues soared in 2024 at Limerick-based tech firm

Limerick-based tech firm Advanced Manufacturing Control Systems (AMCS) saw its losses almost triple to €60.4m last year as it incurred a total of €45m in transactions associated with the sale of a majority stake in the business in November 2024.

Last year, Swedish private equity firm EQT bought a majority stake in AMCS in a deal that valued the Irish company at €2.1bn.

The Irish business, which employs more than 1,200 people, is a supplier of cloud-based AI-enabled planning, performance and safety software that is used in the waste management and recycling sectors, as well as in other resource-intensive industries.

As part of the deal with EQT, AMCS co-founder and CEO Jimmy Martin, management and other existing investors, including Insight Partners, Clearlake Capital, Highland Europe and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, all retained minority stakes.

Newly-filed accounts for AMCS show that turnover jumped to €68.3m last year from €56.5m in 2023.

Recently-filed accounts for the group holding company, Arctic Topco, note that AMCS delivered a “robust financial performance” in 2024, underpinned by what it said was impressive growth in both annual recurring revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), “signalling sustained momentum and operational discipline”.

The adjusted Ebitda for AMCS last year was €7.9m. That was a 47pc increase compared to 2023. The adjusted figure excludes foreign exchange gains and losses and includes the margin on revenues flowing through from opening deferred revenue on acquisitions made during the year.

AMCS reported a 15pc year-on-year increase in annual recurring revenue (ARR) last year, reflecting new customer acquisition, high retention rates and strong upsell activity within its existing customer base.

“This surge in recurring revenue underscores the resilience of AMCS’ business model and the value of its solutions provided in the market,” note the Arctic Topco accounts.

Those accounts note that the margin improvement seen during 2024 reflects disciplined cost management, optimised sales and marketing spend, and increasing operating leverage as the business grows.

“With a strong ARR base and improving Ebitda margins, AMCS is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory,” they added.

Last year, AMCS acquired US-based solutions provider Qv21 Technologies. Qv21 Technologies is a software service solutions provider for short-haul, bulk commodity transportation.

In April this year, AMCS acquired Selected Interventions and Mandalay Technologies. Selected Interventions is a UK-based, global resource management software company and Mandalay Technologies is an Australia-headquartered provider of modular cloud-based weighbridge and data management solutions.

[TITLE]Google-Backed Fleet Tracking Firm Motive Files Publicly For IPO:
[TEXT]
Motive Technologies Inc. filed publicly for an initial public offering, with the artificial intelligence-enabled fleet management software firm disclosing both growing revenue and net losses.

The company, which counts Alphabet Inc.’s Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins among its backers, recorded a net loss of $138.5 million on revenue of $327.3 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30, according to a filing Tuesday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. That compares with a net loss of $113.9 million on revenue of $268.9 million in the same period last year.

The San Francisco-based company’s technology helps owners of large fleets keep track of their vehicles, manage their maintenance costs and monitor driver safety, including via AI-assisted dashboard cameras installed in the cabs of trucks, according to the filing. The company estimates its platform has helped prevent more than 170,000 collisions since 2023.

Motive said in September that it had filed confidentially for an IPO.

A 2022 funding round valued the company at $2.85 billion, according to a statement at the time. In July, Motive raised $150 million from a pre-IPO funding round led by Kleiner Perkins. The capital would be used to invest more in AI and to grow internationally, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Shoaib Makani told Bloomberg News.

Founded in 2013, the firm’s customers come from sectors including construction, oil and gas, trucking and logistics. It had 9,201 core customers representing

[TITLE]Iraq Becomes a Battleground for China and Western Oil Giants:
[TEXT]
Iraq is at a crucial tipping point in its history. The past few months especially have seen a surge in activity from Western firms looking to re-enter the country’s oil and gas sector following a prolonged hiatus that had allowed the previous build-up of influence of China and Russia to accelerate and expand. Both sides – West and East – see Iraq as a crucial part of their global strategic plans, with no room for the other in this zero-sum game. As exclusively revealed to OilPrice.com by a very high-ranking official from the Kremlin: “By keeping the West out of energy deals in Iraq, [Russia and China will see] the end of Western hegemony in the Middle East will become the decisive chapter in the West’s final demise.” On the other side of the equation, the U.S. and its allies believe removing the influence of China and Russia in Iraq will critically diminish their ability to project power elsewhere in the region and around the world. Following the recent elections in Iraq, no new prime minister has yet been chosen, so it is little wonder Beijing has been holding talks with Baghdad in the past few days to discuss deeper cooperation.

Specifically, according to local news sources, China outlined priorities under its fifteenth ‘Five-Year Plan’ and expressed interest in strengthening multilateral cooperation with Iraq. Talks covered expanding cooperation under Beijing’s ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI) and Chinese proposals for deeper and broader initiatives in governance, development and security. On Iraq’s side, Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein described China as a pivotal strategic partner and the largest market for Iraqi oil. It was what was not in the notes that was the interesting bit, but OilPrice.com was exclusively told by two sources who work very closely with Iraq’s Oil Ministry with close knowledge of the talks. “It was stressed that whoever became the new leader [prime minister], Iraq would continue to welcome Chinese investment into the country across all sectors, and also specifically into the oil and gas sectors,” said one of the Iraq sources. “Such developments would continue the ideas contained in the two previous agreements between Iraq and China that are still operational, although the parameters of those that deal with any dual use [for military and civilian purposes] trade or dual use projects, may have to be discussed again in terms of how they are applied,” he said. “In reality, it looked like we [Iraq] are trying to keep China onside for any eventuality that might happen, as we don’t know yet who the new leader will be, but at the same time we don’t want to do anything to upset the Americans either,” he added.

The two previous agreements in question were negotiated during the period in which the U.S. and its allies were nearing or at their weakest point in Iraq since the allied removal of then-President Saddam Hussein in 2003. This saw increasingly active antagonism towards the Western military forces that remained, spearheaded by attacks from Iranian-backed military proxies in Iraq that continued even after the U.S.’s official ‘end of combat mission’ in Iraq in December 2023. Against this backdrop, the groundwork for all future developments by China in Iraq was laid out in the wide-ranging ‘Oil for Reconstruction and Investment’ agreement signed between China and Iraq in 2019. The basic template for this agreement – which includes priority on new field contracts for Chinese firms and substantial discounts for them on oil and gas recovered – was the ‘Iran-China 25-Year Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement’ first revealed anywhere in the world in my 3 September 2019 article on the subject, and analysed in my latest book on the new global oil market order.

The 2019 China-Iraq deal was then substantially broadened and deepened into the ‘Iraq-China Framework Agreement’ of 2021. Part of this featured even bigger discounts given to Chinese firms on oil and gas discovered in Iraq (up to 30%, depending on the field). However, crucially for China’s bigger territorial ambitions in Iraq and the Middle East, it also gave its firms developing such fields wide-ranging rights to station significant security forces in and around these areas and to engage in a massive build-out of accompanying infrastructure. This includes road and rail networks connected to bigger infrastructure hubs with links across the Middle East, the right for the Chinese military to use selected Iraqi military and civilian seaports and airports, and permission to construct further businesses, schools and other support facilities tangential to China’s ongoing interest in the region.

Typical of the underlying idea and structure behind these cooperation agreements were three far-reaching infrastructure deals that heavily involved China in the heartland of Iraq. One was Baghdad’s approval of nearly IQD1 trillion (USD700 million) for infrastructure projects in the city of Al-Zubair in the southern Iraq oil hub of Basra. Judging from comments made by the city’s Governor at the time, Abbas Al-Saadi, China’s heavy involvement in Phase 2 of the projects was part of the broad-based ‘oil-for-reconstruction and investment’ agreement signed by Baghdad and Beijing in September 2019. This agreement allowed Chinese firms to invest in infrastructure projects in Iraq in exchange for oil. The Al-Zubair announcement followed shortly after the awarding by Baghdad of another major contract to another Chinese company to build a civilian airport to replace the military base in the capital of the southern oil rich Dhi Qar governorate. The Dhi Qar region includes two of Iraq’s potentially biggest oil fields – Gharraf and Nassiriya. This airport project, it announced, would include the construction of multiple cargo buildings and roads linking the airport to the city’s town centre and separately to other key oil areas in southern Iraq. This, in turn, followed yet another deal, involving Chinese companies building out Al-Sadr City, located near Baghdad, at a cost of between USD7-8 billion, also within the framework of the 2019 ‘oil-for-reconstruction and investment’ agreement.

Happily for China, much of this investment to secure land in Iraq vital to its key commercial and military strategy underlying its BRI project came indirectly and directly from the dramatically cut-price oil it was able to extract from Iraq in the first place. This, on top of those strategic advantages, was what had made the country so appealing to Beijing (and to Moscow, and Washington, and London, and Paris). As also analysed in depth in my latest book on the new global oil market order, Iraq remains a huge repository of oil at the world’s joint lowest average lifting cost of $2-4 per barrel, together with large quantities of associated and non-associated gas – with both its oil and gas reserves still enormously underestimated. Another strategic advantage, is that it occupies the geographical heart of the region, lying west of Iran, north of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, east of Jordan and Syria (with its long Mediterranean coastline offering access to further critical sea routes), and south of Turkey (affording an entry into the European continent). And a final one is that Iraq is a key member of the ‘Shia Crescent of Power’ geopolitical arc that stretches from Iran through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, where Shia communities and Iran-backed groups exert significant influence over regional politics, economics, and security.

Beijing has done exceptionally well in exploiting these agreements with Baghdad, with some 34% of Iraq's proven reserves and two-thirds of current production now managed by Chinese companies. These combined have direct shares in around 24 billion barrels of reserves and are responsible for production of around 3 million barrels per day. Crucially, though, the past few months have seen Western firms take and consolidate their control over critical projects in Iraq that are vital to its further development as an oil and gas resource. France’s TotalEnergies holds the key to its ability to dramatically increase its oil output via the crucial Common Seawater Supply Project, as detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. And there are three other major projects included in its US$27 billion deal with Baghdad. The UK’s BP is now in a strategically key position to act as a conduit for change in Iraq’s north through its US$25 billion five-field deal recently formally activated. And there have been similar announcements from the U.S.’s Chevron and ExxonMobil, among others. Tellingly as to the direction Iraq may be headed if current Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ al?Sudani emerges again as leader following the ongoing post-election haggling, Iraq recently sent out special invitations to U.S. firms to bid for its huge West Qurna 2 at the expense of forced-out Russian giant Lukoil. Consequently, China may find that any new cooperation deal with Iraq does not in fact continue every element of the 2019 and 2021 versions, if Sudani regains power. If he does not, then the game will be firmly back on for Beijing.

[TITLE]Canada Backs €8 Billion European Data Centre Deal:
[TEXT]
Canada’s CPP Investments Board has joined forces with Goodman Group on a €8 billion European data centre partnership across Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris, marking a major expansion of Canada’s pension fund.

The venture, known as the Goodman European Data Centre Development Partnership, represents CPP Investments’ first formal entry into large-scale data centre development on the European continent, broadening its infrastructure footprint beyond earlier ventures in other regions.

Under the agreement, four major facilities will be developed in Germany, the Netherlands, and France, specifically in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris, strategically chosen for their roles as technology hubs and gateways for cloud services and artificial intelligence infrastructure. These sites together offer a combined 435 megawatts of primary power capacity and 282 megawatts of IT load.

Executives on both sides hailed the partnership as a timely response to the growing need for robust digital infrastructure that supports cloud computing and advanced computing services across Europe. CPP Investments’ Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Real Assets highlighted the opportunity to establish a strong presence in this vital sector.

Goodman Group’s leadership also stressed the rarity and strategic importance of the portfolio being assembled, noting that fully powered and permitted sites in the so-called FLAP markets, encompassing Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, and Paris, are exceptionally sought after by global technology companies.

The pace of construction for the new data centres is expected to pick up quickly, with groundwork and building set to begin by late June 2026, and the transaction anticipated to conclude by March of that year.

[TITLE]Firefly Aerospace (FLY) Soars 16% on Russell 2000 Inclusion:
[TEXT]
We recently published Santa Came Early for These 10 Double-Digit Gainers. Firefly Aerospace Inc. (NASDAQ:FLY) is one of the best performers on Monday.

Firefly Aerospace soared for a third consecutive day on Monday, jumping 16.02 percent to close at $28.60 apiece after officially joining the Russell 2000 Index.

The company was among the 18 firms added to the benchmark, which also triggered its inclusion in the Russell 3000 index. The recomposition officially took effect on the same day.

Companies added to indices typically see their share prices rocket as fund managers and investment firms that track the index rebalance their portfolios by buying the newly included stocks while selling shares of companies removed from the benchmark.

Firefly Aerospace Inc.’s (NASDAQ:FLY) inclusion in the said indices is expected to open doors for greater exposure among institutional and foreign investors.

Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors as benchmarks for investment strategies. The market capitalization-based indexes are part of FTSE Russell, a global index provider that offers a broad range of market indexes to measure the performance of different segments of the global financial markets.

In other news, Firefly Aerospace Inc. (NASDAQ:FLY) last week received a “sector weight” rating from investment firm KeyBanc, on optimism for the company’s spacecraft operations, albeit achieving profitability could take some time.

[TEXT]
SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Red Cat Holdings, Inc . (Nasdaq: RCAT), a U.S.-based provider of advanced all-domain drone and robotic solutions for defense and national security, today responded to the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) announcement to immediately implement Section 1709 of the FY25 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

The FCC’s action adds foreign-manufactured drones and their critical components to the Covered List effective immediately. This step was taken following an interagency review led by the White House and a national security determination that such systems pose “unacceptable risks” to U.S. safety and sovereignty. The decision follows a national security determination made by an Executive Branch interagency body convened by the White House.

“This is a major moment for the American drone industry,” said Jeff Thompson, CEO of Red Cat. “We applaud the Administration’s decision to act with urgency. The FCC’s action sends a clear signal that the U.S. is serious
