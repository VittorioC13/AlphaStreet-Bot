[TITLE]Niveshaay leads ₹325 crore funding in Waaree Energy Storage to scale battery business:
[TEXT]
Investment firm Niveshaay on Tuesday said it has led a Rs 325 crore funding round in Waaree Energy Storage Systems to expand the Waaree Group's battery arm.

The fund will be used to enhance cell and pack manufacturing capacity, strengthen engineering and validation capabilities, and scale containerised Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) across India and select global markets.

Multiple fund vehicles

Niveshaay said it has cumulatively invested Rs 128 crore in the round through its Category II Niveshaay Sambhav Fund, Category III Niveshaay Hedgehogs Fund, and the newly launched one of India's first dedicated Collective Investment Vehicles (CIVs,) Niveshaay WESS Fund.

Other co-investors in the round include Vivek Jain (Managing Director, Action Tesa and GrowthSphere) and Saket Agarwal (former Director, Apollo Pipes Ltd and Apollo Tricoat), among others, Niveshaay, the SEBI-registered investment advisory and boutique asset management firm said.

"Battery storage will play a key role in India's clean energy growth… they expand a domestic storage platform with scale and technology depth," said Arvind Kothari, Founder at Niveshaay.

India’s storage outlook

India's storage market is growing with policy support through viability-gap funding for grid-scale storage, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for advanced cells, and the Energy Storage Obligation (ESO), the firm said.

Cumulative installations, according to Niveshaay, are expected to reach around 200 GWh by 2030 from 0.4 GWh in 2024.

As BESS systems evolve from short-duration buffers to multi-day storage and hybrid configurations, Waaree's vertically integrated model enables it to capture value across the manufacturing, integration, and long-term service layers, it said.

Waaree's existing solar manufacturing and EPC capabilities create strong alignment for battery integration, Kothari said.

The global energy transition is shifting focus from generation capacity to reliability, flexibility, and storage. Falling lithium-ion costs and supportive policy frameworks have made storage economically viable for utilities and commercial users alike, it said.

Worldwide, storage is the defining theme of the decade; India's trajectory now mirrors that of the US and Europe, where multi-hour battery systems underpin renewable integration, grid stability, and peak demand management, the company said.

Niveshaay investments across listed and unlisted equities and is known for its early-stage, high-conviction investments in India's manufacturing and energy-transition ecosystem.

[TITLE]Government selects 17 projects worth ₹7,172 crore investment in electronics manufacturing:
[TEXT]
The Centre on Monday approved 17 projects entailing around ₹7,172 crore investment across six categories under the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS), underlining India’s resolve and its decisive push into producing high-value components.

These projects will lead to production of electronics worth ₹65,111 crore and 11,808 direct jobs cumulatively.

The ECMS would drive the next phase of value chain integration and steer India’s electronics manufacturing to $500 billion by 2030–31, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw said here.

The approved units are spread across nine states -- Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh, reinforcing the government’s commitment to balanced regional growth and creation of high-skill jobs beyond metropolitan clusters, he said.

The second tranche of the scheme includes a wide range of components and sub-assemblies, such as India’s first-ever Optical Transceiver (SFP) manufacturing facilities by Jabil Circuit India and Zetchem Supply Chain Services; Oscillators for precise timing applications in communication devices, computers, and industrial electronics by Rakon India Private Limited; high-end precision enclosures for laptops and smartwatches by Aequs Consumer Products; and camera modules by ASUX Safety Components, Uno Minda Limited, and Syrma Mobility.

Meanwhile, talking about electronics manufacturing in India, Vaishnaw said that developing design teams is crucial for long-term success and global competitiveness because the way geo-economics are emerging, the challenges will be bigger.

He also urged the industry to focus on getting six sigma quality in every product that they manufacture and support each other in the process.

“Make sure that you hold hands and get them up the value chain. That will define your success in the coming years because sooner or later when the world the way geopolitics, the way geo-economics are emerging, the challenges will be bigger and in those challenging periods your ability to have a good control of the supply chain behind you will define your resilience and will define your ability to compete during the difficult times,” Vaishnaw said.

He added that with schemes like ECMS, India could get some of the global large manufacturers of finished products into the country, and that has given the opportunity to create the market and demand for components.

On quality manufacturing, he said, already the manufacturing sector has created new standards, especially in the automobile sector, aerospace sector, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, where the quality is today compared with the global benchmarks.

The government also continues to focus on skilling of youth using these facilities and capabilities. “Hopefully very soon we’ll come out with a new skilling framework also for electronics manufacturing where we will be tying up with certain organisations who have done very good work in the social fields,” he added.

[TITLE]AI-powered manufacturing platform Keychain raises $10m in funding:
[TEXT]
Artificial Intelligence-powered manufacturing platform Keychain has raised $10 million (€8.6 million) to support its expansion, launching its next-generation supply chain and product management platform as it targets private label brands.

British supermarket giant Tesco is among the investors of the fund that is backing this latest capital raising by company cofounded by Irish entrepreneur Oisin Hanrahan.

The new operating system, Keychain360, will help give retailers full control over their supply chains, helping them manage their private label brands more efficiently and reduce product development timelines.

Keychain, initially launched in the US before it expanded into Ireland in September before following with the UK this month.

“Keychain 360 is a true supply chain insights tool for the biggest brands and retailers in the world. We’ve already got some of them using it,” explained Mr Hanrahan, saying that he expected it to significantly expand the business.

“We think that the world is moving more and more to private label and to outsource.”

The company is planning further expansion in Europe.“We have a lot more expansion to do,” he said. “There’s a lot more features and there’s a lot more markets that people are pushing us to go into.”

Keychain360 is the third element of Keychain’s system that puts brands, retailers and manufacturers in touch with manufacturing partners, cutting out brokers and making the process more efficient and cost-effective, according to the company.

The launch is part of the company’s European expansion. Keychain counts eight of the 10 top US retailers among its customers, with seven of the top 10 CPG brands, including General Mills, the Hershey Company, and Schreiber Foods, also using the platform.

It has raised $78 million to date, including a $30 million Series B funding round led by Wellington Management and existing investor BoxGroup.

Among the investors backing the latest funding round is W23 Global, a fund backed by well-known groups such as Tesco, Ahold Delhaize, Woolworths Group, Empire Company Limited and Shoprite Group.

“Keychain’s AI-powered platform streamlines private label sourcing and enables retailers to bring quality private label products to customers faster and more efficiently,” said Ingrid Maes, chief executive and chief information officer of W23 Global.

[TITLE]Capital markets, payments companies spar over stablecoins:
[TEXT]
MUMBAI: The capital market and the payments industry have sparred on the future of stablecoins - an instrument over which government and Reserve Bank of India have articulated a cautious yet evolving policy.At the CII Financing Summit here, where senior financial sector leaders spoke in the presence of senior finance ministry and Sebi officials ahead of Budget preparations, the payments sector argued that fiat-backed stablecoins could modernise cross-border transfers, while the capital market side warned that decentralised models risked weakening regulatory oversight, taxation and market integrity.Visa's group country manager Sandeep Ghosh said the company is "very bullish about stablecoins" if backed by strong guardrails. He said stablecoins could bring scale, speed and lower costs to remittances and cross-border payments, noting that India should not fall behind global standards.By contrast, NSE CEO Ashish Chauhan called stablecoins a 'Trojan horse', warning that decentralised systems could undermine the PMLA framework, dilute taxation and expose markets to manipulation if blockchain records were compromised. He urged policymakers to prepare for risks arising from the shift away from centralised finance.

[TITLE]Doroni Aerospace Launches a Reg CF Raise to Accelerate Commercial Production of H1-X Personal Aircraft:
[TEXT]
Coral Springs, USA, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FAA-Certified Aviation Startup Is Raising Capital to Deliver the First Generation of Personal eVTOL Aircraft in $1T+ Urban Air Mobility Market

Doroni Aerospace, the advanced air mobility company pioneering personal electric flight, has launched a new Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) raise to scale toward commercial production of its flagship personal eVTOL aircraft, the Doroni H1-X.

After eight years of R&D and rigorous flight testing, Doroni has developed a first-of-its-kind personal aircraft designed for everyday people. With intuitive controls and advanced safety systems, the H1-X is positioned to become a breakthrough in the $1 trillion Urban Air Mobility (UAM) sector.

With the H1-X showroom model nearly completed and set to debut early next year, this new capital raise supports Doroni’s transition from prototyping to production. FAA-certified and already approved for manned flight testing, Doroni is building for a future where short-distance air travel is safe, personal, and practical.

The H1-X is engineered for real-world use, built to fit in a two-car garage and takeoff and land directly from driveways. From there, it can reach top speeds of 120 mph, travel up to 100 miles on a single charge, and recharge in as little as 25 minutes. With enclosed ducted fans instead of exposed propellers, it offers increased safety and efficiency. And after just 25 hours of training, anyone can pilot this joystick-driven, user-friendly aircraft.

“While the industry races to build flying taxis, we are focused on something far more transformative: empowering individuals with the freedom of personal flight,” said Doron Merdinger, Founder & CEO of Doroni Aerospace. “We aren’t just creating a new vehicle; we are creating a new era of mobility where people take back control of their time and their travel.

Interest is already mounting. Doroni has received over 600 pre-orders, representing an estimated $175M+ in potential revenue, and is targeting first deliveries in 2028.

Regulatory advancements are now unlocking certification for personal eVTOL aircraft, making the dream of flying your own vehicle a reality. Doroni is a key player in this revolution, having successfully achieved one of the first-ever manned test flights in the U.S.

Doroni’s investment round is now open to the public. Learn more and invest at invest.doroni.io
