[TITLE]Hungary Ditches Moscow? Shell Grabs 10-Year Gas Deal in Surprise EU Energy Shake-Up:
[TEXT]
This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

In a subtle but strategic pivot, Hungary has inked a 10-year gas supply agreement with Shell (NYSE:SHEL), locking in 2 billion cubic meters of LNG starting in 2026. The dealannounced by Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto during the Gastech summit in Milancomes as the European Union barrels toward its self-imposed 2027 cutoff for Russian fossil fuel imports. For Shell, it's a win in the slow-moving realignment of European energy flows. For Hungary, it's an opening salvoone that could gradually rebalance its exposure to Moscow.

Budapest still holds firm ties to Russia's Gazprom, with a contract for 4.5 bcm per year running until 2036. That deal has been topped up since 2022, underscoring Hungary's energy pragmatism. But Szijjarto hinted that more Western supply deals could be coming, pending final terms. He also made no secret of Hungary's frustration with the EU's one-size-fits-all approach, arguing that the bloc's energy transition plan ignores Hungary's limited pipeline access to non-Russian flows. In short: this Shell deal may not be a full divorce from Gazprombut it's not business as usual either.

The longer arc may bend nuclear. Hungary is pushing ahead with plans to double its atomic energy output, banking on two new reactors to slash gas imports by half and meet 70% of national power demand internally. Szijjarto believes the first grid connections could come in the early 2030s. If that timeline holds, Hungary's energy math could look very different by mid-decadewith Shell as a key transitional player and Gazprom gradually stepping back from center stage.

[TITLE]Trump presses European Union to impose 100% tariffs on India and China to pressure Putin:
[TEXT]

U.S. President Donald Trump has asked the European Union to hit China and India with tariffs of up to 100% over the countries' Russia oil purchases, in a move aimed at turning up the heat on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. The proposal, first reported by the Financial Times, was confirmed to CNBC's Megan Cassella by two sources familiar with the matter. Trump made the request when he was called into a meeting with senior U.S. and EU officials in Washington, the Financial Times reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the discussion. Washington was also prepared to "mirror" any tariffs imposed by Europe on the two countries, the report said. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.

The U.S. has imposed a punitive 25% tariff on imports from India over New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil, taking the total duties to as high as 50%. India has said the tariffs are "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," while calling out the U.S. and the EU's trade with Russia. The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between India and Russia reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. China, the biggest purchaser of Russian oil, has so far been spared from the "secondary" tariffs, after securing a truce with Washington to reduce the new levies on its products to 30%. Trump's proposal comes as his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last month has yielded little progress toward securing a ceasefire in Ukraine. After the meeting, Putin told reporters in a joint press conference with Trump that the "root causes" of the conflict needed to be addressed for a sustainable peace. "There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway," Trump said after Putin's remarks last month, without elaborating.

[TITLE]LNG Market Faces Looming Supply Glut:
[TEXT]
The global market for liquefied natural gas faces a multiyear supply glut starting in 2026, potentially pushing prices for the crucial fuel to the lowest since the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

After four years of tight markets, the International Energy Agency expects the biggest boost in LNG production next year since 2019. Exports from the US are already booming as Venture Global Plc’s new plant in Plaquemines, Louisiana ramps up faster than expected, and more big projects will follow with the enthusiastic support of the Trump administration.

Meanwhile in China, which was supposed to be the main growth market for the fuel, imports are contracting. The country’s domestic gas output has risen and a major pipeline deal with Russia is seen further squeezing its LNG purchases.

LNG gluts have been predicted before and failed to materialize, but this time looks different because so much new capacity is on the brink of completion. Industry executives gathering in Milan this week at the Gastech conference will be discussing trends that could bring cheaper power and lower heating costs to consumers around the world, while also accelerating the shift away from dirtier fuels such as coal and oil.

“With more LNG capacities coming online in 2026, the market should loosen after the first quarter,” said Aldo Spanjer, head of energy strategy at BNP Paribas SA. “We’re going to see supply length coming in toward the second half of 2026 and into 2027.”

Consumers shouldn’t expect immediate price relief, especially in Europe where winter is set to start with lower inventories than usual. Over the next six months, the supply buffer will remain slim and the region will still be competing with Asia for LNG cargoes, with the potential for price spikes in colder periods, said Martijn Rats, global commodities strategist and head of European energy research at Morgan Stanley.

But, “as we are out of the winter, a mild surplus will start in the second half of the year, which will become a sizable surplus in 2027 as production ramps up,” Rats said.

Supply Surge

More than 174 million metric tons of annual gas liquefaction capacity is currently under construction, which should raise global LNG supply to 594 million tons a year by 2030, an increase of 42% from last year, according to BloombergNEF.

It’s possible not all of this will arrive on time. A chunk of the new supply for 2026 will come from Golden Pass in Texas, developed by Exxon Mobil Corp. and QatarEnergy, which has already been delayed by

[TITLE]Ukraine willing to freeze frontlines — if security guarantees are strong enough: US NATO ambassador:
[TEXT]
Ukraine is ready to freeze the frontlines with Russia — if European and American allies can help provide tough security guarantees, US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said Monday.

“Ukraine has proven and demonstrated that they’re willing to make a deal. They’re willing to freeze the front line if they get security guarantees,” Whitaker told Fox Business‘ Liz Claman.

“I think there’s a framework for a deal, and now we just need to make sure it happens.”

That could be a game-changer in President Trump’s peace efforts, proving Kyiv’s commitment to ending the brutal conflict that now sees more than 7,000 Ukrainian and Russian deaths per week.

Kyiv officials did not immediately comment on Whitaker’s assertions Tuesday, but Ukrainian and US sources have told The Post that Zelensky may be open to formally acknowledging Russian control — not ownership — of some occupied regions in eastern Ukraine as part of a negotiated settlement.

But it will take more than just Ukraine’s willingness to make peace, the Whitaker said.

Moscow remains the biggest impediment to ending the war, rebuking Trump’s calls for a cease-fire and a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“This death and destruction we’re seeing needs to end, and really continuing to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin to end this war, because both sides are going to have to agree,” Whitaker said, calling for Europe to join in on Trump-proposed sanctions on Russian oil.

Whitaker explained that “the Russian economy is struggling” as its revenue “coming in every month [is] diminishing” — meaning sanctions targeting Moscow’s energy sales can exploit “some near-term cracks that are starting to appear in the Russian economy” and push Putin to the negotiation table.

“The money that’s paying for this war is coming from the sale of Russian oil to countries including India, China and Brazil,” he said.

“And I think applying those additional sanctions and those additional tariffs to continue to increase the cost of doing business for Vladimir Putin reduces revenue.”

Putin last month told Washington he would accept “NATO-like” security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a negotiated settlement, according to Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

But the Kremlin quickly backtracked following Trump’s meeting with the Russian strongman in Alaska on Aug. 15, with Moscow’s leadership rebuking the idea of European troops on Ukrainian soil.

The idea was meant as a compromise: Russia gets what it wants by keeping Ukraine out of NATO, while Kyiv would receive enough protection to deter Moscow from invading again after the war concludes. Still, it has suddenly become unacceptable to the Kremlin.

“In our understanding it will not help us get closer to the conclusion of the Ukrainian conflict,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC this week. “It’s a real danger to us because we are an enemy of NATO.”

Ukraine, Europe and the US are also considering other security guarantees that would come in addition to the “NATO-like” arrangement. At least 26 European nations have pledged to join in, with some even offering troops on the ground to work a peacekeepers to enforce a halt to the war.

“We’re discussing the boots and flags on the ground, and we have big number of the country who is express and readiness to send,” Zelensky’s top advisor Andriy Yermak told The Post on Monday. “I can say that we already discussed exactly numbers, exactly locations. And this is boots on the ground and flags on the ground … in the land, in the sea and the air.”

The US would not provide troops on the ground, but Trump has signaled willingness to provide US air support.

Other guarantees include beefing up Ukraine’s military with training and equipment to empower Kyiv’s forces to deter Russia from pushing further into Europe, as well as boosting the country’s air defense, Yermak said.

“In the center of this system definitely will be a strong, non-limited Ukrainian military force, which need to be equipped and have everything which is necessary to prevent [Russian invasion] and to be ready to defend Ukraine,” he said.

That idea could be tempting for some in the Pentagon who aim to cull the number of US troops in Europe, officials told The Post.

Sanctions would also play a role in a security guarantee package, Yermak said, with partners threatening tough financial punishments should Moscow re-invade Ukraine.

“We need to very carefully and very smartly to coordinate … which sanctions can take place in the future after ending of the war, if aggressions, for example, would be potentially arise again,” he said.

But first, the Kremlin must demonstrate real commitment to ending its assault on Ukraine — and Whitaker said that may not happen until Putin feels the economic consequences of his aggression.

“Vladimir Putin obviously has calculated that he’s going to try to cause as much terror and claim as much territory as he possibly can in anticipation that this war is going to end,” he said.

“I continue to applaud President Trump — he brought Putin at the table and continues … to look for additional ways to apply leverage to make sure Putin not only stays at the table, but [has the] incentive, ultimately, to end this war.”

[TITLE]Africa demands climate investment as aid shrinks:
[TEXT]

Calls for climate investment—not aid—dominated the opening of the Second Africa Climate Summit in Ethiopia.

Leaders warned that shrinking development assistance threatens Africa’s adaptation efforts and urged the world to channel capital into renewable energy, food security, and resilience projects.

Africa accounts for just 4 per cent of global emissions but faces the steepest costs of climate damage. The African Union Commission estimates the continent needs $1.3 trillion annually for adaptation alone.

However, current pledges cover less than a quarter of the required funds, leaving governments with widening financing gaps.

“Development assistance is shrinking,” said President William Ruto. “This strengthens our resolve to design, finance, and drive our own future. But the global system must open space where Africa’s climate, business, and development goals converge.”

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed emphasized that Africa must be seen as a hub of solutions.

He cited Ethiopia’s Green Legacy Initiative—which has planted 48 billion trees since 2019—as proof that local action can deliver global climate benefits.

“We ask our global partners not to fund us because we are impacted, but to invest with us because we are visionary,” Abiy said. He proposed an African Climate Innovation Compact to mobilise 1,000 homegrown solutions by 2030 across energy, agriculture, water, and transport.

AU Commission Chair Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said the continent cannot depend on fragmented aid packages when its priorities—smart agriculture, biodiversity, and clean energy—require stable, large-scale financing.

“The vulnerability of our countries, caused by climate change, debt burden, and structural inequalities in the international financial system, must be redressed through climate justice and genuine cooperation,” he said.

The shift in tone from aid to investment builds on the 2023 Nairobi Declaration, which framed climate action as a driver of economic transformation rather than a burden.Ruto said Africa’s voice is now stronger in global forums, with projects ranging from clean cooking to direct air capture emerging across the region.

“Our economies, our weather systems, and our very survival are interconnected,” he said. “Only through bold, united, and sustained collaboration can we avert climate catastrophe.”

Africa’s natural assets make a strong case for investment. The continent hosts the world’s fastest-growing solar belt, vast deposits of transition minerals, and the last intact carbon sinks in its forests and wetlands.

Analysts say these resources, if harnessed responsibly, could position Africa as a leader in the global green economy.

Despite its potential, Africa receives only 12 per cent of global climate finance flows, according to the Climate Policy Initiative. Between 2020 and 2022, annual climate finance to Africa ranged around $30 billion—far below the $277 billion required each year through 2030 to meet Paris Agreement targets.

At the same time, aid budgets in Europe and North America are declining. The OECD reported that while total aid rose modestly in 2023, allocations to Africa fell in real terms, squeezed by donor domestic crises and competing geopolitical priorities.

Leaders noted that the solution lies in attracting long-term capital.

They pressed for reforms of international financial institutions to lower Africa’s borrowing costs, which remain three times higher than rates for wealthier countries. Ruto emphasized that global markets must open to African value-added goods and carbon credits—“not just extract raw materials.”

Several governments presented case studies to show that investment delivers returns.

Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam, nearing completion, will add over 5,000 megawatts of renewable power, benefiting both Ethiopia and its neighbors.

Kenya highlighted its Accelerated Partnership for Renewables in Africa (APRA), linking green energy with industrialisation. Across the Sahel, solar farms and decentralized grids are already bringing electricity to off-grid communities, cutting diesel imports and boosting local enterprise.

But leaders warned that scaling such initiatives requires predictable financing.

“What is proposed to Africa is $300 billion under private-sector terms. This is far from sufficient,” Youssouf said. He called for an international loss and damage fund with direct, fair, and accessible financing for vulnerable countries.

The summit set the stage for Africa’s position at the UN climate talks in Belém, Brazil, later this year. Leaders said they would present a united front that stresses Africa’s role as a solutions provider rather than a victim.

Ethiopia announced its candidacy to host COP32 in 2027, positioning Addis Ababa as a hub for Africa’s climate diplomacy.

Observers noted that while rhetoric has shifted, the challenge will be turning declarations into bankable projects.Climate economists argue that Africa must also mobilize domestic resources, strengthen governance, and create regulatory certainty to attract global capital.

Ruto acknowledged the internal task ahead. “More must be done, including mobilizing African institutional capital, investing in knowledge, and improving governance. These are the foundations of resilience.”

Across Africa, the human costs of climate change are mounting. In 2024 alone, floods displaced more than 2 million people in East Africa, while prolonged droughts in the Horn pushed 23 million people into food insecurity, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Such figures proved the urgency leaders sought to convey in Addis.

“Africa did not cause this crisis, yet Africa can lead in solving it,” Abiy said.

“This is not charity. It is the most strategic investment humanity can make.”

[TITLE]Hungary Deepens Energy Ties With Shell As Russian Reliance Persists:
[TEXT]
On Tuesday, Shell PLC (NYSE:SHEL) agreed to sign a new long-term natural gas purchase deal with Hungary, which the country's foreign minister called its "largest volume and longest western supply contract ever."

The agreement was confirmed in remarks reported by Reuters, which cited Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto saying the signing would take place later in the day. He did not disclose the contract's length or volumes.

Szijjarto said, "Later today we will announce the signing of a new long-term contract with Shell," while adding that Hungary cannot fully wean itself off Russian gas without further infrastructure development in the region.

Also Read: Shell Halts Rotterdam Biofuels Project After Cost Review

According to Reuters, Hungary's previous long-term deal with Shell was signed in 2020, covering 250 million cubic meters of gas annually between 2021 and 2027. That agreement marked the country's first long-term LNG contract with a Western company.

Hungary consumes around 8 billion cubic metres of gas a year. It is still the biggest buyer of Russian gas in the European Union.

Reuters reported that earlier this year Hungary and Slovakia opposed European Commission proposals to phase out Russian energy imports, reflecting Hungary's reliance on supplies from Moscow.

While the Hungary agreement signals Shell's continued role in European gas markets, the company also moved last week to scale back ambitions in biofuels. On September 3, Shell announced its subsidiary, Shell Nederland Raffinaderij B.V., will not resume construction of a planned biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam.

Shell said that the decision followed a "thorough commercial and technical review" of the project's competitiveness. Construction at the 820,000-tonne-per-year facility had already been suspended in July. The project had been a centerpiece of Shell's push into renewable fuels, and the cancellation reflects a more selective investment approach amid cost pressures.

Price Action: SHEL shares were trading higher by 1.25% to $72.62 at last check Tuesday.

[TITLE]Energy & Utilities Construction Industry Report 2025 | Market to Grow at a CAGR of 7.8% to Reach $213.1 Billion by 2030 - Trends, Opportunities, and Forecasts:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Energy & Utilities Construction Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Energy & Utilities Construction Market was valued at USD 134.6 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 213.1 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 7.80%.

The market is experiencing significant momentum due to the rising global energy demand driven by rapid urbanization, industrial expansion, and population growth, particularly in emerging economies. Simultaneously, the global energy transition is accelerating the construction of renewable power assets such as solar and wind farms, alongside modernization of electricity grids to accommodate decentralized and variable energy sources.

Smart grid initiatives and utility digitization are enhancing operational efficiency and resilience. In developed regions, the replacement of aging infrastructure is being prioritized, particularly to mitigate the growing risks from extreme climate events. Furthermore, surging electricity consumption from digital infrastructure like data centers - spurred by cloud computing and AI technologies - is driving investment in energy and utility networks. Government support through policies, subsidies, and partnerships is enabling sustainable development, reinforcing the sector's strategic role in the global push for energy security and carbon neutrality.

Key Market Drivers

Rising Global Energy Demand and Infrastructure Modernization

A major driver of the Energy & Utilities Construction Market is the increasing global energy demand, propelled by expanding urban populations, economic growth, and industrial activity in emerging economies. As cities grow and industries modernize, existing infrastructure is becoming insufficient, leading to a surge in construction of power plants, transmission lines, substations, and water supply systems. This trend is especially prevalent in regions like Asia and Africa, where electricity demand is projected to rise sharply.

Concurrently, developed economies face the challenge of upgrading aging infrastructure that no longer meets modern efficiency or climate resilience standards. Frequent climate-related disruptions highlight the need for robust and reliable energy and utility systems. Additionally, the global rise of electric vehicles and digital services is creating additional load on power grids, driving the need for smarter, high-capacity, and decentralized energy infrastructure. Governments and private investors are responding by funding large-scale utility construction projects that support economic growth, sustainability, and energy security.

Key Market Challenges

Supply Chain Disruptions and Skilled Labor Shortages

The global Energy & Utilities Construction Market is significantly impacted by ongoing supply chain disruptions and a widespread shortage of skilled labor. Material shortages - particularly of steel, copper, aluminum, and semiconductors - have caused cost spikes and delays in the delivery of key components like turbines, transformers, and electrical systems. Transportation bottlenecks and port congestion further aggravate the situation, prolonging project timelines and increasing costs. Parallel to material constraints, the industry faces a critical labor shortfall.

Specialized roles such as high-voltage technicians, renewable energy engineers, and certified electricians are in short supply, especially as older workers retire and training programs fail to keep pace with demand. This is particularly evident in high-complexity projects like nuclear facilities and offshore wind installations, where strict safety and compliance standards add further recruitment challenges. Together, these issues elevate project risks and operational costs, making it difficult for construction firms to scale operations efficiently. While strategies like local sourcing, modular design, and workforce development are being explored, they require significant time and investment to yield tangible results.

Key Market Trends

Rise of Renewable Energy and Decentralized Power Infrastructure

A prominent trend shaping the Energy & Utilities Construction Market is the rapid global pivot toward renewable and decentralized energy solutions. As countries commit to carbon neutrality and clean energy goals, investment is pouring into the construction of solar farms, onshore and offshore wind projects, hydro plants, and battery energy storage systems. Offshore wind, in particular, is gaining momentum due to its scale and efficiency advantages. This shift is supported by policy frameworks like the EU Green Deal and the U.S.

Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivize green infrastructure projects. At the same time, decentralized energy systems - including rooftop solar, local microgrids, and smart home technologies - are transforming energy consumption and distribution. These systems reduce transmission losses and enhance grid resilience while giving consumers more control over their energy use. Construction approaches are evolving to accommodate these new energy paradigms, with emphasis on modular, localized, and smart infrastructure that supports both centralized and distributed power networks.

[TITLE]Development banks' climate finance hits record $137bn:
[TEXT]
Multilateral development banks provided a record $137 billion in climate finance in 2024, up 10% from the previous year, and also helped boost private sector funding for climate-related investments by a third, a report by the banks showed today.

The increase in investment comes as nations gear up for the next round of UN climate talks in Brazil in November, where developing countries are set to call for more help to pay for the impacts of climate change caused mainly by richer nations.

To help accelerate action, countries are being urged to turn up at the COP30 talks with fresh plans to attract private sector investment in the climate fight - a crucial step as official development aid is slashed by many countries.

"MDBs are clearly supporting the move to accelerate (climate finance)," said Nancy Saich, chief climate change expert at the European Investment Bank, one of the development banks involved in the report.

"We hope that by showing that our finance is flowing, this encourages countries to come with ambitious national climate plans to the COP (because) overall, we're not yet on track to a safe world, and a safe temperature," she stated.

Multilateral development banks (MDBs) directed most of their climate finance - $85.1 billion - towards low and middle-income countries, with finance to the world's poorest nations more than doubling over the past five years, the report said.

Of this, 69%, or $58.8 billion, went to climate change mitigation projects such as renewable energy, while 31%, or $26.3 billion, went to adaptation projects that help countries withstand climate change impacts.

Over the same period, MDBs delivered $51.5 billion to high-income countries, of which $46.5 billion was for climate mitigation and $5 billion for adaptation, the report showed.

MDBs increased the amount of private finance mobilised to support climate action by a third to $134 billion in 2024.

Key Market Drivers

Rising Global Energy Demand and Infrastructure Modernization

A major driver of the Energy & Utilities Construction Market is the increasing global energy demand, propelled by expanding urban populations, economic growth, and industrial activity in emerging economies. As cities grow and industries modernize, existing infrastructure is becoming insufficient, leading to a surge in construction of power plants, transmission lines, substations, and water supply systems. This trend is especially prevalent in regions like Asia and Africa, where electricity demand is projected to rise sharply.

Concurrently, developed economies face the challenge of upgrading aging infrastructure that no longer meets modern efficiency or climate resilience standards. Frequent climate-related disruptions highlight the need for robust and reliable energy and utility systems. Additionally, the global rise of electric vehicles and digital services is creating additional load on power grids, driving the need for smarter, high-capacity, and decentralized energy infrastructure. Governments and private investors are responding by funding large-scale utility construction projects that support economic growth, sustainability, and energy security.

Key Market Challenges

Supply Chain Disruptions and Skilled Labor Shortages

The global Energy & Utilities Construction Market is significantly impacted by ongoing supply chain disruptions and a widespread shortage of skilled labor. Material shortages - particularly of steel, copper, aluminum, and semiconductors - have caused cost spikes and delays in the delivery of key components like turbines, transformers, and electrical systems. Transportation bottlenecks and port congestion further aggravate the situation, prolonging project timelines and increasing costs. Parallel to material constraints, the industry faces a critical labor shortfall.

Specialized roles such as high-voltage technicians, renewable energy engineers, and certified electricians are in short supply, especially as older workers retire and training programs fail to keep pace with demand. This is particularly evident in high-complexity projects like nuclear facilities and offshore wind installations, where strict safety and compliance standards add further recruitment challenges. Together, these issues elevate project risks and operational costs, making it difficult for construction firms to scale operations efficiently. While strategies like local sourcing, modular design, and workforce development are being explored, they require significant time and investment to yield tangible results.

Key Market Trends

Rise of Renewable Energy and Decentralized Power Infrastructure

A prominent trend shaping the Energy & Utilities Construction Market is the rapid global pivot toward renewable and decentralized energy solutions. As countries commit to carbon neutrality and clean energy goals, investment is pouring into the construction of solar farms, onshore and offshore wind projects, hydro plants, and battery energy storage systems. Offshore wind, in particular, is gaining momentum due to its scale and efficiency advantages. This shift is supported by policy frameworks like the EU Green Deal and the U.S.

Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivize green infrastructure projects. At the same time, decentralized energy systems - including rooftop solar, local microgrids, and smart home technologies - are transforming energy consumption and distribution. These systems reduce transmission losses and enhance grid resilience while giving consumers more control over their energy use. Construction approaches are evolving to accommodate these new energy paradigms, with emphasis on modular, localized, and smart infrastructure that supports both centralized and distributed power networks.

[TITLE]Third energy provider to hike its prices as colder weather sets in:
[TEXT]
A third energy company has announced a price rise, in a move that is likely to be followed by others.

Energia, which has 300,000 customers in this country, is set to hike its prices just as the colder weather sets in.

It is the third supplier this year to increase customer costs.

The energy supplier recently paid a €40m dividend to its investment fund owners.

From October 9, Energia electricity customers will be hit with a 10.9pc increase.

This will work out at a rise of €205 a year on the average bill.

Energia Dual Fuel customers are to have a 6pc increase imposed on them.

Energia is raising its prices.

Today's News in 90 Seconds - Tuesday, September 9

Over a year, this works out at a rise of €205.

Energia Smart Meter Electricity plan customers will see a 12.1pc increase.

This will add €194 a year to the typical annual household bill.

Energia Smart Meter Dual Fuel plan customers will have a 6.2pc increase imposed from October 9, two days after the Budget.

Over a year they will be faced with paying an extra €193.

There is no change to Energia gas prices.

It said the price rises are now unavoidable due to ongoing, substantial increases in electricity system operator and network charges.

Daragh Cassidy of price comparison site Bonkers.ie said the rises were “hefty”.

"Although wholesale energy prices have reduced hugely since the height of the energy crisis in 2002, they still remain high,” he said.

Wholesale electricity prices remain around 80pc to 90pc above the level they were at before the war in Ukraine broke out. It’s similar for gas, Mr Cassidy said.

“On top of this, costs for the upkeep of the electricity grid in particular keep on rising.

“Around 30pc of the price we pay for our electricity and gas goes to Eirgrid and ESB Networks, and Gas Networks Ireland for the upkeep of the electricity and gas networks respectively.”

The focus will now be on ESB-owned Electric Ireland, which has 1.3 million customers.

Last month some 45,500 Flogas residential electricity customers were hit by a price rise of around €10.51 a month, adding €126 to annual bills.

It blamed higher network charges after it announced a rise of 7pc in electricity prices.

The standing charge for people on the standard Flogas electricity rate is rising from €257.38 a year to €275.39.

In April, SSE Airtricity raised electricity bills by 10.5pc, and gas bills by 8.4pc.

The move impacted around 250,000 electricity customers and 85,000 gas customers.

It blamed rising wholesale energy prices and higher network charges imposed by the energy regulator.

Last year, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) hiked fees which worked out at just over €100 a year per, with further increases also likely over the following years.

The Energia price rise comes after the Government has repeatedly said there will be no energy credits in next month’s Budget. Last year the credits gave households €250 each towards their energy bills.

The credits, coupled with substantial social welfare support, had helped shield customers from high energy costs, experts said.

And the VAT rate on energy bills is due to revert back to 13.5pc, from the temporary 9pc at the moment, at the end of October, unless the lower rate is extended in the Budget.

Across all energy suppliers some 300,000 households are in arrears on their electricity bills, with 176,000 of those in arrears for 90 days or more.
