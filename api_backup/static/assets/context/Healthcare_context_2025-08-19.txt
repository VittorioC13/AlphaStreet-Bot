[TITLE]4 M&A trends keeping bankers busy this summer: JPMorgan:

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Pie chart JPMorgan

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.

[TITLE]ASEAN Infusion Pump Company Evaluation Report 2025 | BD, Fresenius Kabi, and Terumo Lead with Innovations in Drug Delivery, Hospital Care, and Cardiovascular Solutions:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "ASEAN Infusion Pump - Company Evaluation Report, 2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The ASEAN Infusion Pump Companies Quadrant is a comprehensive industry analysis that provides valuable insights into the global market for ASEAN Infusion Pump. This quadrant offers a detailed evaluation of key market players, technological advancements, product innovations, and emerging trends shaping the industry. 360 Quadrants evaluated over 140 companies, of which the Top 15 ASEAN Infusion Pump Companies were categorized and recognized as quadrant leaders.

The ASEAN infusion pumps market is experiencing significant growth, driven by the rising burden of chronic diseases, expanding healthcare infrastructure, and increasing demand for advanced drug delivery systems. As conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and renal failure become more prevalent across Southeast Asia, hospitals and clinics are increasingly adopting infusion pumps to ensure precise and controlled medication delivery. Countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines are rapidly modernizing their healthcare systems, with substantial investments in hospital equipment and critical care technologies further supporting market expansion.

A major growth factor is the region's aging population, which is more susceptible to chronic illnesses requiring long-term intravenous therapies. This demographic shift is fueling consistent demand for infusion pumps in both hospital and homecare settings. In parallel, governments across the ASEAN region are prioritizing healthcare system improvements, leading to increased public and private investments in medical technologies, including infusion systems. Additionally, the availability of cost-effective, locally manufactured infusion devices is making advanced care more affordable and accessible in price-sensitive markets, promoting broader adoption in both urban and rural healthcare facilities.

The 360 Quadrant maps the ASEAN Infusion Pump companies based on criteria such as revenue, geographic presence, growth strategies, investments, and sales strategies for the market presence of the ASEAN Infusion Pump quadrant. The top criteria for product footprint evaluation included By Product (Accessories and Consumables, Devices), By Application (Chemotherapy/Oncology, Diabetes Management, Gastroenterology, Analgesia/Pain Management, Analgesia/Pain Management, Hematology, Other Applications), and By End User (Hospitals, Home Care Settings, Ambulatory Care Settings, Academic & Research Institutes).

[TITLE]Goddard Systems Presents 17th Annual Anthony A. Martino Memorial Scholarship to Katie Watson from Chester, VA:
[TEXT]
King of Prussia, PA, Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Goddard Systems, LLC, manager of The Goddard School ® franchise system, the nation’s leading premium early childhood education provider, today announced Katie Watson is the 2025 Anthony A. Martino Memorial Scholarship winner. This $10,000 scholarship is awarded annually to a graduating high school senior who successfully completed a Goddard School pre-k or kindergarten program. The recipient must demonstrate the work ethic, perseverance and commitment to community that exemplified Anthony A. Martino, the founder of The Goddard School franchise system. Raised in Chester, VA, Watson is a 2012 pre-k graduate of The Goddard School of Chester (River’s Bend).

“Katie stood out among an extraordinary pool of applications for her unwavering dedication to applying her education in service of her community,” said Darin Harris, CEO of Goddard Systems. “At Goddard, we believe that where you start your educational journey matters, and Katie exemplifies this belief. We are honored to name her the 2025 Anthony A. Martino Memorial Scholarship winner. It’s rewarding to see how The Goddard School set the foundation for Katie’s academic future, and we’re excited to watch her continue to flourish in her educational and personal journeys.”

Watson, who will attend the University of Virginia this fall, developed a passion for history, government and helping others during her time as a member of We the People, a civic education program centered on constitutional law and public policy. Her participation in the program throughout high school gave her experience in analyzing Supreme Court cases, preparing testimony and fielding questions from judges centered around policy that improves access to education and empowers communities to participate in democracy.

“The Goddard School taught me to have empathy and compassion for others, and to embrace my creativity and personality,” said Watson. “Those early learnings were inspiring and shaped my academic path and decision to study public policy and leadership in college. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in law while advocating for civic education.”

Watson is a 2025 graduate of The Maggie Walker Governor’s School. In addition to her time with We the People, she served as a swim coach throughout high school, helping children who had no experience in the water gain confidence and learn to swim.

“It is so fulfilling to see Katie’s transformation from a vivacious preschooler to an accomplished high school graduate. Goddard is the best place to start your education journey, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for Katie,” said Stephen Graham, owner of The Goddard School of Chester (River’s Bend). “Our school is committed to providing a nurturing environment for every child to foster confidence and build a lifelong love for learning. Seeing the success of our graduates is a great reminder of why we do what we do.”

When the new owners were asked why they wanted to start a business flipping houses, Steven said, “We both wanted something more than what the corporate world could offer—a sense of ownership, purpose, and the opportunity to build something successful for ourselves. Partnering with the New Again Houses team gives us that chance, with the added support of a proven system and an incredible network. This opportunity felt like the right fit not only because of the strong references and culture, but also because it aligns with both of our strengths and passions.”

Jennifer added, “What excites us most about this opportunity is the chance to build something of our own—combining our skills, challenging ourselves, and making a real impact in the community—while being supported by a team and system we believe in.”

New Again Houses® Franchise Owners help carry the credible, trustworthy brand name of New Again Houses® across the United States. They are proud of all of their franchise owners for their success, hard work, and dedication in building their companies and delivering the same expectations and culture that New Again represents across the board.
