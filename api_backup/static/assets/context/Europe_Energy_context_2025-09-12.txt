$215 Million Implied Valuation for up to 70% ownership.

Closing Expected 4th Quarter.

NEW YORK, Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pelican Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ: PELI) (“Pelican”), a publicly listed special purpose acquisition company, today announced the signing of a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with Greenland Exploration Limited (“Greenland Exploration”) and March GL Company (“March GL”). Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined company will operate under the name Greenland Energy Company and is expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol “GLND.”

The Jameson Land Basin in East Greenland has been the focus of extensive exploration and research for decades. ARCO, shortly after its discovery of the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska, invested the equivalent of more than $275 million in today’s dollars to evaluate the Jameson Land Basin. Their work included detailed field mapping and sampling programs, as well as the acquisition of approximately 1,800 km of 2D seismic data. ARCO also constructed the Constable Point Airfield, which remains a key piece of infrastructure in the region.

These early efforts indicated that the Jameson Land Basin has significant potential as a hydrocarbon basin. Internal ARCO reports and subsequent independent studies pointed to substantial oil potential, with recoverable resources estimated in the multi-billion-barrel range. Despite this, Jameson remained undrilled due to corporate and macroeconomic conditions of the time, leaving its prospectivity intact.

March GL has now built on this foundation, reprocessing the legacy seismic data with modern technology. This work has identified over 50 distinct oil and gas targets, many with clear structural and stratigraphic trapping potential. Leveraging both the existing infrastructure and the historic investment by ARCO, March GL is positioned to accelerate drilling of the basin’s first well and unlock its long-recognized potential.

"This transaction marks a watershed moment in bringing Greenland's vast energy potential to the global stage," said Larry G. Swets, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of Greenland Exploration. "We're excited to partner with Robert Price and his exceptional team at March GL, working alongside Greenland Exploration to establish the first U.S. public company focused on this critical opportunity. We believe that by uniting Greenland Exploration's proven resource portfolio with March GL's operational excellence and Pelican's capital markets expertise, Greenland Energy will be uniquely positioned to drive responsible growth, accelerate economic diversification in Greenland, and advance strategic priorities for the United States and our allied partners.”

Field activity is progressing rapidly. The Greenland Government has approved the mobilization and the sealift landing of heavy equipment, including a D9 bulldozer, trucks, excavators, loaders, generators, and housing units. Once the equipment is offloaded, it will be ready to build a three mile road to the drilling site.

March GL has signed agreements with Halliburton to support logistics planning and provide drilling services, and with a leading shipping company to mobilize a 3,500-meter-capable drilling rig. IPT Well Solutions has also been retained as project manager to provide additional oversight and technical support. Together, these preparations mark the decisive first step toward drilling in Jameson Land Basin—an opportunity that has stood for decades as one of the most compelling undrilled prospects in the Arctic.

“Energy is fundamental to economic growth and national development, and responsible resource development in Greenland has the potential to unlock new domestic revenue streams that contribute to greater economic self-reliance,” said Robert Price at March GL. “We believe the Jameson basin is among the largest undrilled onshore basins of its kind, and our work with 80 Mile, conducted under Greenlandic regulatory oversight, represents an environmentally responsible and strategic step toward assessing that opportunity. By partnering with experienced technical consultants, globally recognized drilling contractors, and internationally respected logistics providers, we are committed to ensuring that the evaluation and potential development of Jameson is executed to the highest environmental and operational standards.”

March GL Company has obtained the rights from 80 Mile and its subsidiary company, White Flame Energy A/S, to own up to 70% of three onshore licenses, which include over 2,000,000 acres covering the entire petroleum basin.

“Our business combination with Greenland Energy represents a landmark opportunity to responsibly connect American capital with potentially one of the world's most resource-rich and geopolitically strategic regions,” said Robert Labbe, Chief Executive Officer of Pelican Acquisition Corporation. “This merger establishes a robust foundation for growth and creates a platform to responsibly unlock Greenland's vast potential while generating substantial value for all stakeholders—including Greenland itself and the investors backing this vision. We believe this transaction will drive enduring value creation while directly supporting critical U.S. objectives: energy security, economic diversification, and strategic independence. This transaction opens direct access to U.S. public markets, dramatically expanding our capacity to pursue potentially transformative energy projects that generate environmentally responsible sustainable benefits for both Greenland and America while strengthening Western energy security."

Transaction Highlights

Pelican will domesticate from the Cayman Islands to Texas prior to closing.

The transaction will include a series of mergers whereby Pelican, Greenland, and March GL will each merge with subsidiaries of Pelican Holdco, Inc. (“Holdco”), a newly formed Texas corporation to be renamed Greenland Energy Company.

Existing Greenland Exploration shareholders will receive an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Greenland Energy Company common stock.

Existing March GL shareholders will receive an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of Greenland Energy Company common stock.

Pelican shareholders will receive one share of Greenland Energy Company common stock for each share of Pelican common stock they currently hold (subject to redemptions).

Leadership and Governance

The post-closing board of directors and executive management team of Greenland Energy Company will be led by Larry G Swets, Jr. as Executive Chairman and Robert Price as Chief Executive Officer, and will include representatives from Greenland Exploration, March GL, and Pelican.

[TITLE]U.S. Energy Chief Calls Net Zero a “Colossal Train Wreck”:
[TEXT]
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright blasted net-zero targets as a “colossal train wreck” ahead of his trip to Europe for a gas summit and meetings with EU officials, warning the push for climate policies could weaken energy security and derail a U.S.–EU trade deal.

“Net zero 2050 is just a colossal train wreck,” Wright told the Financial Times in an interview.

“It’s just a monstrous human impoverishment program, and of course, there is no way it is going to happen,” said the Energy Secretary, whose remarks were also shared on X by the official account of the U.S. Department of Energy.

Secretary Wright, a former oil and gas executive, made his position on net zero known shortly after he was picked to lead the energy department earlier this year. Weeks earlier, the Trump Administration had given a loud and clear message on what it thinks of net zero on Day One—the day that President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, again.

After years of aligning with Europe on the net-zero agenda under President Biden, the United States is now on a collision course with the EU and its climate regulations.

The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), commonly known as the “carbon border tax”, ultimately aim to impose levies on higher-emission products imported into the EU.

Many companies outside the EU, including those in the U.S., have signaled they would rather not sell in Europe than pay significant “border taxes”, levies, penalties, or whatever the language will be later this decade, when the mechanism will come into effect.

These rules and the EU’s “crusade” toward net zero are a threat to the U.S.-EU trade deal, Secretary Wright told FT.

“I think those regulations significantly threaten the ability to implement the trade deal that was agreed to,” he added.

The U.S.-EU trade deal for European energy purchases of American products already looks unrealistic, analysts say, even without accounting for all EU climate-related levies.

U.S. giant ExxonMobil hopes the ongoing U.S.-EU dialogue on trade would address the “bone-crushing penalties” in the EU’s climate regulations, the supermajor’s CEO Darren Woods told analysts on the Q2 earnings call last month.

Wright’s remarks from this week aren’t the first time the U.S. Energy Secretary has slammed the net zero agenda.

Europe’s goal to pursue a net-zero agenda is depriving citizens of reliable and affordable energy in a choice made by politicians, Wright said at a forum in Poland in April.

“This top-down imposition of enforced “climate policies” is justified as necessary to save the world from climate change,” Wright said.

“But I can say that climate alarmism has clearly reduced energy freedom, and, hence, prosperity and national security across Western Europe.”

Wright noted that affordability is more important than sustainability.

“Today, folks struggling to pay their bills while aspiring to live highly energized lifestyles like you and I is a far bigger global challenge than climate change. Energy access is far too important to get wrong,” Wright said.

The U.S. pushback against net zero has led to Secretary Wright saying that the United States could abandon the IEA if the organization, created in the aftermath of the 1970s Arab oil embargo, doesn’t return to forecasting energy demand without strongly promoting green energy.

“We will do one of two things: we will reform the way the IEA operates or we will withdraw,” Wright told Bloomberg in an interview in the middle of July.

“My strong preference is to reform it,” Secretary Wright added.

The official echoed voices in the U.S. Republican party that the agency has become an advocate of the energy transition and is not objective in forecasting energy demand trends.

From ensuring security of supply after the 1970s embargo, the agency has shifted from this purpose in recent years to endorsing the net-zero by 2050 goal and is advocating for a major change in the global energy system to include more electric vehicles (EVs), renewable power supply, hydrogen, and all other low-carbon energy sources.

The IEA’s forecast that oil demand will peak this decade is “just total nonsense,” Secretary Wright said.

[TITLE]Big Oil Cuts Back as $60 Oil Bites:
[TEXT]
In their first-quarter financial reports this year, Big Oil majors signaled they were doing just fine in a $60-per-barrel oil environment. Spending plans were aggressive, there was no mention of job cuts, and production plans featured the word “growth”. Six months later, with the price of oil still hovering between $60 and $70, things are changing.

Oil jobs in the U.S. shale patch were falling at the fastest pace since 2022, when Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate went from over $100 per barrel to below $80 in a matter of six months. In absolute terms, the job loss was not that much of a big deal, standing at 1.7%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited by Bloomberg this week. But oil prices are down by 125 since the start of the year, the publication recalled, adding that things were only going to get worse because demand for oil was “tepid”.

ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, served a blow to the bullishly minded among oil market observers, saying also this week it would cut as much as a quarter of its global workforce. The company said reductions will occur across functions and geographies, with further details to be shared directly with staff through internal briefings. The job cuts are part of a reorganization drive aimed at making the company more efficient and its structure simpler. The move, however, was taken to mean Conoco was in trouble and doing the first thing oil companies do when they are in trouble: shedding jobs.

Reuters noted a job cut announcement of a similar scale made by Chevron in February this year. However, the suggestion that Chevron decided to slash a fifth of its workforce because of the oil price decline is a bit of a stretch. Chevron announced its job cuts plan early in the year when the price depression was just beginning. It also motivated it with the need to cut costs following its megadeal for the acquisition of Hess Corp.

That said, the company itself noted the challenging environment it was operating in, with CEO Mike Wirth describing the final quarter of 2024 by saying, “I’m not going to call it the perfect storm, but it was a quarter where there were a lot of things that all went in one direction, and it was a negative direction.”

Along with jobs, oil companies are also cutting spending. According to Reuters, 22 public oil companies in the United States, including Conoco, Diamondback Energy, and Occidental, but not the supermajors, had cut a combined $2 billion in spending, as reported in their statements for the second quarter of the year. “We've gone from ‘drill, baby, drill' to 'wait, baby wait’ here in the Permian,” Latigo Petroleum chief executive Kirk Edwards told Reuters. Edwards separately told the Financial Times that the job cuts in the shale patch were “a flashing red warning light for the entire US oil and gas industry.”

The warning light is flashing mostly because of demand projections and predictions of an oil glut. At the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference this week, a number of analysts said Brent crude was

[TITLE]Chevron in Crete: Greece pressures Libya and Turkey under US security umbrella:
[TEXT]
Newsroom September 10 09:55

New developments in the exploitation of Greece’s energy resources, which could place the country firmly within the Eastern Mediterranean’s energy club while also strengthening Athens’ efforts to safeguard and exercise its sovereign rights, are unfolding with the confirmation of U.S. oil giant Chevron’s interest in joining Helleniq Energy in exploration of the offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese.

“I believe this is the best proof of how our government perceives the upgrading of the country’s geopolitical role. We are becoming an important energy player in the Eastern Mediterranean, recognized by both the EU and the U.S.,” said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. He is scheduled to meet tomorrow with U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of the Energy Sovereignty Council, N. Bergam, to discuss “how we are continuously upgrading our country’s strategic geopolitical energy role.”

Environment and Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou, immediately after the tender closed, emphasized:

“A new chapter opens for the utilization of our nation’s offshore energy wealth. This is a development of hope and perspective for our country. Greece, with national confidence, is laying solid foundations for its energy self-sufficiency and leveraging its geopolitical position in the Eastern Mediterranean.”

The completion of the tender, which marks the starting point for Chevron and Helleniq Energy to acquire exploration and exploitation rights in these areas, is a landmark moment in Greece’s long-standing effort to tap into its energy resources. This effort has faced major geopolitical challenges, particularly with Turkey, which effectively froze such initiatives not only in disputed zones but also in the Ionian Sea and Central Mediterranean.

The tender for the blocks south of Crete is of critical importance. Though mapped more than a decade ago, they remained dormant because Greece had not exercised its sovereign rights there, despite the provisions of Law 4001/2011 (the “Maniatis amendment”), which unilaterally delineated the outer limits of the Greek EEZ/continental shelf by setting the median line as the boundary in cases without bilateral agreements.

The tenders for blocks west and southwest of Crete had already triggered Libyan objections. However, ExxonMobil’s entry into the region occurred before the Turkey-Libya Memorandum of Understanding, which attempted to impose faits accomplis against Greece.

Athens’ decision to launch the tender for the southern Crete blocks was a direct challenge both to the Turkey-Libya MoU and to Libya’s maximalist claims, which sought to shift the median line northward at Greece’s expense. Through Law 4001/2011 and now the new tender, Greece is, for the first time, creating its own faits accomplis by exercising sovereign rights—pressuring Libya and indirectly Turkey, since the area overlaps a significant portion of the EEZ that, under the Turkey-Libya deal, would have gone to Libya.

Libya officially protested with a note verbale to the UN (June 20), claiming the two blocks fell within its continental shelf. In another letter (May 27), Tripoli asserted maximalist maritime claims that, under the MoU, extended nearly to Crete’s territorial waters—covering almost the entire area of the two blocks.

Athens countered Libya’s claims. Following Foreign Minister Gerapetritis’ visits to Tripoli and Benghazi, talks on EEZ delimitation—stalled for ten years—were set to resume under the pressure Libya felt from the tender’s continuation and Greece’s adoption of a new national maritime spatial plan.

In this complex and sensitive environment, Chevron’s participation is the strongest response yet to challenges against Greek sovereign rights.

Of course, no company—however powerful—confers sovereignty. But the fact that Chevron accepts the Greek delineation of the blocks and the median line, despite intense efforts to dispute them, effectively consolidates Greece’s position. If seismic surveys and later exploratory drilling proceed, they will create a de facto American “security umbrella.”

Chevron has also expressed interest in entering Libya’s offshore sector. For now, this is not problematic, as Tripoli’s blocks offered for international tender respect the Greek median line, despite Libya’s formal objections at the UN.

Chevron executives even met with Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar on the sidelines of the Energy Conference in Italy, as Turkey seeks to entice foreign—and especially American—oil companies into partnerships. That meeting may not have been unrelated to Chevron’s subsequent announcement of participation in the Greek tender.

This development marks the first step on a long and difficult road, one that many hope will lead to the discovery and exploitation of deposits critical for Greece’s economy, its geopolitical upgrade, and the safeguarding of its sovereign rights.

[TITLE]Turkey Taps U.S., European, Asian Suppliers For 15 Bcm LNG:
[TEXT]
Turkey’s state gas company BOTAS has locked in 15 billion cubic metres of liquefied natural gas (LNG) through new contracts with eight global suppliers, in a concerted effort to expand its energy portfolio and curb dependence on pipelines from Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran.

Announced at the Gastech 2025 conference in Milan, the agreements cover deliveries through 2028 and involve heavyweights including Cheniere, SEFE, Equinor, JERA, BP, ENI, Shell, and Hartree.

Reuters reported that BOTAS sealed a one-year, 1.2 bcm deal with U.S. exporter Cheniere and a two-year, 600 million cubic metre deal with London-based Hartree. Turkish daily DUNYA added further detail, citing contracts with Germany’s SEFE (1.8 bcm over three years), Norway’s Equinor (1.5 bcm over three years), and Japan’s JERA (0.6 bcm for one year). The remaining supply will be split among BP, ENI, and Shell, bringing the total to roughly 15 bcm.

Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said the deals reflect Ankara’s strategy to build a “multi-source, flexible, and market-oriented” gas market. He stressed that Turkey’s LNG terminals and floating storage regasification units are now positioned to handle greater import volumes as demand rises in both industrial and power sectors. Deliveries are scheduled to begin this winter, with volumes extending into 2028.

The scale of procurement of this scope and scale is a direct response to the vulnerability of piped gas supplies. Ankara has been gradually layering LNG into its portfolio to reduce exposure to Russian flows, which still account for over 40% of imports. By adding U.S., European, and Asian suppliers, BOTAS aims to leverage global spot and term markets for price stability and energy security.

Industry officials noted that securing long-term volumes during Gastech gives buyers like Turkey leverage against market swings, with contracted LNG functioning as a hedge at a time of unpredictable demand growth across Europe and Asia.

[TITLE]EU Court Upholds Green Label for Gas and Nuclear Energy:
[TEXT]
The General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union, Europe’s second-highest court, ruled on Wednesday that the EU has the right to label some natural gas and nuclear projects as “sustainable investments,” dismissing a challenge brought by Austria.

In 2022, the European Commission updated in 2022 its Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act on climate change mitigation and adaptation covering certain gas and nuclear activities. Under the new taxonomy, some gas projects, including several pipelines, were given a “sustainable investment” status. Gas projects are “transitional” if they contribute to the transition from coal to renewables, the EU says.

Faced with uncertainty in energy supply after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the energy crisis that followed, the EU allowed certain nuclear and gas projects to be classed as “sustainable investments”.

In its ruling today, the General Court said that “The Commission was entitled to take the view that certain economic activities in the nuclear energy and fossil gas sectors can, under certain conditions, contribute substantially to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.”

With this ruling, the court dismissed Austria’s action against the inclusion of nuclear energy and fossil gas in the sustainable investment framework.

Austria had sought an annulment of the regulation.

But the court sided with the Commission and noted that the EC “was entitled to take the view that nuclear energy generation has near to zero greenhouse gas emissions and that there are currently no technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives at a sufficient scale, such as renewable energy sources, to cover the energy demand in a continuous and reliable manner.”

“The approach taken by the 2022 delegated regulation is a gradual approach based on a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in stages, while allowing for security of supply,” the General Court said.

The court’s decision is “very regrettable,” Austrian Climate Minister Norbert Totschnig said in a statement sent to AFP.

Environmentalists weren’t happy with the court’s ruling, either.

“A dark day for the climate. The ruling is a major setback for climate and consumer protection,” Martin Kaiser, executive director of Greenpeace Germany, said.

“With this ruling, the European Court of Justice legitimizes greenwashing in the financial sector and undermines Europe’s climate targets,” Kaiser added.

“Today, folks struggling to pay their bills while aspiring to live highly energized lifestyles like you and I is a far bigger global challenge than climate change. Energy access is far too important to get wrong,” Wright said.

The U.S. pushback against net zero has led to Secretary Wright saying that the United States could abandon the IEA if the organization, created in the aftermath of the 1970s Arab oil embargo, doesn’t return to forecasting energy demand without strongly promoting green energy.

“We will do one of two things: we will reform the way the IEA operates or we will withdraw,” Wright told Bloomberg in an interview in the middle of July.

“My strong preference is to reform it,” Secretary Wright added.

The official echoed voices in the U.S. Republican party that the agency has become an advocate of the energy transition and is not objective in forecasting energy demand trends.

From ensuring security of supply after the 1970s embargo, the agency has shifted from this purpose in recent years to endorsing the net-zero by 2050 goal and is advocating for a major change in the global energy system to include more electric vehicles (EVs), renewable power supply, hydrogen, and all other low-carbon energy sources.

The IEA’s forecast that oil demand will peak this decade is “just total nonsense,” Secretary Wright said.

[TITLE]Climate action can feel slow – but the fastest energy leap in history has begun:
[TEXT]
It’s increasingly common to hear from experts and the general public that the global shift away from fossil fuels is glacially slow, or even nonexistent.

As the view goes, the meteoric rise of clean energy is only supplementing fossil fuels rather than pushing them out. Repeated with increasing frequency by many – including the fossil fuel lobby – this view is not only incorrect, but dangerous. If accepted as truth, it will encourage climate fatalism.

In reality, we’re living through the fastest energy transformation in human history. Every previous large-scale shift in energy – from muscle power to wood to coal to oil – has taken decades or even longer. But the “renewable revolution” is happening far faster.

It’s only in the past ten years that renewables have become cheap and reliable, and only in the past five that energy storage has become cheap and widely available. Solar farms, wind turbines and grid-scale storage can be built remarkably quickly. Net-zero cities are becoming possible. The iron laws of economics have kicked in. These cheap forms of electricity generation are already displacing more and more fossil fuels.

Slow growth off a small base

You might have seen graphs showing how much power comes from renewables, fossil fuels and other energy sources. When shown over a longer timeframe, the explosive but very recent growth of renewables is compressed into a tiny, apparently insignificant addition.
