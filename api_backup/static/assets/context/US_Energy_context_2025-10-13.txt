[TITLE]T1 Energy (T1) Valuation in Focus After Talon PV Solar Manufacturing Partnership Announcement:
[TEXT]
T1 Energy has taken a key step by investing in Talon PV LLC, acquiring a minority stake as both companies team up to develop advanced solar cell manufacturing in Texas. This move highlights ambitions to increase U.S. solar capacity and create local jobs.

See our latest analysis for T1 Energy.

T1 Energy’s bold solar partnership comes on the heels of explosive momentum in its shares, with a 7-day share price return of 43.87% and an extraordinary 256.86% total shareholder return over the past year. While recent events have clearly attracted attention, it is worth noting that long-term investors are still deep underwater compared to five years ago. However, short-term enthusiasm suggests a shift in sentiment as growth prospects catch the market’s eye.

If you’re eyeing what’s next in energy and renewables, this could be the perfect jump-off to discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership.

With all this excitement, the real question is whether T1 Energy is now trading below its true value, or if the market has already factored future growth and optimism into the current share price. Could there still be a buying opportunity, or is everything priced in?

Most Popular Narrative: 21% Overvalued

With T1 Energy's share price closing at $3.64, the consensus narrative suggests a fair value of $3.00. This points to a disconnect between current excitement and actual expectations for future earnings.

The expansion of U.S. electricity demand, driven by the AI infrastructure build-out, electrification of transportation, and onshoring of advanced manufacturing, positions T1 as a key provider of solar modules and storage solutions for a rapidly growing market. This supports sustained topline revenue growth.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious about the math behind this controversial value gap? The most popular narrative relies on explosive growth rates and ambitious margin targets to justify its outlook. Step inside to discover which headline assumptions could upend the story or confirm the hype.

Result: Fair Value of $3.00 (OVERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, any policy shift or failure to secure crucial project financing could quickly undermine T1 Energy’s ambitious growth expectations and current market optimism.

Find out about the key risks to this T1 Energy narrative.

Another View: Is There Real Value Hiding in the Multiples?

Looking beyond analyst forecasts, the market is also weighing T1 Energy using price-to-sales ratios. The company’s ratio of 3x is much higher than the industry average of 2.3x, suggesting investors are paying a premium right now. Interestingly, it's far lower than some peers’ 15.4x and a "fair ratio" estimate of 36.7x. This could signal either caution or missed opportunity. Could sentiment change, bringing T1’s valuation closer to these higher benchmarks, or does the current premium expose buyers to downside risk?

Does enCore Energy Corp. (EU) Make a Good Investment Amid a Renewed Interest in Nuclear?

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of uranium resource properties in the United States.

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) extracted 203,798 pounds of uranium in the second quarter of 2025, up by a significant 79% from Q1. These numbers are expected to pump after the company announced the acquisition of a 5,900 acre parcel of private land located immediately adjacent to its Alta Mesa uranium project in Texas.

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) also received a significant boost recently after it was reported that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has dismissed a review petition against permits for its Dewey Burdock uranium project. enCore said the project remains on a federal fast-track permitting program.

Following a resurgence of the American nuclear energy sector under the Trump administration and the recent increase in the price of uranium, the stock of enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) has surged by more than 180% over the last six months.

While we acknowledge the potential of EU as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]China and Iran Seal Oil-for-Infrastructure Deal to Bypass U.S. Sanctions:
[TEXT]
China has formalized a barter-style framework with Iran in which crude oil is exchanged for infrastructure projects (from rail lines and ports to industrial works) rather than cash. The volumes involved are substantial: Beijing already imports an estimated 1.4 to 1.6 million barrels per day of Iranian crude, much of it under disguised labels. The new structure secures long-term supply while insulating both sides from dollar clearing and direct sanctions exposure. This arrangement does not fall outside U.S. sanctions law. It remains a purchase of Iranian crude under Executive Order 13846, regardless of how payment is made. Whether settled in goods, services, or construction contracts, it qualifies as a “significant transaction” for Iranian petroleum, leaving traders, contractors, and shipping firms exposed to secondary sanctions. Chinese contractors can take crude as compensation for project work, while settlement occurs through non-dollar channels or deferred credits. The oil moves through opaque intermediaries and reflagged tankers before reaching Chinese ports.

Politics, Geopolitics & Conflict

China has formalized a barter-style framework with Iran in which crude oil is exchanged for infrastructure projects (from rail lines and ports to industrial works) rather than cash. The volumes involved are substantial: Beijing already imports an estimated 1.4 to 1.6 million barrels per day of Iranian crude, much of it under disguised labels. The new structure secures long-term supply while insulating both sides from dollar clearing and direct sanctions exposure. This arrangement does not fall outside U.S. sanctions law. It remains a purchase of Iranian crude under Executive Order 13846, regardless of how payment is made. Whether settled in goods, services, or construction contracts, it qualifies as a “significant transaction” for Iranian petroleum, leaving traders, contractors, and shipping firms exposed to secondary sanctions. Chinese contractors can take crude as compensation for project work, while settlement occurs through non-dollar channels or deferred credits. The oil moves through opaque intermediaries and reflagged tankers before reaching Chinese ports. The infrastructure offset simply adds another layer of deniability, keeping large state banks and insurers insulated from direct exposure. Washington has not shut this one down for practical reasons. Enforcement would require targeting dozens of Chinese intermediaries, logistics providers, and financial conduits that also serve legitimate trade. Doing so would risk disrupting China’s broader supply networks and provoke retaliation across unrelated sectors. U.S. policymakers appear to tolerate limited Iranian oil flows to China as a pressure valve, stabilizing Tehran’s finances just enough to prevent collapse, but not enough to embolden it regionally.

Russia’s move to revoke its 2010 plutonium disposal accord with Washington is more political signaling than substantive escalation. The agreement was meant to eliminate 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium per side, but it has already been suspended since 2016, when Moscow accused the U.S. of failing to fulfill its part after changing the disposal method. What’s new is the formal withdrawal process, which adds drama to the timing. It comes days after fresh U.S. sanctions and amid Trump’s renewed hard line on nuclear rearmament. The Kremlin wants to underline that any arms-control architecture surviving from the Obama era is now defunct and that nuclear leverage, not dialogue, defines parity. In practical terms, the plutonium stockpiles are already outside active use and under IAEA observation, so no material risk shift occurs. But symbolically, it reinforces that Moscow is preparing for a post-New START landscape where nuclear signaling again becomes a bargaining tool, not a stabilizer.

Russia launched one of its largest combined missile and drone barrages in months overnight, striking residential areas and several power generation sites across central and western Ukraine, including in the Lviv, Vinnytsia, and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Kyiv said more than 80 incoming targets were detected, of which roughly two-thirds were intercepted. The attacks appear aimed at stressing Ukraine’s power grid ahead of winter, echoing last year’s campaign that left millions without heat or light for weeks. Independent analysis this week from The Moscow Times questioned claims that Ukrainian strikes have destroyed 38% of Russia’s oil refining capacity, suggesting that while dozens of refineries have been hit since early 2024, only a fraction remain offline for extended periods. Many plants sustained limited damage, with Russia restoring throughput faster than initially assumed, often within days or weeks. The cumulative impact, though real, is far smaller than Kyiv’s portrayal and has not significantly altered Russian fuel export volumes or internal supply so far. The deeper concern for Moscow is the geographic spread of these attacks, which show Kyiv’s drones can now reach nearly any refining region in European Russia, including the Volga basin and Leningrad oblast.

Washington has sanctioned several Indian firms and executives tied to Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade. The U.S. Treasury said the companies shipped Iranian origin products through intermediaries in the Gulf and East Asia, masking cargoes as regional blends. Indian refiners officially halted direct Iranian imports years ago, but secondary trading and blending networks have continued.

Staying on the sanctions beat, it’s been a busy week. Washington has sanctioned more than 50 people, entities, and vessels accused of helping move Iranian oil and liquefied petroleum gas. The new designations include nearly two dozen shipping vessels, a China-based crude terminal, and a smaller independent refinery accused of handling hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian LPG through disguised intermediaries. This hits not only Iranian front companies but also parts of the Chinese gray market that have been quietly absorbing sanctioned cargoes for reprocessing and reexport.

[TITLE]Stopping imports of Russian oil will be key to trade deal with US, says trade policy expert:
[TEXT]
The US-India tariffs standoff may end only if either India stops buying Russian oil or the US Courts strike down the levy, Ajay Srivastava, Founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), said here on Thursday.

The discount levels in prices of Russian oil, which existed earlier for India, are not prevalent now and hence Indian purchase of Russian oil may soon come to an end, he anticipated. However, he added that with America being a net importer of crude oil, they cannot supply to the world. “They are going to create a massive energy crisis,” he said.

Srivastava was speaking at the 14th J V Somayajulu Memorial Lecture organised by The Andhra Chamber of Commerce in Chennai. The event was organised to honour the legacy of an economist and stockbroker J V Somayajulu, Past President of the Chamber.

With September set to be the first full month with 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports, Srivastava expects the month’s exports to be down by a large margin. In sectors like garments, companies supplying to high-end retailers are managing the situation by some internal adjustments such as supplying to other markets, but these short-term measures will not last long, he predicts, calling it a blow for Indian exporters.

If the tariffs continue, globally trade will grow as the US buys from other countries, but it is a problem for India, he noted. “Domestic consumption is doing well in India, and we must focus on improving our production quality,” he added.

Srivastava shed light on the emerging trade blocs, recalibration of supply chains, and a few implications of shifting global alliances. He emphasised the need for proactive policy reform, greater trade facilitation, and strategic global engagement by Indian businesses.

S Narasimhan, Vice-President, Andhra Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the gathering and highlighted the importance of equipping Indian businesses with thought leadership on global economic trends.

Related news: Developing bamboo road map for sustainable industry in future

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia’s Coordinating Ministry for Infrastructure and Regional Development said the use of bamboo as the central theme of the 2025 Indonesia International Sustainability Forum (ISF) represents a strong symbol of sustainability.“We chose bamboo because it is a fast-growing plant with a low carbon footprint and multiple functions,” Deputy for Basic Infrastructure Rachmat Kaimuddin said in a statement on Sunday.He said bamboo’s qualities reflect ISF 2025’s core philosophy of growth, resilience, and sustainability. Through this symbolism, ISF urges all stakeholders to move beyond discussion and take collective action to bring real change for the planet and future generations.“We hope Indonesia and the world can grow rapidly, resiliently, and sustainably,” Kaimuddin said.As a natural material that flourishes across Indonesia, bamboo grows quickly without harming the soil, embodying sustainability. Its strength and flexibility also symbolize resilience — the ability to endure and adapt under pressure.The bamboo theme, he said, was not merely aesthetic but represented the forum’s values of sustainability and resilience.With the theme “Investing in a Resilient, Sustainable, and Prosperous World,” ISF 2025 underscores Indonesia’s commitment to sustainable, innovative, and collaborative development.The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) hosted ISF 2025 on Oct. 10–11 at the Jakarta International Convention Center.According to Kadin, the forum aims to strengthen Indonesia’s position as a sustainable investment hub in Asia and globally by connecting investors with green and blue projects and promoting multi-stakeholder collaboration in the low-carbon economy.

[TITLE]‘No trade-off’ between sustainability and growth, India can grow by 7.5-8%: Nicholas Stern:
[TEXT]
There is no trade-off between economic growth and moving to renewable sources of energy and India can even increase its GDP growth rate to 7.5-8 per cent from 6.5 per cent currently by aggressively investing in its green transition, according to NICHOLAS STERN, the IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government at the London School of Economics.

“…you still get that residual argument that somehow a developing nation will have to choose between sustainability and climate on the one hand and growth in incomes on the other. That’s absolutely wrong…and it’s very important we are very clear that there is no trade-off,” he said in an interview with The Indian Express. Stern also said the path India takes to becoming a developed economy by 2047 will be crucial for the world and that it needs to increase its investment-to-GDP ratio by 5 percentage points, remove impediments to investment, get the incentives right to invest in modern technologies – particularly green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Edited excerpts:

US President Donald Trump’s focus has been on tariff policies. But he is also undoing years of progress made in the renewables sector. Is that more dangerous than the chaos the trade disruptions are causing?

Trump has been disruptive in a number of directions. One, of course, is the tariffs and the structure of world trade. Another is health, where he’s taking the US away from the World Health Organization (WHO) and attacking vaccinations. On security, he is backing off from the defence of Europe. Aid has been dismantled.

Story continues below this ad

One important way forward for the rest of the world is to stay united on these issues. If the US is undermining WTO, which it is, then try to find trade agreements between nations which look quite similar. I think it would be very good if the EU trade agreement (with India) – which I think is coming – looks like the one with the UK. I hope there’ll be more trade agreements with Asia. The more they look similar, the more we’re sustaining the idea that trade should be symmetric and with minimal barriers because we all benefit from that.

In many ways, climate is similar (to health and trade) – we have the international fora where we can find agreements and carry on. At the same time, the cost of solar and batteries has fallen dramatically. If we compare with 1975, it’s not that it has fallen by a factor of 100 – it’s fallen by a factor close to 1,000, which is extraordinary. It is unambiguously the cheapest form of electricity generation.

On the climate side, the forces of change are strong. But we are going nowhere near fast enough. We are probably heading, given current policies, to something like 2.5-3°C (rise in temperatures); we’re already at

Mars has signed its first renewable energy acceleration contract in Europe in partnership with GoldenPeaks Capital, as it looks to reinforce its commitment to renewable electricity.

According to the multinational confectionary company, it has partnered with the European renewable energy developer to launch more than 100 new solar projects in Poland.

The new project is set to come online in 2027 and will provide more than 129 megawatts of clean energy to Mars and produce approximately 222 gigawatt hours annually, which Mars claims is enough to power approximately 100,000 households each year.

The collaboration builds on the existing renewable energy commitments from the two companies.

In Mars’ latest 2024 sustainability report, the company said it delivered a 16.4% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2015, while 58% of the electricity it sourced is renewable.

Mars aims to reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050.

[TITLE]Apollo Funds to Acquire Eagle Creek Renewable Energy, One of the Largest U.S. Hydroelectric Power Platforms:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Oct. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced that Apollo-managed funds (the "Apollo Funds") have agreed to acquire Eagle Creek Renewable Energy ("Eagle Creek" or the "Company"), a leading independent owner and operator of hydroelectric facilities across the U.S. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Eagle Creek owns and operates 85 hydroelectric facilities across 18 states, providing renewable power to support rapidly growing energy demand from data center infrastructure and the Industrial Renaissance in the U.S. Hydropower is differentiated as a low carbon reliable energy source with baseload capabilities. The Company’s nearly 700 MW portfolio makes it one of the largest and most diversified independent hydro platforms in the country, and its facilities produce enough electricity to power over 260,000 homes.

“The Eagle Creek team have built one of the leading independent hydro portfolios in the U.S., with a strong safety and performance track record and a diversified footprint,” said Joseph Romeo, Partner at Apollo. “We see significant opportunity to support the business in its next phase—further expanding the platform and providing reliable, clean power generation to meet the growth in demand.

[TITLE]Digital Utilities Ventures Completes Acquisition and Name Change:
[TEXT]
MANKATO, Minn., Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. (OTC: DUTV), operating as Easy Environmental Solutions, has received notice that the processing of its corporate action by FINRA has been completed. As a result, the Company finalizes its acquisition of Lifestyle Dock Company, LLC, its name will be changed, its reverse stock split will be completed and in 20 days its trading symbol will be changed to EZES. This represents another significant milestone in the Company’s transformation into a leading developer of modular technologies that solve major world problems.

Now, the Company will officially complete its name change to Easy Environmental Solutions, Inc., a name that reflects its expanding focus on sustainable technologies. The Company is expected to begin trading under its new ticker symbol, EZES, at the opening of trading on October 30, 2025. The Company plans to apply to uplist to the OTCQB Venture Market following the completion of an audit, currently underway, and the Company’s previously announced reverse stock split, a procedural step designed to align with OTCQB eligibility requirements and strengthen the Company’s overall capital markets profile.

The acquisition of Lifestyle Dock Company is also now finalized following the completion of FINRA’s process. Lifestyle is a premium manufacturer of luxury docks with a strong distribution network and East Coast manufacturing facility. The acquisition expands Easy Environmental Solutions’ product portfolio, adds a strategically located production base, and creates new opportunities to integrate its patented NanoVoid™ clean-water technology directly into high-end docks and marina systems. Lifestyle’s revenues will be consolidated into the company’s financial statements beginning with the next reporting period.

“The finalization of this process is further confirmation of the momentum we’ve been building across our operations,” said Mark Gaalswyk, CEO of Easy Environmental Solutions. “With Lifestyle now officially part of our organization, we’re expanding our manufacturing capacity and opening new markets for NanoVoid. At the same time, our global EasyFEN™ projects are advancing with signed contracts and deposits in place. These combined steps position us for the next phase of growth as we build a stronger, more globally connected company.”

Easy Environmental Solutions continues to advance commercialization of its NanoVoid™ and EasyFEN™ systems, technologies designed for recurring revenue and scalable deployment across global markets in water treatment, consumer food waste to microbial fertilizer systems, and sustainable agriculture.
