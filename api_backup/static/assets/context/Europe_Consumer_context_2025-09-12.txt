[TITLE]EU Leader Calls to Sanction Israel as U.S. Progressives Push to End Arms Sales:
[TEXT]
The president of the European Union Commission called for sanctions and a partial trade suspension against Israel on Wednesday, as international outrage grew over the country’s strikes on Qatar and Yemen and its ongoing starvation of the Palestinian people in Gaza.

“What is happening in Gaza has shaken the conscience of the world,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at her annual State of the Union address in Strasbourg, France. “People killed while begging for food. Mothers holding lifeless babies. These images are simply catastrophic.”

Von der Leyen’s proposed sanctions signaled a possible shift in the West’s relationship with its decadeslong ally. She said the commission, which operates as the executive branch of the European Union and can take limited unilateral actions, would end its bilateral support of Israel and suspend funding for projects within Israel, with exceptions for work with Israeli civil society and Israel’s Holocaust remembrance center. But more dramatic actions — like sanctioning Israeli ministers and partially suspending the EU’s trade agreement with Israel — would require potentially difficult votes from EU member states.

In the United States, meanwhile, the chorus of progressive voices calling for an end to the country’s complicity in the ongoing genocide escalated — but remains stymied by the status quo in Washington.

Gathered in the pouring rain on Wednesday morning, progressive Democrats in Congress joined activists including the freed Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil and the actors Cynthia Nixon and Morgan Spector to urge Congress to pass the Block the Bombs Act. The legislation would block the United States from sending some U.S.-made weapons to Israel.

“Netanyahu is using U.S.-supplied weapons to perpetrate this campaign of starvation, displacement, and death in violation of U.S. and international humanitarian law,” said Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., who introduced the Block the Bombs Act in the House.

The legislation now boasts 45 co-sponsors, including several Democrats who’ve received funding from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in recent election cycles.

Even with the growing support for ending the U.S. shipment of certain types of weapons to Israel among Democrats, passing the Block the Bombs Act in either chamber is an uphill battle. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have remained steadfast in their support of supplying weapons to Israel.

No Republicans have signed on to co-sponsor the Block the Bombs Act in the House. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced similar legislation in the Senate, but despite gaining some momentum among Democrats, it has not been able to garner enough support to pass.

Dramatic penalties against Israel have similarly gained vocal support in the EU but still struggle to gain final approval. Von der Leyen’s proposals to sanction “extremist ministers” and “violent settlers” and partially suspend the EU’s trade agreement with Israel likely faces long odds, as less ambitious proposals to sanction Israel have stymied — leaving the fate of these two proposals unclear — even as some European nations have condemned Israel for its actions in Gaza and Qatar.

But in the U.S. and EU alike, critics of Israel’s genocide highlighted the moral imperative of action despite political opposition.

“Man-made famine can never be a weapon of war. For the sake of the children, for the sake of humanity, this must stop,” von der Leyen said Wednesday in Strasbourg.

Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., made similar comments in Washington.

“Our humanity is at stake here,” she said. “Vengeance and greed cannot be the United States’ policy doctrine. No country can bomb their way to peace. Starving a child is violent. The children are all of ours, always. History has its eyes on us. Our children will ask what we did in this moment. And the only acceptable answer is everything we could.”

Khalil, an Algerian Palestinian activist who was detained by the Trump administration for his advocacy against Israel’s genocide at Columbia University, said he’d braved a trip to the seat of the federal government to fight for his people.

“The U.S. government has sent over $30 billion worth of weapons and equipment to the Israeli occupation power over the past two years,” Khalil said. “These weapons and equipment are being used by Israel to kill Palestinians to carry out mass atrocity after another mass atrocity against my people. There is one clear and obvious way for Congress to act and save lives. They should stop all weapons, all weapons. Stop sending all weapons to Israel.”

[TITLE]Europe’s Delusions Over What It Means to Deter Russia:
[TEXT]
In reality, Singapore was no impregnable fortress . As the Japanese launched their final assault, Churchill sent desperate orders : “There must at this stage be no thought of saving the troops or sparing the population. … Commanders and senior officers should die with their troops. The honour of the British Empire and of the British Army is at stake.” Yet no amount of exhortation could compensate for the strategic failures that had made defeat inevitable long before the first shots of World War II were fired.

In December 1941, as Japanese bombers and landing ships converged on Singapore, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill still clung to the belief that the British territory and naval base remained impregnable—“our boasted fortress,” as the British commander responsible for its defense called it . Its surrender was, in Churchill’s devastating assessment , the “worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history,” the defeat leaving a “scar on his mind,” his physician later said.

As the Japanese launched their final assault, Churchill sent desperate orders: “There must at this stage be no thought of saving the troops or sparing the population. … Commanders and senior officers should die with their troops. The honour of the British Empire and of the British Army is at stake.” Yet no amount of exhortation could compensate for the strategic failures that had made defeat inevitable long before the first shots of World War II were fired.

Today, as European leaders craft their response to Russian aggression in Ukraine—and as NATO holds emergency Article 4 talks after Russia’s overnight drone attack on Poland—they risk repeating the same fundamental error that doomed Singapore: substituting tactical gestures for strategic clarity and allowing political convenience to drive what should be comprehensive strategic imperatives. The parallels are sobering, revealing how self-deception creates a predictable cascade toward military disaster.

Singapore’s destruction emerged from Britain’s grand strategic delusion in the Far East—the fantasy that naval supremacy could substitute for territorial defense, rooted in the imperial strategy of the 1920s that treated Singapore Naval Base as the cornerstone of Far Eastern defense. British planners envisioned a war with Japan unfolding in three neat phases: Singapore’s garrison would hold the supposed fortress while the British Main Fleet sailed from Europe to defeat the Japanese in a decisive naval battle and subsequently blockade Japan’s home islands. By 1937, according to naval historian Stephen Roskill , “the concept of the ‘Main Fleet to Singapore’ had, perhaps through constant repetition, assumed something of the inviolability of Holy Writ.” This strategic framework completely disregarded the changing character of naval warfare, the rise of air power, and the impossibility of defending a land-based fortress solely through sea-based operations.

Europe’s current approach to Ukraine follows a similar self-delusion. The continent’s leaders have embraced what amounts to a strategy of limited steps —providing enough support to prevent Ukraine’s collapse while avoiding commitments that might require genuine strategic sacrifice and risks. Yet there exists no coherent theory of success defining what Europe actually wants to achieve in Ukraine, other than avoiding direct military engagement with Russia and ending the conflict through some kind of negotiated settlement. This is risk management rather than grand strategy—the Europeans only define what they want to avoid rather than what they seek to accomplish. This approach offers no path toward a sustainable outcome and no metrics for measuring success beyond termination of the current conflict.

This absence of strategic clarity reflects a deeper problem: Europe has not reached a consensus on whether keeping Ukraine independent is worth the risk of a direct military confrontation with Russia. De facto, Ukraine already constitutes part of European security—Russian missiles striking Ukrainian infrastructure directly threatens European energy networks, Ukrainian grain exports affect European food security, and Ukrainian territorial integrity determines the credibility of European deterrence. Were Ukraine to fall, Europe could face consequences that extend far beyond humanitarian concerns: NATO confronting strengthened Russian forces at the Polish and Romanian borders, millions of additional refugees fleeing a collapsed Ukrainian state, and an ongoing insurgency inside Ukraine.

But it doesn’t require a Russian victory to create a dangerous situation: Western fatigue and Ukrainian disillusionment could drive Kyiv toward accommodation with Moscow. Either way, Ukraine in the Russian orbit would provide the Kremlin with battle-hardened Ukrainian soldiers for future conflicts and control over Ukraine’s ramped-up defense industry, massively altering the balance of power in Europe. But this reality has not been communicated to European voters, creating a dangerous gap between political decision-makers and their constituents.

European leaders’ strategic avoidance becomes particularly perilous with a French presidential election scheduled for 2027, Italy’s support for Ukraine steadily waning amid domestic economic pressures, Germany’s governing coalition proving brittle ahead of federal elections, and far-right and far-left parties ascending across the continent.

[TITLE]Zara owner Inditex reports better start to autumn sales, boosting shares:
[TEXT]
By Helen Reid

LONDON (Reuters) -Zara owner Inditex reported a better start to its autumn sales on Wednesday, an encouraging sign as the world's biggest listed fast-fashion retailer grapples with the impact of a weak dollar and U.S. tariffs on consumer spending.

Sales from August 1 to September 8 grew 9% in currency-adjusted terms compared to a year ago, picking up in pace from 5.1% growth over the first half. Shares in Inditex, which have fallen this year, gained 6% in early trading.

The start to the third quarter was an improvement after sales for the second quarter ended July 31 came in at 10.08 billion euros ($11.81 billion), below the 10.26 billion euros expected by analysts, according to an LSEG estimate.

A weaker U.S. dollar was partly to blame, as Inditex said currency changes would erode sales by 4% in 2025, more than the 3% impact it previously expected. A weaker dollar means sales in the U.S. - Inditex's second-biggest market by revenue after Spain - are worth less in euro terms.

"Even without the currency impact, sales growth was slightly worse than we were expecting," said Sara Herrando Deprit, analyst at Kutxabank Investment.

However, she added, "the second half of the year is the important one for Inditex, so it's a good sign that sales growth starts to be a bit stronger."

CEO Oscar Garcia Maceiras said the first-half performance was solid in a "complex market environment."

Sales growth is improving over the course of the year, Garcia Maceiras told analysts on a call, adding that the results "demonstrate the strength of the model."

UNCERTAIN CONSUMER ENVIRONMENT

Primark on Wednesday said it expects the consumer environment to remain uncertain, underscoring the challenge for clothing retailers to convince shoppers to spend.

Despite the currency impact, Inditex maintained its gross margin for the first half at 58.3% - the same level as last year - on a gross profit of 10.7 billion euros.

"A largely unchanged gross margin underscores the group's ability to trade through a tricky spring/summer season across Europe," Jefferies analysts said in a note.

U.S. President Donald Trump has hiked tariffs on imports from a swathe of major trading partners, driving many clothing and sneaker retailers who source from factories in Asia to hike U.S. prices as they try to offset higher costs.

Shares in Inditex have declined since the start of this year as investors adjust to a deceleration after four years of double-digit annual sales growth.

The slowing in sales growth has prompted questions about the strength of demand for Zara clothing, and the extent to which it would be able to raise prices in the U.S. to protect its margins.

[TITLE]Adidas Teams Up With Audi Formula 1 Team for New Apparel Partnership:
[TEXT]
Adidas has revealed its Formula 1 apparel team partnership with the Audi team. The multiyear contract, unveiled Thursday, will start in 2026 and coincides with the team’s official entry into the motorsport category.

The Audi F1 project has been in the works since 2022, when it announced it would enter as an engine manufacturer. The team currently races under the Stake F1 Kick Sauber name until the end of the year, where it will then transition over to the Audi F1 team. Audi also signed a multiyear deal with Revolut at the end of July to be its title sponsor.

The apparel partnership will encompass the two brands, which share German heritage, developing tailored high-performance-oriented equipment for Audi’s drivers, Nico Hülkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto, engineers, mechanics and other team personnel. The team said the goal is to have “functional products” outfitted to help them reach “peak output” on the track.

An Audi Formula 1 team x Adidas collection is also expected to launch ahead of the 2026 season in February. Audi said the collaboration will combine “stylish designs” with “cutting-edge tech” from Adidas and encompass apparel, footwear and accessories lines that will be available globally ahead of the first race.

This is the second apparel partnership Adidas has inked — the first being Mercedes, which signed a deal this year with the German company after it parted ways with Tommy Hilfiger.

In an interview with Footwear News, Michael Batz, global vice president of Adidas Motorsports, said that Audi is the perfect partner for Adidas as the two brands share the same values of performance, innovation and putting athletes and fans at its core.

“Our partnership with the future Audi F1 team allows us to engage deeply with the F1 ecosystem, from technical team apparel to fan collections,” explained Batz. “With Liberty Media driving new audiences in the sport, including younger and more diverse fans, we have the opportunity to connect with emerging consumer groups and inspire them through authentic storytelling. This approach strengthens our presence in motorsport and helps introduce new audiences to both Adidas and F1.”

Batz said that the partnership continues Adidas’ mission to “maximize top sports credibility” by connecting both sport and culture. One example of this is Adidas Originals joining forces with the Mercedes team and Bad Bunny to take to the streets of San Juan, Puerto Rico, with a demo car run by Esteban Gutiérrez on Aug. 2.

“Motorsport, especially Formula 1, allows us to extend our footprint into a high-performance on the global stage,” continued Batz. “Together with Audi, we are partnering to create authentic, performance-driven products and experiences that resonate with fans and athletes worldwide, reinforcing the global relevance of both brands.”

Jonathan Wheatley, team principal of Sauber and future team principal for Audi, told FN that the deal allows Adidas to be part of Audi’s team growth from the start and connect with a new wave of fans. Moreover, he emphasized the deal as a partnership — not a sponsorship — stating that it goes far beyond the sporting goods manufacturer simply putting its name on the car. And from a brand perspective, the two said they will gain from each other mutual brand appeal and cultural relevance.

“Adidas has transcended sport to become a global cultural institution, deeply embedded in music, fashion and street culture,” said Wheatley. “This is the cultural resonance we aim to build for the future Audi F1 Team. This is a partnership of two global icons built on a shared DNA of performance, innovation and design. It’s a strategic alliance for mutual growth. For us, it provides a direct line to Adidas’ massive global audience in fashion and culture. It’s a union of the four rings and the three stripes — a perfect synergy as we build a team to compete at the highest level of motorsport.”

Wheatley said the decision to announce the move well ahead of the 2026 season is a declaration of its long-term intent — especially as the Audi F1 team continues to build its brand identity from the ground up, Adidas will be one of its co-creators. Moreover, the ultimate goal for Audi is to build a “cultural icon” brand that resonates far beyond the racetrack.

Wheatley said the two companies are looking to create a larger narrative around the brands to extend beyond the “bubble” of motorsports; Audi wants to become synonymous with being a progressive and performance-led lifestyle brand.

“Together with Audi, we are partnering to create authentic, performance-driven products and experiences that resonate with fans and athletes worldwide, reinforcing the global relevance of both brands. This collaboration strengthens the credibility of both brands, offering fans a connection to the sport that is both authentic and aspirational — while creating unique, culturally relevant stories that only Adidas and Audi together can tell,” concluded Batz.

[TEXT]
MILAN — Kering’s new course continues to take shape.

A day after the luxury group’s combined general meeting and the first public appearance of chief executive officer Luca De Meo, the French company and Mayhoola jointly announced that the current ownership structure of the Valentino house will not change before 2028 at the earliest.

This represents an amendment to their shareholders’ agreement, inked at the time of Kering’s acquisition of a stake in Valentino in 2023.

Two years ago, Kering bought a 30 percent stake in Valentino for 1.7 billion euros in cash as part of a broader strategic partnership with the Qatari investment fund.

Following the new agreement, Mayhoola’s put options on Kering exercisable in 2026 and 2027 for its remaining 70 percent stake in Valentino are now postponed to 2028 and 2029, respectively. Kering’s call option to acquire Mayhoola’s stake in 2028 is also deferred to 2029.

“Kering and Mayhoola confirm their strategic partnership to support the development of the iconic Italian luxury house and remain entirely committed to its long-term success,” the two companies said jointly on Wednesday.

According to Bernstein analyst Luca Solca, Kering will need up to 3.4 billion euros in cash to pay for the remaining 70 percent. The postponement allows Kering to put off extra debt. According to the bank, Kering’s net debt rose from 200 million euros in 2021 to
