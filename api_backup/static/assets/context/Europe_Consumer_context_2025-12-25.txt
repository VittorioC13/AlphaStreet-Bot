[TITLE]Facing Backlash and FTC Probe, Instacart Ends Pricing Experiments In Wake of Groundwork Report:
[TEXT]
"Churches have suspended all celebrations outside their walls because of the conditions Gaza is going through," Youssef Tarazi, a 31-year-old Palestinian Christian, told MEE. "We are marking the birth of Jesus Christ through prayer inside the church only, but our joy remains incomplete."

"This year, we cannot celebrate while we are still grieving for those killed, including during attacks on churches," Tarazi said. "Nothing feels the same anymore. Many members of our community will not be with us this Christmas."

The IDF, Israeli officials, and leaders in the US and other countries that have backed Israel's assault on Gaza have insisted the military has targeted Hamas and its infrastructure, but Christian churches are among the places—along with schools, refugee camps, hospitals, and other civilian buildings—that have been attacked since 2023.

At least 16 people were killed just days into the war when the IDF struck the Church of Saint Porphyrius, one of the oldest churches in the world. In July, Israel attacked the only Catholic church in Gaza, killing two women and injuring several other people.

Palestinian officials say at least 44 Christians are among more than 71,000 Palestinians who have been killed since Israel began its assault in retaliation for a Hamas-led attack. Some have been killed in airstrikes and sniper attacks while others are among those who have died of illnesses and malnutrition as Israel has enforced a blockade that continues to limit food and medical supplies that are allowed into Gaza.

United Nations experts, international and Israeli human rights groups, and Holocaust experts are among those who have called Israel's assault a genocide, and the International Criminal Court issued a warrant last year for the arrest of Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

George Anton, the director of operations for the Latin patriarchate in Gaza, estimated that the number of Christians killed so far is at least 53, with many dying "because we could not reach hospitals or provide medicine, especially elderly people with chronic illnesses."

In the past, Muslims in Gaza have joined Christian neighbors for the annual lighting of Gaza City's Christmas tree and other festivities, and churches have displayed elaborate lights and decorations in their courtyards for the Christmas season.

"We decorated our homes," Anton told MEE. "Now, many homes are gone. We decorated the streets. Even the streets are gone... There is nothing to celebrate."

"We cannot celebrate while Christians and Muslims alike are mourning devastating losses caused by the war," he added. "For us, the war has not ended."

Hilda Ayad, a volunteer who helped decorate Holy Family Church earlier this month, told Al Jazeera that "we don't have the opportunity to do all the things here in the church, but something better than last year because last year, we didn't celebrate."

“We are trying to be happy from inside.”

[TITLE]Can-Fite Announces Reverse Split of its Ordinary Shares and ADS Ratio Change:
[TEXT]
RAMAT GAN, Israel, Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. (NYSE American: CANF) (TASE: CANF), a biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of proprietary small-molecule drugs targeting oncological and inflammatory diseases, announced today that following the approval of its shareholders on November 10, 2025, its Board of Directors has approved a 1-for-3,000 reverse split of the Company’s ordinary shares. The reverse split will be recorded with the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange on January 2, 2026 and on January 4, 2026, the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange will be closed. The first trading date for the newly consolidated ordinary shares on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange will be January 5, 2026.

The reverse split will result in each outstanding three thousand pre-split ordinary shares automatically combining into one new ordinary share, no par value, without any further action on the part of the shareholders. Concurrently with the reverse split, the Company will effect a corresponding change in the ratio of ordinary shares underlying each of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs), such that its ratio of ADSs to ordinary shares will change from one (1) ADS representing three hundred (300) ordinary shares to a new ratio of one (1) ADS representing two (2) ordinary shares and no adjustment will be made to the outstanding number of the ADSs of the Company. The ratio change will be effective on the NYSE American on January 5, 2026.

For ADS holders, the ratio change will have the same effect as a one-for-twenty ADS split. On the effective date, each ADS holder will be required to exchange every twenty (20) ADSs then held for one (1) new ADS. The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary bank, will arrange for the exchange of the current ADSs for the new ones. The Company’s ADSs will continue to trade on the NYSE American under the symbol “CANF” with a new CUSIP Number 13471N409.

The total number of outstanding ordinary shares will be reduced on the effective date at a ratio of three thousand-for-one. The Company’s authorized number of ordinary shares will also be proportionately decreased from 42,000,000,000 to 14,000,000 ordinary shares, no par value, each as a result of the reverse split. No fractional ordinary shares will be issued as a result of the reverse split as any fractional ordinary shares resulting from the reverse split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share on a per shareholder basis.

The reverse split and ADS ratio change will not impact any shareholder’s percentage ownership of the Company or voting power, except for minimal effects resulting from the treatment of fractional shares.

No fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the change in the ADS ratio. Instead, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees, taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank.

As a result of the change in the ADS ratio, the ADS price is expected to increase proportionally, although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS price after the change in the ADS ratio will be equal to or greater than twenty times the ADS price before the change.

[TITLE]SeaStar Medical Announces 1-for-10 Reverse Split:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SeaStar Medical Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: ICU), a commercial-stage healthcare company focused on transforming treatments for critically ill patients facing organ failure and potential loss of life, announced today the Company’s 1-for-10 reverse stock split (Reverse Split), which will become effective as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on January 5, 2026. The Company’s common stock will begin trading on a post-split adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) effective with the open of the market on January 5, 2026. SeaStar Medical’s stock will continue to trade under the ticker symbol “ICU.”

Authorization for the Reverse Split was approved by the Company’s stockholders at SeaStar Medical’s 2025 Special Meeting of Stockholders held on December 18, 2025. The objective of the Reverse Split is to increase the market price for the Company’s common stock to, among things, enable the Company to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement under applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Company's common stock will trade under a new CUSIP number – 81256L302.

As a result of the Reverse Split, each 10 pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically combine and convert to 1 issued and outstanding share of common stock. Stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares will receive one whole share of common stock in lieu of such fractional share. The Reverse Split reduces the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise or vesting of its outstanding stock options and certain warrants in proportion to the ratio of the Reverse Split and causes a proportionate increase in the exercise prices of such stock options and warrants.

Stockholders of record will receive information regarding their share ownership following the reverse stock split from the Company’s transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company. Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company can be reached at 800-509-8856. Stockholders owning shares via a bank, broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split and will not be required to take further action in connection with the Reverse Split, subject to brokers’ particular processes.

For additional information regarding the Reverse Split, please refer to SeaStar Medical’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 18, 2025.

[TITLE]India’s booming fashion industry is a climate nightmare that demands clean-up action right away:
[TEXT]
India’s fashion story need not become a climate disaster because the country still has an advantage that Europe and North America lost decades ago. Our apparel market and industrial base are still being built and consumer habits are not yet fully entrenched. Industrial clusters are not locked into high-carbon infrastructure. We could embed climate discipline into this phase of growth rather than trying to retrofit it later at vastly higher cost and against fiercer resistance.

[TITLE]How brands shifted marketing and media strategies through year of tariffs:
[TEXT]
The tariff policies imposed by U.S. President Trump at the beginning of his second term in office turned 2025 on its head for marketers.

Joshua Scherz was among them. Scherz is the founder of Bela, a family-owned seafood brand based in Maine that imports canned sardines from Portugal. Hoping to take advantage of rising demand for premium canned seafood among U.S. consumers, Bela rebranded and launched a direct-to-consumer (DTC) business at the end of January — right into the teeth of President Trump’s trade war.

What should have been a celebratory year for the 28-year-old business proved to be one of its hardest. “We took a margin hit,” said Scherz. And Bela wasn’t the only one.

For Sam Piliero, CEO and founder of media agency The Moonlighters, it’s been a “whirlwind” of a year. The agency works with almost 100 brands, 80% of which are e-commerce businesses – many spending between $1 million-$10 million annually. During the choppiest period of Trump’s tariff maneuvers, Piliero estimated some clients cut back on media spending by 50% as they navigated higher costs on imported goods and the end of the de minimis shipping exemption.

“Some of the smaller businesses that weren’t prepared for this had to cut a lot of operational costs,” he said.

‘High degree of uncertainty’

Though the political drama around tariffs quieted down in the second half of the year, their economic impact will be felt for months to come. The IMF, for example, predicted nominal GDP growth will fall from 9.1% in 2024 to 6.8% in 2026. Though many businesses absorbed the additional cost, many more chose to increase consumer prices, leading to loss of real income for the average American household of $1,257, according to Yale University’s Budget Lab.

And although the ad market remained stronger than most expected — WPP recently upgraded its 2025 ad revenue growth projections from 7.7% in 2024, to 8.8% — businesses large and small were forced to devote time and money to navigate the shifting regulatory maze.

“There were shipments that we lost money on because we didn’t want to upset our retailers,” recalled Bogg Bag founder and CEO Kim Vaccarella. The company’s brightly colored bags, which are popular on social media platforms including TikTok, were all manufactured in China at the beginning of the year, putting the company on the hook for tariffs initially as high as 145%.

Though that figure has reduced, the firm no longer depends solely on Chinese suppliers. “By the end of December, we’ll have 50% [of our suppliers] in Vietnam,” said Vaccarella. “Unfortunately … there still isn’t a lot of certainty. But you still have to run the business.”

Target, already weathering one of the rockiest years in its history, has had to manage similar disruption on a much larger scale. In May, a 5.7% fall in sales was attributed to the introduction of tariffs. “The difficulty level has been incredibly high, given the magnitude of the rates we’re facing and a high degree of uncertainty,” CEO Brian Cornell told analysts that month.

‘We scaled back significantly’

In some cases, brands had to choose between media budgets or their price margins. Vaccarella said that Bogg Bag reduced its ad spending by 10%, as part of a wider cost-cutting push that enabled it to hold prices. “We scaled back on that [advertising] significantly in that period,” she said.

Within his agency’s roster, Piliero saw several clients move production out of China to countries with smaller tariffs, such as Brazil and Mexico, while two apparel clients stopped advertising altogether. More typically, those clients that had reduced their spending in the first half of the year ended up increasing investment just months later. Piliero told Digiday revenues and client accounts had both doubled in 2025. He didn’t provide financial specifics.

Not every brand choosing to absorb rising costs altered its advertising plans. Some cut back on free online returns, while others rethought their promotional calendar — and some international brands stepped back from the U.S. altogether (and some U.S. brands leant farther into overseas markets).

At Bela, which faced a 15% blanket tariff on goods from the European Union, Scherz decided not to raise prices and not to cut paid media investment. The brand originally planned on spending 15% of its sales on advertising, the bulk on Instagram and Facebook (Scherz didn’t provide a dollar amount).

But as well as additional costs, delays moving goods through ports during the spring led to stock shortages. “After 28 years, I pride myself on being in stock — even throughout the entire pandemic. This was a much more challenging year than the pandemic,” he said.

The shortages led Bela to focus promotional efforts on the products it had over the ones it couldn’t ship (in this case, piri-piri sardines over lemon sardines). As a result, Scherz’s team tilted the campaign supporting Bela’s DTC business farther into brand storytelling, and away from emphasizing specific products.

In Target’s case, the retailer chose to refocus its campaign messaging on own-brand product lines and its decision not to raise prices. “We continue to see strong consumer response to campaigns that clearly communicate savings, newly lowered prices and stylish, on-trend items at affordable price,” chief guest experience officer Cara Sylvester said in an email.

Noble West, a full-service agency that works with food and beverage firms Sun Valley Rice and nut company Minturn, found clients willing to take a similar direction. Founder and CEO Ali Cox told Digiday the tariffs had granted some of its clients a window to reinforce regional credentials.

“In times of international uncertainty it’s actually an opportunity to double-down on the safety and ‘local’ story,” she said. The agency’s clients had refocused on content marketing and social campaign activity; she declined to provide specific examples.

‘A good problem to have’

Marketers deciding whether to change course – and if so, how – have had to juggle opportunity cost alongside rising real costs. In many cases, the impact of tariffs wasn’t felt by businesses until months after they were imposed – just as they went into the make-or-break Q4 sales period. Some marketers cut back on creator spending in response.

According to John Shea, head of commerce at PMG, while some clients reduced their spending in that period, high e-commerce demand among shoppers meant most kept their investments in place. As a result, PMG’s revenue during the fourth quarter was “slightly better than expectation”, he noted, without providing specifics.

Elsewhere, Piliero said clients were less willing to take a chance on channels with unproven performance, preferring to keep budget focused on Facebook or Google’s search inventory.

While 2026 should bring fewer surprises, businesses that chose to absorb higher costs will have to choose whether or not they continue to do so — and if so, whether to cut marketing spend to maintain profit margins. At full-service agency Moroch, CEO Matt Powell said he expects one or two “very conservative” clients to cut media spend by 5-10%, while others are set to take a wait-and-see approach.

Shea hopes 2026 will bring relative calm after the “super turbulent” 2025, while major sporting events like the World Cup and Winter Olympics offer the chance of boosting brand spending. “I think you’re going to expect an extra 2% bump in overall media spending just [from those] cultural moments,” he suggested.

Despite the turbulence, Bela’s DTC business caught an updraft. Speaking to Digiday a week after visiting Portugal to visit olive oil suppliers, Scherz said the company recorded “exponential growth” in sales. In 2026, he said the brand will promote its full range of items and forge ahead on its DTC business.

“We were confronted with logistical challenges and inventory challenges, but the demand for canned fish is insane” he said. “That’s a good problem to have.”

[TITLE]Socure Acquires BNPL Consumer Credit Database Qlarifi:
[TEXT]
Identity verification, compliance, and risk decisioning platform Socure has acquired Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) consumer credit database, Qlarifi. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The acquisition will create a unified, identity, anti-fraud BNPL credit infrastructure to help consumers build credit responsibly.

New York-based Socure has been a Finovate alum since 2013. Johnny Ayers is Founder and CEO.

Global identity, compliance, and risk decisioning platform Socure has acquired real-time Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) consumer credit database, Qlarifi. The combination will create a unified identity, anti-fraud BNPL credit infrastructure helping consumers build credit responsibly, enabling lenders to confidently offer financing to more qualified customers, while providing transparency and increased consumer protection that regulators increasingly demand.

“BNPL has outgrown the legacy systems that were never designed to support their innovative lending products,” Socure Founder and CEO Johnny Ayers said. “At the same time, consumers deserve a safe path to build credit, lenders need real-time visibility to reduce fraud and risk, and regulators require transparency and reporting. Qlarifi built the first real-time BNPL consumer credit database, and by combining it with SocureID and our Identity Graph, we can deliver the unified infrastructure that all market participants have been asking for.”

Buy Now Pay Later is a growing component of the e-commerce ecosystem, with nearly 6% of all online transactions in the US relying on BNPL. With growth of more than 20% in the US, spending on BNPL is poised to top $700 billion globally by 2028. The rise of BNPL presents a challenge to both conventional credit reporting systems and infrastructure, however. These systems were not built for the kind of high frequency, small dollar amount lending decisions made in milliseconds that characterizes BNPL. Moreover, lenders have little visibility into the creditworthiness of borrowers, especially when it comes to cross provider visibility. This can expose merchants to significant losses and even increased fraud rates. Furthermore, unlike other credit schemes, BNPL also tends to leave consumers without a path to build credit.

In response, Qlarifi’s platform enables BNPL providers to safely extend financing to qualified customers, while identifying high-risk behavior such as loan stacking and financial crime such as first-party fraud. Already piloted effectively with its partners in Europe, Qlarifi is designed specifically to help lenders protect their customers from overextension and reduce the risk for BNPL providers. Integrated with Socure’s Identity Graph intelligence and RiskOS decisioning engine, lenders will be able to validate identity across BNPL providers, enable thin file customers (those with limited credit history) to access credit responsibly, and reduce fraud-related payment costs for merchants.

“We built Qlarifi to solve a very real pain point: the lack of infrastructure to protect consumers from overextending themselves across multiple BNPL providers,” Qlarifi CEO and Co-founder Alex Naughton said. “By joining forces with Socure, we now have their tremendous commercial scale, balance sheet, and world-class analytics behind us to build the infrastructure that will enable responsible lending at scale and demonstrate to regulators that the industry can protect consumers while expanding access to credit.”

Headquartered in London and founded in 2023, Qlarifi offers a BNPL consumer credit database, providing lenders with BNPL transaction history data to enable them to make more informed underwriting decisions. The solution helps consumers access the right credit products for their needs, provides enhanced fraud protection, and reduces scoring costs while enabling lenders to mitigate operational risks through an emphasis on data privacy and data minimization.

New York-based Socure has been a Finovate alum since 2013. The company leverages AI and machine learning, along with trusted online and offline data intelligence, to verify identities in real time. A leading digital identity verification and trust platform, Socure has more than 2,000 customers in financial services, e-commerce, healthcare, and other industries, and includes four of the top five banks, seven of the top 10 card issuers, and more than 250 of the largest fintechs among its clients.

[TITLE]India’s booming fashion industry is a climate nightmare that demands clean-up action right away:
[TEXT]
India’s fashion story need not become a climate disaster because the country still has an advantage that Europe and North America lost decades ago. Our apparel market and industrial base are still being built and consumer habits are not yet fully entrenched. Industrial clusters are not locked into high-carbon infrastructure. We could embed climate discipline into this phase of growth rather than trying to retrofit it later at vastly higher cost and against fiercer resistance.

Some Argentines had taken buses from neighboring cities and camped outside overnight. Many others had come to a parking lot in Buenos Aires at dawn and stood in a line, a six-block stretch of baggy eyes and determination.The people in the queue were not waiting to see a pope, a king or Taylor Swift, but to be some of the first to enter a budget sporting goods store. Decathlon , a midrange French fitness-gear juggernaut, had just opened its first megastore in Argentina after President Javier Milei's trade liberalization policies made it easier to import foreign goods.Many Argentines, whose material aspirations had been choked by decades of prohibitive tariffs, saw the arrival of the sportswear equivalent of Ikea as a marker of their belated access to the global consumption machine."It's a new beginning," said one customer, Fernanda Pedre, dumping Lycra shirts into a shopping basket. "We are getting closer to the world," said another, Marcelo Monje.For decades Argentina adopted sweeping trade barriers to protect its domestic industries. Middle-class Argentines traveling abroad would return with suitcases stuffed with leggings, printer cartridges, jars of pesto and other goods that are easily accessible in much of the industrialized world.Since taking office two years ago, Milei, an enthusiastic supporter of free-trade capitalism, has begun to roll back some barriers to commerce, opening the door for shiploads of T-shirts from Shein or Temu, the Chinese fast-fashion online retailers, and more goods from Amazon and lingerie from Victoria's Secret, which opened its first flagship store in Buenos Aires in November.Amid the international onslaught, Argentine producers have seen their sales drop and many local businesses have closed. That has set off a national debate on the merits of opening up at a time when Milei's most powerful backer, President Donald Trump, is doing just the opposite, imposing sweeping tariffs on the United States' trading partners, including on some Argentine exports."The world's most powerful nation is embracing protectionism, and Argentina is opening up indiscriminately," said Miguel Ángel Pichetto, a veteran Argentine lawmaker who opposes the trade liberalization. "It doesn't work."Milei has defended his policies, calling protectionism an unsustainable "scam" and arguing that an open economy will eventually redistribute jobs from noncompetitive industries to more efficient ones.Argentina's starting point was one of particular isolation, and expensive imports were a luxury largely reserved for the upper class.Some trade barriers still remain and Argentines do not enjoy the same low prices at chains as customers in other countries.The Zara branches in Argentina still have some of the brand's highest prices in the world. "Premium Outlets" in Buenos Aires sell H&M, Primark and Pull & Bear clothes at much higher prices than in the United States or Europe, and Argentines would pay "personal shoppers" to buy phones or computers abroad.Federica Bianchi, 24, a teacher, said that during two trips to the United States years ago, she stocked up on a supply of clothing that lasted a few years.But since Milei loosened customs red tape, reduced levies and increased the permissible weight and cost of bulk shipments, Bianchi, like many Argentines, began buying online on Shein."We never had this here before," she said, showing off light flowery dresses, tops and four iPhone covers she ordered on the Chinese platform for only a few dollars.Before, she said, "It was like, I have to buy it because I need it, and it's super expensive, but oh, well, I need some jeans." Now, she said, her reasoning is, "OK, I'll buy it, I might use it sometime."Consumerism, experts say, has always existed within Argentina's middle class, which is generally well educated with a cultural and historical proximity to Europe. But the new availability of cheaper imports has unleashed it."It's like opening a Disneyland," said Guillermo Oliveto, an Argentine consumer expert. "They can eat all the candies that they want."By October, imports of consumer goods had risen by 62% since last year. In the same 10-month period, imports of products including deliveries from e-commerce websites had surged by over 200%.Word of newly available brands and shopping apps spreads on Instagram , on WhatsApp chats and at gym classes. In September, a local importer opened a pop-up Cheesecake Factory store -- an American brand -- in a trendy mall in Buenos Aires. Argentines lined up for $9 slices of cake.At the Decathlon opening last month, customers stared at windbreakers as if they were haute couture. Items were still more expensive than in the chain's European stores, and the gift cards Decathlon workers were handing out to the first customers in line may have, in part, helped explain the crowd outside.Nevertheless, eager shoppers formed a line at the register that ran the length of the sprawling store. One of the owners, Sabine Mulliez, said sleeping bags and water bottles represented something more meaningful than just gear for camping."More than selling clothes," said Mulliez, who is part of one of France's richest families, "we are bringing hope."Despite the French retail liberation at Decathlon, it is the Chinese websites, Shein and Temu, which charge no shipping costs for deliveries to the other side of the world, that are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the consumption frenzy. The total value of deliveries of consumer goods from China doubled in the past year.One night in Buenos Aires, customers feverishly rummaged through plastic bags at the opening of a new store reselling Shein clothes that were part of older collections.Argentines are ordering more and more Chinese products even as the United States and Argentina enjoy a financial honeymoon. The two countries recently agreed to a framework for a trade deal, and the United States extended a $20 billion financial lifeline to Argentina -- partly in an effort to expand American influence in the region and counter China's presence."Everybody is asking for Shein," said Camila Di Cesare, 33, the owner of the Shein resale store. These brands, she added, "are breaking the market."Luciano Galfione, the owner of an Argentine synthetic yarn and fabric manufacturer a few miles away, was among those being broken."Shein and Temu beat us hands down," said Galfione, as he walked between hundreds of long rolls of fabric wrapped in plastic and stacked on top of one another. "They're impossible to compete against."His 75-year-old family-owned factory, Galfione said, was working at 20% of capacity, down from 80% in 2023. ​​He had recently let go a quarter of his workforce and said half of those left have barely anything to do.Galfione, the president of Pro Tejer, a local nonprofit representing the textile industry, is hardly alone. In the past year, the Argentine textile industry has seen its production fall by nearly 20%, while clothes imports surged by 95%, leading to the loss of more than 12,000 jobs, according to Pro Tejer.Pichetto, the lawmaker, is pushing a bill seeking to regulate and tax e-commerce platforms to try to protect domestic industries. With purchases from Chinese retailers surging across the region, other countries, such as Chile and Mexico, have also imposed taxes on the shipments.Consumers may not be happy to pay more, Pichetto said, but thousands of domestic companies had closed in the past two years and "the day that there is no more work there is no more consumption."While many Argentines say the country needed to open up to allow access to imported goods at reasonable prices, some experts say that the elimination of trade barriers comes at a challenging moment for domestic producers. Taxes and other costs are high for local companies. Lower trade barriers and changes in exchange-rate policy made foreign goods more affordable, but also increased the prices of Argentine-made products."The government is opening up with no parachute," said Daniel Schteingart, a director at Fundar, a research center in Buenos Aires.Milei does not seem worried. He recently shared a screenshot from Temu showing Milei-themed merchandise on sale, including caps with one of his catchphrases: "There is no money," a rallying cry against state spending.
