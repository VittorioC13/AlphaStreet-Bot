[TITLE]Wall Street rallies to more records as gold's price slumps again:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks climbed to more records on Monday ahead of a week packed with potentially market-moving events for Wall Street.

The S&P 500 rose 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 337 points, or 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.9%. Each of the trio set an all-time high for a second straight day.

Stocks also rallied in Asia ahead of a meeting on Thursday between the heads of the United States and China. The hope is that the talks could clear rising tensions between the world’s two largest economies and allow the global economy to keep motoring.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there’s “a framework” for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss at their meeting, while Trump said, “We feel good”

In a sign of how critical technology will be for China's growth in the following five years, the proposal had 46 references to the word, compared with 36 in the plan for 2020-2025.

Chipmakers, robotics companies, high-end manufacturers and stocks linked to domestic consumption were set to emerge as outperformers in the long run, according to brokerages including Guotai Haitong Securities and Huajin Securities.

"The five-year plan is expected to reset investment themes and the valuation system on the capital market," said Wang Jun, a strategist at BOC International in Shanghai. "The new productive force represented by tech self-reliance, the green transition and an upgrade of domestic demand may run through the policy front and investment themes in the next five years. We expect long-term capital such as mutual funds and insurance funds to further tilt towards those industries of strategic value."
