[TITLE]Investors Could Be Concerned With Greatech Technology Berhad's (KLSE:GREATEC) Returns On Capital:
[TEXT]
Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Greatech Technology Berhad (KLSE:GREATEC), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.

Trump has pledged to "unleash" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Greatech Technology Berhad, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.16 = RM165m ÷ (RM1.2b - RM214m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).

So, Greatech Technology Berhad has an ROCE of 16%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.3% generated by the Semiconductor industry.

Check out our latest analysis for Greatech Technology Berhad

KLSE:GREATEC Return on Capital Employed October 14th 2025

In the above chart we have measured Greatech Technology Berhad's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Greatech Technology Berhad .

What Can We Tell From Greatech Technology Berhad's ROCE Trend?

The trend of ROCE doesn't look fantastic because it's fallen from 23% five years ago, while the business's capital employed increased by 298%. That being said, Greatech Technology Berhad raised some capital prior to their latest results being released, so that could partly explain the increase in capital employed. Greatech Technology Berhad probably hasn't received a full year of earnings yet from the new funds it raised, so these figures should be taken with a grain of salt.

On a related note, Greatech Technology Berhad has decreased its current liabilities to 17% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.

[TITLE]Bank of America Raises AMD (AMD) Price Target to $300, Citing 11/11 as Next Major Catalyst:
[TEXT]
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week. On October 17, Bank of America reiterated the stock as “Buy” and raised its price target to $300 per share from $250.

“We rate AMD Buy. It serves a multi-hundred billion addressable market opportunity in PC, server, high-end gaming, deep-learning and related markets where AMD has less than 30% value share currently.”

The firm also discussed how it sees improved visibility into AMD’s MI450 Series ‘Helios’ racks launching in 2H26, supported by customers such as Oracle, Meta, and OpenAI. Further, the analysts have marked 11/11 as the next date to watch out for, deeming it the next major catalyst.

“Overall, we now see greater visibility into the deployment and ramp outlook of MI450 Series ‘Helios’ racks launching in 2H26, supported by key industry customers such as Oracle, Meta, and OpenAI (more details on pg. 3)."

"As a result, we now assume 50% OpenAI deal (6 GW deployment over 4 years) fall-through in our base model, raise sales/EPS ests, and highlight upside toward $10–11 EPS power by CY27E at 100% fall-through. Our new $300 PO is based on unch. 33x CY27E PE, still within 14x–55x historical range. Next major catalyst includes upcoming Analyst Day in NYC on 11/11. Separately, we also highlight very low AMD ownership amongst active fund managers at just ~20% of funds as of August, as well as just 0.16x weighting within SPX at funds, down significantly YoY vs. market-weight+ (1.00x+) for most large cap semis peers.”

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) develops and sells semiconductors, processors, and GPUs for data centers, gaming, AI, and embedded applications.

While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]HSBC Lifts AMD Price Target to $310 on OpenAI Deal Visibility:
[TEXT]
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching Closely. On October 15, HSBC analyst Frank Lee raised his price target on the stock to $310 from $185 and reaffirmed his Buy rating. The firm believes that AMD’s OpenAI deal is poised to bring massive AI revenue upside potential.

“OpenAI deal implies massive AI revenue upside potential, which is still under-estimated by consensus. We believe this deal gives enhanced visibility into AMD’s AI GPU revenue opportunity till 2030.”

The companies agreed last week that OpenAI will deploy six gigawatts of AMD GPUs over several years. The deployment of the first 1 gigawatt AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs will begin in the second half of 2026.

“Since the deployment is set to begin with the MI450 series, we used the power consumption of MI450 as the base. We believe that the total revenue opportunity for AMD from this OpenAI deal is around USD80bn – more than 10x its 2025e AI GPU revenue of USD7.3bn.”

The analysts lifted their 2026 estimates for AI GPU revenue to $19.8B from $13.9B. This reflects expectations of a 0.5GW deployment for OpenAI in the second half of 2026.

“We believe AMD has also increased its CoWoS allocation to 70k-80k wafers for 2026e. With constant capacity expansion and increased visibility, we believe AMD should be able to continue expanding its CoWoS allocation into 2027e as well.”

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) develops and sells semiconductors, processors, and GPUs for data centers, gaming, AI, and embedded applications.

[TITLE]HSBC Upgrades NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) To Buy, Lifts Price Target to $320:
[TEXT]
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is among the 14 Best Big Name Stocks to Invest in Right Now. On October 15, HSBC analysts led by Frank Lee upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, citing their expectation that the total addressable market (TAM) for AI GPUs will continue to increase beyond hyperscalers, which should result in continuous earnings growth.

The firm also lifted its price target for the stock to $320 from $200, representing an upside of nearly 78% from Tuesday’s close. Lee and his team said they had made the adjustments on the back of increasing FY27 estimates for GPU TAM compared to previous expectations, resulting in an upward revision in their data center revenue forecast for FY27 to $351 billion, which is 36% above consensus projections.

The HSBC analysts also anticipate that a potential trade deal between the United States and China could result in easing of China GPU uncertainties, which could help NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) see a demand recovery in the Chinese market.

Moreover, the analysts raised their earnings forecast for Nvidia in FY27 to $8.75 per share, higher than the average street projections of $6.48. They said that this encouraging outlook was backed by surging demand across the global AI chip market.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a full-stack computing infrastructure company. It is the go-to company for firms looking for GPUs and semiconductors as they increase spending on artificial intelligence.

While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]NVIDIA and TSMC Celebrate First NVIDIA Blackwell Wafer Produced in the US:
[TEXT]
AI has ignited a new industrial revolution. NVIDIA and TSMC are working together to build the infrastructure that powers the world's AI factories, right here in America. NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang today visited TSMC's semiconductor manufacturing facility in Phoenix to celebrate the first NVIDIA Blackwell wafer produced on U.S. soil, representing that Blackwell has reached volume production. Onstage at the celebration, Huang joined Y.L. Wang, vice president of operations at TSMC, to sign the Blackwell wafer, commemorating a milestone that showcases how the engines of the world's AI infrastructure are now being constructed domestically. This bolsters the U.S. supply chain and onshores the AI technology stack that will turn data into intelligence and secure America's leadership for the AI era."This is a historic moment for several reasons. It's the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States," Huang said at the event. "This is the vision of President Trump of reindustrialization - to bring back manufacturing to America, to create jobs, of course, but also, this is the single most vital manufacturing industry and the most important technology industry in the world.""To go from arriving in Arizona to delivering the first U.S.-made NVIDIA Blackwell chip in just a few short years represents the very best of TSMC," said Ray Chuang, CEO of TSMC Arizona. "This milestone is built on three decades of partnership with NVIDIA - pushing the boundaries of technology together - and on the unwavering dedication of our employees and the local partners who helped to make TSMC Arizona possible."The wafer - the base material for semiconductors - will go through a complex process of layering, patterning, etching and dicing before taking shape as the ultra-high-performance, accelerated AI chip the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture offers.TSMC Arizona will produce advanced technologies including two-, three- and four-nanometer chips, as well as A16 chips, all essential for applications like AI, telecommunications and high-performance computing.America-based manufacturing is crucial to meeting the growing demand for AI.Today's achievement marks a huge step forward in semiconductor manufacturing and AI development in the U.S., paving the way for sustained American leadership in artificial intelligence. NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs offer exceptional performance, return on investment and energy efficiency for AI inference.In addition, NVIDIA plans to deploy its advanced AI, robotics and digital twin technologies to design and operate new U.S. manufacturing facilities.

[TITLE]Bangladesh Spectrum Auction Uncertain - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
Bangladesh Plans 700 MHz Spectrum Auction: What it Means for 4G and 5G Expansion

Exciting news for the telecommunications sector in Bangladesh! The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) is reportedly gearing up to auction 700 MHz spectrum early next year. This move could significantly impact the expansion of 4G and 5G services across the country.

According to reports, the BTRC aims to make 45 MHz of spectrum available in the 703- to 803-MHz range by January 2026. This potential spectrum auction is designed to empower telecom companies to enhance their existing 4G network capacity and accelerate the rollout of 5G coverage. This will mean faster internet speeds and more reliable mobile connectivity for consumers and businesses alike.

However, a legal hurdle exists. A portion of the 700 MHz spectrum is currently tied up in a legal dispute between the BTRC and a broadband provider, AlwaysOn Network Bangladesh Ltd. This company holds 12 MHz of spectrum in that band. The dispute stems from a 2007 allocation of the 700 MHz spectrum to AlwaysOn, which was later revoked by the BTRC. The case is currently under appeal, and the outcome could influence the amount of spectrum ultimately offered in the auction. This legal challenge could impact the interest from mobile operators.

The BTRC has already applied to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to proceed with the auction. Their current plan involves offering at least 25 MHz of the 700 MHz spectrum in January. If AlwaysOn loses its appeal, the BTRC could potentially offer the full 45 MHz. The success of this spectrum auction is crucial for telecom operators to meet the growing demand for high-speed data.

Leading telecoms like Grameenphone, Robi Axiata, and Banglalink reportedly hope that the regulator releases the entire 45 MHz block for auction. These mobile operators are eager to acquire more bandwidth. Furthermore, the potential bidders are reportedly concerned

[TITLE]Europol Dismantles SIM Farm Network Powering 49 Million Fake Accounts Worldwide:
[TEXT]
Europol on Friday announced the disruption of a sophisticated cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) platform that operated a SIM farm and enabled its customers to carry out a broad spectrum of crimes ranging from phishing to investment fraud.

The coordinated law enforcement effort, dubbed Operation SIMCARTEL, saw 26 searches carried out, resulting in the arrest of seven suspects and the seizure of 1,200 SIM box devices, which contained 40,000 active SIM cards. Five of those detained are Latvian nationals.

In addition, five servers were dismantled and two websites gogetsms[.]com and apisim[.]com) advertising the service was taken over on October 10, 2025, to display a seizure banner. Separately, four luxury vehicles were confiscated, and €431,000 ($502,000) in suspects' bank accounts and €266,000 ($310,000) in their cryptocurrency accounts were frozen.

The countries that participated in the operation comprised authorities from Austria, Estonia, Finland, and Latvia, in collaboration with Europol and Eurojust.

According to Europol, the criminal network has been attributed to more than 1,700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1,500 in Latvia, leading to losses totaling around €4.5 million ($5.25 million) and €420,000 ($489,000) in the two countries, respectively.

"The criminal network and its infrastructure were technically highly sophisticated and enabled perpetrators around the world to use this SIM-box service to conduct a wide range of telecommunications-related cybercrimes, as well as other crimes," the agency said.

The infrastructure offered telephone numbers registered to people from over 80 countries for use in criminal activities, including setting up fake accounts on social media and communication platforms with the primary goal of obscuring their original identity and location. In all, the service enabled the creation of more than 49 million online accounts.

These accounts were then used to conduct phishing and smishing attacks and carry out financial fraud by tricking victims into investing their funds in bogus trading schemes. Another involved contacting prospective targets on WhatsApp by posing as their daughter or son, claiming they now have a new number and asking them to transfer money in the four-figure range for an emergency.

Some of the other offenses that were made possible via the platform included extortion, migrant smuggling, and the distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

According to snapshots captured on the Internet Archive, GoGetSMS was marketed as a way to get "fast and secure temporary phone numbers," with more than 10 million numbers to choose from and receive verification codes from over 160 online services.

On its website, GoGetSMS also offered the ability to monetize existing SIM cards by turning them into "powerful assets for generating passive income" using its "specialized software," allowing card owners to earn revenue for every SMS message sent to them.

On review website Trustpilot, paid users have complained of facing issues getting hold of a temporary number through GoGetSMS, with one user claiming that they paid for a U.S. number on the platform and did not get a working number in return. "Tried multiple times, wasted both time and money. Support is completely unresponsive – no help, no refund, nothing," the user added.

The Latvian State Police, in a coordinated announcement, said the platform was designed for anonymous communication and payments, impacting 3,200 people in various countries.

[TITLE]Trump called Digital Equity Act ‘racist.’ Now internet money for rural Americans is gone:
[TEXT]
By Sarah Jane Tribble, KFF Health News

Megan Waiters can recite the stories of dozens of people she has helped connect to the internet in western Alabama. A 7-year-old who couldn’t do classwork online without a tablet, and the 91-year-old she taught to check health care portals on a smartphone.

“They have health care needs, but they don’t have the digital skills,” said Waiters, who is a digital navigator for an Alabama nonprofit. Her work has involved giving away computers and tablets while also teaching classes on how to use the internet for work and personal needs, like banking and health. “It’s like a foreign space.”

Those stories are now bittersweet.

Waiters is part of a network of digital navigators across the country whose work to bring others into the digital world was, at least in part, propped up by a $2.75 billion federal program that abruptly canceled funding this spring. The halt came after President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the Digital Equity Act was unconstitutional and pledged “no more woke handouts based on race!”

The act lists exactly whom the money should benefit, including low-income households, older residents, some incarcerated people, rural Americans, veterans, and members of racial or ethnic minority groups. Politicians, researchers, librarians, and advocates said defunding the program, along with other changes in federal broadband initiatives, jeopardizes efforts to help rural and underserved residents participate in the modern economy and lead healthier lives.

“You could see lives change,” said Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, recalling how they helped grandpas in Iowa check prescriptions online or laid-off factory workers fill out job applications.

The Digital Equity Act is part of the sweeping 2021 infrastructure law, which included $65 billion to build high-speed internet infrastructure and connect millions without access to the internet.

This year, Congress once again pushed for a modern approach to help Americans, mandating that state leaders prioritize new and emerging technologies through its $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program.

A KFF Health News analysis found that nearly 3 million people in America live in areas with shortages of medical professionals and where modern telehealth services are often inaccessible because of poor internet connections. The analysis found that in
