[TITLE]Oil awaits Zelenskiy-Trump meeting clues on peace deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices held steady today as traders awaited clues from a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as they attempt to come to a peace deal to end Europe's deadliest war in 80 years.

Brent crude futures stood at $65.87 a barrel this morning, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was up nine cents, or 0.14%, to $62.89 a barrel.

Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Saturday and emerged more aligned with Moscow on seeking a peace deal instead of a ceasefire first.

"Market focus now shifts to today's Washington meeting for signs of a deal that could eventually boost crude and gas supply. Meanwhile, in the week to August 12, speculators held the first-ever combined net short position in WTI (CME & ICE), leaving prices exposed to any upside surprises," said Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy, Ole Hansen.

"I don't believe the oil market has priced in a full peace dividend that potentially could see prices of crude and EU gas suffer further setbacks," Hansen added.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro's comments around India's purchases of Russian crude funding Moscow's war in Ukraine led to crude ticking up earlier in the session.

"India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs," Navarro said.

"The US adviser's sharp words on India's Russian crude imports, paired with postponed trade talks, revive concerns that energy flows remain hostage to trade and diplomatic frictions, even as peace prospects in Ukraine brighten," said Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at brokerage Phillip Nova.

On Saturday, Trump said he did not immediately need to consider retaliatory tariffs on countries such as China for buying Russian oil but might have to "in two or three weeks", cooling initial concerns about a disruption in Russian supply.

China, the world's biggest oil importer, is the largest buyer of Russian oil, followed by India.

Investors are also watching for clues from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments at this week's Jackson Hole meeting regarding the path of US interest rate cuts that could boost stocks to further records.

[TITLE]Exxon Seals Massive Trinidad Oil and Gas Exploration Deal:
[TEXT]
Exxon has sealed a deal with the Trinidad and Tobago government for deepwater exploration that could involve investments of $21.7 billion, according to the Caribbean nation’s energy minister.

“What we are awarding today is larger than the surface area of the country,” Roodal Moonilat said as he broke the news of the new deal, saying the area that Exxon will explore was the size of seven normal offshore blocks.

Said area lies northwest of the Stabroek block—the offshore Guyana block that Exxon has been developing since 2005, with the first production well drilled in 2015. Since the start of exploration, Exxon has tapped an estimated 11 billion barrels in reserves and production has grown rapidly, turning Guyana into a rare hot spot in the world of oil. Plans are to pump 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2030. To date, production runs at 900,000 barrels daily.

Due to its proximity to the Guyana oil bounty, Trinidad and Tobago made a logical choice for Exxon. The supermajor had a presence in the Caribbean country until 2003, when it announced it would quit, following an unsuccessful exploration campaign.

Despite that failure, Trinidad and Tobago is the largest oil and gas producer in the Caribbean and the 17th largest in the world. Its oil and gas industry is seen growing at a compound annual rate of 4.4% over the decade to 2030, with companies involved in that growth including BP, Shell, and Spain’s Repsol—and now Exxon, which very much hopes to replicate its Guyana story in Trinidad.

The new exploration campaign will begin with an investment of $42 million and the drilling of two wells, the first of which could be drilled in six months, once the company finishes with its seismic survey of the area. If that is successful, development could be even faster than it was in Guyana, Reuters noted in a report on the news.

[TITLE]Centrica Signs 10 Year Deal for USA Natural Gas With Devon Energy:
[TEXT]
The deal expands Centrica's global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office.

Centrica Plc signed a 10-year agreement to buy natural gas from Devon Energy Corp. to help expand its activities across the Atlantic.

Centrica Energy, its trading arm, will receive 50,000 million British thermal units per day of natural gas from 2028, or the equivalent of five liquefied natural gas cargoes per year, according to a statement on Friday. The volumes will be indexed to TTF, the European benchmark price.

The deal expands Centrica’s global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office. The agreement will also help the firm to manage the price risk in its liquefied natural gas portfolio by aligning feed gas rates with European futures. For Devon, the deal offers exposure to international markets, according to the statement.

“Gas remains an essential transition fuel and, through long-term agreements like this, Centrica ensures competitively-indexed gas supply,” said Centrica Chief Executive Officer Chris O’Shea.

US natural gas producers are increasingly seeking to lock in agreements with buyers overseas. Both the Asian and the European benchmarks for the heating and power-generation fuel trade at roughly four times the price at Henry Hub in Louisiana, the US benchmark.

In February, Centrica signed a 15-year agreement to supply American LNG to Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and last year it struck a deal with US-based Coterra Energy Inc. to secure more gas.

The smell of yeast still hangs in the air at the Vivergo plant in Hull but the machines have fallen quiet.

More than 100 lorries usually pass through here each day, carrying 3,000 tonnes of wheat. It is milled, fermented and distilled. The final product is bioethanol, a renewable fuel that is then blended into E10 petrol.

This is a vast operation. It took several years to build, with considerable investment, but it is on the verge of closing down. Management and staff are holding out for a last-minute reprieve from the government but time is running out.

[TITLE]Duke Energy promises over $1 billion in savings over a decade from merger of North, South Carolina utilities:
[TEXT]
Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation’s largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That’s after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina — including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina. But its coverage area also includes Asheville, North Carolina, in the west.

The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They would all continue to regulate the combined utility.
