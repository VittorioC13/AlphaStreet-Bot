[TITLE]Asia's strong equity deals pipeline to be tested by AI bubble concerns in 2026:

HONG KONG/MUMBAI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A strong pipeline of high-profile IPOs by companies in China and India looking to tap into a move by investors to diversify bets will bolster Asian equity capital deals next year, although worries over soaring ​tech valuations could drag on momentum.

Asian equity capital market (ECM) deals, including initial public offerings (IPOs), follow-ons and convertible bonds, have totalled $267 billion so far this year, ‌up 15% from 2024 in the first annual rise since 2021, LSEG data showed.

Hong Kong, the preferred listing destination for Chinese companies, dominated regional ECM deals with $75 billion so far in 2025, more than triple ‌what was raised there last year and the highest since 2021, the data showed.

India, meanwhile, has raised $19.3 billion via IPOs so far this year, LSEG data showed, down 6% from 2024's record $20.5 billion haul. The 2025 data does not include e-commerce platform Meesho's $604 million IPO that is underway this week.

"China's recovery and India's continued expansion have been the twin engines driving equity issuance across Asia this year," said James Wang, head of Asia ex-Japan ECM at Goldman Sachs.

"We expect both markets to remain central to regional deal flow in ⁠2026," he said. "We are still in the early stages of ‌a broader upswing ... supported by Asia's economic growth and improving corporate earnings."

India is set to generate as much as $20 billion from IPOs in 2026, according to a forecast by investment banking firm Equirus Capital. Over 300 companies have filed for Hong Kong listings, public ‍disclosures showed.

Landmark offerings such as the IPO of India's Reliance Jio Platforms and the Hong Kong second listing of China's Zhongji Innolight Co are expected to lift volumes significantly in 2026, advisers said.

PIVOTING AWAY FROM US ASSETS

Asia has benefited from a global move by investors to diversify their portfolios, pivoting away from U.S. assets in recent months amid uncertainties about U.S. President Donald Trump's ​trade and geopolitical policies.

"In periods of U.S. turbulence, we often see capital rotate toward Asia in search of diversification and structural upside," said Li He, partner and ‌Asia ex-Japan co-head at law firm Davis Polk.

"The recovery of 2025 was not a flash in the pan. It reflected deep liquidity pools across the region and an unmistakable shift toward frontier technologies that are reshaping how we manufacture, consume and interact."

[TITLE]Asian markets rise ahead of key US jobs & inflation data:
[TEXT]
Asian markets mostly rose on Wednesday following a resumption of Wall Street’s rally, but gains were muted as investors await the last tranche of US data before next week’s Federal Reserve meeting.

With a third successive interest rate cut already priced in, trading has softened ahead of key indicators this week that could still play a role in the central bank’s planning over the next year.

Most in focus are the private jobs report from payroll firm ADP, which is due later Wednesday, and Friday’s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, which is the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation.

Money markets have put the chances of a December 10 cut at around 90 percent, with another three forecast by the end of next year.

The optimism has also been boosted by reports that President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser Kevin Hassett — a proponent of more reductions — is the frontrunner to take the helm at the Fed when Jerome Powell’s tenure ends in May.

But while a number of bank decision-makers have thrown their hat in the ring for a reduction, observers said there appeared to still be some differences on the policy board
