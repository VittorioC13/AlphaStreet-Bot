[TITLE]Stocks rise on Nvidia-Intel deal, Fed rate cut:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK: Stock markets advanced on Thursday (Sep 18), as tech shares jumped following AI chips giant Nvidia's announcement of a US$5 billion investment in struggling US rival Intel, and as investors digested the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq led gains on Wall Street, with Intel shares soaring nearly 23 per cent and Nvidia gaining more than three per cent.

All three major US indices finished at fresh records.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.27 per cent to 46,142.42, the S&P 500 climbed 0.48 per cent to 6,631.96 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.94 per cent to 22,470.72.

The dollar gained against other major currencies.

"Even if Intel needs handouts from its peers in Silicon Valley, investors like it," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB.

Under the Nvidia-Intel deal, the companies will jointly develop chips for PCs and data centers.

The deal comes on the heels of the United States taking a 10-per cent stake in Intel, which has fallen behind in recent years after missing key technology shifts.

The move propelled shares of other tech firms.

In Europe, shares in ASML, a Dutch company that makes the machines used to produce semiconductors, surged more than seven per cent.

Other US semiconductor names were mixed. Micron jumped 5.6 per cent while Advanced Micro Devices dropped 0.8 per cent.

Investors were also reacting to Wednesday's US central bank decision to lower rates by 25 basis points.

US stocks had finished mixed on Wednesday over uncertainty about the path forward following the Fed's announcement.

But the mood changed Thursday, with investors confident that more cuts are coming this year, analysts said.

"Markets are betting policymakers will continue to prioritise jobs over inflation, even with headline prices still running hot," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com.

The decision to cut came even as US inflation runs well above policymakers' two-per cent target, but analysts said the main focus was on the jobs market.

Fed policymakers are split between those who expect at least two interest rate cuts later this year and those who anticipate one or fewer.

Fed boss Jerome Powell remained cagey, telling reporters decision-makers were approaching it "meeting bay meeting".

Paris and Frankfurt stocks were up around 1 per cent in afternoon deals, with German sentiment buoyed by a central bank statement saying Germany should dodge a technical recession in the immediate future.

London rose less enthusiastically as the Bank of England kept its main interest rate at 4 per cent in the face of the UK's stubbornly high inflation, which stands at 3.8 per cent.

While Britain's interest rate was kept unchanged, Norway's central bank cut borrowing costs on Thursday, after a similar move by Canada on Wednesday.

In Asia, investors were in a cautious mood on Thursday.

Shanghai stocks retreated overall, and Hong Kong's session also ended in the red.

Tokyo closed in the green as the Fed decision boosted the dollar against the yen, helping Japanese exporters.

[TITLE]NVIDIA Announces £2 Billion Investment in the United Kingdom AI Startup Ecosystem:
[TEXT]
News Summary:

NVIDIA commits £2 billion to catalyze the U.K.’s AI startup ecosystem and accelerate the creation of new companies, jobs and globally transformative AI businesses.

Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court will join NVIDIA’s investment in the U.K. market, underscoring their commitment to foster the U.K. AI ecosystem.

The investment will bring new capital and advanced AI infrastructure to major U.K. hubs like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester — empowering researchers and developers across the country to scale the next generation of AI businesses.

LONDON, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced an investment of £2 billion in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally.

Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups.

“This is the age of AI — the big bang of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The United Kingdom is in a Goldilocks moment, where world-class universities, bold startups, leading researchers and cutting-edge supercomputing converge. There has never been a better time to invest in the U.K. — AI is unlocking new science and sparking entirely new industries. With new capital and advanced infrastructure, we are doubling down to empower the U.K. to lead the next wave of AI innovation.”

The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. NVIDIA’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups.

“NVIDIA’s investment is a major vote of confidence in the U.K. both today and long into the future,” said U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “By backing our startups, empowering our researchers and connecting capital with talent, this partnership will create jobs, spark new industries and ensure the U.K. remains at the forefront of global AI leadership.”

NVIDIA is committed to working closely with the U.K.’s leading company founders and VCs — especially in London, home to world-renowned academic AI labs — and partnering with top U.K.-based funds to ensure capital and compute reach the most ambitious entrepreneurs and most dynamic regions, including the U.K. government’s newly announced AI growth zone.

Following NVIDIA’s recent commitment to manufacturing up to a half-trillion dollars’ worth of AI supercomputers in America, the investment will be domiciled in the United States and activated in the United Kingdom, celebrating the transatlantic partnership between the two countries. NVIDIA is purposefully investing in the U.K.’s future, unlocking opportunities for the next generation of British innovators.

“In collaboration with NVIDIA, we're accelerating the growth of U.K. AI startups,” said Sonali De Rycker, partner at Accel. “World-class compute and fresh capital will empower the next wave of entrepreneurs and AI startups, create new jobs and further enable the U.K. to compete in the AI race. The U.K. has long been a hotbed for AI talent, with a strong community of researchers, founders and world-class universities, and this new investment will supercharge the AI flywheel.”

“We’ve embarked on a new journey where scaling AI unlocks capabilities that, when we started in this industry over a decade ago, would have been considered magic,” said Nathan Benaich, general partner at Air Street Capital. “The U.K. has world-class talent and research, but the infrastructure has not kept pace. This commitment aims to bridge that gap by providing U.K. founders with the resources needed to build globally significant AI companies.”

“We are in the midst of a seismic technology shift as people and companies around the world increasingly depend on more intelligent hardware and software,” said James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital. “The U.K. is fortunate to be home to some of the teams and companies leading that wave. The challenge facing us, however, is how to overcome constraints like the cost of energy or ability to access compute. Investment from firms like Balderton and companies like NVIDIA will help smooth the path, so more global winners can be built and thrive here in the U.K.”

“The U.K. has the talent, research institutions and entrepreneurial drive to build world-leading AI companies — but turning breakthrough ideas into global impact requires collective action,” said Hussein Kanji, founder and partner at Hoxton Ventures. “We’re thrilled to partner with NVIDIA to commit resources to help Britain’s brightest founders commercialize their innovations and build the next generation of transformational AI companies.”

“Britain has the science and the talent. This collaboration with NVIDIA puts capital and computing power in their hands to scale globally,” said Saul Klein, founder and executive chair of Phoenix Court. “With nearly 800 venture-backed U.K. companies generating revenues of over $25 million, the opportunity now is to back the next wave of truly differentiated AI companies solving real-world challenges.”

[TITLE]Octopus Energy Plans to Spin Off Technology Arm:
[TEXT]
Octopus Energy Group Ltd. plans to spin off Kraken Technologies Ltd., a software platform that helps utilities manage the transition to cleaner energy.

Kraken has been key to Octopus Energy’s growth into the UK’s largest electricity supplier, leapfrogging industry incumbents to serve more than 7 million customers in the country. The software allows it to balance out power flows to households as energy-transition technologies like electric vehicles, home batteries, solar panels and heat pumps become more widespread.

The software platform is already being licensed to other energy providers such as Electricite de France SA, serving more than 70 million household and business accounts worldwide. Committed annual revenue has increased fourfold to $500 million in just three years and the spinoff will accelerate the expansion, Octopus said in a statement on Thursday.

“Kraken is now a globally successful business in its own right,” Chief Executive Officer Amir Orad said in the statement. “Completing our journey to full independence is a strategic and inevitable next step.”

Tim Wan has joined Kraken as its chief financial officer, the same role he previously held at US software firm Asana Inc., according to the statement. He was involved in Asana’s US listing in New York in 2020.

Kraken could be valued at as much as $14 billion, Sky News reported in July, citing a person familiar with the matter, who also said the spinoff could be part of plans for Octopus Energy to sell a stake in Kraken to external investors.

The demerger and any stake sale could “bring transparency to the value of Kraken,” said Martin Young, founder of consulting firm Aquaicity Ltd. He said that could be a precursor to further sales in the future, and possibly an initial public offering.

“Separation offers a cleaner structure and puts to bed the question: ‘Is Octopus a supplier with a tech arm attached, or a tech company that has a supplier as a shop window?” Young added.

Previous Moves

Octopus Energy itself followed a similar path when it moved from being wholly owned by Octopus Group to taking in outside capital to fund its rapid growth. In 2020, it agreed to sell a 20% stake in the power supplier to Origin Energy Ltd. in a deal that valued the company at more than £1 billion ($1.4 billion). It later attracted investment from Generation Investment Management, the sustainable fund co-founded by former US Vice President Al Gore.

Octopus Energy said in January that it had become the UK’s largest energy supplier just nine years after the company started, overtaking legacy providers such as Centrica Plc’s British Gas. The rapid decarbonization of the country’s electricity has transformed the business landscape for utilities, occasionally sending power prices below zero when wind power generation surges.

At times when renewable energy is abundant in the UK, suppliers can use Kraken’s software to offer cheaper deals to customers and incentives for them to ramp up demand, for example by charging their electric cars. This helps manage the fluctuations in electricity flows that come with a more renewables-heavy grid.

[TITLE]Analysis-US investment validates Starmer's risky UK invite for Trump:
[TEXT]
By Andrew MacAskill, Paul Sandle and Muvija M

LONDON (Reuters) -For Keir Starmer, securing record levels of U.S. investment into Britain has validated his offer of an unprecedented second state visit to Donald Trump, a high-risk gamble that was designed to keep the unpredictable president on side.

Trump celebrated his historic visit to Britain by announcing 150 billion pounds ($203 billion) of corporate investment in the UK's technology, finance and energy sectors.

Public opinion was split over whether Starmer was right to cosy up to Trump, but he managed to avoid any public blow-up and the deals agreed gave him a much needed boost after some of the toughest weeks of his premiership.

While state visits hosted by Britain's royal family have in the past been used to announce trade deals or cultural partnerships, Trump, the most transactional of presidents, arrived with billionaires and business leaders.

TRUMP WANTS UK ALIGNED WITH US IN AI RACE

During the visit the two governments announced a raft of U.S. corporate investments into Britain, with private equity group Blackstone pledging 100 billion pounds over 10 years and Microsoft making a 22 billion pound commitment.

Trump has said he wants the U.S. to win the global AI race, and with China the only real challenger in the space, Britain has chosen to align with its ally to secure the building of data centres and supercomputers.

Trump and some tech CEOs, including Microsoft's Satya Nadella, were explicit in their thinking, saying it was important that Britain rely on the United States.

"We're committed to ensuring that the UK has a secure and reliable supply of the best AI, hardware and software on Earth, and we supply that," Trump told a news conference.

The investment is intended to help combine U.S. strengths in building AI infrastructure, capabilities and capital with British innovation and creativity coming out of its universities, start-ups and major companies.

But not everyone endorsed the deal, with some analysts and lawyers arguing that it would leave Britain as little more than an outpost of Silicon Valley.

Nick Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister who was later policy chief at Meta, said the deal represented Britain "holding on to Uncle Sam's coattails".

Alex Kirkhope, partner at law firm Shoosmiths, agreed, saying if Britain's AI was built on U.S. infrastructure, software and data centres then "clearly our leverage in terms of the political side of things is naturally compromised."

Moving too close to the United States also risks limiting Britain's ability to export into the European Union, by far its biggest trade partner, and key for economic growth.

And critics of Starmer's approach argue that despite Trump's apparent sense of goodwill towards Britain - the birthplace of his mother - the country remains at his mercy.

"The UK has made the best of a bad situation but the actual outcome depends on the whims of Trump, not UK tactics or strategy," said Peter Holmes at the UK Trade Policy Observatory.

STARMER STRIKES SOLID RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP

Unlike some other world leaders, Starmer, a liberal technocrat and former human rights lawyer, has proved to be adept at handling Trump, flattering him in public, remaining polite, and using his trump card of a royal invite.

David Dunn, a professor in international politics at the University of Birmingham, said Trump's willingness to bring senior members of his cabinet and leading corporate bosses to Britain provided huge opportunities.

Other countries, including Brazil and India, had been hit by punishing tariffs because they had not shown enough "fealty", he said.

"Trump is a mercurial figure who acts like a medieval king," said Dunn. "Britain through quiet, careful diplomacy has managed to get reasonably favourable treatment."

Britain was the first country to secure a reduction of Trump's global tariffs when the two countries announced an economic deal in May. Lower levies on cars and aircraft parts were vital for companies like Jaguar Land Rover.

But Starmer's influence has its limitations. While the UK's steel sector faces 25% tariffs to sell into the U.S., versus 50% for other countries, Starmer did not succeed in bringing them lower during the trip.

The two leaders also agreed to disagree on the recognition of a Palestinian state, and there was little movement on Trump's approach to Russia.

But the two men left on good terms, with Trump saying the U.S. and Britain would always be united.

"And I just want to thank you, Mr Prime Minister, for the great job I think you're doing," he added.

[TITLE]Silicon Valley will remain 'pro-immigrant' amid U.S. skepticism:
[TEXT]
Openness to foreign talent could be a competitive advantage for up-and-coming tech hubs around the world, particularly as the U.S.—traditionally the world’s leading tech sector—begins to look more skeptically at immigration.

The Trump administration is tightening visa policies, leading to delays for those trying to enter the U.S. And moves like the White House’s campaign against leading universities may be discouraging international students from pursuing education in the U.S.

While Silicon Valley itself will always “remain very pro-immigrant,” the broader political changes within the U.S. could create opportunities for other regions, said Hans Tung, managing partner of U.S.-based venture capital firm Notable Capital, at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah last week.

“When I look at Europe, this is a perfect time to be a lot more open, to include a lot more STEM students from around the world to go to Europe, to innovate on AI in Europe,” Tung said. “Wherever is more open still has a chance to win the next cycle.”

Wendy Tan White, CEO of Intrinsic, a robotics firm owned by Alphabet, pointed out a lack of local talent is constraining U.S. ambitions to revive domestic manufacturing. “That has to be replaced in some way,” she explained. “I think the only way to do it now is through intelligent automation, especially if you want to bring that reshoring of manufacturing back to the U.S.,” White said.

Manufacturing talent has been spotlighted in recent weeks after Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided an LG-Hyundai factory in Georgia earlier this month, detaining several hundred Korean workers. The raid sparked outrage across the South Korean political spectrum, with some Korean businesses reportedly pausing their U.S. investment projects in response.

On Sunday, Trump said he didn’t want to “frighten off” investors, and admitted that the U.S. needed foreign experts to build up industries like chips.

Can the U.S. keep its lead?

The U.S. has long dominated the global tech sector, combining the world’s largest tech companies, deep capital markets, and leading universities. That strength has led to a slightly snarky maxim: “The U.S. innovates, China iterates, Europe regulates.”

Still, recent innovations elsewhere from non-U.S., and particularly Chinese, tech companies are challenging that narrative. Asian companies had already taken the lead in advanced manufacturing, particularly in goods like semiconductors and industrial robotics. More recently, Chinese tech firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are also pushing the boundaries on AI development, releasing open-source models that have pushed U.S. developers like OpenAI and xAI to respond in kind.

“It’s changed. With the open-sourcing of things like DeepSeek, China is starting to drive some of that innovation, and is open to driving that,” White said, pointing to robotics as an example.

Wendy Tan White, chief executive officer of Intrinsic, speaking at Fortune Brainstorm Tech on Sep. 9, 2025. Maeve Reiss for Fortune

China is focusing on what experts call “embodied AI,” or real-world applications of AI models. China produces nearly half the world’s industrial robots, giving the country a possible synergy between hardware and software.

“There’s a huge manufacturing knowledge and expertise in China, as there is in Germany. And so we have teams that try to learn from that,” White explained. And she saw an opportunity in combining the industrial strength in markets like Germany and China “with the software engineering and AI expertise we have from the Valley,” she suggested.

White noted that investors “can’t ignore the U.S,” adding that “the AI development going on there is still outstripping what’s going on globally.” Still, when it comes to specific applications, “there’s not going to be one pure winner,” she said.

“That’s where the competition is going to come.”

Going global

Speakers at Brainstorm Tech pointed out there’s opportunities beyond the U.S. and China. Some smaller countries, like Singapore and the UAE, are also trying to become leaders in AI, leveraging their global connections, attractiveness to global talent, and deep pockets.

“When it comes to software, there’s no question that Silicon Valley still leads innovation in many ways,” Tung said. “But Silicon Valley is not the only game in town, and you see different countries be good at different things.”

Founders outside the U.S. are “just naturally more in tune to what’s needed beyond the U.S., and therefore think about building applications and solutions that cater to the non-English population,” he added.

Chan Ih-Ming, executive vice president of the Singapore Economic Development Board, speaking at Fortune Brainstorm Tech on Sep. 9, 2025. Maeve Reiss for Fortune

“Any company, small or large, has to really think global on day one, figure out ways to leverage the capabilities where they can find them and access them, and that’s everything from talent to being in a business-friendly environment,” Chan Ih-Ming, an executive vice president of the Singapore Economic Development Board, said last week. (The EDB is a partner of Fortune Brainstorm Tech).

“It’s a global world. The important thing is to look further afield, right?” he added later. “We are already pretty interconnected. Moving too far in the opposite direction would be a problem.”

[TITLE]Europe's underappreciated superpower:
[TEXT]
While Europe’s policymakers and opinion leaders obsess over semiconductors and clean tech, another economic engine is humming along with far less fanfare – and far greater local impact. In its forecast for the five-year period from 2024 to 2029, Oxford Economics named travel and tourism the world’s fastest-growing established industry – outpacing financial services, manufacturing, and even information and communication. It’s time Europe treated it as a serious pillar of economic strength – not a sideshow.

And yet, the travel industry remains strikingly underappreciated by Europe’s top decision-makers.

If we add up international tourism receipts for the EU’s top ten markets in 2024, the figure comes to roughly €400 billion - comparable to the gross domestic product of a mid-sized EU member state. Unlike other revenue streams, tourism receipts count as service exports – real money flowing in from outside into the local economies of Member States, supporting jobs that cannot be offshored.

[TITLE]Artificial Intelligence could lift global trade 34-37% by 2040: WTO:
[TEXT]
Global trade is projected to rise by 34-37 per cent by 2040 with right enabling policies to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) for productivity gains and lower trade costs, per a new WTO report.

However, non-tariff measures , including antidumping duties and export restrictions, targeting AI-enabling goods such as semiconductors, could jeopardise global dissemination of AI, the World Trade Report 2025 released on Wednesday cautioned.

“For AI and trade to contribute to inclusive growth, policies need to be in place to bridge the digital divide, invest in workforce skills, and maintain an open and predictable trading environment,” the report titled ‘Making Trade and AI Work Together to the Benefit of All’ pointed out.

Global trade in AI-enabling goods totalled $2.3 trillion in 2023, it noted.

“With the right mix of trade, investment and complementary policies, AI can create new growth opportunities in all economies. With the right frameworks, trade can play a central role in making AI work for all. The WTO is committed to supporting this effort,” WTO DG Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.

The report pointed to the need for open and predictable trade policies, noting that the number of quantitative restrictions applied to AI-related goods has climbed sharply over time, from 130 in 2012 to nearly 500 in 2024, driven by high- and upper middle-income economies.

“A growing set of quantitative restrictions, such as import and export quotas, licensing requirements, and even bans, are increasingly shaping trade in AI-related products,” the report noted. These measures are almost exclusively used by the high-income group, which generally have low tariffs, so the overall level of protection is higher than what might be concluded from tariffs alone.

For instance, AI-enabling goods, such as semiconductors, face relatively low tariffs, but are increasingly targeted by non-tariff measures, including antidumping duties and export restrictions.

“AI development and diffusion is also being held back by the relatively high trade costs imposed by regulations on services trade and data flows. Such trade restrictions could jeopardise the global dissemination of AI,” it said.

Key policy areas that need to work together with trade policy for AI to be beneficial are intellectual property and competition policies, infrastructure and labour market policies, and industrial policy, the report said.

High-income and upper middle-income economies have a substantial lead in regulating AI and and adopting trade-related complementary policies, and this risks widening the structural divide across income groups.

On the crucial need for a balance between data protection and data flow, the report observed that legitimate policy objectives, such as protecting data privacy, can come into conflict with objectives to further open cross-border flows of products and data.

“Policymakers face complex challenges as they aim to achieve policy objectives without compromising inclusive growth through AI and trade. International cooperation can be an important avenue to address such challenges,” it said.

The WTO could play an important role in helping to deliver inclusive access to AI and its benefits, the report pointed out. It noted that 80 specific trade concerns raised at the WTO have focused on AI. Dedicated discussions on AI and inclusive trade have also taken place in the context of the Work Programme on E-Commerce.

“Additional commitments from members, such as through broader participation in the WTO’s Information Technology Agreement and updated commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services, could make AI more inclusive and affordable,” the report added.

[TITLE]D2D in focus as satellite connectivity moves from ‘niche to mainstream’:
[TEXT]
Activity, interest and investments in direct-to-device (D2D) satellite services has increased dramatically over the past two years, driven by multiple technology, regulatory, partnership and service strategies, with telcos and satellite operators such as Starlink and AST SpaceMobile at the heart of the action, and additional companies seeking to get in on the action on an almost weekly basis – witness the joint venture announcement from Viasat and Space42 earlier this week.

Following the inclusion of 3GPP-defined 5G non-terrestrial network (NTN) specifications in Release 17, an increasing number of operators are forming partnerships with satellite operators with a focus on broadband connectivity and/or direct-to-device (D2D) or direct-to-cell (D2C) offerings.

According to a new report from the Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA), satellite connectivity is now moving “from niche to mainstream”, with 170 publicly announced operator–satellite partnerships in 80 markets, and 34 operators in 25 markets having launched commercial services.

The GSA noted that while rural and enterprise broadband remains the dominant application, accounting for half of all partnerships, D2D services “are expanding quickly, with 12 launches and 24 trials or licensed projects” as of August 2025. A further 28 partnerships plan to launch services.

In terms of spectrum, Ka-band remains the most widely used frequency range, although L-bands and S-bands are increasingly important for D2D applications, the report added.

It comes as a surprise to no one to learn that Starlink, the low-earth orbit (LEO) unit of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is a dominant player here and now accounts for 44 partnerships, followed by AST SpaceMobile and Lynk Global. Starlink already has more than 7 million satellite broadband customers across the world and D2D services provisioned with T-Mobile US (T-Satellite).

Notably, Musk has even indicated that Starlink could become a “global carrier” of satellite and terrestrial services following the recent agreement by SpaceX to buy spectrum licences from EchoStar for $17bn.

Following news of the EchoStar deal, ViaSatellite reported that SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell told attendees at the World Space Business Week event in Paris on 16 September that the satellite firm is working with semiconductor developers to ensure that chips compatible with the assets acquired from Echostar – 50 MHz of S-band spectrum (AWS-4 and PCS-H) for the US market and mobile satellite service (MSS) licences for Europe – are being made for smartphones.

She also commented on the ongoing relationship with the telco community. “We will be initiating discussions with telcos in a different way now,” Shotwell stated. “It’s our spectrum, but we want to work with them, almost providing wholesale capacity to their customers. We have to work with the device manufacturers, the chip companies, and working with telcos on the end game. It’s really exciting, but it’s a huge amount of work.”

Other satellite operators are also hoping to get a slice of the satellite connectivity and/or D2D pie, including Amazon’s Project Kuiper, which aims to be offering its services in five major markets across North America and Europe by early 2026.

Iridium recently signed an agreement with Deutsche Telekom (DT) that will see the German group use the Iridium NTN Direct service when it arrives, currently expected in 2026. DT’s US business, T-Mobile, has already signed up with Starlink and launched its first services.

In addition, geostationary satellite firm Viasat is forming a joint venture with United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based spacetech firm Space42 that will adopt a “towerco infrastructure model” to offer wholesale D2D connectivity around the world to third-party service providers.

Spectrum and device concerns

Despite the growth in interest, the GSA warns that the potential for such services as a complement to terrestrial networks remains unclear, pointing to the higher cost as well as the “limited but growing number of smartphones supporting satellite connectivity”.

At the same time, it notes that while uses for satellites are currently limited, “this industry is taking its first step toward long-term growth, similarly to the evolution of terrestrial networks”.

Mobile operator lobby group the GSMA has also waded into the debate with guidelines on the best regulatory approach to spectrum usage as the mobile and satellite industries converge. D2D operations can use two spectrum categories: Frequency bands identified for IMT (international mobile telecommunications) and allocated to the mobile service, and bands already allocated for MSS services.

While clearly supportive of D2D, the GSMA wants to ensure that mobile operators are protected as services are rolled out.

John Giusti, chief regulatory officer at the GSMA, said D2D satellite connectivity “has the potential to extend the reach of mobile, strengthen resilience and deliver real societal benefits”. However, he warns that “without careful and balanced regulation, it risks disrupting the very mobile services that billions of people rely on every day”.

In particular, the GSMA naturally does not want regulators to grant separate licences to D2D operators for the same licensed frequencies and areas as existing terrestrial licences. It also addresses potential inference issues, and is taking early steps to ensure that existing terrestrial mobile networks are protected.

[TITLE]What’s up with… Proximus Global, Verizon, Vantage Data Centers:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Proximus Global has a new head honcho; Verizon offers to sell cut-price broadband in California to try to get the green light for its Frontier acquisition; Vantage Data Centers is to invest billions in a datacentre campus in Spain; and more!

Proximus Global, the subsidiary of Belgium’s national telco that comprises BICS (connectivity services), Telesign (digital identity) and Route Mobile, the communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) specialist in which Proximus acquired an 82.7% stake in May 2024, has appointed Seckin Arikan as its new CEO. Arikan, who joins from Ericsson CPaaS and network API unit Vonage, will start his new position on 1 November and will report to Stijn Bijnens, who took on the role of Proximus Group CEO on 1 September. According to Proximus, Arikan is “a global ICT executive with over 25 years of experience leading transformation and growth in the global telecom and enterprise industry. As chief operating officer of Vonage, he oversees strategy, M&A, technology, AI and IT to drive operational efficiency and build value in UCaaS [unified communications-as-a-service], CCaaS [contact centre-as-a-service], CPaaS and network API offerings.” He will take over from Mark Reid, Proximus Group CFO, who has led Proximus Global as interim CEO since April.

Verizon has pledged to offer cheap broadband services in order to win approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for its acquisition of Frontier Communications, a deal valued at $20bn that was first announced in September 2024. Ars Technica reports that Verizon has committed to offering fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) services of at least 300 Mbit/s symmetrical and fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband services of at least 100 Mbit/s downstream and 20 Mbit/s upstream for just $20 per month to people on low incomes in California if the CPUC will approve the takeover, which has already been cleared by US regulator the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) following Verizon’s decision to amend its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies – see M&A megadeals reshape US comms sector.

Vantage Data Centers, in partnership with local power utility company Desarrollos Ecoindustriales La Cartuja, is to invest €3.2bn in the decade-long construction of a hyperscale datacentre campus near the town of Villanueva de Gállego in the Aragon region of Spain, reports real estate news site EjePrime (in Spanish).

Finnish telco Elisa is often at the forefront of innovation, so it’s interesting to note it has hired one of the cybersecurity sector’s most respected individuals, Mikko Hyppönen, as its principal cybersecurity advisor on a part-time basis. He will also continue in his main role as research director at Sensofusion Oy, a developer of advanced anti-drone systems that specialises in radio frequency (RF) detection and countermeasure technologies. “Hyppönen’s expertise will be available to Elisa’s customers, management and experts in matters related to cybersecurity, digital services and security in telecommunications,” noted Elisa. Hyppönen stated: “Information security products and services are meaningless if people don’t actually use them. As one of Finland's largest IT companies, Elisa is in a unique position to improve the information security situation of our entire society. In my new role as an advisor to Elisa, I will strive to ensure that we can shift as much responsibility for information security issues as possible from end users to experts.”

Chinese tech and digital services giant Alibaba is raising $3.2bn in debt funding to strengthen its “cloud infrastructure capabilities and international commerce business operations,” it has announced to its investors. Look out for more datacentre infrastructure investment announcements, then!

[TITLE]Europe’s Impossible Choice: AI Development or Net Zero?:
[TEXT]
Guest essay by Steve Goreham

This year, European nations announced plans to pursue artificial intelligence. National leaders announced AI spending goals totaling hundreds of billions of euros in efforts to catch up to the United States. But AI requires huge amounts of electrical power, conflicting with Europe’s commitment to achieve a Net Zero power grid.

Since ChatGPT released their AI chatbot in November of 2022, artificial intelligence has exploded. In only two years, the AI revolution became the driving force in the US high-tech industry. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and other firms will spend over $100 billion this year building and upgrading data centers to run AI. Nvidia, the dominant supplier of AI graphics processor units (GPUs), became the most valuable company in the world, its market capitalization soaring from $300 billion to $4.3 trillion in less than three years.

Artificial intelligence requires vast amounts of electricity. AI processors run 24 hours a day, enabling computers to think like humans. When servers are upgraded to support AI, they consume 6 to 10 times more power than when used for cloud storage and the internet. Data centers consumed 4% of US power at the start of 2024 but are projected to consume 20% within the next decade.

The need for new generating capacity for AI now drives US electricity markets. Coal-fired power plant closures have been postponed in Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and other states. Nuclear plants are restarting in Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Dozens of small modular reactors are on the drawing board. More than 200 gas-fired plants are in planning or under construction, including more than 100 in Texas. Companies building AI data centers are constructing their own on-site power plants, unwilling to wait for grid power. The pursuit of artificial intelligence is rapidly replacing obsolete US Net Zero policies.

For more than 25 years, Europe enacted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in order to try to “mitigate” dangerous human-caused climate change. The European Green Deal of 2019 seeks to make Europe the first “climate-neutral continent.” The European Climate Law of 2021 provides legal force for the European Green Deal, calling for a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and for achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050. Nations have been installing wind and solar facilities and closing traditional power plants to reduce emissions. Today,
