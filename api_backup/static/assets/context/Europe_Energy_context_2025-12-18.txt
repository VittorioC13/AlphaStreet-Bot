PA Media The UK government and Ineos are to invest a combined £150m in the plant

A £150m support package has been announced for the Grangemouth industrial complex. The UK government will invest £125m and owners Ineos will contribute £25m to support 500 jobs at the site. Scottish secretary Douglas Alexander told the BBC the joint deal was a "stark contrast" to the closure-hit Mossmoran chemical plant. He criticised ExxonMobil for lack of investment in the Fife site, which is due to close in February with the loss of up to 400 jobs.

Alexander said the funding was effectively "bridging finance", in the hopes that the plant would be profitable in five years after £100m was spent to keep it open in the past year. He added that Ineos were able to commit to "five years of ethylene production at the facility." Grangemouth is the UK's last ethylene plant, a key ingredient in plastics used in advanced manufacturing and the automotive and aerospace industries. In addition to ethylene, the plant's core products are propylene, polyethylene, and polypropylene.

PA Media Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander visited the plant following the announcement

These materials are used in a wide variety of products, including packaging, insulation, cables, construction materials, pharmaceuticals and healthcare products, including PPE and syringes. The complex uses shale gas brought in by ship from the United States to produce ethylene. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would protect jobs and ensure places like Grangemouth can develop into the future. He said: "Our commitment is clear; to back British industry, to stand by hardworking families, and to ensure places like Grangemouth can thrive for years to come."

The UK government said that it had underwritten £75m in finance provided by NatWest. The government said it was providing the remainder of the funding via a grant - to take the total to £125m - with Ineos providing equity to make up the remainder of the £150m total. Chancellor Rachel Reeves visited the plant following the announcement, along with Alexander and Business secretary Peter Kyle. Reeves said: "Building on the millions of pounds we've already invested in Grangemouth, this vital package protects our national resilience and secures the livelihoods of hundreds of people employed at the site way into the future."

The site stands next to the Grangemouth oil refinery. In April, it stopped processing crude oil and moved to being an import terminal for finished fuels, with the loss of 400 jobs. Ineos chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe had earlier warned the chemical industry was coming to an end in Britain due to high energy costs and carbon taxes. He said the new investment package demonstrated Ineos and the UK government's commitment to British manufacturing. "It protects 500 high-value jobs, secures supply chains, and preserves the industrial capacity the nation needs," he said. "The support of the UK government is welcome as we work to deliver competitive and efficient low-carbon manufacturing for the UK, long term."

PA Media Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the investment would protect 500 jobs

Grangemouth community councillor Steven Aitkenhead told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live that the news was a "glimmer of hope." He said: "Grangemouth itself is experiencing huge social difficulties at the moment and could be classed as a social emergency. "So this news that securing and safeguarding jobs in the town is very welcome. "We hope that all the opportunities that come to the town through the Just Transition improves the lives of people who live in Grangemouth and the local area."

Snack bar owner Brenda Bolton said most of her customers are employed at the plant

Brenda Bolton, owner of the Rumbling Tum snack van which has served workers at the site for more than 30 years, said her business had more than halved since the 400 oil refinery job losses. She said: "I took to social media to build up the business and keep my staff in jobs. "The news of new jobs being generated is great for us and everybody round about here. "A customer did say 'I've heard on the radio there's an announcement for new jobs in Ineos so I hope that's great for you guys.'" But Ms Bolton said she was cautious about the security of the area's long-term future. She added: "There's been things promised in the past that have never transpired, so we'll believe that when we see it. "Hopefully it does generate more business for myself and other businesses round about."

Earlier, the Scottish Secretary told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme that the UK government was "determined to protect chemical production in Grangemouth". Alexander said: "This petrochemical facility is of strategic significance, not just to Scotland, but to the whole of the UK. "It is a critical element of the supply chain to a whole range of industries."

In recent months there has been concern about the future of the UK petrochemical industry due to the rising cost of energy. Last month, ExxonMobil announced plans to close part of the Mossmorran chemical plant in Fife, impacting 179 directly employed jobs and 250 contractors. The company said the high cost of energy at the plant, which also produces ethylene for the plastics industry, was partly to blame for the decision. The UK government has warned that high energy costs have caused problems for the chemicals industry across Europe. It said about 40% of ethylene gas capacity has either closed recently or is at risk of closure.

Alexander criticised ExxonMobil's leadership and said there had been a "stark contrast in the dialogue and discussions" over the future of the Mossmoran site. He said: "When we sat down with Jim Ratcliffe it was pretty clear what was needed in order to be able to deliver a future for the chemical facility in Grangemouth. "There had been significant Ineos investment in the plant. "In contrast, the Mossmorran facility is now 40 years old, it was built to have a 20 year lifecycle. "Alas, there hasn't been the scale of investment that many of us would wished to see in Mossmorran over recent years. "The management were not able to give us a pathway to profitability."

parliamentlive.tv ExxonMobil chairman Paul Greenwood was asked about the Grangemouth investment during a session of the Scottish Affairs Committee

ExxonMobil chairman Paul Greenwood has previously partly blamed UK government policy for the decision and said there was no "competitive future" for the site. On Wednesday Mr Greenwood told the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster that the current environment was "very difficult" to operate in the UK at the moment. Douglas McAllister MP asked Mr Greenwood if the new investment announcement on Grangemouth "flew in the face" of that view and if Mr Ratcliffe and others were experiencing the same environment he described. Mr Greenwood agreed, but added: "If you stand back and you look at the facts, I think you turn around and you say, Prax refinery has shut. Grangemouth refinery has shut. Fife ethylene plant has shut. "The government has now effectively had to inject some money and capital into another chemical plant in order to keep it operating. "I think those are signs of an industry that's struggling, not signs of an industry that's thriving." Mr Greenwood said Exxon Mobil had invested £270m into the Mossmorran site over the previous five years, but had made a £300m loss over the same period. He said there had been both "formal and informal" discussions about a potential sale of the site, but there was no "viable" takeover offer.

PA Media Unite said governments in the UK and Scotland had done "too little too late" after the Grangemouth oil refinery announced its closure

Giving evidence to the same committee, Bob McGregor, industrial officer for the Unite union, disagreed that Mossmorran was not commercially viable and urged both governments to intervene. He said: "The plant is one of the youngest ethylene plants in Europe, it has a dedicated workforce. "Yes, it needs investment, but I'm sure that investment could come from a company who's making £25bn, the third best year in the history of their business." Mr McGregor said that there had been "a lot of kind words and soundbites", but said he had not seen "any real tangible evidence" of support from either government. Responding to the evidence, Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said the Scottish government's priority was to secure a sustainable future for the site at Mossmorran and workers at the plant. She said she had been working to secure new opportunities for the Fife plant and its workforce, but encouraged the UK government to intervene.

'Much-needed boost'

The UK and Scottish governments have been scrambling to reduce the impact of recent job losses in the chemicals sector. They made a joint commitment to supporting a green energy hub at Grangemouth, on part of the site left vacant by the refinery closure. The Scottish government welcomed the new investment. Climate and energy secretary Gillian Martin said: "The Scottish government has been calling upon UK government for months now to intervene to protect jobs at Grangemouth and Mossmorran at a scale seen in other parts of the UK."

[TITLE]500 jobs protected at Grangemouth as UK Government partners with INEOS to save vital plant’s future:
[TEXT]
UK Government provides over £120m support package as part of £150m joint investment with INEOS to protect vital chemical production and 500 jobs at Grangemouth, plus hundreds more in the supply chain.

Unique plant strategically important for UK’s critical national infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, North Sea operations and modern Industrial Strategy.

Deal secures operational commitment from INEOS for the plant and multimillion-pound investment from the company.

Britain’s last ethylene plant at Grangemouth has been saved by the UK Government - securing 500 good jobs and hundreds more across the region in the supply chain.

Thanks to a landmark partnership between the UK Government and INEOS, the future of this vital site is now protected, sending a clear signal: this Government is backing workers and their communities across the whole of the UK.

With over £120 million in UK Government support and major investment from INEOS, the Grangemouth plant will stay open with jobs secured.

This huge win keeps the heart of Scotland’s industry beating strong, supports local families, and keeps critical supply chains running nationwide.

This package will help secure the site’s operations and contribute toward improving energy efficiencies, reducing carbon emissions and increasing productivity, helping to secure the site’s long-term competitiveness and sustainability. INEOS has spent over £100 million over the last year maintaining operations at the site.

The Grangemouth plant is vital for the whole UK economy. It produces ethylene which is essential for medical-grade plastics and use in the chemical supply chain. These plastics are also vital to key industries, including advanced manufacturing, automotive, and aerospace, where they are used in nearly every product.

The decisive action from the UK Government is part of its modern Industrial Strategy, which identifies chemicals as a vital foundational sector that underpins the UK’s high-growth industries like defence and advanced manufacturing by producing the materials they all depend on, while also being essential to many supply chains.

The UK Government is backing the chemicals sector through the Industrial Strategy with targeted support to bring down energy costs, including through the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme – which will slash costs for businesses in sectors including chemicals by up to 25% - and the British Industrial Supercharger, which will save Britain’s most energy-intensive firms money on their electricity costs.

The plant also links to the Forties Pipeline System, which is key for transporting North Sea oil and gas to onshore facilities. Without government intervention, the plant’s closure would have seriously affected hundreds of onsite workers, impacted thousands of jobs regionally, and devastated supply chains.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle will formally announce the support today (17 December) during a visit to the INEOS site in Grangemouth with the Chancellor and Scotland Secretary.

Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, said:

When we said we’d protect jobs and invest in Britain’s future, we meant it - and this is proof. Through partnership, determination, and our Modern Industrial Strategy, we’re delivering new opportunities, fresh investment, and security for the next generation of workers in Scotland. This is

[TITLE]Senate lowers oil benchmark, approves N54.46tn budget:
[TEXT]
The Senate on Tuesday approved a revised Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper for 2026–2028, slashing Nigeria’s crude oil benchmark to $60 per barrel for 2026 and endorsing a N54.46tn federal spending framework designed to shield the economy from global uncertainties.

The upper chamber adopted the recommendations of its Committee on Finance following the presentation of the report by the committee’s chairman, Senator Sani Musa, at plenary presided over by Senate President Godswill Akpabio.

The approval comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East, persistent volatility in the global energy market, and concerns over the vulnerability of oil-dependent economies such as Nigeria to external shocks.

In a key adjustment, the Senate reduced the crude oil benchmark earlier proposed at $64.85 for 2026, $64.30 for 2027, and $65.50 for 2028 to $60, $65, and $70 per barrel for the respective years. The committee explained that the downward review was informed by global uncertainties and the sensitivity of oil prices to geopolitical developments.

Despite the conservative oil price outlook, lawmakers sustained domestic crude oil production projections at 1.84 million barrels per day for 2026, 1.88 million barrels per day for 2027, and 1.92 million barrels per day for 2028, expressing confidence in ongoing sectoral reforms and efforts to stabilise output.

On macroeconomic assumptions, the Senate endorsed projected exchange rates of N1,512 to the dollar in 2026, N1,432.15 in 2027, and N1,383.18 in 2028, aligning with the Central Bank of Nigeria’s outlook and its drive to stabilise the naira through coordinated fiscal and monetary policies.

Inflation is projected to ease gradually over the medium term, moderating to 16.5 per cent in 2026, 13 per cent in 2027, and nine per cent in 2028. The committee anchored the projections on sustained monetary tightening and reforms aimed at addressing structural drivers of inflation.

Similarly, the Senate sustained real GDP growth projections of 4.68 per cent for 2026, 5.96 per cent for 2027, and 7.9 per cent for 2028, citing the expected impact of economic reforms, improved revenue mobilisation, and gains from recently enacted tax reforms expected to take firmer effect from 2026.

A major plank of the report was the emphasis on the effective implementation of newly enacted Tax Acts as critical tools for economic growth and fiscal sustainability.

In this regard, the committee recommended the adoption of a National Scanning Policy within the National Single Window of the Nigeria Revenue Service, in collaboration with relevant agencies, to enhance revenue assurance, reduce leakages, improve trade facilitation, strengthen transparency, and bolster national security.

On fiscal operations, the Senate approved a total proposed expenditure of N54.46tn for the 2026 financial year.

Of this amount, Federal Government retained revenue is estimated at N34.33tn, while new borrowings—both domestic and foreign—are projected at N17.88tn. Debt service obligations were put at N15.52tn.

The framework also provides N1.376tn for pensions, gratuities, and retirees’ benefits, while the fiscal deficit is pegged at N20.13tn.

Capital expenditure, exclusive of transfers, was sustained at N20.131tn, alongside statutory transfers of N3.152tn and a Sinking Fund provision of N388.54bn.

Total recurrent (non-debt) expenditure was approved at N15.265tn, while special intervention funds for recurrent and capital spending were fixed at N200bn and N14bn, respectively.

In concluding remarks, the committee expressed appreciation to the Senate for what it described as its commitment to a critical national assignment, expressing optimism that faithful implementation of the approved framework would help stabilise the economy and promote sustainable growth.

[TITLE]Benchmark oil price slides to lowest level since 2021:
[TEXT]

The price of the benchmark North American crude blend known as West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, slid to a four-year low on Tuesday, dipping to $55 US a barrel after starting the year off around $80.

Oil prices have been on a downward trend since the start of the year, and agencies expect that pressure to continue as global oil inventories continue to rise in 2026. Projections vary, but others see prices headed even lower in 2027.

Drops in oil prices are of particular concern in Canada, and especially Alberta, given how much oil and gas royalties figure into the financial health of governments.

Rory Johnston, energy researcher and founder of the Commodity Context newsletter, says the latest slide in prices is the continuation of a trend that began months ago, driven by a combination of weakening global growth expectations and a surge in supply.

“Demand has actually performed relatively well, funny enough, but there's just so much supply in the market that prices are going to need to continue grinding lower until we see supply cut somewhere in the world,” he said.

Johnston said the market turned decisively earlier this year when U.S. trade policy announcements hurt global demand assumptions, followed almost immediately by OPEC+ accelerating production increases .

The consequences for Western Canada are unavoidable, Johnston said.

“Lower prices are bad for Western Canadian producers. There’s no two ways

[TITLE]Analysis: Costly gas and infrastructure are driving Virginia’s soaring power bills:
[TEXT]
By David Kelly, EDF Senior Director – Mid-Atlantic Region

Virginians are facing rising costs on multiple fronts, and electric bills are no exception. Virginia’s electric bills are increasing at a pace faster than general inflation and, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), bills have increased nearly 30% since 2021. It’s easy to understand the growing frustration, as some Virginians are forced to choose between paying for doctor’s visits and prescription drugs – or even food – over their electric bill.

Drawing on Dominion Energy’s and Appalachian Power’s own filings at the State Corporation Commission (the agency that oversees utility investments and regulates ratemaking in Virginia), a new analysis from EQ Research underscores that volatile fossil fuel prices and skyrocketing utility investment in power system infrastructure are the primary drivers behind surging electricity costs for Virginia households.

While not explicitly addressed in this report, we’d be remiss, as we consider cost drivers, not to highlight that data centers represent a significant element of the need for new power system infrastructure. As the Joint Legislative and Review Commission (JLARC) data center report pointed out, this booming industry brings economic benefits to the state, but comes with cost impacts to Virginia’s electric customers. Just recently, the SCC issued an order aimed at corralling transmission and distribution system costs brought on by data center energy demand. By requiring data centers and other large users to pay a minimum of 85% of contracted distribution and transmission demand, and 60% of generation demand, among other requirements, the SCC order seeks to protect Virginia ratepayers from those costs.

While the SCC’s order is notable, the consequences to customers in a more fossil-fuel focused future are clear: the more utilities seek to invest in gas power plants and associated infrastructure, the more Virginia households will remain financially tethered to a price-volatile and increasingly expensive energy system. Meanwhile renewable energy, particularly solar paired with battery storage, is the most affordable, most rapidly-scalable energy resource available to meet Virginia’s energy needs while keeping electricity prices in check.

What the Numbers Say

The data, taken from Dominion and ApCo’s own filings with the State Corporation Commission, paints a clear picture of what’s driving up Virginians’ electric bills.

Analysis of utility filings between January 1, 2019, and April 1, 2025, shows:

Residential rates have increased significantly in both Dominion (20.5%) and ApCo’s (45.4%) service territories since January 2019. (See Figure 1)

While base rates have remained relatively stable, rate riders to cover the costs of powerplant fuel and grid infrastructure spending have significantly increased residential customer costs in both Dominion and ApCo’s service territories.

Fuel costs – what the utility pays for natural gas – increased 62.5% , distribution costs increased 123.1%, and transmission costs increased 82.0% in ApCo’s service territory over the analysis period (See Figure 4)

In Dominion’s service territory, non-renewable generation costs decreased 13.0% over the analysis period, but the trend in non-renewable generation costs over time shows a 73% spike in fuel costs beginning in 2022 and carrying into 2023 . Distribution costs increased by 66.0% and transmission costs increased by 49.0% in Dominion’s service territory over the analysis period.

Reliance on Gas is Fueling a Rate Hike Rollercoaster

The utilities’ own SCC filings make it clear: the cost of fuel to run fossil power plants is a primary driver of price instability and rising cost for Virginia households. Nevertheless, Dominion continues to prioritize new fossil fuel investments. This piece of the energy equation is simple: When fuel prices spike, so do customers’ bills. When gas fuel prices jumped in 2022–23, Virginia households and businesses saw their bills spike. And with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting gas prices to more than double in 2026, up from 2024 prices, that’s bad news for Virginians looking for energy affordability solutions – especially heading into cold winter months when rising demand for electricity to keep homes warm is already promising higher than usual electricity bills.

Energy Affordability and the Transition to Clean

One of the ways Virginia’s electric utilities generate a profit is through a guaranteed return on equity (ROE) for their investment in major infrastructure projects like power plants. While state policy might specify that electric power should be delivered to customers at the least cost, incentives in the electricity market encourage utilities to pursue the most expensive projects they can get the SCC to approve.

By requiring that utilities shift investment toward price-stable, affordable clean energy solutions, policies like the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) help stabilize rates in the near term and keep downward pressure on energy costs for the long haul, with the added benefit of driving down climate and health-harming air pollution from the electric power sector. Analysis of ApCo’s and Dominion’s SCC filings shows that VCEA costs make up a relatively small fraction of the average customer’s monthly bill and are dwarfed by the significant cost increases customers are experiencing due to the utilities’ reliance on gas power plants and ballooning investment in grid infrastructure build out.

Moreover, ApCo itself announced in October that they were in a rare position to lower customer bills by a whopping 24% because of a ramp-up of renewable energy use. As ApCo explained in its

[TITLE]Ellomay Capital Announces Execution of an Agreement to Sell the Control Stake in the Company to O.Y. Nofar Energy Ltd.:
[TEXT]
Mr. Ran Fridrich will continue as Chief Executive Officer of the Company

Tel-Aviv, Israel, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and USA, today announced that S. Nechama Investments (2008) Ltd., Kanir Joint Investments (2005) LP and Anat Raphael, who together currently hold approximately 45.9% of the Company’s outstanding share capital (together, the “Sellers”), agreed to sell their holdings in the Company to O.Y. Nofar Energy Ltd. (“Nofar”), a public company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE: NOFR). As described below, the closing of the sale is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

Ran Fridrich, CEO and Board Member of Ellomay, said: “The transfer of control from the current controlling shareholders to Nofar is intended to ensure an orderly transition of ownership that will secure Ellomay’s future and continued growth. Ellomay will continue to operate in the ordinary course of business, while retaining its dedicated employees and management backbone, and will work to expand its activities in the future.”

Ofer Yannay, CEO and Board Member of Nofar, said: “The acquisition of the controlling stake in Ellomay constitutes a significant strategic milestone in the implementation of our growth strategy. This transaction represents not only an expansion of Nofar’s portfolio, but also the leveraging of three core principles: first, full strategic alignment with target markets in which we seek to deepen our activity; second, entry into the conventional energy sector through Ellomay’s holding in the Dorad power plant, which strengthens Nofar’s position by broadening its production mix; and third, the creation of operational synergies and asset-enhancement potential through the integration of the experience and expertise of Nofar and Ellomay. In particular, I would like to note my deep appreciation for Ellomay’s team, and especially for Rani Fridrich, who is expected to continue in his role as CEO of Ellomay.”

As noted in a report submitted to the Israel Securities Authority by Nofar (“Nofar’s Report”), the Sellers will be selling their shares based on a Company valuation of NIS 1 billion (approximately $310.4 million), subject to customary adjustments. Nofar further reports that the consummation of the sale is subject, inter alia, to receipt of regulatory approvals (including from the Israeli Electricity Authority and the Israeli Competition Commissioner) by no later than 90 days from the date of execution of the sale agreement, however, if Nofar acts in good faith to obtain the required approvals and such approvals are not received by the applicable deadline, and the Sellers receives written notice thereof, the final deadline may be extended in two stages of up to 45 days each. In addition, Nofar’s Report notes that Nofar has the right to terminate the sale agreement in the event that during the interim period until the consummation of the transaction: (i) the Company enters into a new material transaction that is not in the ordinary course of business with the Sellers or any of their related parties or any of the Company’s controlling shareholders or office holders, (ii) if the Company enters into a material new field of operations not included in the Company’s strategic plan and requires substantial investments, (iii) if the Company sells (or leases) a significant part of the Company’s real estate (owned or leased by the Company), or (iv) if the Company’s articles of association are amended, other than a technical amendment.

Based on Nofar’s Report, the sale agreement further provides that upon consummation of the transaction, and at Nofar’s discretion, up to four directors on behalf of Nofar may be appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors, and an equivalent number of directors (other than the Company’s external directors) will be replaced. Nofar’s Report notes that Mr. Ran Fridrich will continue to act as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

As noted above, the consummation of the sale transaction is subject to conditions to closing, that are not within the control of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot estimate, and there is currently no assurance as to, whether and when the transaction will be consummated. In addition, the value of the Company’s shares set forth in the Nofar Report may not be reflective of the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the NYSE American or the TASE.

Consumers stores gas in underground reservoirs for use during the winter heating season. On Dec. 16, 2025 it filed paperwork requesting to raise gas rates, in part to upgrade aging infrastructure on its Lower Peninsula system. Joel Bissell | MLive.com

LANSING, MI - Consumers Energy is again beginning the process of raising natural gas rates, on the first day it is permitted to under Michigan law and for the fourth year in a row.

The utility serving half of Michigan’s gas customers filed paperwork on Tuesday, Dec. 16 requesting to increase rates by $240 million.

Average monthly bills for residential customers would increase 8.2% if approved in full by regulators with the Michigan Public Service Commission, according to Consumers filings.

Instead, regulators often reduce utility requests after a monthslong legal process involving scrutiny from outside groups, known as a “rate case.” New rates won’t show up on customer bills until late next year.

Michigan law makes utilities wait one full year between rate hike applications. Consumers has done so down to the day. For four years running, its gas rate requests have landed on the first business day it is able to formally submit them, falling in mid-December.

Some consumer watchdogs call that pace “troubling.”

“Consumers Energy has created a revolving door of rate increases by filing annually in recent years. This case continues that trend,” said Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, a nonprofit advocating for residential ratepayers, in a statement.

Consumers is the largest gas utility in Michigan, operating nearly 31,000 miles of pipeline across the Lower Peninsula.

“Consumers Energy is committed to our customers. That means we’re upgrading the system that delivers natural gas safely and reliably to over 1.8 million homes and businesses while recognizing our responsibility to keep bills affordable,” said utility spokesperson Brian Wheeler in a statement.

The pace of its rate case filings reflects a need to invest in its gas system for safe and affordable service for customers, he added. Gas rates today are below Midwest and national averages, Wheeler said.

The utility request comes two and a half months after regulators approved its last rate hike, effective Nov. 1 and totaling $157 million.

That amount was 36% less than Consumers’ initial $248 million ask. It amounted to an 8.1% monthly increase, or $6.44, for a residential customer with typical usage.

If approved in its entirety, the latest rate increase request would mean the average residential natural gas customer would pay $3.14 per day for service in 2027, according to Consumers filings.

Utilities have tripled spending in recent years as they replace decades-old gas infrastructure.

If the trajectory continues, the three largest gas providers — Consumers Energy, DTE Energy and SEMCO Energy Gas Co. — are on track to invest nearly $60 billion through 2050, according to a Citizens Utility Board report that warned the hefty sum could burden customer bills.

Environmental groups have also used rate cases to question whether the spending could also lock Michigan into reliance on natural gas, a fossil fuel composed primarily of methane, with potent planet-warming effects.

Consumers has argued replacing legacy piping with modern materials reduces methane leaks, cutting emissions.

[TITLE]New £150m funding package to protect jobs at Grangemouth:
[TEXT]
New £150m funding package to protect jobs at Grangemouth

8 hours ago Share Save David Henderson , Scotland news correspondent and Graeme Ogston , Tayside and central reporter Share Save

PA Media The UK government and Ineos are to invest a combined £150m in the plant

A £150m support package has been announced for the Grangemouth industrial complex. The UK government will invest £125m and owners Ineos will contribute £25m to support 500 jobs at the site. Scottish secretary Douglas Alexander told the BBC the joint deal was a "stark contrast" to the closure-hit Mossmoran chemical plant. He criticised ExxonMobil for lack of investment in the Fife site, which is due to close in February with the loss of up to 400 jobs.

Alexander said the funding was effectively "bridging finance", in the hopes that the plant would be profitable in five years after £100m was spent to keep it open in the past year. He added that Ineos were able to commit to "five years of ethylene production at the facility." Grangemouth is the UK's last ethylene plant, a key ingredient in plastics used in advanced manufacturing and the automotive and aerospace industries. In addition to ethylene, the plant's core products are propylene, polyethylene, and polypropylene.

PA Media Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander visited the plant following the announcement

These materials are used in a wide variety of products, including packaging, insulation, cables, construction materials, pharmaceuticals and healthcare products, including PPE and syringes. The complex uses shale gas brought in by ship from the United States to produce ethylene. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would protect jobs and ensure places like Grangemouth can develop into the future. He said: "Our commitment is clear; to back British industry, to stand by hardworking families, and to ensure places like Grangemouth can thrive for years to come."

The UK government said that it had underwritten £75m in finance provided by NatWest. The government said it was providing the remainder of the funding via a grant - to take the total to £125m - with Ineos providing equity to make up the remainder of the £150m total. Chancellor Rachel Reeves visited the plant following the announcement, along with Alexander and Business secretary Peter Kyle. Reeves said: "Building on the millions of pounds we've already invested in Grangemouth, this vital package protects our national resilience and secures the livelihoods of hundreds of people employed at the site way into the future."

The site stands next to the Grangemouth oil refinery. In April, it stopped processing crude oil and moved to being an import terminal for finished fuels, with the loss of 400 jobs. Ineos chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe had earlier warned the chemical industry was coming to an end in Britain due to high energy costs and carbon taxes. He said the new investment package demonstrated Ineos and the UK government's commitment to British manufacturing. "It protects 500 high-value jobs, secures supply chains, and preserves the industrial capacity the nation needs," he said. "The support of the UK government is welcome as we work to deliver competitive and efficient low-carbon manufacturing for the UK, long term."

PA Media Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the investment would protect 500 jobs

Grangemouth community councillor Steven Aitkenhead told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live that the news was a "glimmer of hope." He said: "Grangemouth itself is experiencing huge social difficulties at the moment and could be classed as a social emergency. "So this news that securing and safeguarding jobs in the town is very welcome. "We hope that all the opportunities that come to the town through the Just Transition improves the lives of people who live in Grangemouth and the local area."

Snack bar owner Brenda Bolton said most of her customers are employed at the plant

Brenda Bolton, owner of the Rumbling Tum snack van which has served workers at the site for more than 30 years, said her business had more than halved since the 400 oil refinery job losses. She said: "I took to social media to build up the business and keep my staff in jobs. "The news of new jobs being generated is great for us and everybody round about here. "A customer did say 'I've heard on the radio there's an announcement for new jobs in Ineos so I hope that's great for you guys.'" But Ms Bolton said she was cautious about the security of the area's long-term future. She added: "There's been things promised in the past that have never transpired, so we'll believe that when we see it. "Hopefully it does generate more business for myself and other businesses round about."

PA Media Business secretary Peter Kyle (second left) and Mr Alexander (third left) also toured the plant

Earlier, the Scottish Secretary told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme that the UK government was "determined to protect chemical production in Grangemouth". Alexander said: "This petrochemical facility is of strategic significance, not just to Scotland, but to the whole of the UK. "It is a critical element of the supply chain to a whole range of industries."

In recent months there has been concern about the future of the UK petrochemical industry due to the rising cost of energy. Last month, ExxonMobil announced plans to close part of the Mossmorran chemical plant in Fife, impacting 179 directly employed jobs and 250 contractors. The company said the high cost of energy at the plant, which also produces ethylene for the plastics industry, was partly to blame for the decision. The UK government has warned that high energy costs have caused problems for the chemicals industry across Europe. It said about 40% of ethylene gas capacity has either closed recently or is at risk of closure.

Alexander criticised ExxonMobil's leadership and said there had been a "stark contrast in the dialogue and discussions" over the future of the Mossmoran site. He said: "When we sat down with Jim Ratcliffe it was pretty clear what was needed in order to be able to deliver a future for the chemical facility in Grangemouth. "There had been significant Ineos investment in the plant. "In contrast, the Mossmorran facility is now 40 years old, it was built to have a 20 year lifecycle. "Alas, there hasn't been the scale of investment that many of us would wished to see in Mossmorran over recent years. "The management were not able to give us a pathway to profitability."

parliamentlive.tv ExxonMobil chairman Paul Greenwood was asked about the Grangemouth investment during a session of the Scottish Affairs Committee

ExxonMobil chairman Paul Greenwood has previously partly blamed UK government policy for the decision and said there was no "competitive future" for the site. On Wednesday Mr Greenwood told the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster that the current environment was "very difficult" to operate in the UK at the moment. Douglas McAllister MP asked Mr Greenwood if the new investment announcement on Grangemouth "flew in the face" of that view and if Mr Ratcliffe and others were experiencing the same environment he described. Mr Greenwood agreed, but added: "If you stand back and you look at the facts, I think you turn around and you say, Prax refinery has shut. Grangemouth refinery has shut. Fife ethylene plant has shut. "The government has now effectively had to inject some money and capital into another chemical plant in order to keep it operating. "I think those are signs of an industry that's struggling, not signs of an industry that's thriving." Mr Greenwood said Exxon Mobil had invested £270m into the Mossmorran site over the previous five years, but had made a £300m loss over the same period. He said there had been both "formal and informal" discussions about a potential sale of the site, but there was no "viable" takeover offer.

PA Media Unite said governments in the UK and Scotland had done "too little too late" after the Grangemouth oil refinery announced its closure

Giving evidence to the same committee, Bob McGregor, industrial officer for the Unite union, disagreed that Mossmorran was not commercially viable and urged both governments to intervene. He said: "The plant is one of the youngest ethylene plants in Europe, it has a dedicated workforce. "Yes, it needs investment, but I'm sure that investment could come from a company who's making £25bn, the third best year in the history of their business." Mr McGregor said that there had been "a lot of kind words and soundbites", but said he had not seen "any real tangible evidence" of support from either government. Responding to the evidence, Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said the Scottish government's priority was to secure a sustainable future for the site at Mossmorran and workers at the plant. She said she had been working to secure new opportunities for the Fife plant and its workforce, but encouraged the UK government to intervene.

'Much-needed boost'

The UK and Scottish governments have been scrambling to reduce the impact of recent job losses in the chemicals sector. They made a joint commitment to supporting a green energy hub at Grangemouth, on part of the site left vacant by the refinery closure. The Scottish government welcomed the new investment. Climate and energy secretary Gillian Martin said: "The Scottish government has been calling upon UK government for months now to intervene to protect jobs at Grangemouth and Mossmorran at a scale seen in other parts of the UK."

[TITLE]Ireland needs to break link with fossil fuels, says SEAI:
[TEXT]
A new report from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) says that although energy related emissions in Ireland have fallen by 16% since 2018, the country has not broken the link between economic growth and fossil fuel use in a meaningful way.

The SEAI says Ireland needs to double down on decarbonisation, especially in transport, which is still 93% powered by fossil fuels.

Ireland is legally obliged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030.

SEAI Energy in Ireland 2025 report notes total energy-related emissions have fallen to the lowest level in over 30 years.

Ireland's national energy-related emissions in 2023 were at their lowest level in over 30 years

This has been despite a 10% growth in the population, 18% growth in electricity demand, and strong growth in the economy.

However, it warns this is not enough to achieve the 2030 targets.

The average fall in emissions is just 2.7% per year but needs to be 5% to reach the target.

Read the report in full here

Heat pumps

The SEAI says the key levers for faster progress include more wind and solar, heat pumps, home energy upgrades, expanded public and active travel, district heating and a strengthened electricity grid.

The report shows that heat pumps in Ireland delivered more renewable energy last year than all solar farms and rooftop solar panels combined.

Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are down 5.3% compared with 2018.

That is an average of 0.9% per year which is well below the reduction rate needed to stay on target.

SEAI says a significant shift from private car use to active travel and public transport is needed, particularly for shorter journeys.

Heat pumps are among the key levers for faster progress, the SEAI said

It notes that positive progress has been made in public and active transport infrastructure, with the rollout of cycleways, Local Link, BusConnects, and the sign-off of DART+ and the Luas extension.

It says this investment needs to continue with the delivery of further projects, including the long-awaited MetroLink.

The biggest and fastest reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have been delivered by the electricity generation sector.

[TITLE]Analysis: Costly gas and infrastructure are driving Virginia’s soaring power bills:
[TEXT]
By David Kelly, EDF Senior Director – Mid-Atlantic Region

Virginians are facing rising costs on multiple fronts, and electric bills are no exception. Virginia’s electric bills are increasing at a pace faster than general inflation and, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), bills have increased nearly 30% since 2021. It’s easy to understand the growing frustration, as some Virginians are forced to choose between paying for doctor’s visits and prescription drugs – or even food – over their electric bill.

Drawing on Dominion Energy’s and Appalachian Power’s own filings at the State Corporation Commission (the agency that oversees utility investments and regulates ratemaking in Virginia), a new analysis from EQ Research underscores that volatile fossil fuel prices and skyrocketing utility investment in power system infrastructure are the primary drivers behind surging electricity costs for Virginia households.

While not explicitly addressed in this report, we’d be remiss, as we consider cost drivers, not to highlight that data centers represent a significant element of the need for new power system infrastructure. As the Joint Legislative and Review Commission (JLARC) data center report pointed out, this booming industry brings economic benefits to the state, but comes with cost impacts to Virginia’s electric customers. Just recently, the SCC issued an order aimed at corralling transmission and distribution system costs brought on by data center energy demand. By requiring data centers and other large users to pay a minimum of 85% of contracted distribution and transmission demand, and 60% of generation demand, among other requirements, the SCC order seeks to protect Virginia ratepayers from those costs.

While the SCC’s order is notable, the consequences to customers in a more fossil-fuel focused future are clear: the more utilities seek to invest in gas power plants and associated infrastructure, the more Virginia households will remain financially tethered to a price-volatile and increasingly expensive energy system. Meanwhile renewable energy, particularly solar paired with battery storage, is the most affordable, most rapidly-scalable energy resource available to meet Virginia’s energy needs while keeping electricity prices in check.

What the Numbers Say

The data, taken from Dominion and ApCo’s own filings with the State Corporation Commission, paints a clear picture of what’s driving up Virginians’ electric bills.

Analysis of utility filings between January 1, 2019, and April 1, 2025, shows:

Residential rates have increased significantly in both Dominion (20.5%) and ApCo’s (45.4%) service territories since January 2019. (See Figure 1)

While base rates have remained relatively stable, rate riders to cover the costs of powerplant fuel and grid infrastructure spending have significantly increased residential customer costs in both Dominion and ApCo’s service territories.

Fuel costs – what the utility pays for natural gas – increased 62.5% , distribution costs increased 123.1%, and transmission costs increased 82.0% in ApCo’s service territory over the analysis period (See Figure 4)

In Dominion’s service territory, non-renewable generation costs decreased 13.0% over the analysis period, but the trend in non-renewable generation costs over time shows a 73% spike in fuel costs beginning in 2022 and carrying into 2023 . Distribution costs increased by 66.0% and transmission costs increased by 49.0% in Dominion’s service territory over the analysis period.

Reliance on Gas is Fueling a Rate Hike Rollercoaster

The utilities’ own SCC filings make it clear: the cost of fuel to run fossil power plants is a primary driver of price instability and rising cost for Virginia households. Nevertheless, Dominion continues to prioritize new fossil fuel investments. This piece of the energy equation is simple: When fuel prices spike, so do customers’ bills. When gas fuel prices jumped in 2022–23, Virginia households and businesses saw their bills spike. And with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting gas prices to more than double in 2026, up from 2024 prices, that’s bad news for Virginians looking for energy affordability solutions – especially heading into cold winter months when rising demand for electricity to keep homes warm is already promising higher than usual electricity bills.

Energy Affordability and the Transition to Clean

One of the ways Virginia’s electric utilities generate a profit is through a guaranteed return on equity (ROE) for their investment in major infrastructure projects like power plants. While state policy might specify that electric power should be delivered to customers at the least cost, incentives in the electricity market encourage utilities to pursue the most expensive projects they can get the SCC to approve.

By requiring that utilities shift investment toward price-stable, affordable clean energy solutions, policies like the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) help stabilize rates in the near term and keep downward pressure on energy costs for the long haul, with the added benefit of driving down climate and health-harming air pollution from the electric power sector. Analysis of ApCo’s and Dominion’s SCC filings shows that VCEA costs make up a relatively small fraction of the average customer’s monthly bill and are dwarfed by the significant cost increases customers are experiencing due to the utilities’ reliance on gas power plants and ballooning investment in grid infrastructure build out.

Moreover, ApCo itself announced in October that they were in a rare position to lower customer bills by a whopping 24% because of a ramp-up of renewable energy use. As ApCo explained in its

[TITLE]‘We’re in a better place’: Has the time for a unified global carbon market finally arrived?:
[TEXT]
Our subcommittee spent six months consulting with economists and climate policy experts to try to identify carbon markets’ role today. The role of carbon markets goes back to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, which sought to put an emissions cap on richer countries. No global market resulted, although the creation of the European Union ETS [Emissions Trading System, the internal system that European nations use among themselves] was a major achievement. The Paris Agreement later moved towards promoting voluntary participation by countries including by “nationally determined contributions,” which may involve carbon pricing and compliance markets, typically domestically.

In our work we also explored what we would call the voluntary carbon market, which is the main market through which cost-effective abatement options from low-income countries get traded.

How do you see carbon markets advancing the goal of reducing emissions globally? And why have they fallen short in the decade since the Paris Agreement?

Rohini Pande: To limit global warming we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And most greenhouse gas emissions are linked to fossil fuels, the most common energy source in most countries. There is also a pretty much 1-to-1 relationship between increases in GDP or economic prosperity and energy use. And so, the main reason it’s been hard to consider transitions away from fossil fuels has been the belief of a huge trade-off between economic growth — especially for lower-income countries — and energy consumption.

Renewable energy sources are cheaper now, showing more promise. However, these energy sources have large upfront costs, which makes them particularly difficult for low-income countries. One of my colleagues on the report found that the countries with the most sunshine are the ones with the least solar power: they’re closer to the equator, low-income, and have a high cost of financing.

How can carbon markets help solve these problems? Well, a specific reduction in emissions into the atmosphere — or removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, say one tonne of CO2 in each case — has the same climate benefit, wherever it takes place. And since we have limited funding for investment in decarbonization, we can best reduce climate damage by investing in the best value decarbonization projects — the ones that achieve the biggest reduction in CO2 per dollar spent — first. That’s best done in a global market that lets buyers compare all decarbonization projects.

That’s the theory. In practice, it’s difficult to measure reduced emissions — and often the buyer is not in a position to know what happened across the globe. If I buy a tonne of lead, for example, I can have it delivered to my door. I can weigh and inspect its quality. If I invest in reducing carbon emissions by one tonne — or reducing atmospheric carbon by the same amount — often I can’t observe that reduction directly. And often it’s hard to measure what would have happened in a world where I hadn’t paid to curb deforestation, or how to handle a forest fire in an area I paid to preserve.

If I want my market to be credible, everyone involved must be certain that market participants’ measurements and calculations are correct — and that there are ways to fix unexpected problems. This requires standardizing measurement and verification procedures — and preventing systemic conflicts of interest.

So identifying ways to have a carbon market that spans rich and poor countries could have significant benefits. This would enable climate financing for high-return, low-cost choices like renewable grids and deforestation prevention in these countries. But you have to solve these questions of measurement, implementation, and credibility — often in low-income contexts, with low state capacity. So that’s what we’re trying to do.

How are market forces uniquely equipped to address the complex economic, political, and geographic challenges of climate change?

Pande: First, while low-income countries offer low-cost abatement opportunities that can help the whole world, we need to ensure the growth they need to pull their populations out of poverty isn’t hurt. So, for example, if reducing future emissions involves shutting down one low-productivity carbon-intensive economic process — like deforestation — we also need to ensure that that economic process is replaced by a cleaner one that provides an equivalent growth path.

Second, if we want to use a market to hit global emissions reductions targets by decarbonizing globally at the lowest cost, we need a market structure that enables that. And that would be a compliance market with a required, coordinated cap, not a voluntary market.

Explain the difference. What are some examples of the kind of trading you might find on the voluntary carbon market? And in a compliance market?

Pande: Well, in the voluntary market, let’s say a company like Meta or Google decides to offset emissions from large data centers by reducing emissions somewhere else in the world. They might approach, say, a Brazilian company that’s in the business of reforestation and say, “Can we pay you to reforest enough land that it actually, over the next 30 years, reduces emissions by X amount?” And that would then be the amount they can offset their own emissions.

One drawback with this model is that it’s completely voluntary: companies must decide to participate, and there’s no mandate for how much these companies should bring down their own emissions over time. Even if a company hits its own net-zero target, this doesn’t take us to a global net zero. Further, emissions could go up if the firm changes their mind or if they pay for a program that doesn’t work out as intended. This feeds into the challenge I mentioned earlier that buyers often can’t check the quality of the product. The consequence of all these issues is that credits trade at very low prices — and the market just doesn’t enable investment at scale.

Contrast this with compliance markets like EU-ETS [the European Union’s Emissions Trading System]. Here a set of companies — usually large industrial firms — are required as a group to maintain their emissions under a legally mandated cap, that reduces every year towards an agreed target. Firms are issued or buy permits to pollute and can trade them. This market structure — combined with the fact that industrial emissions are relatively easy to measure — ensures that the best-value decarbonization projects are funded and happen first and that targets are hit. The problem is that, right now, these markets only exist at a national or regional scale. And they either don’t include, or allow only small quotas of, nature-based or renewables projects. This is because of the fear that the problems of measurement and implementation I’ve mentioned linked to these projects will reduce the credibility of the entire market.

Our ultimate aim is to bring together all these piecemeal elements in one unified global compliance market.

Why do you think it’s possible to build a unified global carbon market now, when it hasn’t happened so far?

Pande: The market that was put in place in the Kyoto Protocol was a first attempt at building a global compliance market, but we didn’t know how to do it well and didn’t have all the technology we do today. But now we’re in a better place. First, we see that a lot more countries — both rich and lower-income — are putting in place the basic architecture for compliance markets. In addition, we have seen what we would describe as a measurement and credibility revolution in the sciences and social sciences, whereby we can use better satellite imagery, better remote sensing techniques, machine learning, and data science. And I think there is a better understanding of how to construct counterfactuals [hypothetical models that simulate climate outcomes without human interference] to measure a project’s emissions reduction potential. It’s also much easier to share data for transparency.

A financial economist on our team noted that there have also been advances in the kinds of financial contracts you can write so that risk can be managed. People talk

[TITLE]Analysis: Costly gas and infrastructure are driving Virginia’s soaring power bills:
[TEXT]
By David Kelly, EDF Senior Director – Mid-Atlantic Region

Virginians are facing rising costs on multiple fronts, and electric bills are no exception. Virginia’s electric bills are increasing at a pace faster than general inflation and, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), bills have increased nearly 30% since 2021. It’s easy to understand the growing frustration, as some Virginians are forced to choose between paying for doctor’s visits and prescription drugs – or even food – over their electric bill.

Drawing on Dominion Energy’s and Appalachian Power’s own filings at the State Corporation Commission (the agency that oversees utility investments and regulates ratemaking in Virginia), a new analysis from EQ Research underscores that volatile fossil fuel prices and skyrocketing utility investment in power system infrastructure are the primary drivers behind surging electricity costs for Virginia households.

While not explicitly addressed in this report, we’d be remiss, as we consider cost drivers, not to highlight that data centers represent a significant element of the need for new power system infrastructure. As the Joint Legislative and Review Commission (JLARC) data center report pointed out, this booming industry brings economic benefits to the state, but comes with cost impacts to Virginia’s electric customers. Just recently, the SCC issued an order aimed at corralling transmission and distribution system costs brought on by data center energy demand. By requiring data centers and other large users to pay a minimum of 85% of contracted distribution and transmission demand, and 60% of generation demand, among other requirements, the SCC order seeks to protect Virginia ratepayers from those costs.

While the SCC’s order is notable, the consequences to customers in a more fossil-fuel focused future are clear: the more utilities seek to invest in gas power plants and associated infrastructure, the more Virginia households will remain financially tethered to a price-volatile and increasingly expensive energy system. Meanwhile renewable energy, particularly solar paired with battery storage, is the most affordable, most rapidly-scalable energy resource available to meet Virginia’s energy needs while keeping electricity prices in check.

What the Numbers Say

The data, taken from Dominion and ApCo’s own filings with the State Corporation Commission, paints a clear picture of what’s driving up Virginians’ electric bills.

Analysis of utility filings between January 1, 2019, and April 1, 2025, shows:

Residential rates have increased significantly in both Dominion (20.5%) and ApCo’s (45.4%) service territories since January 2019. (See Figure 1)

While base rates have remained relatively stable, rate riders to cover the costs of powerplant fuel and grid infrastructure spending have significantly increased residential customer costs in both Dominion and ApCo’s service territories.

Fuel costs – what the utility pays for natural gas – increased 62.5% , distribution costs increased 123.1%, and transmission costs increased 82.0% in ApCo’s service territory over the analysis period (See Figure 4)

In Dominion’s service territory, non-renewable generation costs decreased 13.0% over the analysis period, but the trend in non-renewable generation costs over time shows a 73% spike in fuel costs beginning in 2022 and carrying into 2023 . Distribution costs increased by 66.0% and transmission costs increased by 49.0% in Dominion’s service territory over the analysis period.

Reliance on Gas is Fueling a Rate Hike Rollercoaster

The utilities’ own SCC filings make it clear: the cost of fuel to run fossil power plants is a primary driver of price instability and rising cost for Virginia households. Nevertheless, Dominion continues to prioritize new fossil fuel investments. This piece of the energy equation is simple: When fuel prices spike, so do customers’ bills. When gas fuel prices jumped in 2022–23, Virginia households and businesses saw their bills spike. And with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting gas prices to more than double in 2026, up from 2024 prices, that’s bad news for Virginians looking for energy affordability solutions – especially heading into cold winter months when rising demand for electricity to keep homes warm is already promising higher than usual electricity bills.

Energy Affordability and the Transition to Clean

One of the ways Virginia’s electric utilities generate a profit is through a guaranteed return on equity (ROE) for their investment in major infrastructure projects like power plants. While state policy might specify that electric power should be delivered to customers at the least cost, incentives in the electricity market encourage utilities to pursue the most expensive projects they can get the SCC to approve.

By requiring that utilities shift investment toward price-stable, affordable clean energy solutions, policies like the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) help stabilize rates in the near term and keep downward pressure on energy costs for the long haul, with the added benefit of driving down climate and health-harming air pollution from the electric power sector. Analysis of ApCo’s and Dominion’s SCC filings shows that VCEA costs make up a relatively small fraction of the average customer’s monthly bill and are dwarfed by the significant cost increases customers are experiencing due to the utilities’ reliance on gas power plants and ballooning investment in grid infrastructure build out.

Moreover, ApCo itself announced in October that they were in a rare position to lower customer bills by a whopping 24% because of a ramp-up of renewable energy use. As ApCo explained in its

[TITLE]Consumers Energy asks to increase gas rates for fourth year in a row:

LANSING, MI - Consumers Energy is again beginning the process of raising natural gas rates, on the first day it is permitted to under Michigan law and for the fourth year in a row.

The utility serving half of Michigan’s gas customers filed paperwork on Tuesday, Dec. 16 requesting to increase rates by $240 million.

Average monthly bills for residential customers would increase 8.2% if approved in full by regulators with the Michigan Public Service Commission, according to Consumers filings.

Instead, regulators often reduce utility requests after a monthslong legal process involving scrutiny from outside groups, known as a “rate case.” New rates won’t show up on customer bills until late next year.

Michigan law makes utilities wait one full year between rate hike applications. Consumers has done so down to the day. For four years running, its gas rate requests have landed on the first business day it is able to formally submit them, falling in mid-December.

Some consumer watchdogs call that pace “troubling.”

“Consumers Energy has created a revolving door of rate increases by filing annually in recent years. This case continues that trend,” said Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, a nonprofit advocating for residential ratepayers, in a statement.

Consumers is the largest gas utility in Michigan, operating nearly 31,000 miles of pipeline across the Lower Peninsula.

“Consumers Energy is committed to our customers. That means we’re upgrading the system that delivers natural gas safely and reliably to over 1.8 million homes and businesses while recognizing our responsibility to keep bills affordable,” said utility spokesperson Brian Wheeler in a statement.

The pace of its rate case filings reflects a need to invest in its gas system for safe and affordable service for customers, he added. Gas rates today are below Midwest and national averages, Wheeler said.

The utility request comes two and a half months after regulators approved its last rate hike, effective Nov. 1 and totaling $157 million.

That amount was 36% less than Consumers’ initial $248 million ask. It amounted to an 8.1% monthly increase, or $6.44, for a residential customer with typical usage.

If approved in its entirety, the latest rate increase request would mean the average residential natural gas customer would pay $3.14 per day for service in 2027, according to Consumers filings.

Utilities have tripled spending in recent years as they replace decades-old gas infrastructure.

If the trajectory continues, the three largest gas providers — Consumers Energy, DTE Energy and SEMCO Energy Gas Co. — are on track to invest nearly $60 billion through 2050, according to a Citizens Utility Board report that warned the hefty sum could burden customer bills.

Environmental groups have also used rate cases to question whether the spending could also lock Michigan into reliance on natural gas, a fossil fuel composed primarily of methane, with potent planet-warming effects.

Consumers has argued replacing legacy piping with modern materials reduces methane leaks, cutting emissions.
