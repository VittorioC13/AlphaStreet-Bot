Global shares were mostly lower Wednesday on selling of technology shares following a lackluster day on Wall Street.

France's CAC 40 fell 0.5 per cent in early trading to 8,213.90. The German DAX dipped 0.3 per cent to 24,251.58. Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.6 per cent to 9,487.52.

In Asian trading, Chinese markets retreated after US President Donald Trump cast doubt on whether or not he will meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month.

“Maybe it won't happen, maybe it won't happen,” he said while hosting a lunch for Republican Party senators at the White House.

MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) — World shares were mixed on Thursday following a retreat on Wall Street, while crude prices jumped more than $2 after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Russian oil giants.

The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil are intended to drive Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and help end Moscow’s brutal war on Ukraine.

Meanwhile, European Union leaders were holding a summit Thursday, aiming to greenlight still more sanctions against Russia and press ahead with plans to use Moscow’s assets that are frozen in Europe to fund Ukraine’s war effort and economy for at least the next two years.

U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $2.70 to $61.21 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose $2.85 to $65.44 per barrel.

The future for the S & P 500 was up more than 0.1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%.

In early European trading, Germany's DAX slipped 0.3% to 24,083.89. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.1% to 9,527.33, while in Paris, the CAC 40 rose 0.4% to 8,238.47.

Chinese shares rose from losses earlier in the day as leaders in Beijing were wrapping up an important Communist Party meeting that will set the agenda for the coming five years.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 0.7% to 25,967.98 while the Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.2% to 3,922.41 as reports indicated Washington may tighten restrictions on exports to China of products made using U.S. software.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 shed nearly 1.4% to 48,641.61 on reports that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing a stimulus package larger than last year’s of nearly 14 trillion yen (about $92 billion). SoftBank Group led losers, with shares shedding more than 4% after it unveiled plans to finance its investments in artificial intelligence by issuing U.S. dollar and euro dominated bonds.

Takaichi has also said she favors keeping interest rates near their current low level of close to zero, and that has caused the Japanese yen to weaken against the dollar. The dollar rose to 152.59 Japanese yen Thursday, up from 151.94 yen.

South Korea's Kospi fell 1% to 3,845.56, with investors remaining cautious while trade negotiations with the U.S. made limited progress.

Australia's S & P/ASX 200 added less than 0.1% to 9,032.80.

Taiwan's Taiex slipped 0.4%, while India's BSE Sensex rose 0.6%.

On Wednesday, the S & P 500 sank 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7%, from its record set the day before. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.

Netflix helped drag the market lower after delivering a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The pressure is on the video streamer and on companies broadly to deliver solid growth in profits. That would counter criticism that their stock prices shot too high following a 35% romp for the S & P 500 from a low in April.

Capital One Financial rose 1.5%, and Western Alliance Bancorp climbed 3.2% following their own profit updates that beat analysts’ expectations. The report from Western Alliance was particularly welcome after it helped shake confidence in the industry last week. It’s one of several banks that had warned of potentially bad loans on its books, possibly because of fraud.

Beyond Meat, meanwhile, swung sharply through a manic Wednesday. After surging as much as 112% in the morning, its stock erased all of that to finish with a drop of 1.1%. It’s still up 454.5% for the week so far in the midst of its meme-stock run.

The maker of plant-based meat alternatives was the biggest holding in the Roundhill Meme Stock exchange-traded fund, as of Tuesday. The ETF holds stocks where investors have piled in because they’re hoping to catch a wave of momentum, almost regardless of how or even what the businesses themselves are doing.

In other dealings early Thursday, the price of gold recovered about 1.6% to $4,131.80 after sliding for two days from its record high.

The euro slipped to $1.1595 from $1.1610.

[TITLE]Wall Street climbs to the cusp of records as oil prices jump:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose to the cusp of their records on Thursday, as oil prices jumped after President Donald Trump announced “massive” new sanctions on Russia’s crude industry.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and crept back within 0.2% of its all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 144 points, or 0.3%, and finished just below its own record set earlier this week, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%.

Companies in the oil and gas business led the way, including gains of 1.1% for Exxon Mobil, 3.1% for ConocoPhillips and 3.4% for Diamondback Energy. They rose with prices for crude, which leaped roughly 5.5% after Trump announced sanctions against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil.

The hope is to convince Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to end the brutal war with Ukraine, and sanctions could constrict the global flow of oil. The jumps helped oil prices recover some of their sharp recent losses, taken because of expectations for supplies of crude in inventories to remain plentiful. Oil prices are still down more than 10% for the year so far.

Also helping to drive the stock market higher were strong profit reports from several big U.S. companies, as the reporting season ramps up for their profits during the summer. The majority are topping Wall Street’s forecasts, as is usually the case.

Dow jumped 12.9%, and Las Vegas Sands rallied 12.4% after both delivered stronger earnings than analysts expected. Tesla shook off an early loss to climb 2.3% after reporting a weaker profit but also stronger revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

The pressure is on companies broadly to deliver solid growth in profits. That would counter criticism that their stock prices shot too high following a 35% romp for the S&P 500 from a low in April.

On the losing end of Wall Street, Molina Healthcare tumbled 17.5% after its profit for the latest quarter fell well short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Joseph Zubretsky cited a challenging environment for medical costs, and insurers across the industry have been warning about rising medical costs throughout the year.

IBM fell 0.9%, despite reporting better profit and revenue than analysts expected. Wall Street focused instead on weaker-than-expected results for its Red Hat business, which provides open-source software products.

All told, the S&P 500 rose 39.04 points to 6,738.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 144.20 to 46,734.61, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 201.40 to 22,941.80.

In the gold market, prices strengthened to halt a sharp recent slide. The price for an ounce climbed 2% to $4,145.60 per ounce.

[TITLE]City-States Without Limits – Part 2:
[TEXT]
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity.

In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.”

The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs.

The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain).

The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin.

By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means.

We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments.

At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring
