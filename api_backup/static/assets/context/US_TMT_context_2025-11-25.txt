Despite the consolidation phase, Nifty is trading below its intrinsic value, says Nimesh Chandan , CIO of Bajaj Finserv Asset Management. He believes this undervaluation presents a strong entry point for investors, with earnings growth expected to accelerate in FY26–27. Chandan is bullish on BFSI consumption , pharma, chemicals, and home improvement as key sectors for generating alpha.The current equity market setup reflects a phase of consolidation, yet underlying fundamentals are improving. We are seeing an acceleration in economic growth; corporate earnings growth is improving; steps taken on the fiscal side and the monetary side are showing their impact on the demand or consumption side. We are likely to see higher capacity utilisation in the corporate sector, and that will encourage private capex. We hope that India will be able to sign a favourable trade agreement with the US and the EU and trigger a revival in exports too.While global uncertainties persist, with the combination of strong earnings momentum, resilient domestic demand, and bottom-up opportunities across large, mid, and small caps, we believe the markets are poised for an upcycle from here on.Over the past 12–14 months, the Indian equity market witnessed net selling by FIIs. There were multiple factors at play – a slowdown in corporate earnings, geopolitical issues, higher valuation comfort in some other emerging nations, and uncertainty around US trade tariffs. While the lack of AI-focused plays is one among these multiple reasons, we do not see it as a key deterrent of FII flows. India has always offered strong diversification to global portfolios due to its unique demographics, faster economic growth, and a diversified basket of high-quality businesses.After a substantial relative underperformance over the past 12–15 months versus the emerging market index, Indian markets now offer an improved growth-valuation dynamic for global investors. India presents a unique investment case today – strong growth prospects, robust balance sheets, and a stable government. As the emerging market bull cycle enters its next phase, a high-quality market like India should see a rebound in capital flows. A likely earnings upcycle in H2FY26 and FY27 could provide a further fillip.It is a fact that India is not seen as one of the pioneering nations in AI-related developments. However, it is too early to draw conclusions

India's emerging electric car market remains under the shadow of Chinese imports as the manufacturers continue to rely on the world's largest exporter for key components such as semiconductors, batteries and magnets. A report in the Times of India reveals that only six of every 46 (around 13%) electric vehicle (EV) models sold in India have been found eligible for benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme of the government, as they meet the domestic value-addition mandates.The rest 87% EV models in India were marked ineligible for PLI as they carried imported content more than the stipulated levels with the vast part of components coming in from China, sources told TOI.As per the Ministry of Heavy Industries' PLI Scheme for automobile companies and auto components released in September 2021, automakers are required to meet a minimum 50% domestic value addition (DVA) and follow Phased Manufacturing Programme similar to FAME-II Scheme. The government provides a relaxation on import of battery cells that takes the DVA cut-off lower to 40%As per TOI's sources, the government has approved six models under the scheme, including five car models from Tata Motors and one from Mahindra . "All the other models sold in the market, including from companies such as JSW MG, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Citroen, VinFast, Volvo, Tesla and Audi, have over 60% imported content," the source said.The EV models that have gained from the PLI scheme are - Tata Punch , Tata Nexon, and Tata Harrier SUVs, Tata Tiago hatch, and Tata Tigor sedan, along with Mahindra XEV9E.Tata's popular EV Curvv and Mahindra BE6 green did not meet PLI's local value addition criteria, despite other models from the autogiants making the cut.Officials from companies whose models did not make the cut told TOI that meeting the DVA criteria at such a nascent stage of EV adoption remains challenging. "The local supply ecosystem for EVs is still not as evolved as it is in the internal-combustion engine (ICE) category. Also, with limited sales of the greens, it is quite challenging and practically unviable to ask our supply chain partners to come to India," a top functionary at a leading European automaker told TOI.EV makers in India import a range of auto components from China and Taiwan, some of which are key elements to make the industry function smoothly."These include lithium-ion battery cells; rare earth magnets; DC Motors; laminated stators; semiconductor chips; printed circuit boards, and electronic child parts, all of which are coming from China," an industry executive said, citing a PwC study on localisation of EV component supply chain in India. "Then you have connectors; contactors; relays, and DC-DC converters which come from China and Taiwan," the executive said.The government launched the PLI scheme in view of the need to reduce exposure to supply chain volatility and drive localisation in the production of EVs. The PWc study emphasises that a strong push from various Government initiatives over the next few years to create an enabling local ecosystem, coupled with the need for EV OEMs to stabilise and control the ever-growing spend on EV components , will drive localisation of the EV supply chain in India.The PLI scheme aims to build 50 GWh of manufacturing capacity with 60% value addition over a period of 5 years. However, the pace at which this capacity grows may be slow due to the high investments required and the complexities involved in cell manufacturing.Localisation has always been a strong mandate for India’s automotive sector due to numerous inherent advantages, the study mentioned, adding that global tensions and COVID-led disruptions in the auto sector have reinforced the need for developing strong local supply chains.The localisation of EV manufacturing in India is particularly challenging due to the nature of components, assembly lines and the available infrastructure in India. As per estimates by PwC, previously non-existent components such as batteries with advanced chemistry, electric motors, power electronics and software now make up at least 50–60% of an EV, most of which are not present in India.Most of the locally manufactured motors are currently relying on Chinese imports for child parts to ensure commercial viability, with limited local value addition in brushless DC (BLDC) motors. While India will have to import rare earth magnets from China, other components such as laminated stators, are also mainly Chinese imports. China and Taiwan control majority of the global supplies of electric components like connectors, contactors, relays and DC-DC convertors, which are important parts of an EV high-voltage circuit.In addition to this, the black box assembly locks in a significant value in EV manufacturing, but is difficult to localise without the support of tier-1 manufacturers or in-house capabilities.India's auto sector continues to rely heavily on Chinese imports, which give rise to volatility and price hikes for the industry. While the government is taking crucial steps to boost localisation of EV production, private players can also play a key role with collaboration and investment to make India an EV superpower.

[TITLE]Customer and AI-driven network investments: Red Hat's role in TM Forum catalyst project:
[TEXT]
Telecommunication service providers face the challenge of maximizing return on investment (ROI) on massive 5G investments. Efficient infrastructure deployment is particularly difficult in areas with real-time demand fluctuations, such as stadiums and tourist spots. One key challenge lies in comprehending usage patterns and connectivity performance from the end-user's perspective.

A new paradigm is emerging: Customer and AI-driven network investments. This paradigm is being realized as a TM Forum catalyst project to build an AI-driven platform for network investments. Imagine every customer's device acting as a real-time sensor for a service provider’s network. This is the promise of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), an approach that puts customer experience at the center of every network decision.

A new model for network intelligence

Red Hat, along with other industry leaders, are collaborating on this TM Forum catalyst project to develop a solution that combines the power of crowdsourced data with advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver actionable insights. TM Forum is a global industry association that helps its members digitally transform through collaboration, innovation, and the development of standards and best practices. They provide resources like the open digital architecture, open APIs, and catalyst innovation programs to help members reduce costs, accelerate time-to-market, and deliver new services.

The platform is built on three core pillars:

User insights: With user consent, a lightweight application on customer devices collects quality-of-experience (QoE) and radio metrics to create a high-resolution, low-cost view of network performance. Following the DePIN approach, users are rewarded with on-chain tokens to create a transparent and verifiable incentive system.

With user consent, a lightweight application on customer devices collects quality-of-experience (QoE) and radio metrics to create a high-resolution, low-cost view of network performance. Following the DePIN approach, users are rewarded with on-chain tokens to create a transparent and verifiable incentive system. AI-powered analytics platform: Crowdsourced data from end user devices is fed into an open source data lake (Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation running on Red Hat OpenShift), in Apache Iceberg table format. By deploying the Trino operator and Trino model context protocol (MCP) server on Red Hat OpenShift, AI agents (built using Red Hat AI and the llama-stack agentic framework) use natural language to query data stored in OpenShift Data Foundation to obtain specific reports on network performance.

Network evolution: Machine learning models analyze data, predict future congestion, and simulate scenarios to recommend targeted network upgrades based on customer impact and cost efficiency.

Industry collaboration drives innovation

This project is a joint effort by several key players in the telecommunications and technology sectors, and demonstrates how open source technology and industry collaboration solves complex and real-world challenges to unlock new value.

NTT Group, Spark New Zealand, Ooredoo Kuwait, and other champions listed in TM Forum catalyst project are leading proof of value (PoV) implementations for tangible business benefits and technical feasibility. They are responsible for sourcing internal testers who will use the Netradar application to activate data collection.

Netradar provides the technology for collecting, storing, and analyzing 24/7 near real-time data from end-user devices. Their predictive AI delivers the critical customer and network insights that serves as the basis for the larger solution.

Red Hat provides the cloud-native application and AI platform for the solution. Using Red Hat OpenShift, and Red Hat OpenShift AI, the platform leverages a large language model (LLM) to process the raw data and generate insightful reports. Network insights give service providers the ability to anticipate future needs rather than reacting to network issues. The Red Hat application and AI platform provides robust and crucial security mechanisms to mitigate the risks associated with AI models throughout their lifecycle.

Mlnetworks provides an AI-powered data platform that transforms network operations for service providers, solving the challenges of traditional, reactive manual processes that lead to inefficient capital expenditure (Capex) and high operational expenditure (Opex). By leveraging Netrader's crowdsourced raw data and a service provider’s operational support system data, the platform enables proactive, data-driven decision-making.

The path to business value through customer and AI-driven network investments

Immediate and direct insights of user experience from crowdsourced data directly from end-user devices is a compelling business benefit. The ability to analyse data in human language, benchmark user experience directly with competitors, and use closed-loop feedback provides better customer experience and reduces churn. These capabilities translate into optimized CapEx and an improved customer experience that directly boosts revenue and net promoter scores (NPS):

Targeted capacity additions result in a 10% decrease in CapEx but keeps customer perceived quality at the same level.

10-15% improvement in customer retention by addressing their issues proactively through quick end-to-end root cause analysis, leading to improvements in NPS.

There are also operational benefits, unlocked through the investment of training, and new culture and skill development. With service provider personnel having the requisite skills to manage AI-driven network workflows and integrating new tools safely into procedures, they will deliver measurable results that include higher network availability and performance. With a clear people strategy tied to business outcomes, service providers can transition to more pro-active and strategic operations.

Continuous improvement

To be most effective, service providers must move beyond outdated methods to measure network performance. Expensive and time-consuming drive-tests and siloed data leads to misdirected capital expenditure, and it delays issue resolution. This reactive approach is inefficient and can degrade customer experience. The solution is meaningful insight into user experience from crowdsourced data, directly from the devices of your end user. Through industry collaboration, Red Hat is helping make this pragmatic model of quality assurance a reality.

Mumbai: India has seen record investments in subsea cable connectivity, with four out of seven major subsea networks now landing in the country, said Carl Grivner, chief executive, FLAG , one of the world's largest independent subsea network operators.FLAG, backed by UK-based private equity firm 3i Group, operates systems linking Mumbai to Singapore, and Chennai to Singapore which entailed total investments of $20 million."We have plans to invest approximately $40 million in several key initiatives and projects, including Indian terrestrial routes, new investments between India to Malaysia/Singapore, and are exploring cable landing party opportunities," Grivner told ET. "In addition to our ILD (international long distance) licence, we're applying to expand our licence footprint to better meet customer demand," he added.As global concerns rise over subsea cable security and redundancy, Grivner stressed the need for diverse and redundant routes to mitigate outages like those in the Red Sea.FLAG plans to diversify its network mix from 90% subsea and 10% terrestrial to 60% subsea and 40% terrestrial in the coming years, building land-based extensions through Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Turkey among markets to bypass volatile maritime zones.Grivner, an infrastructure sector veteran and former CEO of London's Colt Technologies, believes that India's rising middle class and hyperscaler-led data centre boom are fuelling demand for high-capacity, low-latency links."We're talking gigawatts of data centre capacity now, and that demands massive connectivity both within and beyond India," he said.Grivner also urged greater private equity participation in the subsea ecosystem, which could boost efforts by telecom companies and hyperscalers like Google and Meta. FLAG, which plans further investments in India and Asia, is also exploring edge data centres to serve the low-latency demands of AI-driven applications.On policy measures for supporting India's connectivity, Grivner said, "I'm very encouraged to see that the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) has become far more open and progressive in the last four-five years. And I would suggest them to continue opening this market with new participants."FLAG has full ownership of the cables FNAL, FA-1, FEA, HAWK and FALCON, and investments in other India-to- Asia and European paths. FLAG has also made an initial investment in a new Trans-Pacific cable and intends to make further investment announcements in the future, Grivner said.In April this year, FLAG secured a $340 million refinancing deal from Apterra, Barclays, CIBC, DNB, HSBC, NAB, and NatWest to support growth and expansion, including investments in subsea cable network upgrades, edge data centres, and cable landing stations.In December 2024, the company committed $34 million investment to secure new capacity on the India-Asia-Xpress and India-Europe-Xpress cable systems, which also saw an investment from Reliance Jio.
