[TITLE]SEALSQ Announces Deal With Quantix Edge Security to Develop Spain’s First Post-Quantum Semiconductor Personalization Center Worth $25M in Expected Revenue:
[TEXT]
Geneva, Switzerland, Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

The Spanish Government recently announced a €19.6 million public investment in Quantix, which is projected to generate €793 million of economic impact in the Region of Murcia over the next five years https://digital.gob.es/comunicacion/notas-prensa/secretaria-digitalizacion-e-inteligencia-artificial/2025/09/2025-09-25

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) (“SEALSQ” or “the Company”), a leader in semiconductors, PKI, and post-quantum technology hardware and software, today announced a definitive agreement with Quantix Edge Security to develop and deploy Spain’s first post-quantum semiconductor personalization center in the Region of Murcia.

This agreement, a key milestone in the Quantix Edge Security project previously announced by the Company in June 2024, is expected to generate $25 million of revenue over the next three years with recognition likely to be milestone based over the course of the project. The Company anticipates that the project will start in H1 2026 and further expects that the project milestones will occur regularly over the life of the project creating a relatively even spread of revenue recognition..

This development is aligned with the Spanish Government’s national strategy to strengthen sovereignty in critical sectors such as semiconductors and cybersecurity. In September 2025, the Government announced a €19.6 million public investment in Quantix, projected to deliver €793 million in economic impact to the Region of Murcia over the next five years. The new center will reinforce Spain’s role as a European hub for post-quantum and cybersecurity-focused semiconductor innovation.

SEALSQ also plans to accelerate commercialization by distributing its post-quantum semiconductors through Quantix Edge Security beginning in 2026, even while the Murcia facility remains under construction. This strategy will enable early adoption of SEALSQ’s quantum-resistant technologies and supports the Company’s $170 million pipeline of potential revenue as part of its broader Quantum Roadmap.

In parallel, SEALSQ is preparing to launch the Quantum Shield “QS7001” in mid-November 2025, the world’s first1 secure chip to embed NIST-standardized quantum-resistant algorithms ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber) and ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) at the hardware level. The QS7001 will provide robust protection for critical applications including cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructures, defense and aerospace systems, healthcare platforms, and Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems.

The QS7001 delivers secure key storage, post-quantum signing, and hybrid migration frameworks that enable seamless transitions from RSA/ECC to quantum-safe cryptography, along with an open hardware platform that supports personalized firmware. The product also paves the way for SEALSQ’s upcoming QVault TPM, a Trusted Platform Module scheduled for release in the first half of 2026.

The EU's trade deal with the United States shields the bloc's drug exports from tariffs higher than 15 percent, Brussels said Friday, after US President Donald Trump announced new levies on pharmaceuticals.The July agreement capped tariffs on pharmaceutical products and other goods at 15 percent. Trump has now said he will impose a 100-percent tariff on drugs but Brussels dismissed concerns that the deal was under threat.The EU pointed to the joint statement under which the United States agreed to ensure the tariff rate on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber does not exceed 15 percent."This clear all-inclusive 15 percent tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators," said EU trade spokesman Olof Gill."The EU and US continue engaging towards implementing the joint statement commitments, while exploring further areas for tariff exemptions as well as wider cooperation," Gill said.It was not immediately made clear by the US side whether the EU was indeed exempt from the higher new pharmaceutical levies.The United States this week cut tariffs on auto imports from the EU to 15 percent as part of the agreement, down from 27.5 percent.The European Commission , which leads trade policy for the 27-country bloc, is working hard to secure carve-outs for other sectors including drinks.Gill had said Thursday EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic continued to push for cutting tariffs on wine and it remained a "top priority" for Brussels.

IBM shares went up more than 4% in New York after it announced its first experiment using quantum computers for bond trading with HSBC . The experiment helped improve predictions for bond orders in the European corporate bond market by up to 34%.The trial combined normal computers and IBM quantum computers to make quote requests better in over-the-counter markets, where buyers and sellers trade directly with each other. Philip Intallura from HSBC said, "We now have a tangible example of how quantum computers can solve a real-world problem and deliver a competitive advantage", as per the report by Market Screener.IBM explained that the project shows how business knowledge, algorithm research, and advanced quantum processors can work together. HSBC announced this is the world’s first proof that quantum computers can give real benefits in financial markets, according to the report by Benzinga.Corporate bond trading uses models to quickly price customer requests during competitive bidding. The quantum approach was better than normal computing at predicting quote prices. The trial used real trading data from European corporate bonds and ran on IBM’s quantum systems, including the Heron processor.By using quantum computing in models, the teams found hidden pricing signals that were buried in messy market data. HSBC said this shows quantum technology can make quote requests in over-the-counter bond markets faster and more accurately, giving trading advantages.HSBC stock has gone up more than 41% this year, much higher than the S&P 100’s 15% gain, and the bank beat revenue and earnings expectations for three quarters in a row. This experiment happened soon after the Technology Prosperity Deal between the US and UK, which focuses on AI, semiconductors, telecom, and quantum computing. Leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman were involved, as per the report by Benzinga.UK Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said technologies like AI and quantum computing will change people’s lives. At the last check, HSBC shares were down 0.99% to $69.20 in premarket trading on Thursday.IBM stock rose over 4% after its trial with HSBC showed quantum computers can improve bond trading predictions by up to 34%.HSBC and IBM used quantum computers to make bond trading more accurate and faster by predicting prices better in over-the-counter markets.

[TITLE]What’s up with… Nscale, Nokia, TIP:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: UK-based AI infrastructure company Nscale has raised $1.1bn from the likes of Nvidia, Nokia and DT to fund its datacentre rollout; as a result, Nokia has become Nscale’s preferred network tech supplier; Vodafone’s Paco Pignatelli takes over from Caroline Chan as TIP’s president; and much more!

UK-based AI infrastructure firm Nscale has raised $1.1bn in what it describes as “the largest Series B in UK and European history”. The new funding will be used to advance Nscale’s deployment of AI infrastructure across Europe, North America and the Middle East, including the ‘AI factory datacentres for projects such as Stargate UK and Stargate Norway. The round was led by Norwegian investment giant Aker ASA and included participation from Sandton Capital, Blue Owl Managed Funds, Dell, Fidelity Management & Research Company, G Squared, Nokia, Nvidia, Point72 and T.Capital, which is Deutsche Telekom’s investment vehicle. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang highlighted his company’s intention to invest in Nscale earlier this month as part of the flurry of AI infrastructure investment activity that marked the ‘Tech Prosperity Deal’ between the US and UK, where Nscale is set to deploy up to 58,640 Nvidia GPUs across various projects with the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI.

One of the AI infrastructure specialist’s investors, Nokia, has become an “Nscale preferred partner for networking technologies from across its Network Infrastructure portfolio, for the build-out of AI clusters at scale… The partnership agreement will also see Nokia and Nscale jointly drive innovation in the networking stack used in AI clusters and partner globally on joint deployment initiatives,” noted Nokia in this announcement. Nokia CEO Justin Hotard stated: “Demand for the build-out of secure, scalable AI infrastructure in Europe and across the world continues to accelerate. Our partnership with Nscale combines Nokia’s expertise in IP and optical networking with Nscale’s leading infrastructure platform and enables the innovation needed for the future of AI infrastructure.” Nokia is banking on growing demand for its switching, IP and optical product lines from datacentre operators to fuel future sales growth. The vendor recently announced the formation of a new corporate unit, dubbed the Technology and AI Organization (TAO), and appointed former Intel AI and datacentre executive Pallavi Mahajan to lead it – see Nokia taps former Intel exec for new tech, AI role.

The Telecom Infra Project (TIP) has appointed Francisco ‘Paco’ Pignatelli, Vodafone Group’s head of Open RAN and a TIP board member, as its new president. Pignatelli takes on the role vacated earlier this month by Caroline Chan, who stepped down from her position as a TIP board member and as president following her departure from Intel. “Francisco has been a valued TIP board member, bringing deep expertise and passion for open and disaggregated networks,” noted TIP in this announcement on LinkedIn. “His leadership will help guide our community as we continue to accelerate innovation, scale deployments and shape the future of connectivity,” it added. With Chan, who was until last month general manager of telco AI and new technologies at Intel, stepping down, Cristina Rodriguez, general manager of Intel’s NEX (Network and Edge Group), which is being spun out as a separate business, has been appointed by Intel to join the TIP board. “Cristina’s experience and leadership in advancing communications technologies will be invaluable as TIP continues its mission to transform the future of global connectivity,” the industry body noted in a recent email newsletter.

Migrating the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) sectors from outdated analogue networks to digital infrastructure could result in a £3bn “net economic benefit” across five key sectors by 2040, according to a study by Assembly Research released by UK national operator BT Group. The telco noted that the research evaluated the costs, risks and potential gains from digital migration across energy, water, health (NHS), emergency services and local government, accounting for “the direct cost of upgrading, as well as the rising expense of maintaining legacy systems like the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the 2G mobile network – both decades old and increasingly challenging to support”. The migration to digital systems would also create greater efficiencies in critical sectors, according to the Assembly Research team – for example, preventing 100 unnecessary ambulance trips each day and saving over 600,000 NHS staff hours (comparable to the annual workload of 350 full-time employees). Matthew Howett, founder and CEO of Assembly Research, stated: “For the first time, we've lifted the lid on legacy network migration and worked to understand the scope and scale of how key UK industries are still relying on aging fixed and mobile networks. Our research found that while the energy and water sectors are already well into their migrations, it’s vital that others follow to avoid growing costs and missed efficiencies.” Jon James, CEO of BT Business, added: “This research sends a clear message: Delaying the shift to digital carries a real cost to public services, the environment and the wider economy. Legacy systems are becoming increasingly unreliable and the case for action is urgent. BT is committed to guiding the UK’s critical national infrastructure sectors through this upgrade with the resilience and support they need.”

San Francisco-based Distyl AI, which has developed a platform called Distillery that turns company processes into AI workflows, has raised $175m in its Series B funding round at a $1.8bn valuation. The investors in this round, which follows a $20m Series A round announced in November 2024, include Lightspeed Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, DST Global, Coatue and Dell Technologies Capital. “Distyl works with Fortune 500 leaders in healthcare, telecommunications, insurance, manufacturing and financial services to deliver measurable outcomes today while preparing them to re-architect their business models for the AI era,” according to the company.

China’s space infrastructure is “expanding rapidly, supported by commercial and private enterprises, as well as technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, quantum computing and 6G research,” according to ABI Research. The developments “are tightly integrated with China’s ambitious plans to deliver next-generation connectivity solutions,” added the research firm, which expects China’s serviceable addressable market (SAM) for satellite direct to cellular (D2C) subscription services “could reach 30 million users by 2030, driven by the launch of new major LEO networks”. According to ABI Research analyst Rachel Kong, there are “opportunities in China’s space sector across a wide range of areas, including domestic commercial expansion in private and state-backed constellations, business opportunities in downstream applications, multi-application communication networks, and partnerships in adjacent technology areas. These opportunities are strongly supported by government policies, which are a key driver in ramping up investments and funding for national initiatives. Examples include the Space Silk Road Initiative, the New Infrastructure Policy, and the Space-Ground Integrated Information Network Plan. Currently, two mega constellations, Spacesail and Guowang, are launching satellites with the aim of building networks that could potentially include tens of thousands of satellites,” she added. ABI Research expects the number of active satellites put into orbit by Chinese companies to increase from more than 17,000 in 2025 to over 48,000 by 2032.

Cisco Systems has unveiled a Sovereign Critical Infrastructure portfolio for European companies that are looking for “more control and autonomy over their digital infrastructure and data,” the vendor announced. The new portfolio, which comprises Cisco’s “core product lines, from routing, switching and wireless, to collaboration, and select endpoint devices, enhanced by Cisco and Splunk security and observability solutions”, can be operated by customers “in their own air-gapped, ‘on-prem’ physical environments,” noted the vendor.

[TITLE]What’s up with… Equinix & Zayo, robot deployments, Telecom Italia:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Zayo and Equinix have teamed up to create a blueprint that “defines how next-generation infrastructure powers AI workloads”; the majority of the world’s new industrial robotics deployments are in China; Telecom Italia branches into the retail gas and electricity sector; and more!

Long-distance network operator Zayo has teamed up with datacentre operator Equinix to produce what they call “the industry’s first AI Infrastructure Blueprint, a joint infrastructure architecture framework that defines how next-generation infrastructure powers AI workloads”. The blueprint aims to provide a “framework that clarifies the roles of high-capacity networks, interconnection hubs, training and inference datacentres, and provides a clear model for connecting them,” the partners noted. “AI at scale spans training locations, distributed inference, and network and interconnection nodes that link them. The AI Infrastructure Blueprint provides a clear infrastructure architecture framework for how these pieces fit together: Equinix as the neutral interconnection hubs for connecting networks, training and inference infrastructure; and Zayo as the high-capacity fibre and network services, linking hubs, data sources and workloads,” they added. Bill Long, chief product and strategy officer at Zayo, stated: “AI is transforming the digital infrastructure landscape, but there’s been no playbook for connecting training, inference and enterprise infrastructure. Together with Equinix, we’re introducing a network standard and datacentre best practices that makes AI communication infrastructure scalable, extensible and ready for what comes next.” Zayo is one of an increasing number of companies to identify datacentre interconnect (DCI) services as a significant growth opportunity as tens of billions of dollars are piled into new AI infrastructure facilities. Another company seeking to capitalise on that business opportunity in North America is Lumen Technologies, which has just provided an update on its multibillion-dollar US network expansion that’s part of its multi-year effort to build the backbone for the AI economy – see Lumen accelerates multibillion-dollar network expansion to meet soaring AI demand.

The timing of the Zayo/Equinix announcement coincided with datacentre firm’s inaugural AI Summit, where Equinix also unveiled its distributed AI infrastructure, which “includes a new AI-ready backbone to support distributed AI deployments, a global AI Solutions Lab to test new solutions, and Fabric Intelligence to better support next-generation workloads for enterprises”. For more details, see this Equinix announcement.

The latest world robotics statistics unveiled by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) show that 542,000 industrial robots were installed globally in 2024, with Asia accounting for 74%, Europe just 16% and the Americas just 9%. China alone accounted for 295,000 deployments last year, 54% of the global total, while in the US robot installations were down by 9% year on year to 34,200 units, according to the IFR, which noted that the US “imports most of its robots from Japan and Europe, with few domestic suppliers”. The IFR expects annual industrial robot installations to grow by 6% to 575,000 this year and for the total number to exceed 700,000 in 2028. “The transition of many industries into the digital and automated age has been marked by a huge surge in demand” for robotics, stated IFR president Takayuki Ito. “The total number of industrial robots in operational use worldwide was 4,664,000 units in 2024, an increase of 9% compared to the previous year,” he added. All of this is interesting in itself, of course, but what’s even more interesting is the connectivity that such industrial robots require, and it’s notable that China is also regarded as the most mature private 5G national market “thanks to state-funded directives aimed at accelerating the adoption of 5G connectivity in industrial settings, such as factories, warehouses, mines, power plants, substations, oil and gas facilities, and ports,” according to a recent report published by SNS Telecom & IT.

Telecom Italia (TIM) has teamed up with Poste Italiane, which was recently granted regulatory approval to acquire a 15% stake in the national telco, to enter the retail energy market.
