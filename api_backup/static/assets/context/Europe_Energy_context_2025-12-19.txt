[TITLE]Shares in South Korea's LGES drop more than 7% after Ford cancels EV battery deal:
[TEXT]
SEOUL, Dec 18 : Shares of LG Energy Solution dropped as much as 7.6 per cent in morning trade on Thursday after the company announced a day earlier that Ford Motor had cancelled an electric vehicle (EV) battery supply deal.

The South Korean battery maker said in a regulatory filing that the termination followed a notice from Ford after the automaker decided to halt production of some EV models due to policy changes and shifts in the outlook for EV demand.

Analysts noted that because the cancelled contract had been scheduled to begin in January 2027 it would be difficult to immediately secure new orders to replace the lost volume, making delays in improving utilisation rates at LGES' European plant in 2027 inevitable.

The benchmark KOSPI was trading down 1.4 per cent as of 0009 GMT.

[TITLE]How Far Can Brent and WTI Fall in an Oversupplied Market?:

In other words, a peace deal is far from certain, but this has not prevented the latest media updates on the issue from prompting traders to sell oil, bringing benchmark prices to the lowest in months.

President Trump said this week that a peace deal for Ukraine is closer than ever. However, this may be just an expression of optimism because recent developments in the negotiations process suggest Russia is rather unwilling to make any concessions, especially territorial ones while the European backers of the current Ukrainian government have their own plan that, observers note, crosses all of Russia’s red lines, including territorial concessions, the size of the Ukrainian army and, not least, the presence of European troops in the Ukraine as a peacekeeping force, which from Russia’s perspective is similar to the Ukraine joining NATO.

Earlier this week, Brent crude slipped below $60 per barrel, and West Texas Intermediate dipped to $55, under the combined weight of a projected supply overhang and media reports claiming the United States and Russia were close to a peace deal for Ukraine. Even a blockade on sanctioned tankers carrying Venezuelan crude ordered by President Trump did not do much for prices. The question now is just how low Brent and WTI could sink from here.

The result is a growing volume of Russian oil at sea.”

Meanwhile, JP Morgan has reiterated its expectation of an oversupplied market, saying in a recent note that “At the risk of flogging a very dead horse, our message to the market has remained consistent since June 2023. While demand is robust, supply is simply too abundant.” The Wall Street major is not alone in this perception. Most analysts expect lower prices in 2026.

Last month, Goldman Sachs commodity analysts said they expected Brent crude to average $56 per barrel in 2026, with West Texas Intermediate at $52, citing, once again, an oversupplied market. Yet it was Goldman again that quickly adjusted its oil demand growth outlook following the International Energy Agency’s revision of peak oil demand projections. In the update, made in November, Goldman dropped its prediction of peak oil demand growth by 2034, now expecting demand to continue growing until at least 2040.

In a more recent update, the bank acknowledged that low prices will at some point start affecting production, leading to a rebound. “We expect oil prices to pick up in 2027 as the market returns to balance and shifts focus to incentivizing investment, given the reduction in oil reserve life, the maturing of US shale, and solid demand growth,” Goldman commodity analysts wrote.

WTI at or around $50 is not the best price level for U.S. shale, even for the supermajors. It is definitely not the best price level for OPEC, either. So, we might reasonably expect a reaction from both should prices remain extra-depressed. Growth in U.S. shale output is already moderating in response to price depression. For 2026, the Energy Information Administration actually expects a dip of around 100,000 barrels daily from this year’s levels.

According to Saxo Bank, traders would need some hard evidence that supply is tightening before they turn more bullish, which is hardly surprising after months of glut predictions. Energy markets, the Danish bank’s head of commodity strategy, Ole Hansen, wrote in an update, “may need clearer evidence of tightening balances or supply discipline before sentiment eventually improves, as we believe it will especially towards the second half of 2026.”

What’s more, “The sense that the market is well supplied, at least in the near term, continues to outweigh episodic geopolitical risk premiums,” Hansen noted, which explains why the tanker blockade that President Trump ordered yesterday against Venezuela failed to have a pronounced effect on oil prices, barely pushing Brent crude back above $60 per barrel.

In addition to excess supply, analysts tend to note slowing oil demand. Yet what few mention is the fact that the tariff pressure from earlier this year is largely gone. Trump wanted trade deals and got them, and now things are more or less back to normal. In other words, fear of tariffs is no longer the same concern for oil demand that it was in the first quarter of the year. This, in turn, suggests that demand may already be recovering, not only in China.

The new year is unlikely to bring fast relief to oil markets. It will take hard evidence of production cuts, both in OPEC+ and elsewhere, notably in U.S. shale, to convince traders that the market is returning to balance. Until then, however, the possibility of supply responses among producers will keep a floor under oil prices, as will the uncertainty around the Ukraine peace deal, at least until it becomes a fact.

[TITLE]Venezuela oil blockade pushes crude prices above $60:

Oil prices rebounded on Wednesday as markets weighed an escalation in US action against Venezuela against persistent bearish pressures from Russia-Ukraine peace talks and weak Chinese economic data.

On Wednesday, oil prices rose more than 2.4 per cent after US President Donald Trump ordered what he described as a “total and complete blockade” of all sanctioned tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, heightening fears of supply disruptions from the South American producer.

As of noon on Wednesday, US West Texas Intermediate crude jumped 2.44 per cent to $56.62 a barrel, while Brent crude climbed 2.27 per cent to $60.26 a barrel, according to Oilprice.com.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump labelled the Venezuelan government a “foreign terrorist organisation”, justifying the move as part of efforts to combat alleged illicit activities tied to President Nicolás Maduro’s administration, including drug smuggling and human trafficking. He further claimed that the “largest armada ever assembled in the history of South America” would continue to expand until Venezuela returns oil, land and assets he alleged belong to the United States.

While the blockade targets only sanctioned vessels within Venezuela’s long-standing “shadow fleet”, analysts said it could still disrupt a substantial portion of the country’s estimated 850,000 barrels per day in crude exports, most of which go to China.

Chevron’s licensed operations shipping Venezuelan crude to the United States are expected to remain unaffected for now.

The rally followed a sharp decline earlier in the week, when crude prices slipped below $60 a barrel on Tuesday, hitting their lowest levels since May, as optimism over a possible Russia-Ukraine peace deal and weak Chinese economic data weighed heavily on market sentiment.

According to Reuters, Brent crude futures fell $1.03, or

[TITLE]The Unbelievable Rise of Heat Pumps in the Coldest Places on Earth:
[TEXT]
For years, heat pumps were seen as the fragile heroes of mild climates, efficient in theory but unreliable when the mercury dropped. That narrative has now collapsed under the weight of experience. From the frozen lakes of Finland to the prairies of Canada, heat pumps are thriving where they were once thought impossible.

The data from the multiple past winters tells the story clearly. Even in subzero temperatures, installations are growing faster than almost any other clean heating technology. This shift is more than a technical achievement; it is a cultural one. It challenges long-held assumptions

[TITLE]Trump's Surging LNG Exports Cost US Consumers $12 Billion in Just 9 Months:
[TEXT]
Underscoring expert warnings that exporting liquefied natural gas not only worsens the climate emergency but also drives up energy prices for Americans, Public Citizen revealed Tuesday that as LNG exports surged under the Trump administration, US households paid $12 billion more in utility bills from January through September than they did last year.

In other words, "the costs borne by residential consumers in the first nine months of 2025 are up 22%," or an average of $124 per family, according to an analysis of federal data by Tyson Slocum, director of the consumer advocacy group's Energy Program and author of the new report. "LNG exports are also up 22% over that same time."

His report highlights President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign pledges, pointing to a Newsweek op-ed and various speeches across the country. Slocum said in a statement that "Trump explicitly promised voters he would slash utility bills by half within the first year, yet in the first nine months of his term, they surged, squeezing some of the country's most vulnerable households."

Now, "1 in 6 Americans—21 million households—are behind on their energy bills," which "are rising at twice the rate of inflation," the report states. "Even registered Republican voters are increasingly blaming President Trump for the affordability crisis."

"Limiting or prohibiting LNG exports would provide immediate relief for households across the country, but it would require action from the White House."

It's not just "higher domestic natural gas prices, driven primarily by record LNG exports," affecting US utility prices, the report acknowledges. Other factors include "electric transmission and distribution costs, which include extreme weather and wildfire liabilities. These costs are administered by state or federal regulators and have been exacerbated by climate change."

"Electricity demand load growth, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence data centers, along with transportation electrification," is also having an impact, the document details. Additionally, "Trump's unprecedented cancellation and revocation of billions of dollars of permitted renewable energy projects, combined with his unlawful abuse of emergency authorities to impose punitive tariffs, have injected chaos into domestic supply chains, stifling domestic investment in energy infrastructure."

As the report explains:

Of these four factors, record natural gas exports not only represent the largest impact on natural gas prices, but feature clear statutory solutions to help protect consumers. The Natural Gas Act—passed by Congress during the Great Depression—asserts in Section 1 that "the business of transporting and selling natural gas for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest," with the US Supreme Court affirming that the "primary aim" of this 87-year-old law is "to protect consumers against exploitation at the hands of natural gas companies." Section 3 of the law forbids exports of natural gas unless the Department of Energy determines the exports to non-Free Trade Agreement countries are "consistent with the public interest."

Rather than living up to those obligations, Slocum said, "Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have acted as global gas salesmen, traveling to Europe to push exports and gut European methane regulations while attacking mainstream climate science. Meanwhile, Trump has done nothing to keep prices down at home."

"Limiting or prohibiting LNG exports would provide immediate relief for households across the country, but it would require action from the White House," he added. "Trump would need to stand up to some of his fossil fuel donors to make our energy more affordable."

It's not just Public Citizen pushing for action by the president. US Sen. Edward Markey (D–Mass.)—the upper chamber's leading champion of the Green New Deal—joined a press event for the group's new report. He stressed that "record-breaking levels of natural gas exports are breaking the bank on your monthly energy bill."

Public Citizen released the report just a day after Bloomberg also noted what the export boom means for US energy prices.

"We have been talking about, in apocalyptic terms, for a decade now when the world would start taking away America's cheap gas," Peter Gardett, CEO of Noreva, an energy trading platform specializing in power, told Bloomberg. "Well, we're here."

[TITLE]Quadrupling sustainable fuels by 2035? Only if they’re truly sustainable.:
[TEXT]
As COP30 came to a close, 23 countries — led by Brazil, India, Italy and Japan — signed onto a bold commitment: to quadruple sustainable fuel production and use by 2035. The ‘Belem 4x Initiative’, under the Future Fuels Action Plan, is one major signal that governments increasingly view alternative fuels not just as climate policy, but as a pillar of energy security, industrial competitiveness and supply-chain resilience.

This shift is long-due, putting a real focus on the so-called hard-to-abate sectors, i.e. industries that require a lot of energy to reach very high temperatures or to move heavy loads. Heavy trucking, shipping, aviation, steel, cement and chemicals are together responsible for roughly one-third of global carbon emissions and as long as those sectors remain reliant on fossil fuels, global decarbonization efforts will fall short. Recent investments in alternative fuels by, for example, the EU, China, India, and others are critical steps toward filling this gap.

Still, the rising demand for alternative fuels brings critical questions: Which fuels? And how clean are they, really? The answers: it depends. And right now, we have an incredible opportunity to bring stakeholders together around sound science, innovative policies and best practices, to get the sustainable fuels ecosystem right as it develops.

Energy security meets climate reality

The strategic appeal of a diverse clean fuel mix is obvious. Countries that secure a portfolio of domestically produced hydrogen, e-fuels, sustainable biofuels and other low-emissions fuels can reduce reliance on unstable fossil import markets while growing their economies. They can protect themselves from geopolitical shocks, stabilize industrial inputs, and foster robust export industries — all while advancing a clean energy transition.

But this ambition should not come at the expense of environmental integrity. A new peer-reviewed perspective article from our own EDF scientists, recently published in Environmental Science & Technology, makes it clear: sustainability is not inherent to the molecule – it is a feature of the full value chain. Feedstock and energy sourcing, production efficiency, methane or hydrogen leakage, land-use impacts, carbon capture performance and combustion emissions all determine whether a fuel is genuinely sustainable, or no better (or even worse) than fossil fuels. The most successful strategies will build in environmental integrity from the start, to maximize all potential benefits.

The numbers confirm the challenge of scaling up sustainably. Today, sustainable fuels represent only 1.3% of total energy use worldwide. In its October 2025 report, the International Energy Agency calls on global use of sustainable fuels to nearly double by 2030 and expand fourfold by 2035, pointing to existing and announced policies as an achievable pathway.

IEA defines a ‘sustainable’ fuel as having a low (though unspecified) greenhouse gas intensity over its lifecycle, while complying with other sustainability criteria around biodiversity, water management and social safeguards. However, the range of actual GHG emissions and other impacts can vary greatly. For example, the chart below from the IEA demonstrates the wide range of emissions intensities that can exist within each pathway. Some pathways, like biomethane from food waste or alcohol-to-jet fuel from sugarcane, can offer a near-zero-emission fuel option — or they can be no better than natural gas (~50 gCO2/MJ). Moreover, even these ranges of IEA estimates are not comprehensive — they downplay or ignore warming impacts from indirect land use change and methane, ammonia and hydrogen releases (as outlined in EDF’s recent perspective paper).

Beyond labels: Why the details matter

Calling something a sustainable fuel based on its potential does not guarantee sustainability. Because the term encompasses dozens of fuel types and feedstocks, and a wide variety of production pathways and value chains, the environmental and social outcomes can vary drastically.

A few high-stakes examples:

Biofuels derived from crops grown on recently converted forest land could emit more CO 2 than the fossil fuels they displace — not to mention negative impacts on biodiversity, water and local communities.

Hydrogen produced from natural gas without high carbon capture rates and permanent storage, or with high upstream methane leakage, might offer little or no climate benefit, and could lock in new fossil infrastructure for decades.

E-fuels or bio-derived fuels made with fossil-intensive electricity or inefficient processes might carry hidden carbon and air-quality burdens.

Put simply: fuels that are irresponsibly sourced or poorly regulated risk locking in climate, environmental, and social harms right when the world can least afford them. That’s why fuel diversification must come with not only big aspirations, but high standards grounded in science. This is not only smart — it’s doable.

What policy and practice needs to look like

What’s needed now is to channel momentum (and finance) into pathways that deliver real climate, environmental and societal value. For policymakers, the steps should be clear:

Prioritize electrification (paired with additionality) wherever feasible as the most efficient use of energy; use alternative fuels where no better options exist, maximizing positive impacts.

Encourage investment, incentives and technological innovation in truly low-impact fuel pathways.

Require transparent accounting of lifecycle emissions and societal and environmental impacts for every fuel pathway — from feedstock sourcing and energy inputs to emissions and impacts during production, transport, storage and use.

Mandate best-in-class controls to prevent methane, hydrogen and ammonia leakage , ensure permanent carbon capture and storage when needed, and protect ecosystems and local communities from land-use or pollution impacts.

Adopt internationally harmonized sustainability standards to avoid a patchwork of weak regulations that undermine credibility and market stability.

This disciplined approach will not only safeguard the climate — it will also deliver greater energy security, economic resilience and long-term value for industry, governments and communities alike.

Why this matters — not tomorrow, but now

The world stands at a crossroads. As energy costs surge, supply chains fray and fossil fuel volatility deepens, the case for clean fuel diversification grows stronger every day. The COP30 pledge is a political landmark. But decisions made in the coming months — about which feedstocks to allow, how to measure emissions, how to regulate production, distribution and use — will determine whether the pledge becomes a historic success or a cautionary tale.

If we act decisively and in line with science, aligning policy, investment and environmental integrity, alternative fuels can become an integral pillar for decarbonization. They can be a cornerstone of global climate security, economic strength and energy sovereignty. But if we cut corners, chase quick wins or ignore the details, we risk trading today’s emissions for tomorrow’s liabilities. The path forward is clear. What matters now is not just ambition, but integrity.

Environmental Defense Fund is partnering with stakeholders to work on getting the necessary frameworks in place through, for example, our observer status at the International Civil Aviation Organization , the International Maritime Organization and other international fora. We’re using our science-led approach to proactively find the solutions that work for the entire ecosystem, and we’re ready to engage with all stakeholders to get this right.

If implemented, the rates cap would not come into force until in 2028.

With annual rates increases of between 5% and 11% forecast between 2028 and 2034, a cap could have a big impact on Tauranga ratepayers’ bills.

The council has agreed to plan public consultation to help the community understand the ramifications of paying lower rates.

Tauranga Mayor Mahé Drysdale said the council could work towards lower rates; however, there would be consequences to cutting costs in terms of the level of services available.

[TITLE]TriplePundit • What Is “Crocodile Economics,” and What Does It Mean for Fossil Fuels?:
[TEXT]
“Crocodile Economics” is a newly adopted, colorful term for the familiar decarbonization model that climate advocates have championed for decades: If renewables can beat fossil fuels on cost, then a country’s global warming emissions will fall while economic growth continues upward.

Represented on a line graph, fossil fuels evoke the lower jaw of a crocodile’s open mouth sinking downward, with economic growth represented by the upper jaw rising. Said differently, it’s another way to think

[TITLE]Trump's Surging LNG Exports Cost US Consumers $12 Billion in Just 9 Months:
[TEXT]
Underscoring expert warnings that exporting liquefied natural gas not only worsens the climate emergency but also drives up energy prices for Americans, Public Citizen revealed Tuesday that as LNG exports surged under the Trump administration, US households paid $12 billion more in utility bills from January through September than they did last year.

In other words, "the costs borne by residential consumers in the first nine months of 2025 are up 22%," or an average of $124 per family, according to an analysis of federal data by Tyson Slocum, director of the consumer advocacy group's Energy Program and author of the new report. "LNG exports are also up 22% over that same time."

His report highlights President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign pledges, pointing to a Newsweek op-ed and various speeches across the country. Slocum said in a statement that "Trump explicitly promised voters he would slash utility bills by half within the first year, yet in the first nine months of his term, they surged, squeezing some of the country's most vulnerable households."

Now, "1 in 6 Americans—21 million households—are behind on their energy bills," which "are rising at twice the rate of inflation," the report states. "Even registered Republican voters are increasingly blaming President Trump for the affordability crisis."

"Limiting or prohibiting LNG exports would provide immediate relief for households across the country, but it would require action from the White House."

It's not just "higher domestic natural gas prices, driven primarily by record LNG exports," affecting US utility prices, the report acknowledges. Other factors include "electric transmission and distribution costs, which include extreme weather and wildfire liabilities. These costs are administered by state or federal regulators and have been exacerbated by climate change."

"Electricity demand load growth, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence data centers, along with transportation electrification," is also having an impact, the document details. Additionally, "Trump's unprecedented cancellation and revocation of billions of dollars of permitted renewable energy projects, combined with his unlawful abuse of emergency authorities to impose punitive tariffs, have injected chaos into domestic supply chains, stifling domestic investment in energy infrastructure."

As the report explains:

Of these four factors, record natural gas exports not only represent the largest impact on natural gas prices, but feature clear statutory solutions to help protect consumers. The Natural Gas Act—passed by Congress during the Great Depression—asserts in Section 1 that "the business of transporting and selling natural gas for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest," with the US Supreme Court affirming that the "primary aim" of this 87-year-old law is "to protect consumers against exploitation at the hands of natural gas companies." Section 3 of the law forbids exports of natural gas unless the Department of Energy determines the exports to non-Free Trade Agreement countries are "consistent with the public interest."

Rather than living up to those obligations, Slocum said, "Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have acted as global gas salesmen, traveling to Europe to push exports and gut European methane regulations while attacking mainstream climate science. Meanwhile, Trump has done nothing to keep prices down at home."

"Limiting or prohibiting LNG exports would provide immediate relief for households across the country, but it would require action from the White House," he added. "Trump would need to stand up to some of his fossil fuel donors to make our energy more affordable."

It's not just Public Citizen pushing for action by the president. US Sen. Edward Markey (D–Mass.)—the upper chamber's leading champion of the Green New Deal—joined a press event for the group's new report. He stressed that "record-breaking levels of natural gas exports are breaking the bank on your monthly energy bill."

Public Citizen released the report just a day after Bloomberg also noted what the export boom means for US energy prices.

"We have been talking about, in apocalyptic terms, for a decade now when the world would start taking away America's cheap gas," Peter Gardett, CEO of Noreva, an energy trading platform specializing in power, told Bloomberg. "Well, we're here."

[TITLE]Early Signals on Renewable Fuels Require Clarity and Ambition to Unlock Their Full Potential:
[TEXT]
Brussels, 17 December 2025: The Commission’s proposal to revise the CO₂ Standards for light- duty vehicles introduces, for the first time, an explicit recognition that renewable fuels, including both biofuels and efuels, may contribute to meeting the 2035 target.

Liana Gouta, Director General, states “this indicates that the role of renewable fuels in the decarbonisation of road transport is, to a certain extent, acknowledged also in the vehicle regulation”.

However, without access to the full legislative text, it is not yet possible to determine how the compensation mechanism actually works, and consequently how renewable fuels are allowed to contribute to the road decarbonisation objectives.

At this stage, it remains unclear how this mechanism will function in practice, how manufacturers will be expected to demonstrate compliance, and whether the mechanism will result in creating a genuine increase in the demand for renewable fuels. This does, however, not appear to be a clear investment signal for renewable fuels.

A detailed analysis of the complete proposal will be indispensable in the coming days. Only with full transparency on the design, and implementation of the compensation mechanism will it be possible to assess its effectiveness and its potential contribution to Europe’s broader renewable fuels strategy, while offering alternative, and affordable decarbonisation options to all EU citizens.

The future of the EU’s domestic renewable fuels industry, and its ability to serve road transport as well as aviation, maritime, and defence, depends on a regulatory environment that creates stable, long-term demand and recognises the strategic importance of multiple decarbonisation pathways.

[TITLE]Plug Power Installs 5MW GenEco Electrolyzer with Cleanergy Solutions Namibia for Africa’s First Fully Integrated Green Hydrogen Facility:
[TEXT]
SLINGERLANDS, N.Y., Dec. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, today announced it has successfully installed a 5MW GenEco electrolyzer system for Cleanergy Solutions Namibia ’s groundbreaking green hydrogen project. The Walvis Bay project plant, which officially opened in September, represents Africa’s first fully integrated commercial green hydrogen facility and will serve as the foundation for expanding hydrogen mobility across Namibia and neighboring markets.

Plug’s PEM GenEco electrolyzer is integrated directly at Cleanergy Solutions Namibia’s Hydrogen Dune site, which includes a 5MW solar park spanning more than 6.5 hectares and a 5.9 MWh battery energy storage system to produce renewable hydrogen off-grid. The locally generated hydrogen will support hydrogen-powered trucks, port and rail equipment, and small ships operating through the Port of Walvis Bay, while also supplying vehicles converted on site for dual-fuel operation using hydrogen and conventional fuels.

By pairing renewable power generation with Plug’s electrolyzer hydrogen production and refueling infrastructure, the Cleanergy Solutions Namibia project creates a vertically integrated model that links clean electrons to clean molecules and supports Namibia’s emergence as a hydrogen production hub for transportation, maritime operations, and broader industrial decarbonization.

“Projects like Cleanergy Solutions Namibia demonstrate how green hydrogen is moving from concept to commercial reality,” said Jose Luis Crespo, President and Chief Revenue Officer of Plug. “By deploying our electrolyzer technology in growing hydrogen markets such as Namibia, we are helping partners build reliable, scalable hydrogen infrastructure that can decarbonize transportation and industrial activity today while supporting long-term economic development.”

This latest Plug project aligns with accelerating global investment in hydrogen. Regions including Africa, the Middle East, and Australia are emerging as next-generation hydrogen hubs, supported by renewable resources and favorable policy frameworks that enable early commercial deployment. The Cleanergy Solutions Namibia project is expected to serve as a replicable model for hydrogen infrastructure development across Africa, positioning Namibia as a regional leader in renewable hydrogen production with export potential.

[TITLE]The Unbelievable Rise of Heat Pumps in the Coldest Places on Earth:
[TEXT]
For years, heat pumps were seen as the fragile heroes of mild climates, efficient in theory but unreliable when the mercury dropped. That narrative has now collapsed under the weight of experience. From the frozen lakes of Finland to the prairies of Canada, heat pumps are thriving where they were once thought impossible.

The data from the multiple past winters tells the story clearly. Even in subzero temperatures, installations are growing faster than almost any other clean heating technology. This shift is more than a technical achievement; it is a cultural one. It challenges long-held assumptions

[TITLE]U.S. Plans $80 Billion Nuclear Power Expansion:
[TEXT]
The United States aims to embark on its most active new nuclear construction program since the 1970s. In its most high-dollar nuclear deal yet, the Trump administration in October launched a partnership to build at least $80 billion worth of new, large-scale nuclear reactors, and chose Westinghouse Electric Company and its co-owners, Brookfield Asset Management and Cameco, for the job.

The money will support the construction of AP1000s, a type of pressurized water reactor developed by Westinghouse that can generate

[TITLE]Global Coal Demand Hits All-Time High:
[TEXT]
The world’s coal demand is on track to hit a record high this year as policy shifts, weather, and fuel prices have pushed higher consumption in regions previously thought to have leveled off, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday.

Global coal demand is on track to rise by 0.5% this year, reaching a record 8.85 billion tons, the IEA said in its annual Coal 2025 report.

For three years in a row, the agency has expected coal to have reached its peak, and global demand to begin levelling off, but various shifts in policies and weather-related consumption trends have defied the IEA forecasts.

This year, coal consumption has defied the most recent trends. An intense monsoon season in India, the world’s second biggest coal consumer, led to a decline in annual coal use for only the third time in five decades.

But in the United States, rising natural gas prices and policy measures to slow coal-fired plant retirements resulted in a rebound in coal consumption, which had been mostly falling for the past 15 years, the IEA said.

U.S. coal-fired power generation is set to rebound further in the winter months as surging natural gas prices prompt utilities to switch from gas to using more coal.

Even in the European Union (EU), coal demand slipped only slightly compared to two years of double-digit slumps, according to the IEA’s estimates.

China, the world’s top coal consumer, saw demand virtually unchanged this year compared to 2024 levels.

But it will be China and its power demand and energy transition pace that will determine the trajectory of global coal demand in the near to medium term, the agency noted.

In today’s report, the IEA expects global coal demand is tick lower by 2030, returning to the same level as in 2023. In 2023, global coal demand grew by 2.6% to 8.7 billion tons—not too lower compared to 8.85 billion tons expected in 2025.

“Should China see faster-than-expected growth in electricity consumption, slower integration of renewables, or strong investment in coal gasification, it could push global coal demand above the forecasts,” the IEA said in the 2025 report.

“Major uncertainties also persist globally over the pace of electricity demand growth in both advanced and developing economies, policy approaches, and the pace of coal substitution in certain sectors and regions.”
