[TITLE]FG targets 100,000 jobs from gas flare programme:
[TEXT]
The Federal Government has said it targets more than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs from the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme following permits granted to 42 companies under the Access Flare Gas initiative.

The Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Gbenga Komolafe, disclosed this during the Permit to Access Flare Gas ceremony for the 2022 NGFCP cycle on Friday in Abuja.

Komolafe said the initiative would also produce about 170,000 metric tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas annually, providing clean energy for roughly 1.4 million households, while unlocking nearly 3 gigawatts of power generation capacity.

He explained that 49 flare sites were auctioned, with 42 successful bidders now set to capture and commercialise between 250 and 300 million standard cubic feet of gas per day currently being flared.

“A total of 49 flare sites have been auctioned. Forty-two bidders have been awarded the sites. Between 250 and 300 million standard cubic feet of currently flared gas will be captured and commercialised, eliminating approximately six million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually,” Komolafe said.

He added, “The programme is expected to attract up to US$2bn in investment. More than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created. About 170,000 metric tonnes of LPG will be produced annually, enabling clean energy access for approximately 1.4 million households. And nearly 3GW of power generation potential will be unlocked.”

Komolafe further revealed that an NGFCP Forum and College of Awardees has been established to support implementation and knowledge exchange.

“An NGFCP Forum and College of Awardees has been established to support project implementation and knowledge exchange. We have also deepened engagement with international financiers and technology partners. Furthermore, Nigeria’s leadership in practical upstream decarbonisation continues to gain global recognition,” he said.

He, however, stressed that the permits marked only a step in the process, warning that the success of the programme depended on sustained project execution.

“Let me emphasize that the Permit to Access Flare Gas is a critical step forward, but it is not the final destination. The value of this programme will be realized only through consistent, disciplined project execution. The Commission will closely monitor progress and performance under the Milestone Development Agreements while providing needed regulatory support required for success.

“So to our producers, we appreciate your cooperation and look forward to your continued collaboration, especially during this implementation phase. To our awardees, we look forward to seeing your projects progress from plans to productive assets. Together, we will continue to advance Nigeria’s upstream petroleum sector toward greater transparency, efficiency, sustainability, and global competitiveness.”

The Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme was launched by the Federal Government to tackle the long-standing challenge of gas flaring in the country’s oil-producing areas.

[TITLE]FEC approves N6.43tn PPP projects to boost infrastructure:
[TEXT]
The Federal Executive Council has approved three major Public-Private Partnership projects valued at over N6.43tn, signalling another significant wave of private-sector investment into Nigeria’s infrastructure landscape.

The projects, two deep seaports and a massive 460-megawatt hydropower plant, form the second batch of PPP initiatives cleared by the Council within one month, underscoring President Bola Tinubu’s push for private capital as a driver of growth under the Renewed Hope Agenda.

The approvals were announced in a statement by the Director-General of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, Jobson Ewalefoh, on Friday. He said the deals represent one of the strongest signals yet that the government’s reform agenda is yielding measurable impact.

The statement read, “The Federal Executive Council has approved three transformative Public-Private Partnership projects, confirming an injection of over N6.43tn (approximately $4.29bn) in private capital into the Nigerian economy. These approvals underscore the practical impact of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda, which prioritises private-sector-led infrastructure delivery as a catalyst for national growth, economic competitiveness, and job creation.”

He explained that improved policy clarity, economic liberalisation, and strengthened regulatory institutions have boosted investor confidence, enabling the Federal Government to unlock billions of dollars in long-term investments.

The newly approved projects constitute the second batch of seven PPP initiatives endorsed by the Council in the last month, all under the regulatory guidance of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission.

The new projects include the $2.27bn Bakassi Deep Seaport, the $1.14bn Port of Ondo Deep Seaport, and the $878.1m Katsina-Ala Hydropower Plant, all to be fully financed, developed, and operated by private investors.

Ewalefoh said the projects reaffirm the Tinubu administration’s resolve to deploy PPPs to accelerate economic competitiveness, enhance trade, and expand Nigeria’s renewable-energy footprint.

He explained that the Bakassi Deep Seaport, a greenfield development, would create a new maritime gateway for the North-Central and North-East and serve as a major hub for West and Central Africa.

“These are decisive, multi-sectoral investment portfolios that directly address national needs. The approval of the two deep-seaport projects alone, totaling over $3.4bn in private capital, will fundamentally optimize our maritime trade routes and decongest existing port facilities.

“The Bakassi Deep Seaport is a greenfield development designed to accommodate larger vessels and integrate an industrial cluster and Free Trade Zone, creating thousands of jobs and positioning Nigeria as a first-choice maritime destination.

“The approval of the two deep-seaport projects alone, totalling over $3.4bn, will fundamentally optimise our maritime trade routes and decongest existing port facilities,” he said.

He added that the Port of Ondo Deep Seaport is expected to open up the South-West’s solid mineral and agro-allied value chains while positioning Ondo State as a new logistics and export corridor.

On the hydropower project, he said, “The 460MW Katsina-Ala Hydropower Plant is a monumental greenfield project that will help address Nigeria’s persistent electricity deficit while unlocking vast renewable-energy potential.

“This $878m investment will supply essential base-load power to the national grid and stimulate immense economic activity across the region. It is a strategic commitment to a cleaner, more reliable, and more sustainable energy future for our country.”

The latest approvals follow the clearance of three PPP projects earlier in November: the Product Authentication and Tracking System, the V-PASS contactless biometric verification platform, and the Port Harcourt International Airport concession, which attracted an additional $230.9m in private capital.

With the approvals announced on Thursday, the total number of PPP projects endorsed in 2025 has now exceeded 13, spanning maritime, health, aviation, power, and industrial sectors.

Other PPP projects approved this year include the MediPool initiative under the Health Ministry; the Maritime Electronic Management System of NIMASA; the Ikere Gorge 6MW Hydropower Plant; the Borokiri Coastal Fisheries Terminal; the Farin Ruwa 20MW Hydropower Project; and the concession for Enugu International Airport.

Ewalefoh commended President Tinubu for what he described as “consistent support” for the ICRC, noting that the President’s push to strengthen regulatory institutions has repositioned the Commission as the engine room for PPP development. “These consistent approvals reflect Mr President’s trust in the ICRC’s mandate and further empower us to deliver even greater value to the nation,” he said.

Nigeria has increasingly turned to PPPs to expand its ageing infrastructure stock amid tight public revenues and rising fiscal pressures. The model allows private investors to finance, build, and operate major assets, particularly in ports, airports, and power, with returns tied to user fees or long-term concessions.

The strategy is crucial for Nigeria’s growth trajectory, with the country requiring an estimated $100bn annually in infrastructure spending to close its deficit. It also confirms the administration’s intent to shift heavy infrastructure financing to the private sector while improving regulatory oversight to attract long-term capital.

[TEXT]
MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

[TITLE]The Energy Justice Resistance: How States Can Counteract Federal Attacks on Community Benefits Plans:
[TEXT]
The Biden Administration tied historic federal clean energy funding in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Law (IIJA) and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to a local benefits framework through the Department of Energy’s Community Benefits Plan (CBP) requirements. The Trump Administration’s rapid rescission of CBP requirements, however, has removed the primary federal mechanism linking clean energy deployment to local benefits. Because of this rollback, state legislatures should consider mandating the use of tools such as Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs) and Host-Community Bill Credits (HCBCs) to ensure that communities continue to share in the economic and social benefits of the energy transition.

Federalizing Energy Justice: Mandatory Community Benefit Plans Under the Biden Administration

During the previous administration, President Biden signed the IIJA and IRA into law, appropriating historic amounts of federal funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives, including clean energy development. Much of this funding was made available via grant and loan programs, which were administered by federal agencies, like the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). In 2021, the DOE established a first-of-its kind program, under which all applicants for federal grants and loans under the IIJA and IRA were required to develop and submit CBPs.

CBPs are planning documents in which developers detail how a proposed project will deliver benefits—such as local employment, workforce training, or environmental justice benefits— to impacted communities, beyond the core technical goals of the project. While these planning tools are not legally binding, CBPs were mandatory components of DOE funding applications during the Biden Administration. To ensure these plans were not merely perfunctory, the Biden DOE required CBPs to address four goals: (1) community and labor engagement, (2) quality jobs and workforce development, (3) diversity and inclusion, and (4) benefits for disadvantaged communities under the federal Justice40 Initiative. If the DOE approved a funding application, the Agency integrated the terms and conditions of the proposed CBP into the grant / loan award, thus conditioning grant / loan funding on successful CBP implementation.

Initial evidence suggests that CBPs likely had positive social and economic impacts. Data compiled by UC Berkeley Law demonstrates that, across 635 DOE-funded projects, developers entered into more than 250 agreements to support local labor and encourage community oversight. Many expected that more local agreements would be executed in the future, but that now seems unlikely.

The Trumpian Backslide: Executive Order 14151 and DOE Grant Revisions

Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued a slate of executive orders designed to rollback diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice initiatives pursued by the Biden Administration. In Executive Order 14151 (“Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing”), the Trump Administration ordered federal agencies to terminate all DEI initiatives, including those embedded in DOE’s CBP framework. This order thus dismantled the administrative foundation for CBPs.

In response to Executive Order 14151, the DOE issued internal memoranda instructing program offices to suspend CBP implementation and to amend existing grant and loan agreements to remove CBP provisions. The Agency told recipients that “[c]osts incurred after the date of this letter will not be reimbursed” for CBP-related activities. DOE Grants Officers contacted grantees to renegotiate awards and strip CBP obligations that had required local benefits.

The consequences of this rollback were immediate, eliminating structured mechanisms that had tied federal grants to local job creation and community oversight. Even worse, the DOE later terminated grants and loans for over 200 projects, stymieing new development and inhibiting planned benefits from flowing to communities. The Trump Administration’s actions, therefore, shifted federal energy and infrastructure policy away from community empowerment toward regressive deregulation — undermining a significant justice-oriented reform in federal clean energy funding.

Resisting the Backslide: How States Can Support Community Benefits and Wealth Sharing Programs

Because of this federal backsliding, it is incumbent upon states to reassess and strengthen their community benefit frameworks to ensure that the fruits of the energy transition do not remain concentrated among a handful of developers. To do this, states can legislatively mandate that project developers provide monetary and/or non-monetary benefits— such as local hiring, community oversight, and environmental remediation — to host communities as a condition of development. These mandates can help to advance both procedural and distributive justice, ensuring that local communities are involved in, and benefit from, major infrastructure projects that affect them.

Legislatively-mandated community benefit schemes for clean energy projects generally take one of two different forms: Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs) and Host Community Bill Credits (HCBCs). CBAs are highly tailored agreements between project developers and local governments or local organizations in a host community, under which the developer promises to deliver specific public benefits to the community. HCBCs, conversely, are a highly streamlined approach in which developers apportion bill credits among residential electricity ratepayers that reside in the development’s host community, thus providing direct-to-consumer bill savings.

Though each model provides local benefits, the two approaches differ significantly—both normatively and administratively—in how they integrate energy justice into renewable energy siting. Whether states choose to mandate CBAs, HCBCs, or both, moreover, may substantially impact how these states balance the often-tensional policy goals of transition acceleration and energy justice. Legislators should therefore recognize the distinct benefits and tradeoffs associated with each regime.

a. Community Benefits Agreements

For several decades, localities have used CBAs to secure local benefits from, and build public support for, large-scale developments. A highly procedural approach, CBAs generally involve a multi-step process of convening developers and host communities, including: (1) public education; (2) community negotiation; (3) contract drafting and signing; and (4) implementation and enforcement. Because of this individualized time-investment, proponents argue that CBAs increase local buy-in and project certainty, reducing risk for developers. In addition, CBA negotiations provide developers local knowledge that may improve project outcomes. Furthermore, advocates increasingly contend that CBAs — when viewed as a tool to reduce local opposition to utility-scale renewable energy projects — could be more widely deployed to accelerate the energy transition.

Several states have adopted legislation which mandate CBAs for renewable energy and other types of projects. Pursuant to HB 5120 in Michigan, for example, owners of energy facilities of 50 MW of capacity or more must negotiate a CBA with host communities and must pay $2,000 per MW of capacity to the host community. Under AB 205 in California, applicants seeking California Energy Commission certification for renewable energy facilities of 50 MW of capacity or more must enter into “one or more legally binding and enforceable agreements with, or that benefit, a coalition of one or more community-based organizations.” By requiring developers to enter into CBAs with host communities, states can ensure that impacted communities receive substantial benefits from the projects they host.

As more host communities adopt CBAs, however, several issues persist. CBAs often lack clear enforcement mechanisms, typically because of poor planning and drafting. In addition, communities may face challenges monitoring developers’ actions and may be unaware of non-compliance with the terms of a CBA. Even if non-compliance becomes apparent, communities may lack the capacity or resources necessary to address this breach. Power imbalances between developers and host communities may also result in a lack of transparency and the “institutionalization” of CBAs, threatening the underlying flexibility that makes CBAs an attractive policy option.

Some critics harbor deeper, more philosophical objections to the use of CBAs in the context of renewable energy development. Developer-sympathetic critics argue that CBAs risk enabling extortionate opposition to renewable energy projects. Certainly, local stakeholders offer valuable input and express valid concerns

Data centres will be required to meet at least 80% of their annual energy demand with additional renewable electricity projects generating in the Republic of Ireland.

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has today published its decision on a new electricity connection policy for data centres.

Under the rules, data centre developers will be allowed a six-year "glide path" for renewables to be developed and start generating.

The CRU said that new data centres connecting to the electricity network will continue to be required to provide generation and/or storage capacity, either onsite or local in proximity to match the requested data centre maximum import demand capacity.

"This generation will be required to participate in the wholesale electricity market to support overall system adequacy, while providing a potential revenue stream to the developer.," the CRU said in its decision.

When it comes to the location of data centres, the CRU said that electricity system operators must consider whether a requested data centre connection is in a constrained or unconstrained location on the electricity network.

"This will require system operators to focus on the details of the specific application and its location on the electricity network instead of the current broader regional approach," the CRU said.

"The system operators will also be required to regularly publish information in relation to the availability of capacity on the electricity network, identifying current and future constraints to provide accessible information for all stakeholders," it added.

Electricity demand from data centres has grown from 5% of national electricity demand in 2015 to 22% in 2024.

Digital Infrastructure Ireland, which represents the data centre sector, said it was pleased that the policy has finally been released by the CRU.

"We are hopeful this will end the four-year de facto moratorium on data centres and begin to reset the digital infrastructure industry here in Ireland," the group said.

Cloud Infrastructure Ireland, the Ibec trade association that represents digital infrastructure providers, welcomed the publication of the connection policy, which it said provides the needed clarity for new sustainable data centre investments in Ireland.

"The policy will also support Ireland's wider digital economy and the hundreds of Irish firms supporting the digital infrastructure sector," it said.

Wind Energy Ireland also welcomed the publication of the connection policy.

"This new policy gives certainty to large-energy users and to the renewable energy industry," said Noel Cunniffe, CEO of Wind Energy Ireland.

"It will unlock investment into Ireland, support new wind farms and help to accelerate the electrification of our energy system," he added.

The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland (AmCham) said the publication of the CRU's decision provides much-needed clarity for investors and energy users.

"Vital digital infrastructure is foundational to Ireland's ability to attract and retain investment, support high-value jobs, and enable the continued growth of the wider digital economy, all of which rely on dependable access to electricity for large energy users," said AmCham CEO Paul Sweetman.

Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said it may be a good decision for data centres and renewables developers, but added that it is not a good day for climate, or for households and communities dependent on expensive fossil fuels.

"Requiring data centres to 'match' at least 80% of their annual demand with new renewables does not guarantee actual reductions in emissions," said Jerry Mac Evilly, Campaigns Director at Friends of the Earth.

"This is merely an accounting exercise and data centres’ colossal energy demand inevitably means more use of fossil fuel power plants."

[TITLE]State regulators play umpire in clash between Xcel Energy, counties on transmission project:
[TEXT]
Xcel Energy’s fight to overturn Elbert County’s denial of a permit for part of a $1.7 billion transmission project highlights a clash between two of Colorado’s high-wattage issues: the growing demand for electricity and local governments’ right to regulate land uses.

Xcel, the state’s largest electric utility, wants the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to allow it to proceed with plans for its Colorado Power Pathway, which will stretch across 12 counties, most in eastern Colorado. The total project includes roughly 550 miles of new lines and new and expanded substations to improve the electric grid and deliver more power from renewable energy sources.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission, or PUC, gave the go-ahead in 2022 to the project that Xcel says will help it deliver more power from renewable energy and meet the target of cutting carbon emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.

The company must win approval from counties for its site plans.

But in June, Elbert County denied two land-use applications that Xcel needs to build 48 miles of lines, towers and other infrastructure. The county commissioners said the applications were incomplete and didn’t meet the county’s regulations. They also raised questions
