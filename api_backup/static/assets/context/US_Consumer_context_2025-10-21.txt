The bankrupt company’s major secured creditors include Azim Premji Trust IDFC First Bank and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction, which claimed dues of over Rs 485 crore. As per the latest available data with the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), the company’s total admitted claim stood at Rs 885 crore.“Approval of the resolution plan shall not be a ground for termination of any existing consents, approvals, licences, concessions, authorisations, permits or the like that has been granted to the corporate debtor...,” observed the division bench of judicial member Lakshmi Gurung and technical member, Hariharan Neelakanta Iyer, “...or for which the said corporate debtor has made an application for renewal, grant permissions, sanctions, consents, approvals, allowances, exemptions, etc.,” said the tribunal in its 36-page order.Before the tribunal’s approval, resolution professional Rajan Rawat, had informed the tribunal that out of seven bidders, two had submitted the resolution plan, through counsel Nausher Kohli.

[TITLE]Federal Realty Buys Maryland Retail Plaza for $187M:
[TEXT]
One of the nation’s oldest real estate investment trusts has acquired an open-air retail plaza in eastern Maryland, the latest firm to snag a substantial property amid the retail’s resurgence.

North Bethesda, Md.-based Federal Realty Investment Trust, founded in 1962, has paid $187 million for the retail portion of the mixed-use Annapolis Town Center, a 480,000-square-foot shopping center in Annapolis. PGIM Real Estate sold the complex, which is anchored by Whole Foods alongside fellow tenants such as Anthropologie, Sephora, Restoration Hardware, and Williams Sonoma.

“This is exactly the kind of opportunity we target: a dominant asset with strong fundamentals, competitive positioning, and the potential to unlock further value under our ownership,” Don Wood, Federal Realty president and CEO, said in a statement.

Federal Realty’s new property is just a portion of the 2 million-square-foot Annapolis Town Center, developed in 2008 at 1906 Towne Centre Boulevard by Greenberg Gibbons. PGIM acquired the mixed-use complex in 2018, though earlier this year it opted to sell the property’s multifamily component — two buildings totaling more than 400 units — to Peterson Companies for $160 million.

Federal Realty joins other investment firms acquiring Maryland malls in the past 12 months, though under widely varying circumstances.

In November, Spinoso Real Estate Group paid $190 million for the 1.2 million-square-foot White Marsh Mall near Baltimore. Spinoso had been the mall’s court-appointed receiver for about a year at the time, owing to financial distress from former owner Brookfield.

European mall giant Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW) meanwhile has faced its own distress with Westfield Wheaton, a 1.7 million-square-foot plaza on the northern outskirts of Washington, D.C. The mall was transferred to special servicing in April after URW failed to meet its March debt maturity, and the company has reportedly opted to sell following a meager $166 million appraisal in August, Bisnow reported at the time.

[TITLE]Why L’Oréal’s Deal With Kering Beauty Is a Category Game-changer:
[TEXT]
Kering and L’Oréal have made it official: The two French giants announced that they are forming a long-term strategic partnership in beauty and wellness.

In a joint announcement, the companies said the binding agreement encompasses the acquisition of the House of Creed by L’Oréal, and gives L’Oréal the rights to enter into a 50-year exclusive license for the creation, development and distribution of fragrance and beauty products for Gucci, commencing after the expiration of Kering’s current license with Coty for that business.

Kering acquired Creed, the oldest existing high-end niche fragrance house, in June 2023 in a blockbuster deal estimated at between high 2 billion euros to 3.5 billion euros.

The partnership will also include 50-year exclusive licenses for Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, which will start at the close of the transaction. These will join other designer fragrance brands already in the L’Oréal Luxe division, which includes Yves Saint Laurent (a Kering brand), Armani, Valentino, Prada, Miu Miu, Jacquemus, Mugler, Azzaro, Maison Margiela, Viktor & Rolf, Ralph Lauren, Diesel and Cacharel.

The 50/50 joint venture agreement is valued at 4 billion euros, payable in cash at the closing, which is expected to take place in the first half of 2026. L’Oréal will also pay royalties to Kering for the use of its licensed brands.

Beyond beauty, the companies said they are joining forces to explore business opportunities at the intersection of luxury, wellness and longevity.

“This strategic alliance marks a decisive step for Kering,” said chief executive officer Luca de Meo in a statement. “Joining forces with the global leader in beauty, we will accelerate the development of fragrance and cosmetics for our major houses, allowing them to achieve scale in this category and unlock their immense long-term potential.”

For his part L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said, “I am delighted to forge this long-term alliance with one of the world’s most prestigious, creative and visionary luxury groups. The addition of these brands significantly expands our reach into new, dynamic segments of luxury beauty. Through Creed, we will establish ourselves as one of the leading players in the fast-growing niche market.”

“This is a real game-changer. It is earth-shattering,” said an industry expert of the L’Oréal-Kering Beauty deal. “It has implications for everyone.”

For Kering, it will provide a much-needed injection of cash to reinvest in its struggling brands, and is a bold move by de Meo, who took the reins in September and has wasted no time in making changes. In addition to a deal for the beauty, industry sources indicate he is also looking to shed the company’s eyewear business. Both were key pillars of the strategy implemented by former CEO François-Henri Pinault, who seems to be abiding by his pledge to give de Meo free rein in executing his own vision even as Pinault remains company chairman.

“To build a beauty company takes a lot of time, and it’s very different from fashion, even though there are synergies on the brand side,” said Laurent Droin, a partner and investor in Felix Capital.

“For L’Oréal, it makes a lot of sense, because it’s a unique opportunity to acquire a real luxury beauty portfolio,” he added. “This makes sense for both parties.”

Many insiders predict the deal could reshape not only the market’s landscape, but also force some company and brand marriages that were not on the horizon otherwise.

A deal could be pivotal for midsize beauty brands held by private equity concerns, which had been banking on L’Oréal to acquire them as other major beauty groups struggle to find their footing.

With this deal, L’Oréal is significantly bolstering its position in perfumes — the beauty market’s largest category driver over the past six years, since the coronavirus pandemic began. Within that, niche fragrances are the strongest segment.

Overall, the worldwide fragrance market is highly fragmented and large — expected to generate sales of $62.11 billion this year, according to Statista. The category’s growth might be mitigating currently, but its outlook remains strong. This in part is due to fragrances’ expanding scope that is morphing, moving into new geographies such as Asia and the well-being sector with functional attributes.

Fashion fragrances, which sell particularly well in the West, are increasingly serving as launchpads for fashion-branded makeup, an increasingly hot category in the East.

Many industry analysts weren’t surprised that Kering is abandoning its efforts to build a beauty business on its own. “Kering spent 3 billion euros on Creed and they are selling everything for 4 billion — the value destruction is incredible,” said one insider. “It’s very tough for these firms to take beauty in-house. Burberry tried it a few years ago and Coty picked up the beauty business because they realized they couldn’t do it. Kering is the same.”

As it is, the deal will almost certainly have implications for the major players in the category, including Coty Inc., the Estée Lauder Cos., Puig and Interparfums.

“It puts more pressure on everyone,” Droin said.

The move comes at a time of great change in beauty. As first reported by WWD in June, Coty’s future remains uncertain as the company explores potential sell-offs of its luxury and consumer divisions, according to industry sources.

Coty’s Luxury division includes fragrance brands such as Gucci, Burberry, Jil Sander and Hugo Boss. If L’Oréal acquires Kering Beauty and Coty does look to divest its prestige fragrance holdings ultimately, it could intensify the scramble to take over those brands.

Meanwhile, the Estée Lauder Cos. is increasingly leaning into its perfume activity. Last week, its CEO Stéphane de La Faverie said fragrance is the future of the group, as it inaugurated La Maison des Parfums, a prospective innovation arm for perfume, in central Paris. That is meant to accelerate its fragrance business around the world.

Puig was in the running to acquire Kering Beauty, according to an industry source. A Puig spokeswoman could not be reached for comment Sunday.

Already a number of fragrance licenses held by Puig — such as Valentino, Prada and Miu Miu — have migrated to L’Oréal.

Questions remain

[TITLE]Reconstruction and Opportunities: The CDFG Consumer White Paper 2024-2025 is Released:
[TEXT]
BEIJING, Oct. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On the cusp of the conclusion of the “14th Five-Year Plan” and the commencement of the “15th Five-Year Plan”, China Duty Free Group (CDFG), a leader in China’s travel retail industry, along with Beijing DATA 100 information technology Co. Ltd., has released its CDFG Consumer White Paper (referred to as the “White Paper”). Drawing on real consumption data and informed by industry performance, macroeconomic trends, and duty-free policies, the White Paper offers deep insights into how the industry is recovering. It comprehensively analyzes the value of CDFG’s users and members, the characteristics of the nine key customer segments, the value upgrade paths for five core categories, and offers an outlook on future development.

The White Paper points out:

Global Market Maintains Recovery Momentum.

In 2024, the global duty-free and travel retail market reached a scale of $74.13 billion, a YoY (Year-on-Year) increase of 3%, recovering to 85.8% of its 2019 level. This rebound is driven by a confluence of factors, including the recovery of international tourism, policy support and market liberalization, the rise of emerging markets, and digital transformation, continuously invigorating the industry.

Source: CDFG Consumer White Paper 2024-2025

China’s Market Highlights Its High-Potential Foundation.

China’s GDP has returned to healthy growth after a period of adjustment. The combined effect of supportive policies and expanding domestic demand has stabilized consumer confidence, providing a solid foundation for the industry. Market expansion was driven by the optimization of Hainan’s offshore duty-free policy, the advancement of downtown duty-free shop policy, and growth in domestic and international tourism, as well as increased inbound consumption.

CDFG’s Omnichannel Ecosystem Strategy Delivers Results.

In the Chinese market, industry concentration continued to increase, with CDFG further strengthening its leadership with a 78.7% market share. Leveraging its advantages in industry leadership, omnichannel layout, supply chain, member value management, and capital and technology drivers, CDFG, along with its numerous partners, achieved higher-quality development in 2024

Source: CDFG Consumer White Paper 2024-2025

CDFG’s User Base Achieves Breakthrough Growth, with Strong Performance from Foreign Users.

In 2024, the total user base reached 104 million, a YoY increase of 26.1%. Foreign users grew particularly rapidly, with the number of users growing by 53.9% and their spending increasing by 84.5%.

CDFG’s Total Membership Continues to Grow, With A Significant YoY Growth Rate and A Stable Month-on-Month Increase.

The 2024 YoY increase in the number of active members is particularly prominent, while their proportion of the overall membership remains stable. As of June 2025, CDFG’s membership has surpassed 45 million. Building on steady overall growth and a healthy structural adjustment, the member base exhibits three new traits: a solidified customer foundation across both mass and high-luxury segments; the emergence of men as a key growth engine for high-end consumption; and the increasingly evident purchasing power of the senior demographic.

Source: CDFG Consumer White Paper 2024-2025

Customer Base Reshaping: From “Scale Expansion” to “Meticulous Segment Cultivation”.

Based on dimensions such as consumption contribution, category preference, age, and region, CDFG’s core customer base can be segmented into nine categories that precisely cover diverse consumption needs: The Self-Care Connoisseurs, aged 31-45 from first- and second-tier cities, focus on high-end skincare; HNW Luxury Lifestyle Connoisseurs favor watches and jewelry; The Aspiring Upgraders from third- and fourth-tier cities pragmatically pursue quality; male Spirits Aficionados aged 31-50 are keen on premium liquor; The Tech Adventurers aged 21-35 focus on technology products; Gen Z Trend-Driven Stylists aged 16-30 follow makeup trends; The Senior Quality Seekers aged 60+ prioritize health-related consumption; The Performance Athletes aged 26-45 choose professional gear; and The Foreign Travelers favor products with unique Chinese characteristics. The distinct consumption preferences of each group drive consumption upgrading and meticulous segment cultivation.

Source: CDFG Consumer White Paper 2024-2025

Consumption Growth Shows New Trends: “The Rise of Guochao (China Chic)”, “The Experience Economy”, and “Channel Integration”.

Through product innovation and cross-over collaborations, domestic brands have achieved a breakthrough in brand premium within the travel retail market. The enthusiasm of young consumers for “Guochao” products is changing the long-standing dominance of international brands in the travel retail market, creating new points of value growth. Experiential elements like immersive displays and art installations are upgrading duty-free shopping from a transactional activity to a form of content consumption. This shift requires operators to transform from merchandise suppliers to curators of lifestyle experience. The boundaries between online and offline channels are dissolving. Innovative initiatives such as the application of AR/VR technology and online-exclusive SKUs (Stock-Keeping Units) are building a new consumption loop of “Online Ordering + Offline Experience”. This integration not only enhances conversion efficiency but also redefines the spatio-temporal dimensions of duty-free shopping.

Category Consumption Reveals a New Landscape: “Beauty Dominates”, “Hard Luxury Holds Ground”, and “Wines & Spirits Breaks Through”.

- In Fragrances & Cosmetics, makeup and fragrances show remarkable growth, with foreign travelers, male customers, and Guochao brands emerging as key growth drivers. CDFG enhances repeat purchases through offline customized skincare solutions and online precision outreach.

- In Luxury Goods & Accessories, the consumption structure has diversified. The ultra-high-end market shows significant growth, while the affordable luxury segment maintains stable demand. CDFG secures high-end clientele with exclusive services such as personal shopping assistance and flight ticket reimbursement.

- In Watches & Jewelry, there is significant category divergence. The jewelry category shows YoY growth, while demand for watches exhibits strong regional characteristics.

- In Liquor, the market is undergoing both expansion and upgrading. Consumption is clearly stratified across categories and demographics, and channels are developing in a complementary fashion, showcasing a clear trend of simultaneous scale expansion and structural upgrading.

- In Food & General Merchandise, the market is expanding steadily with distinct segment characteristics. Gen Z and the senior demographic are driving a transformation in emotional and health-related consumption. CDFG is implementing a targeted strategy of “Guochao brands + niche scenarios” to precisely match the needs of these segments.

CDFG has established a product matrix of over 360,000 SKUs across all categories, including Luxury Goods & Accessories, Perfumes & Cosmetics, and Liquor & Tobacco. In 2024, the Group successfully introduced over 200 new brands and exclusively launched over 500 limited-edition products across 19 collections, continuously enhancing its merchandise competitiveness.

Source: CDFG Consumer White Paper 2024-2025

The Duty-Free and Travel Retail Market Is Set for Continued Advancement.

Industry Opportunities: Structural Opportunities Emerge, Recovery Trend to Continue; Marketing Opportunities: Targeting Nine Key Segments and Breaking Through with a “Contextual Customer Acquisition - Immersive Conversion - Emotional Retention” Model

In the future, CDFG will use its digital-intelligence ecosystem as a core driver to deepen the “Duty-Free + Culture, Commerce, Sports, Tourism, and Health” integration. This will involve joint marketing initiatives tied to art exhibitions, sporting events, and celebrity performances to create immersive consumption experiences. At the same time, it will remain customer-centric, conveying the brand value of “YOUR WORLD OF DELIGHT” through stratified operations, the supply of rare goods, and omnichannel services, thereby promoting the high-quality development of the industry.

[TITLE]Denver-based women’s ski apparel brand Halfdays raises $10M:
[TEXT]
Halfdays is now sitting on a mountain of cash.

The Denver-based women’s ski apparel company announced a $10 million raise this month, bringing its lifetime total to $15 million. Apparel maker Kellwood Company led the raise, with participation from Dicks Sporting Goods Ventures and model Taylor Hill.

“This raise will allow us to fuel our growth trajectory: expanding our core winter and ski collections, continuing to grow into year-round trail and activewear, and investing in brick-and-mortar retail,” co-founder and CEO Ariana Ferwerda said in an email.

Ferwerda, who started the brand in 2020 alongside Karelle Golda and former Olympic skier Kiley McKinnon, said Halfdays’ collection will double in size next year to feature more versatile, all-year activewear. Bestsellers like the $395 Lawrence jacket, $295 Alessandra snowpant and $95 Sophia baselayer leggings will remain.

Ferwerda said powderhounds will also have more places to find Halfdays, with online fashion outfits Revolve and Shopbop joining existing retailers like Nordstrom, REI and Dick’s.

Halfdays will also grow its own store count after a successful Denver debut at 2609 Walnut St. in RiNo, which opened last December. Ferwerda said no additional ones are planned in Colorado, but Halfdays is exploring doing a pop-up shop in the mountains sometime this ski season.

Halfdays started as solely direct-to-consumer before testing the wholesale slopes in 2021, its second ski season. Last year, Ferwerda said, the company “decided to go all in” and tripled to 150 retail locations across North America.

This year, one-third of Halfdays’ projected $25 million in sales will come from that arm of the business. That total revenue is an 80% jump from 2024, Ferwerda said.

Halfdays raised its previous $5 million in 2021 and 2022, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Goods & Services Tax (GST)-linked benefits are fuelling demand across categories including those of baby-care products, said Rajesh Vohra, chief executive of Artsana India, which sells global baby care brand Chicco in India.The government had slashed GST on baby products such as feeding bottles, napkins and diapers to 5% from 12% last month.“We are scaling up retail footprint as well as product portfolio in response to increasing discretionary demand,” Vohra said.Various industry reports estimate that the domestic baby care market in India is growing in double digits, fuelled by higher disposable incomes and aspirational demand.Market researcher Mordor Intelligence noted in a recent report that the domestic baby care products market clocked annual sales of US $ 4.94 billion in the current year and foreclosed it to touch sales of US $ 8.61 billion by year 2030.In India, Chicco competes with Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Mothercare and Mother Sparsh, in addition to dozens of direct-to-consumer brands, in the infant personal care market.The flagship brand of Italian Artsana Group, Chicco has presence in 120 countries and over 360 single-brand stores, according to information on its website. The site lists the United States as the brands’ second biggest market after Italy in terms of sales volume.A report by consulting firm Redseer said the per capita spending on childcare products in the country would grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% from 2023 to 2028, growing faster than larger markets such as the United States and China.The sector has also attracted high investor interest. Two years back, Reliance Retail Ventures acquire majority 51% stake in Ed-a-Mamma, an infant brand founded by actor Alia Bhatt.Vohra said Chicco intends to open a dozen new stores in the coming year, adding that quick commerce platforms are fuelling the category’s growth, outpacing growth of physical stores.

[TITLE]Gold glitters online as festive shoppers turn to e-commerce, quick commerce platforms for auspicious buys:
[TEXT]
Luxury and prosperity are shining bright this festive season, with online platforms like Amazon and BigBasket witnessing record demand for gold, silver, and fine jewellery purchases ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras.

Premium fashion on Amazon Fashion and Beauty has seen a sharp uptick, led by fine jewellery and luxury watches.

“This festive season, premium fashion is seeing remarkable growth, with luxury watches and gold and diamond jewellery — including lab-grown diamonds — driving demand,” said Siddharth Bhagat, Director, Amazon Fashion and Beauty, India.

Amazon reported a 96% year-on-year surge in gold jewellery sales, driven by brands such as CaratLane, PN Gadgil Jewellers, Joyalukkas, PC Chandra, KISNA, and Malabar Gold & Diamonds. The platform now offers more than five lakh styles across silver, gold, and diamond jewellery, making it the largest fine jewellery destination among online marketplaces.

Bhagat said the company is also seeing strong traction in affordable fine jewellery — with customers buying pieces starting at ₹2,000 for silver and up to ₹40,000 for gold and diamond. Demand for 14K daily-wear jewellery has grown 50 per cent year-on-year, while 18K styles are also gaining popularity.

In line with global trends, Amazon has expanded into lab-grown diamonds, offering jewellery starting at ₹1,699 across more than 50,000 styles. “Amazon is the first and only online marketplace focusing on this whitespace,” Bhagat said.

Gold coins remain a festive favourite, with the most purchased denomination being 2 grams. “Customers continue to prefer Amazon for their auspicious purchases of gold and silver coins during Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras and more,” Bhagat added.

Complementing this, Tata-owned bigbasket also recorded a strong Dhanteras, with gold coin sales rising 146 per cent and silver coins up 234 per cent from last year. Demand for pooja essentials — including diyas, flowers, and festive décor — grew 54 per cent year-on-year.

“Dhanteras is a time for prosperity, devotion, and togetherness. This year, bigbasket ensured our customers could celebrate without compromise, whether it was purchasing auspicious coins or getting the perfect gifts and pooja items in minutes,” said Seshu Kumar, Chief Buying and Merchandising Officer, bigbasket.

With 10-minute delivery and curated festive assortments, bigbasket blended technology and tradition, meeting last-minute festive needs — from auspicious buys to celebratory gifting.

Both platforms are capitalising on India’s accelerating shift toward online festive shopping, where authenticity, convenience, and trust are emerging as the new hallmarks of prosperity.
