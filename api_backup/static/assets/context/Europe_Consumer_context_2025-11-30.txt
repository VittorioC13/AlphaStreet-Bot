[TITLE]Meridianbet Founder and Golden Matrix's Largest Shareholder Aleksandar Milovanovic Completes $8 Million Cash-to-Equity Conversion Under Post-Closing Agreement with Company:
[TEXT]
VALLETTA, Malta and LAS VEGAS, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aleksandar Milovanović, founder and largest shareholder of Meridianbet, has elected to convert $8 million of cash consideration owed to him into equity, further strengthening the Company's balance sheet and demonstrating strong conviction in Golden Matrix's long-term growth trajectory.

Under the terms of the conversion agreement Mr. Milovanovic voluntarily converted $8 million of 18-Month Non-Contingent Post-Closing Cash Consideration into 8 million shares of Golden Matrix common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share.

This transaction was completed pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Sale and Purchase Agreement originally executed in connection with the Company's transformational acquisition of Meridianbet.

This debt-to-equity conversion represents a significant strategic milestone that materially improves Golden Matrix's financial position by:

Eliminating $8 million in near-term cash obligations, preserving capital for growth initiatives and operational expansion

Reducing leverage and enhancing financial flexibility during a period of accelerating business momentum

Demonstrating disciplined capital allocation that prioritizes shareholder value creation

Positioning the Company to capitalize on emerging market opportunities without the constraints of debt service

The conversion is particularly noteworthy as it represents Mr. Milovanović's deliberate choice to increase his equity stake in Golden Matrix rather than receive cash. As one of the Company's largest shareholders and a principal architect of the Meridianbet success story, Mr. Milovanović's decision to further align his interests with public shareholders sends a powerful signal

In February 2025, AI Ain Water introduced the UAE's first locally produced 100% rPET bottled water, transitioning fully to recycled PET bottles to cut reliance on virgin plastic. The move underscores rising demand for sustainable packaging in emerging markets and may influence neighboring regions to adopt similar practices.

[TITLE]20 Retail Workers Share Their Most Insane Black Friday Horror Stories:
[TEXT]
Black Friday is famous for two things: Great deals and horrible tramplings.

So when a post on Reddit’s AskReddit forum asked users to recount their “Black Friday horror stories” the gruesome tales of terrible human behavior stormed in like an angry mob on the day after Thanksgiving.

More specifically the post asked people who have had the distinct misfortune of working retail on Black Friday to recall the horrors that they’ve seen when slavering shoppers meet low-low prices.

Here are some of the worst (and funniest) Black Friday stories from Reddit:

1. The Narc

“We had a lady call the police on our store because we sold out of a TV. I really wish I was lying… they came too.” –Thebootiediaries

2. The Near-Smush Experience

“I almost died when I opened the door when I was working at Best Buy”. –WatchGodwin1

3. The Bootyshort Bandit

“I work at the largest lingerie retailer in the country. We had a security guard last night for the beginning of black Friday. A southern belle mother decided she didn’t want to wait in a 50 person deep line and she would cut. Our security guard asked her multiple times to step to the back of the line or leave. She proceeded to ream him with every curse word in the book, and ended by threatening him with a gun she had in her bag. This will be my last holiday in retail.” –kittiekatie0629

4. The Mission Impossible

“Not so much a horror story but something I just couldn’t believe Black Friday at ASDA (British Walmart) there was these microwaves like 70% off and the store and was so busy you couldn’t move. There were empty shelves all along the aisle up to these microwaves and a guy laid down on the shelf and army crawled along the shelves grabbed a microwave and army crawled back with it.” – VeryLazyLewis

5. The Avoidable Farce

“Worked at a store that had a service department. They couldn’t ring up anything at the service counter but they had a computer which made it look like a register. Guy is standing there patiently waiting to be rung up. Finally somebody notices him and asks what he needs. “I’d like to pay.” he says. “I’m sorry this isn’t a register” replies the service tech. The guy then proceeds to try and convince the service tech to let him pay because the line for the main registers is three hours long. Of course the service tech couldn’t because he didn’t have a register. He just had a computer for making appointments and such. So after 15 minutes of argument the guy moves off to find the line. Here’s the fun part. While he was arguing somebody else saw him standing by something that looked like a register and so got in line behind him. Then people saw the shorter line and got in behind them. With nobody to control it the line to nowhere grew quickly. 15 minutes was all it took for the not-line to snake all the way around the department. So when the doofus who started this whole fiasco went to find the right line he found the end of the line he had started. Then the guy behind him heard that there wasn’t a register so he followed the first guy. Then the next customer followed the 2nd and so on. They walked around in a circle for an hour before somebody noticed them. We almost had a riot when a manager had to tell 100 people that they weren’t in line and had just waited an hour for nothing. That same year we had several scuffles at points where the register line had forked into two lines. From then on we marked off a huge register path and had several employees just manage the line.” –IntentionalTexan

6. The Old-Fashioned Way

“I worked for a golf superstore as a cashier. Black Friday customers come rushing in and the line starts. I proceed to scan the first item and nothing… the registers are completely down and the lines are growing fast. The only thing we could do is take every transaction manually. Write down SKU’s, calculate tax, and use the old credit card swipers for 3 hours. I never worked retail during Black Friday again.” –Steelergrl2310

7. The Oh The Humanity!

“I saw someone get the crap beaten out of them for the toy of the year, a Hatchimal.” –The14thNoah

8. The Parent Trap

“I worked at Toys R Us some years ago. No stand out bad customers, but It surprised me how many parents brought their young children out at 3am and then got mad and would yell at their children for whining/crying because “you can’t get any toys, Christmas is next month. Ask Santa.” Your kid is exhausted and you dragged them to a toy store, of course they’re gonna be pissed off. Working there really changed my perspective from being annoyed at shitty kids in public to being annoyed at shitty parents.” –Because_Science

9. The Biter

“My dad was a police officer when the toy of the year was the Tickle Me Elmo. He responded to a call at Walmart or Target (can’t remember which one exactly) of two women beating each other up over one. When he went to break up the fight, one of the women bit his arm. She bit him so hard that she actually spit some of his skin and blood out onto the floor. He had to get his blood tested every 6 months for 2 years after the incident to make sure he didn’t get any diseases from her. People are fucking crazy.” –JennyAnydots711

10. The Insane…Deals

“I worked one gloomy Friday in the clothes dept at Walmart. For like 2 straight hours before the sale began, people hovered over the pallets. The alarm went off and the swarm just went insane. There were two women in particular on opposite sides, tossing clothes back and forth to each other. Idk what their system was because half the stuff they were just catching and tossing aside. But this little teenager (I mean like petite tiny girl) intercepted a pair of pants being tossed and the women went fucking INSANE and elbowed her in the face. Instant blood and the little girl was so shocked she just stood there shaking and crying. The woman acted like that was a perfectly reasonable thing to do. I pulled her out of the crowd and started to walk her to get her cleaned up when the sheriff appeared out of nowhere. The best part was she was his kid and the woman was arrested on the spot. Hahaha. She had to post bail AND pay full price for her shitty Levi’s.” –arielscoop

11. The Day Off

“I worked at a grocery store in high school. Black Friday was my favorite day all year. Hardly anyone goes food shopping the day after Thanksgiving.” –Tastes_like_SATAN

12. The Tough Customer

“Former GameStop manager. The worst one I ever worked was 2006. Everyone wanted a damn Wii. When I got to the store at 4am to prep for the 5am opening, there were people wrapped around the shopping center in a line for the damn thing even though I had a sign on the door explicitly stating that we could only guarantee them for the first 6 people. When I made the announcement to the folks in line, I thought I was

[TITLE]Weight for food in India’s CPI basket among the highest globally:
[TEXT]
It is widely known that Indian CPI basket has a very high weight for food items. But what are the weights for the major components of CPI – food, housing and transport – in other countries?

A businessline analysis shows that the weight assigned for food in India is among the highest globally. But the weight for transport and communication is among the lowest.

Food dominates

India has assigned the highest weight for food (including alcoholic beverages and tobacco) at 48 per cent on a combined basis. The rural CPI gives an exorbitantly high 57 per cent weigh to this component while the weight in urban CPI is 38 per cent. China, Japan, Brazil and Indonesia have given weights between 25 to 30 per cent for this component. The weight for food is the lowest in the US at 15 per cent.

Two takeaways emerge from this. Firstly, lower income countries seem to be spending a higher proportion of their income on food. Secondly, Asian economies seem to be giving a higher weight to food in their CPI index.

The case for Japan is especially interesting as it assigns 26 per cent to food, even though it is a high-income country. Pre-cooked or frozen meals account for the largest component of food in Japan, at 5.6 per cent of the CPI basket.dated November 27, 2025

Housing and transport

Housing has the second largest weight in most countries’ CPI but in US’ CPI, it occupies the top slot with 44 per cent weight. High rentals in US are leading to a large part of monthly expenditure going towards housing. Rent of shelter, a component of housing and related costs in CPI index of the US has 35.5 per cent weight.

The weight for housing in India is a more modest 16.91 per cent, which aligns with the weights for this category in other countries such as South Korea and Brazil. The low rentals in tier II and III cities and in rural areas, continued prevalence of joint family culture in many regions and a large number of self-owned dwellings could be reducing this expenditure in India.

The weight for transport and communication is among the lowest in India at 8.59 per cent. This could be due to extensive use of bicycles and two-wheelers and a large part of the population preferring to take bus or suburban trains to work. Brazil has the highest weight for this category at 22.31 per cent.

Factoids

The highest weighed component in the CPI basket of EU is non-energy industrial goods at 25.6 per cent. This component includes cars, furniture, clothing, footwear, and electronic personal care items. This component has more weight than food which has 19.3 per cent.

China loves meat, especially pork. Their CPI basket gives 5.9 per cent weight to meat, the largest component of food, while pork alone is almost half of that.

Brazil assigns a higher weight to personal expenses and clothing than education, a peculiarity not observed in other emerging economies like China, India, Indonesia or South Korea, all of which assign higher weight to education than clothing or entertainment.

Vegetarian components of food, especially cereal, milk products and vegetables collectively at 22 per cent, has a heavy influence on India’s CPI basket.

[TITLE]Ahead of Black Friday, Report Reveals Attacks on Garment Workers' Right to Organize:
[TEXT]
With clothing companies that will be offering discounted Black Friday deals this week relying heavily on the labor of tens of millions underpaid and overworked garment workers across the Global South, two reports by the human rights group Amnesty International make the case that ensuring these employees are afforded the right to organize their workplaces is key to ending worker exploitation across the fashion industry.

The organization interviewed 64 garment workers in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan from 2023-24, including 12 union organizers and labor rights activists, for its report titled Stitched Up,

[TEXT]
The $250 million fund will support high-potential Indian brands to expand globally, leveraging Dubai’s connectivity with India Global Forum’s powerful ecosystem.

DUBAI, UAE and NEW DELHI, Nov. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- India Global Forum (IGF) today announced a first-of-its-kind $250 million fund dedicated to helping India’s most ambitious consumer and industrial brands expand into global markets. Anchored by Ved Family Office and Ananta Capital, the fund was unveiled at IGF Middle East 2025: NXT Frontiers in Dubai in the presence of senior business leaders, policymakers and innovators shaping the future of the India–UAE corridor.

The new fund will combine growth capital, world-class logistics and market access, and IGF’s powerful convening and networks. Through a dedicated Accelerator Programme, Indian companies will be supported to scale into key international markets across the Middle East, Africa, Europe and beyond.

Unveiling the initiative at the fifth edition of IGF’s Dubai forum, Manoj Ladwa, Founder & Chairman, India Global Forum, said: “India is producing brands that are ready for the world, and Dubai is the natural launchpad for their global ambitions. Through this $250 million fund, we are unlocking a new era of opportunity, where Indian entrepreneurship meets world-class infrastructure, global capital and international demand.”

The programme brings together IGF’s unparalleled networks across business, government and innovation with Dubai’s logistics ecosystem through DP World. Participating companies will gain access to tailored market-entry support as well as curated introductions to investors, partners and potential customers.

The fund and accelerator will focus on high-potential Indian companies across sectors including food & beverage, consumer brands, chemicals, automotive, advanced manufacturing and industrial products. IGF will work closely with partners to identify companies with strong brands, global scalability and a compelling value proposition for international markets.

Reflecting on the significance of this moment for India–UAE business ties, Nilesh Ved, Chairman, Ved Family Office and Apparel Group, commented: “The UAE has long been a bridge between India and global markets. As anchor investors in this fund, we see a tremendous opportunity to back the next generation of Indian brands that can go global from Dubai. This initiative will give founders the confidence, capability and connectivity they need to scale internationally.”

Ashutosh Taparia, Founder & Managing Partner, Ananta Capital, added: “India is at an inflection point where homegrown brands are ready to compete and win globally. By anchoring this fund, we aim to provide patient, strategic capital and partner with entrepreneurs who are building durable, category-defining businesses.”

Speaking at the launch, Abdulla Al Hashmi, COO Parks & Zones, DP World GCC, said: “We welcome initiatives that empower Indian businesses to scale globally through the UAE. With one of the most advanced trade ecosystems in the world, Indian businesses can use Dubai’s connectivity to reach more than 3 billion consumers in fast-growing regional markets.”

The Accelerator Programme marks a major step forward in strengthening the economic partnership between India and the UAE. It offers founders access to global infrastructure, world-class logistics, curated networks and strategic capital — all under one integrated platform designed to take Indian brands global.

IGF Middle East 2025: NXT Frontiers convened 90 senior leaders from government, global corporations, venture capital, advanced technology, academia and next-generation enterprises to explore how India’s rapid digital and economic transformation can complement Gulf capital and innovation ecosystems to unlock growth across nine frontier themes: Capital, Deep Technology, Intelligence, Consumer Capital, Experience, Resilience, Healthspan, Ambition and Inclusion. Through roundtables, plenaries, fireside dialogues and curated networking, participants examined the opportunities and challenges reshaping the global economy amid geopolitical disruption and rapid digitalisation.

[TITLE]Give the Gift of Learning With MasterClass Courses Led by Marc Jacobs, Bobbi Brown, and Diane von Furstenberg — 50% off Today Only:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

One of the very best things you can give someone this holiday season isn’t a thing at all. Instead, it’s the gift of knowledge (as cheesy as that sounds) — straight from the pros. Where such a present is to be found? Over at MasterClass, of course, which is our editors’ favorite online learning platform, based on the sheer diversity of its courses and just how engaging each one turns out to be.

For a limited time only (read: through the end of today, meaning you have absolutely no time to waste), all MasterClass subscriptions are going for 50 percent off. A single membership gets you access to over 200 classes taught by individuals at the top of their respective fields, which you can watch from anywhere (yes, even on “Airplane Mode” while jet-setting to Bali, if you happen to invest in the platform’s “Plus” or “Premium” packages).

MasterClass One-Year Standard Subscription $60 $120 50% off Buy Now at masterclass

Price upon publish date of this article: $60

Essentially, MasterClass operates on three tier levels. “Standard” (now $5/month versus the regular $10) lets you learn on one device only, with no offline capabilities. “Plus” ($8/mo) allows for two devices and treats users to its offline functionality. Lastly, “Premium” ($10/mo) lets you connect up to six devices to a single subscription. And while we totally recommend pampering yourself with what MasterClass has up its sleeve when it comes to interactive courses across categories like design, film and TV, food, wellness, music, science, writing, and more, this is a gift-worthy purchase if we’ve ever seen one. That’s why MasterClass lets you easily forward a subscription to someone else, at an annual rate of $60 versus $120 (a printable gift option is available and the giftee has 30 days to cancel with a money-back guarantee).

Now, onto the part you were no doubt waiting for. What courses are actually worth checking out? If you have an unlimited reserve of time, our answer is: All of them. But, more realistically, picking the ones that most align with your interests is a solid bet, and those who are obsessed with the latest fashion trends, follow every major makeup artist on social media, and in general love nothing more than getting their glam on would be wise to explore MasterClass’ “Personal Style” category.

Here, you can master the art of self-expression through clothes under the tutelage of stylist-to-the-stars Karla Welch; learn the basics of fashion sketching and putting on a runway show with Marc Jacobs as your teacher; go behind the scenes of creating a fashion empire with Diane von Furstenberg; and get tips on acing an everyday makeup look, straight from the lips of beauty maven Bobbi Brown.

And in case all you (or the woman on your list) want for Christmas is healthier, more radiant skin, turn to one of MasterClass’ most recent releases: a dermatologist-led class that was extensively reviewed by our commerce beauty editors earlier this year. Called “Skin Health,” the offering features a total of 20 episodes through which you will get a firmer grasp on everything from scalp health and lip care to good-for-skin nutrition and effective nighttime routines that cut through the TikTok BS. The experts spearheading all this are Dr. Shereene Idriss, social media darling, dermatologist, and founder of skin care line Dr. Idriss; Dr. Michelle Henry, cosmetic dermatologist and clinical instructor at Weill Cornell Medicine; Ron Robinson, award-winning cosmetic chemist; and Dr. April Armstrong, UCLA’s chief of dermatology.

By the end of your “Skin Health” journey, you’ll have an understanding of proper sunscreen usage, what peptides can do for your face, and everything in between. Courtesy MasterClass

A MasterClass subscription, whichever level you get it at, is the key to becoming a more informed and well-rounded person, while chasing your passions and enriching your mind outside of that nine-to-five. This is something everyone wants more of in their lives, making MasterClass the great equalizer when it comes to shopping for your style-guru mom, beauty microinfluencer sister, wife who does the “morning shed” ritual each day like clockwork, and even the best friend-slash-holiday hostess who has expressed her wishes to pivot careers and become a designer (hey, anything is possible).

Don’t miss the moment and shop MasterClass memberships for half off, today only. Then proceed to click play on your newest hobby.
