[TITLE]Nvidia buys AI software provider SchedMD to expand open-source AI push:
[TEXT]
Dec 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia said on Monday it acquired AI software firm SchedMD, as the chip designer doubles down on open-source technology ​and steps up investments in the artificial intelligence ecosystem to fend off ‌rising competition.

The chip designer built its reputation on speedy chips, but it also offers a range ‌of its own AI models, from physics simulations to self-driving vehicles, as open-source software that researchers and companies can use.

Its proprietary CUDA software, a standard among most developers, is a major selling point for its chips, making software key to ⁠maintaining its dominance in the ‌AI industry.

Nvidia shares were up 1.35% after the news and an earlier announcement of new open-source AI models.

SchedMD provides software ‍that helps schedule large computing jobs that can occupy a big share of a data center's server capacity.

Its technology, called Slurm, is open source, meaning developers and firms can ​access it for free, while the company sells engineering and maintenance support.

Financial terms ‌of the deal were not disclosed. Nvidia said it would continue to distribute SchedMD's software on an open-source basis.

"Slurm, which is supported on the latest Nvidia hardware, is also part of the critical infrastructure needed for generative AI, used by foundation model developers and AI builders to manage model training and inference ⁠needs," Nvidia said in a blog post.

Earlier ​on Monday, Nvidia unveiled a new family of ​open-source AI models that it says will be faster, cheaper and smarter than its previous offerings, as it faces a growing wave ‍of rival open-source ⁠models from Chinese AI labs.

SchedMD was founded in 2010 by Slurm software developers Morris "Moe" Jette and Danny Auble in Livermore, California, and the company ⁠currently employs 40 people, according to its website.

Its customers include cloud infrastructure firm CoreWeave and ‌the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, among others.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs leads investment in software delivery startup Harness at $5.5 billion valuation:
[TEXT]
Jyoti Bansal, co-founder and CEO of Harness, speaks at the company's Unscripted conference in London on Sept. 25, 2025.

Almost nine years ago, Jyoti Bansal sold AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion just as the software startup was set to go public.

Bansal's latest venture, Harness, is now worth substantially more than that, after raking in $200 million in fresh capital at a $5.5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs .

Harness' technology helps companies manage and monitor code that's produced with the help of artificial intelligence, making sure it doesn't break, create security vulnerabilities or trigger cost overruns. It's a compliment to the so-called vibe coding trend that's taken off with the boom in generative AI.

In recent months, venture capitalists have poured money into startups such as Cursor, Lovable and most recently Kilo Code that sell subscriptions for tools for directing AI models to write and update software. Harness' software draws on models from Anthropic and OpenAI.

Earlier this year, Bansal bolstered Harness' cybersecurity chops by merging the startup with Traceable, another company he co-founded. The combined company, based in San Francisco, has a total of about 1,300 employees.

Harness is on track to exceed its goal of more than $250 million in annualized revenue, growing more than 50% year over year, Bansal said. That makes it larger than AppDynamics at the time it was acquired by Cisco.

Bansal is aiming for a different outcome this time.

"I'm a believer that at the right market timing, we want to operate as a public company, so we can build for the long term," Bansal said.

In addition to the funding round, Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer to provide some liquidity to long-standing employees.

[TITLE]How tax havens really help in raising debt:
[TEXT]
In the complex world of global finance, the line between strategic financial planning and aggressive tax avoidance is often drawn in the sand of a distant shore. A significant body of research has illuminated a pervasive trend — the strategic use of tax havens not just to hide profits, but to issue debt.

While the public imagination often pictures tax havens as repositories for illicit cash, for modern multinational corporations, they function more like high-efficiency conduits for capital.

This phenomenon is particularly visible in emerging markets like India, where major conglomerates in sectors such as telecommunications and renewable energy (to name a few) have historically utilised subsidiaries in tax haven jurisdictions (like Singapore and the Netherlands) to optimise their tax liabilities and access global capital markets.

Offshore Debt Issuance

The primary motivation for issuing debt through a tax haven is often a potent mix of tax arbitrage and capital accessibility. When a company borrows money, the interest it pays is typically tax-deductible, reducing its overall taxable income. This tax shield is a standard feature of corporate finance.

However, multinational firms can supercharge this benefit by routing the debt through a low-tax jurisdiction. In this model, a subsidiary is established in a tax haven to act as the primary borrower. This subsidiary issues bonds to international investors or takes loans from global banks. It then on-lends this capital to the parent company in the high-tax home country. The parent company pays interest to the subsidiary, claiming a tax deduction in its high-tax home jurisdiction, while the subsidiary receives that interest income in a jurisdiction where it is taxed lightly or not at all.

This structure creates a distinct financial advantage that goes beyond simple interest rate differentials. If the parent company were to borrow directly from foreign investors, it might face significant withholding taxes on the interest payments sent abroad. However, by inserting a subsidiary in a jurisdiction that has a favourable tax treaty with the home country, the company can significantly reduce or eliminate these withholding taxes.

This creates a smoother, less costly flow of capital. For companies in capital-intensive industries, like building telecom towers or wind farms, saving even a fraction of a percentage point on debt costs can translate to millions of dollars in savings over the lifespan of a loan.

Mechanics of ‘debt shift’

The operational mechanics of these transactions are sophisticated. A typical structure might involve, for example, an Indian parent company creating a subsidiary in Singapore. This Singaporean entity issues dollar-denominated bonds to international investors. Because the subsidiary is located in a high-rating financial hub, it might secure capital at competitive rates. The proceeds from this bond issue are then lent to the Indian parent company. The Indian parent pays interest on this intra-company loan. In India, this interest payment is treated as an expense, lowering the company’s taxable profit.

Meanwhile, the interest income received by the Singapore subsidiary is taxed at a low rate (or effectively shielded through various exemptions and incentives available to global trading companies).

This mechanism allows the corporate group to effectively shift profits out of the high-tax jurisdiction (India) and into the low-tax jurisdiction (For instance, Singapore or Netherlands). The academic literature highlights this as a form of base erosion, where the tax base of the developing country is eroded by deductible payments sent offshore.

For the companies involved, however, this is presented as a legitimate tool for balance sheet efficiency. It allows them to hedge against currency risks and tap into a pool of global liquidity that might not be available domestically. In sectors like infrastructure or telecommunications, where upfront capital expenditure is massive and revenue generation is spread over decades, this access to efficient global debt is often cited as a critical survival mechanism.

The Indian landscape

Regulators have not been blind to these practices. Over the last decade, the Indian government and global bodies like the OECD have tightened the screws on such structures. The introduction of the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) in India and the global Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) framework aims to curb treaty shopping i.e., the practice of routing funds solely to take advantage of tax treaties.

Under new norms, companies must demonstrate “substance” in the subsidiary wherein it cannot just be a mailbox in Amsterdam or a file folder in Singapore. It must have actual employees, office space, and genuine economic activity. This has forced many Indian companies to restructure their offshore operations, moving away from purely tax-driven vehicles to more substantive international holding structures.

The use of tax havens for debt issuance is a testament to the fluidity of global capital. It highlights a fundamental tension in the global economy i.e., the friction between national tax laws and the borderless nature of modern finance. For the companies involved, routing debt through tax havens to some extent remains a rational economic decision driven by the imperative to minimise costs and maximise shareholder value.

However, as scrutiny intensifies and regulatory nets tighten, the free pass of the offshore conduit is disappearing. The future of corporate finance will likely demand more transparency, forcing companies to justify their offshore presence not just with tax returns, but with genuine economic purpose.

[TITLE]Verizon partners with Array Digital Infrastructure for tower usage:
[TEXT]
Verizon Communications Inc. and Array Digital Infrastructure, Inc. have entered into a new strategic partnership through which the carrier will use Array’s national portfolio of 4,400 towers to enhance its 5G network.

The multi-year deal permits Verizon to co-locate on several new Array Digital Infrastructure sites over the next several years for an established — though undisclosed — price.

“This strategic partnership with Array is a key part of our network tower management strategy,” Phillip French, Verizon vice president of engineering, said in a prepared statement.

“It provides us with the nimbleness and flexibility to manage our network portfolio efficiently. The streamlined agreement allows for greater cost efficiency and, most importantly, accelerates our ability to deploy advanced wireless technologies to Verizon customers across the nation.”

“Our partnership with Verizon, particularly with this new agreement, creates great opportunities for both organizations,” said Array Digital Infrstructure President and CEO Anthony Carlson. “We’re pleased to continue growing Array and strengthening our position as one of the leading tower companies in the United States.”

Array Digital Infrastructure, formerly known as UScellular, was in the news recently after the purchase of some of its spectrum by AT&T was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

The $101.8 billion deal, first announced in early November 2024, was part of Array Digital Infrastructure’s effort to divest itself of licenses that were not included in the company’s acquisition by T-Mobile.

The FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau portrayed the deal as posing little risk and agreed that a significant upside potential exists. But the Rural Wireless Association (RWA) released a statement criticizing the FCC decision and a decision related to a different Verizon/Array Digital Infrastructure deal than the one announced today.

“These two staff level decisions, along with an expected decision allowing Verizon to acquire UScellular spectrum collectively, amount to the death of mobile wireless competition,” RWA outside counsel Carri Bennet said in the statement.

[TITLE]Elizabeth Warren Urges DOJ and FCC to Scrutinize $6.2 Billion Nexstar-Tegna Merger:
[TEXT]
Sen. Elizabeth Warren has taken aim at Nexstar and Tegna’s $6.2 billion merger, warning in a new letter that the combined entity would “likely raise prices for consumers, accelerate job losses, and weaken the independence and news coverage of local TV stations.”

She also said the move is “presumptively illegal” because the combined company would reach 80% of U.S. TV households, exceeding the FCC’s 39% national cap on station ownership.

Warren urged the Department of Justice’s antitrust chief Gail Slater and FCC chairman Brendan Carr to scrutinize the deal, including by holding public hearings, and potentially block it if it’s found to violate federal telecommunications or antitrust laws by lessening competition or not serving the public interest.

Under the terms of the deal, Nexstar and Tegna will have a combined portfolio of 265 television stations in 44 states and the District of Columbia. It would also have stations in nine of the top 10 markets, and in 41 of the top 50.

“The approval of a Nexstar-Tegna deal will entrench Nexstar’s existing market dominance in local TV markets across the United States, some of which are already duopolies,” Warren said. “A Nexstar-Tegna conglomerate would control two of the top — and in some cases, three — local TV stations in Sacramento, St. Louis, Denver, Scranton, Des Moines, Knoxville, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Minneapolis, among many other major media markets.”

She also said the combined Nexstar-Tegna would have increased leverage to extract favorable terms with pay TV distributors and advertisers and drive up prices on retransmission consent fees and could lead to blackouts across an increased number of stations.

“The costs of these changes would be passed on to subscribers to cable and satellite services, who have already seen two decades of price increases on “signals that are otherwise free over the air,” Warren continued.

Additionally, Warren warned that more industry consolidation would result in local newsroom layoffs and a reduction in the diversity of news coverage. She pointed to multiple M&A deals that have led to job cuts, including Nexstar’s acquisition of Tribune in 2019, E.W. Scripps’ acquisition of ION Media Group in 2020 and Skydance’s merger with Paramount Global that closed in August.

Per the letter, there are 35 markets where Nexstar and Tegna both control stations that can be folded if their merger is approved. The deal is expected to generate approximately $300 million in cost savings. Warren also claimed that Nexstar is the “largest duplicator of news content today” and that the combination could reduce the diversity of coverage offered by stations across the country by accelerating a “homogenization of content.”

In the letter, Warren called out Carr’s comments in which he threatened to take action against Jimmy Kimmel for remarks the late night host made

[TITLE]Nvidia's Depreciation Time Bomb: Jim Chanos Warns Of 'Massive Financial Risk' For CoreWeave, Oracle:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Legendary short-seller Jim Chanos is sounding the alarm on the AI infrastructure boom, warning that a critical accounting oversight regarding Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips creates a “massive financial risk” for the sector's aggressive spenders.

Depreciation Trap

In a recent podcast interview, Chanos argued that data center operators, specifically Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) and “neocloud” provider CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV), are overstating their future profitability by relying on unrealistic depreciation schedules for their artificial intelligence (AI) hardware.

The core of Chanos' bearish thesis is the estimated lifespan of the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution.

Don’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

While hyperscalers and neoclouds typically depreciate these expensive assets over six years, Chanos contends that the relentless pace of Nvidia's innovation renders them obsolete much faster.

He noted that rental rates for Nvidia's “Hopper” chips have already plummeted roughly 28% year-over-year as newer models enter the market. If the useful economic life of a chip is closer to three or four years rather than six, companies must drastically increase their annual depreciation expenses, which would crush reported earnings.

“If the chips last for three years, you have to depreciate a third of what you spend,” Chanos explained. “That's the bet you have to make if you're a CoreWeave investor.”

Benzinga reached out to Nvidia for comment on Chanos’ claims regarding GPU depreciation schedules and the useful life of its chips, but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Oracle's ‘Fundamental' Problem

Chanos singled out Oracle as the most vulnerable among the tech giants. He noted that, unlike Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Oracle is not currently earning its cost of capital on its massive AI investments.

He described the company's aggressive spending spree as a “bet the company” strategy that leaves little room for error.

“If AI monetization gets pushed out... to 2030 or whenever, then Oracle will have fundamental financial problems,” Chanos warned.
