NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWS WIRE SERVICES OR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stallion Uranium Corp. (the “Company” or “Stallion”) (TSX-V: STUD; OTCQB: STLNF; FSE: FE0) is pleased to announce that it has closed a first tranche of its previously announced non-brokered private placement of units and flow-through units (the “Offering”). This closing consisted of 21,239,800 units of the Company (each a “NFT Unit”) at a price of $0.20 per NFT Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of $4,247,960 and 1,315,000 flow-through units (each a “FT Unit”) at a price of $0.20 per FT Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of $263,000.

Each FT Unit consists of one flow-through common share of the Company as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (a “FT Share”) and one FT Share purchase warrant (each a “FT Warrant”). Each FT Warrant entities the holder to purchase one additional FT Share in the capital of the Company (a “FT Warrant Share”) at a price of $0.26 per FT Warrant Share for a period of 60 months from the closing of the date of issuance.

Each NFT Unit consists of one non-flow-through common share in the capital of the Company (a “NFT Share”) and one share purchase warrant (a “NFT Warrant”). Each NFT Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional non-flow-through common share in the capital of the Company (a “NFT Warrant Share”) at a price of $0.26 per NFT Warrant Share for a period of 60 months from the date of issuance.

The NFT Units and FT Units issued pursuant to the first tranche of the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period under applicable Canadian securities laws that expires on December 21, 2025.

In connection with the closing of the first tranche of the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 668,003 NFT Shares and 668,003 non-transferable NFT Share purchase warrants (the “Finder’s Warrants”) to eligible arms’ length finders, DJ Sheehan Consulting Limited and Edward Marlow. Each Finder’s Warrant is exercisable into one NFT Share (a “Finder’s Warrant Share”) at a price of $0.26 per Finder’s Warrant Share for a period of 60 months from the date of issuance. In connection with the first tranche of the Offering, the Company has paid cash finder’s fees totaling an aggregate of $173,976.67 to Accilent Capital Management Inc. and DJ Sheehan Consulting Limited.

Upsizing of the Offering:

Due to market demand, the Company has increased the size of the Offering from up to $12,000,000 to up to $15,000,000. The Company anticipates completing a second closing of the Offering on or before August 30, 2025.

The upsized Offering will consist of up to a combined aggregate of 75,000,000 FT Units and NFT Units for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $15,000,000. The Company anticipates that, upon completion of all tranches of the Offering, a new Control Person (as defined below), Mr. Matthew Mason (“Mr. Mason”), will be created though Mr. Mason’s anticipated purchase of 15,000,000 FT Units. Mr. Mason’s subscription is subject to obtaining requisite approval from the disinterested shareholders of the Company (as further described below) and the TSX Venture Exchange (the "TSXV").

The gross proceeds raised from the issuance of the FT Units will be used by the Company to incur exploration expenditures on the Company’s resource claims in the province of Saskatchewan and will constitute “Canadian exploration expenses” as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada). The net proceeds raised from the issuance of the NFT Units will be used by the Company for exploration and development activities of its Athabasca Basin properties and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Closing of the Offering is subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of all necessary corporate and regulatory approvals, including the TSXV. Policy 4.1 of the TSXV Corporate Finance Manual requires disinterested shareholder approval where a transaction creates a shareholder that holds or controls 20% or more of an issuer's shares (a "Control Person"). The Company anticipates that Mr. Mason’s purchase of FT Units under the Offering will create a new Control Person pursuant to Policy 4.1. To fulfil the requirements of Policy 4.1, the Company intends to seek approval of disinterested shareholders holding or controlling more than 50% of its common shares of the Company to approve the creation of the new Control Person by written consent resolution. All securities issued in connection with the Offering will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months plus a day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities legislation.

Finder’s fees may be payable in connection with the completion of further tranches of the Offering in accordance with TSXV policies. In connection with the Offering, the Company has entered into an Advisory Agreement with Canaccord Genuity Corp. (the “Advisor”), pursuant to which the Advisor shall provide financial advisory, consulting, and support services in connection with the Offering (the “Advisory Services”). In consideration for the Advisory Services, subject to the approval of the TSXV, the Company will pay the Advisor a work fee equal to $150,000 (the “Fee”). The Fee shall be payable in units at the terms matching those of the NFT Units in the Offering. The Fee Units and the underlying securities issued to the Advisor will be subject to a four month and one day hold period in accordance with Canadian securities laws.

Insiders of the Company will participate in the Offering. Any such participation will be considered a “related party transaction” as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). The Offering is expected to be exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101, as neither the fair market value of any securities issued to such insiders nor the consideration that will be paid by such persons will exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization.

This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to sell any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act") or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. Persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.

[TITLE]Centrica Signs 10 Year Deal for USA Natural Gas With Devon Energy:
[TEXT]
The deal expands Centrica's global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office.

Centrica Plc signed a 10-year agreement to buy natural gas from Devon Energy Corp. to help expand its activities across the Atlantic.

Centrica Energy, its trading arm, will receive 50,000 million British thermal units per day of natural gas from 2028, or the equivalent of five liquefied natural gas cargoes per year, according to a statement on Friday. The volumes will be indexed to TTF, the European benchmark price.

The deal expands Centrica’s global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office. The agreement will also help the firm to manage the price risk in its liquefied natural gas portfolio by aligning feed gas rates with European futures. For Devon, the deal offers exposure to international markets, according to the statement.

“Gas remains an essential transition fuel and, through long-term agreements like this, Centrica ensures competitively-indexed gas supply,” said Centrica Chief Executive Officer Chris O’Shea.

US natural gas producers are increasingly seeking to lock in agreements with buyers overseas. Both the Asian and the European benchmarks for the heating and power-generation fuel trade at roughly four times the price at Henry Hub in Louisiana, the US benchmark.

In February, Centrica signed a 15-year agreement to supply American LNG to Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and last year it struck a deal with US-based Coterra Energy Inc. to secure more gas.

[TITLE]Inox Wind sells ₹175 crore stake in EPC subsidiary at ₹7,400 crore valuation:
[TEXT]
Inox Wind Limited announced that it has sold a stake worth approximately ₹175 crores in its engineering, procurement and construction subsidiary Inox Renewable Solutions Ltd. to investors. The transaction values the subsidiary at around ₹7,400 crores post-merger.

The stake sale involves Inox Renewable Solutions Ltd., formerly known as Resco Global Wind Services Pvt. Ltd., which serves as the EPC arm of India’s leading wind energy solutions provider. The valuation reflects the post-merger value following a recent corporate restructuring where the substation business from Inox Green was demerged and merged into IRSL, which received regulatory approval from stock exchanges.

Inox Renewable Solutions ranks among India’s top two wind EPC service providers with over 14 years of operational experience. The company provides end-to-end renewable project services from conceptualization to commissioning, including transmission infrastructure construction. It has expanded its offerings to include crane services, transformer manufacturing, and power evacuation asset hybridization.

The subsidiary benefits from strong revenue visibility through Inox Wind’s diversified order book of approximately 3.1 GW with a healthy pipeline. IRSL operates across India with a strong presence in western regions and is developing multi-gigawatt scale common infrastructure for future renewable projects.

Inox Wind Limited is part of the $12 billion INOXGFL Group and operates four manufacturing plants with a 2.5 GW annual capacity.

The shares of Inox Wind Limited were trading at ₹144.25 up by ₹4.26 or 3.04 per cent on the NSE at 11.27 am.

[TITLE]Duke Energy promises over $1 billion in savings over a decade from merger of North, South Carolina utilities:
[TEXT]
Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation’s largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That’s after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina — including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina. But its coverage area also includes Asheville, North Carolina, in the west.

The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They would all continue to regulate the combined utility.
