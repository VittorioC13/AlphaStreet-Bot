[TITLE]Share Market Today highlights 8 October 2025: Markets end lower as IT outshines amid pre-earnings caution; Gold hits historic high:
[TEXT]
* * Increased macro concerns keeping enterprise clients to remain cautious on spends

* Expect Midcap IT cos to post healthy QoQ sales growth

* * Sector valuations will remain under check and range bound in the near-medium term

Mumbai, October 6, 2025 — Financial services firm Equirus Securities has released a press note detailing a preview of Q2FY26 earnings of the IT sector. As per the press note, the Top-6 large IT companies are likely to report CC US$ Sales growth of 0% to 2.1% QoQ in Q2 (expect LTI Mindtree & Infosys at close to upper end and Wipro IT Services close to lower end). The midcap IT companies are expected to post healthy QoQ sales growth in Coforge, Persistent Systems, R-Systems and eClerx.

The heightened macroeconomic concerns that started in March 2025 has been keeping enterprise clients to remain cautious on incremental Tech led Services spend. But, at the same time demand trends are stable QoQ in Q2. Hence, with likely conversion of increasing deal wins (on cost-take-out side) into revenues, Equirus Securities expect most of the large caps to show some improvement in QoQ CC US$ sales growth rates in Q2 vs Q1FY26. Good execution on EBITM is likely to continue in 2Q with QoQ dip of 36bps (for Wipro IT Services) to increase of 71bps in top-6 large caps considering tailwinds from currency benefits (INR/US$ depreciated by nearly 3% QoQ in Q2 on an average for most companies) and benign supply-side issues, cost optimisation and productivity led gains.

Expect higher QoQ Sales growth in most of Top 6 large caps in 2Q vs. 1Q

Equirus Securities expect top 6 large caps to register QoQ growth of flat to 2.1% in US$ Sales in CC terms in 2QFY26E. A marginally positive impact of 2-28 bps QoQ is expected from cross currency tailwinds across most of the top 6 large caps in Q2. The sales performance will likely be healthy from some of the midcap companies incl. Coforge, Persistent Systems, R-Systems and eClerx with expected US$ Sales growth in the range of 3.6% to 5.8% QoQ (Persistent Systems at the lower end and Coforge at the upper end) in CC terms. Equirus Securities expect CC US$ Sales growth to remain tepid in most the ER&D companies (led by soft demand continuing in Mobility/Auto) with LTTS to lead with expected 1.6% CC QoQ growth in US$ Sales in Q2.

Demand commentary likely to remain cautious

Equirus Securities expects demand commentary to remain cautious (unless some certainty relating to tariff related issues emerges ahead). However, it believes vendors are still witnessing better demand tailwinds in BFSI. For 2QFY26E, they expect mix trends on deal TCV (on Qoq basis). Key thing to watch will be management commentary regarding deal pipeline and any further delays in decision-making regarding deal awards and start/ramp up of earlier won deals.

Expect some tweak in Infosys’s FY26E Sales growth guidance

Equirus Securities expects Infosys to guide for 2.0-3.0% CC growth in US$ Sales (vs. current growth guidance of 1-3%; inorganic growth contribution from Versent Group unlikely to be factored into growth guidance given its pending closure) with no change in its EBITM guidance of 20-22% for FY26E. Equirus Securities expects no change in HCL Tech’s CC US$ Sales growth guidance of 3-5% (c.2-4% Organic) both for Services & Consol. US$ Sales with no change in its Consol. EBITM guidance of 17-18% for FY26E. The research house expects Wipro to guide for (-) 0.5% to (+) 1.5% QoQ growth in IT Services US$ Sales for 3QFY26E in CC terms.

Remain selective

Equirus Securities recommends remaining selective and prefer Infosys/Tech Mahindra amongst large caps and prefer Mphasis/Zensar/KPIT/eClerx amongst midcaps on a relative basis

[TEXT]
Laura Modi, co-founder and CEO of infant formula startup Bobbie, is on a mission to transform an industry that she says has been stagnant for decades, and shift the culture around how parents feed their babies.

Modi, a former Airbnb executive, came up with the idea for Bobbie after the birth of her first child.

"I remember walking into a pharmacy buying infant formula and hoping that they would give me a bag that you couldn't see through it, because I felt so embarrassed

[TITLE]What’s Propelling and Stalling the Industry’s Traceability Preparedness:
[TEXT]
When it comes to traceability, there is a gap between the industry’s intentions and their actions.

According to a survey conducted by Sourcing Journal in partnership with Oritain, 63 percent of industry executives indicate traceability is a strategic advantage, yet just 44 percent are actively tracing goods. The remaining 56 percent either have a plan in place but are not actively tracing goods yet or they have no plan in place. During a panel at Sourcing Journal’s Fall Summit, moderated by SJ and Fairchild Studio director Lauren Parker, speakers dove into the motivations behind traceability investments and what is still holding companies’ efforts back.

Looking at the key drivers shaping traceability, protecting brand reputation came out on top with 40 percent of respondents. This was followed by consumer demand for transparency and expected regulatory pressures, reflecting the growing need for compliance preparedness.

“The cost of trading non-compliant or unethical goods significantly outweighs the cost of investing in a pretty robust due diligence program,” said Ben Tomkins, regional vice president, Americas at Oritain, which uses forensic science to verify raw material origins. “The longer the businesses take to implement a degree of traceability, the more acute their risk becomes as well.”

One piece of legislation spurring the industry to action on traceability is the United States’ Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which bars imports tied to China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Between 2023 and 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s shipment detentions rose 25 percent, and the detention increase was sharper in apparel, footwear and textiles, rising 33.4 percent the same year. “UFLPA was a huge catalyst for sort of moving the need of traceability from a nice to have to sort of a business necessity,” said Tomkins.

This crackdown on slavery and forced labor extends beyond the U.S. with the United Kingdom’s Transparency in Supply Chain Act and the European Union’s Forced Labour Regulation. Companies are also facing escalating due diligence requirements from regulations like the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

Further, EU legislation will soon mandate digital product passports. To create DPPs, companies must have knowledge

[TITLE]One Month After Its $2.4B Acquisition of Foot Locker, Here Are 3 Burning Questions Dick’s Should Answer:
[TEXT]
Questions still remain one month after Dick’s Sporting Goods completed its $2.4 billion acquisition of .

And market watchers will have to wait a little bit longer to get some answers.

As Dick’s executive chairman Ed Stack said during the company’s second quarter earnings call in August, a full picture of its plans for will not be disclosed until its third quarter earnings call next month. Stack added at a recent conference that Wall Street should expect details on the expectations for Foot Locker on the company’s fourth quarter earnings call in March 2026.

As for what we do know, the company said in September that it will now operate more than 3,200 stores plus e-commerce and digital businesses across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, plus a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Dick’s also noted that it will continue to operate Foot Locker’s portfolio of brands, including Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and Atmos, under a new leadership team.

Stack will lead the global Foot Locker businesses, in partnership with two new presidents, one for North America and one for international. For North America, Dick’s has named the controversial former Nike executive Ann Freeman as president of the North America. As for its international business, Dick’s said it has yet to officially name a president for the division.

By banner, Tony Aversa will serve as senior vice president and general manager of Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker North America, while Denise Karkos will serve as senior vice president and general manager of Champs Sports. No leadership changes were noted at WSS and Atmos at the time.

These executive changes also meant that Mary Dillon, chief executive officer of Foot Locker, and Franklin Bracken, who was just promoted to president of Foot Locker in March, have exited the company.

Looking ahead to November’s Q3 earnings report, here are the top three remaining questions Dick’s should address on the future of Foot Locker and the integration of the two massive sports retailers.

Will Foot Locker still move its headquarters to Florida?

In August 2024, Foot Locker announced its intention to make the move its global headquarters to St. Petersburg, Fla. in 2025 while maintaining a smaller presence in its current New York City office. At the time, Foot Locker said the move would help to cut costs and drive collaboration among teams in a location where many employees are already based. (Champs is already headquartered in St. Pete.)

In March, it looked like the move was one step closer to happening when national real estate investment firm The Feil Organization disclosed that the sneaker retailer had signed a long-term office lease for a 110,998-square-foot space in St. Pete.

But since Dick’s Sporting Goods is based in Pittsburgh, some think the move to Florida does not seem likely. According to Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser, his checks indicate that Foot Locker’s merchant team will remain in NYC and not move to St. Petersburg. “Dick’s has not confirmed our check,” Poser wrote in a note last month. “Keeping the Foot Locker team in NYC is best, in our view, for talent acquisition, and having close contact with core streetwear and fashion sneaker consumers.”

Will Dick’s continue to operate Foot Locker’s full portfolio of store banners?

While Dick’s confirmed that it will operate Foot Locker’s portfolio of store brands, some analysts are skeptical that it will remain that way for long. In an Aug. 27 note, Poser wrote that Williams Trading “would not be surprised” if Dick’s chooses to sell WSS, and shutdown Champs.

In a later note last month, the analyst noted that Champs “may not be long as a going concern under Dick’s ownership. Poser cited the appointment of Karkos as SVP and GM of Champs Sports as to why Champs may not be a focus for the company. “Karkos’ lack of footwear, apparel, and store experience lead us to believe that she is leading Champs, which has been a distraction to Foot Locker (in our view), until it is no longer a distraction,” Poser wrote.

With the integration of the businesses, when will layoffs be revealed?

During the acquisition process, Dick’s touted that the combined companies would generate approximately $100 million to $125 million of cost synergies once the deal is closed, which will be realized in the medium term. Some of the savings are bound to come from duplicate costs like technology and human resources, distribution center efficiencies and better terms from vendors. This leads to the question, “Will there be layoffs?”

TD Cowen’s John Kernan placed a “Hold” on shares of Dick’s last month, citing uncertainty on Foot Locker’s turnaround. With cost and procurement synergies in the works, he expects that headcount reductions and store rationalization are a possibility.

But while layoffs remain to be seen, there will inevitably be a “simplification” of staffing and organizational structure, similar to the recent moves done by Adidas, Nike and Puma this year.

[TITLE]Amazon Prime Big Deal Days 2025: Top Sales on Viral Beauty Products:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

Amazon’s fall Prime Day, happening until 11:59 p.m. PT today, is the best chance to stock your makeup bag with the beauty goodies you’ve used to the last drop and can’t function without — as well as hot-right-now sunscreens, serums, hair care, face oils, and styling tools that have long resided in your bookmarks tab, waiting for a good enough deal to hit so as to finally make them investment-worthy.

Well, dear reader, that time has come, as we’re seeing prices slashed by close to 50 percent off on TikTok-approved beauty bestsellers from brands like Dyson, Shark, Sol de Janeiro, Supergoop, Virtue, and beyond.

Need to level up your hair game for the fall season with a styling system that curls, smooths, dries, and volumizes? Look no further than the Shark FlexStyle, which our editors said was “in a league of its own” — officially selling for its lowest price ever. On the hunt for an SPF formula you can easily layer under makeup to stay sun-safe all winter long? Supergoop’s Unseen Clear Face Sunscreen, along with many of the brand’s other celeb-loved offerings, is part of the sale this year. And if it’s the benefits of red light therapy that you’re after, seriously consider grabbing HigherDose’s Red Light Therapy Face Mask — a cordless gadget that promotes cellular renewal, wrinkle reduction, and a more youthful complexion (our editors are big fans of the HigherDose Infrared Sauna Blanket, which is also seeing its biggest deal yet).

Last year for Amazon’s Big Deal Days event, we saw markdowns on everything from Clinique’s Cleansing Balm and Briogeo’s Don’t Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Mask (which won a spot on WWD’s 2025 list of the Greatest Hair Care Products of All Time) to the Neutrogena Night Calming Makeup Remover Face Wipes that Kim Kardashian once raved about. Many of these same picks are once again on sale, and, similarly to what happened in 2024, the second-day discounts on Amazon beauty favorites are even juicier than the ones that were available to shop yesterday.

The savings extravaganza’s lowest prices are reserved for Amazon Prime members. Not part of the club? A subscription to Amazon Prime normally costs $14.99/month, but you can score a 30-day free trial here and use it to shop the last day of the Prime Big Deal Days without commitment.

Without further ado, the best Prime Day beauty deals our editors have already cleared space for on our bathroom counters. Drop everything and shop before the dreamy discounts are retired until next year.
