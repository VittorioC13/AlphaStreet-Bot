[TITLE]Innovating for stability: central bank money in the digital era:
[TEXT]
Welcome address by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an event hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank for central bank representatives attending the Sibos conference

Almost exactly one year ago, I gave a speech – also here at the Bundesbank – outlining a vision for the future of digital finance and the role of central bank money in this new ecosystem.[1]

Fast forward 12 months, and the pace of transformation seems to have quickened even more. Innovative digital payment solutions and digital assets are receiving increasing attention, with market participants scrambling to position themselves favourably to ensure they do not miss out. The opportunities and risks are being discussed at length.[2]

So what does this mean for central banks? Today, I will argue that we need to innovate to keep central bank money at the technological frontier so that it can continue to act as an anchor of trust and stability for the financial system. I will also discuss the implications for retail, wholesale and cross-border payments.

Keeping central bank money at the forefront of technology to preserve its role as an anchor of trust and stability

Our vision has not changed: central bank money must remain the anchor of trust and stability at the heart of the financial system. In retail transactions, cash provides immediate and risk-free settlement directly between the payer and the payee. In wholesale markets, settlement in central bank money eliminates counterparty risk and provides finality in large-value transactions. In both cases, trust in private money relies on its convertibility with central bank money.

In other words, central bank money is the glue that holds the singleness and unity of our currency in place and secures the integrity of our financial system. And as finance becomes increasingly digital and new technologies emerge, we must adapt to ensure that central bank money remains reliable and available. This is the only way we can stay true to our mandate of issuing central bank money – the only risk-free settlement asset – and ensure that payment systems function smoothly. It will also encourage digital innovation and keep it safe.

I know that many of you share the Eurosystem’s vision and – like us – are working hard to make it a reality. For central bank money to keep its stabilising and unifying role in the future of finance and payments, it must stay at the forefront of technology. This is the pre-condition for preserving the balance between public and private money that has served us well until now.

Implications for retail, wholesale and cross-border payments

Within the Eurosystem, we have considered the implications of the digital transformation for our own role in retail, wholesale and cross-border payments.

Retail payments

With everyday retail payments becoming increasingly digital, the role of physical central bank money – cash – is being reduced, creating risks to competition, inclusion, resilience and monetary sovereignty. And for the euro area, the risk to integration is particularly concerning – cash as the legal tender has always provided a means of payment that can be used everywhere across our monetary union. This is why we are working on a digital euro.[3]

But we have not forgotten

The market movement this past week can be explained quite clearly if you look at the flows. Market expert Sunil Subramaniam in an interview to ET Now said that domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have remained consistent buyers, even during the volatility. The pressure has come entirely from foreign institutional investors ( FIIs ), whose selling has intensified this week after briefly easing last week.“I would again point it out to only one factor — the Trump factor, the uncertainty that he has been causing and not only in terms of today's pharma announcement, I think he has also met with the Pakistan prime minister,” Subramaniam said.He noted that

[TITLE]Beauty and Personal Care Products Market Report by Type, Product, Pricing, Distribution Channel, End User, Countries and Company Analysis, 2025-2033:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Beauty and Personal Care Products Market Report by Type, Product, Pricing, Distribution Channel, End User, Countries and Company Analysis, 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Beauty And Personal Care Products Market is expected to reach US$ 924.86 billion by 2033 from US$ 582.55 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 5.27% from 2025 to 2033

The market is still being supported by rising disposable incomes and rising consumer desire for self-care. Beauty firms are quickly embracing the shift in consumer preferences toward high-end, customized beauty products. Additionally, a philosophical shift in customer preferences is reflected in the move away from conventional brands toward organic, ecological, and cruelty-free products.

Asia-Pacific is the region with the fastest growth in the beauty and personal care market, followed by North America and Europe, which prioritize high-end and sustainable products, and Latin America and the Middle East, which are growing due to increased urbanization and digital access.

The global market for beauty and personal care goods is changing dramatically due to the influence of digital culture, changing consumer lifestyles, and growing wellness consciousness. Categories like skincare, haircare, cosmetics, and personal hygiene have grown in popularity as consumers place a higher value on self-care and individual expression. Strong competition and ongoing innovation characterize the sector, as companies launch novel formulations, delivery methods, and marketing approaches to appeal to a wide range of shifting consumer tastes. The customer journey has also changed as a result of the growth of social media and e-commerce, which have made it simpler to obtain goods and allowed companies to engage with consumers in more interactive and tailored ways.

A wider change in consumer values is reflected in the industry's focus on sustainability and diversity. Consumers are increasingly looking for goods that adhere to moral principles, such as natural ingredients, cruelty-free testing, and environmentally friendly packaging. Brands are being pushed to become more inclusive as a result of the rising demand for products that accommodate a variety of skin tones, hair textures, and gender identities. Smaller and specialized businesses are making their mark by being more nimble, open, and purpose-driven, even while big multinational corporations continue to hold dominant market positions. The ability of the sector to respond to both local cultural quirks and global trends while striking a balance between innovation and authenticity will determine its destiny.

Over the years, consumer trends have shaped the market for personal care and cosmetics. Constant themes impacting the market include convenience, health, natural and organic products, and sustainability. The market is expanding as a result of consumers' increasing preference for natural, organic, and vegan beauty and personal care products in order to avoid the negative effects of synthetic and coarse chemicals.

Clean branded and eco-friendly products are taking the place of traditional cosmetics and personal care items among consumers. Millennials and Gen Z are the main consumer groups driving the trend, and they are more enthusiastic

[TITLE]Leather Supply Chain Firms Focus on Science and Tech Amid Grim Industry Outlook:
[TEXT]
MILAN — As the economic challenges mount, luxury leather supply chain firms are forging new collaborations, enhancing the sector with scientific and technological solutions.

Working together to find further synergies between technology and materials was emphasized as the only way to endure the complex economy mired by inflationary, trade and currency pressures, leaders said at the Lineapelle exhibition, which took place at Rho-Fiera Milano fairgrounds Sept. 23 to 25. Organizers of Italy’s leather trade show expressed caution for the rest of the year, after the sector saw a 6 percent decline in the number of companies in 2024.

“These [companies that went out of business] were mostly subcontractors, who are certainly the most vulnerable. There have also been voluntary closures due to profitability that has become increasingly reduced — or, in some cases, costs that have exceeded revenue,” said Fulvia Bacchi, Lineapelle’s chief executive officer.

Mauro Bergozza, president of Simac Tanning Tech, Italy’s consortium for machinery and technology for the footwear, leather goods and tanning industries, underscored the importance of collaboration.

“The synergy between Simac Tanning Tech and Lineapelle and between technology and materials represents a virtuous model for the entire Made in Italy sector. Collaborating allows us to strengthen our leadership and look to the future with confidence, promoting a supply-chain system vision that goes beyond the individual supply chain and markets,” he said in a statement.

Lineapelle gathered a global network of companies across the leather supply chain.

I pay rent, buy groceries, school supplies for the kids,” she said. “I spent a week looking for another job, but because there are so many people looking at the moment, I didn’t get one. There aren’t any other options—we just have to take what work we can get.”

When Maleshoane Rakojoana was furloughed from her job at a Lesotho clothing factory nearly three months ago, it turned her whole family’s life upside down. No longer able to afford the rent, they had to leave the capital, Maseru, and move in with relatives, miles away from where her children go to school. Because Rakojoana is the main breadwinner for her extended family, her loss of income has created a wave of impoverishment that ripples through the generations.

It is a story repeated thousands of times over in Lesotho, a small, landlocked state in southern Africa that has become caught up in U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff wars. The country that Trump famously said no one’s ever heard of has certainly heard of him: Before any tariff increases had even come into effect, Lesotho had declared a national state of disaster as it faced up to the twin crises of massive U.S. aid cuts and what the think tank ODI Global has described as a “gendered supply chain shock” in the garment industry.

At the end of June, Rakojoana’s employer, which manufactures tops and leggings for Walmart and JCPenney, suspended all 900 employees—the vast majority of them women—as orders fell off a cliff in the face of threatened U.S. tariffs of 50 percent.

[TITLE]Retail’s love affair with incentivized reviews:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 7 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

In retail, it’s hard to understate the impact of customer product reviews.

With the growth of e-commerce over the past decade, shoppers are eager to hear what others think of products before they make a purchase — especially if it’s something they aren’t able to see in person or test in stores to begin with.

More than two-thirds of online adults in the U.S. rely on product ratings and reviews before they make a purchase, according to a 2024 report from Forrester.

This can be especially important for products that are highly individualized. In the beauty category, a person’s experience with a product can vary based on their skin type, skin tone, age and more.

Retailers and brands know how vital reviews are to purchasing decisions, which is why they’re eager to have a plethora of feedback available from existing users to potential new customers.

In walks the incentivized review — a way to easily gather feedback by providing a consumer with anything from a free product to a payment or a sweepstakes entry.

Sourcing incentivized reviews can be a quicker way to collect consumer reactions, especially for newer brands or product launches that may not have a ton of organic recognition yet. But can incentivizing reviews inflate ratings?

Pump those numbers up

A 2021 article in the Journal of Marketing Research found that incentivized reviews “contained a greater proportion of positive relative to negative emotion across a variety of product and service experiences.” The article’s findings (based on a series of experiments examining how incentivizing reviews can impact consumer emotions) found that this effect applied for both financial and nonfinancial incentives.

In general with incentivized reviews, Professor of Marketing at the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business Kaitlin Woolley — who co-authored the article — says two mains things can happen.

“One is [that] they increase the volume, like the number of people reviewing,” she told Retail Dive, adding that people are more likely to review if there is an incentive. Secondly, “the incentive itself changes the content of what people write and then also the rating that they apply to it.”

In many cases, people aren't able to separate the positive experience of the incentive they received from their review and rating of the product itself, Woolley added.

The Federal Trade Commission requires the disclosure of online incentivized reviews and consumer testimonials to make them easily identifiable. Whether required disclosures are able to prevent inflated ratings and provide reassurance to online shoppers seeking out authentic reviews is another question.

“Although it is better to have nonincentivized reviews, that often takes longer to build, and brands want the launch to be successful out of the gate,” Caroline Weintraub, vice president at True Beauty Ventures, a beauty and wellness emerging growth fund, told Retail Dive.

The investment group has a portfolio of well-known emerging beauty brands (some of which are sold at Sephora) such as skin care brands Dieux and Sofie Pavitt Face, as well as makeup brand Caliray.

“For smaller or emerging brands, incentivized reviews have become increasingly important,” Weintraub added. “When you are competing with legacy players that already have thousands of reviews, launching with a ‘zero review’ product page puts you at a disadvantage.”

Sephora is a place where shoppers can find new brands as well as tried and true ones. The retailer gives early access to some new product launches for its mobile app users before they go live on the full website.

Such was the case when Sephora earlier this month let app users have access to LoveShackFancy’s new fragrance, Secret Crush. During early access on Sept. 18 via Sephora’s app, the product already had 361 reviews listed, and all were labeled as incentivized at the time that Retail Dive checked that day.

Sephora makes it easy to know which reviews are incentivized by letting shoppers filter out incentivized reviews. Doing so will tell users how many nonincentivized reviews there are, though it will not adjust the average star rating provided.

Sephora declined an interview request in addition to requests for comment from Retail Dive for this story.

As an example, Sephora’s BB and CC cream makeup category contained 16 product listings on Sept. 22. Nearly two-thirds of all the reviews across this product category — adding up to 19,866 out of more than 30,000 total at the time Retail Dive collected data — were labeled as incentivized.

For the retailer’s eye primer makeup category, containing 20 product listings, over three-quarters of the 36,904 total reviews were labeled incentivized.

A necessary evil?

Per its website, Sephora’s reviews are managed by Bazaarvoice, an industry leader in user-generated content.

While Bazaarvoice did not elaborate on the specific nature of its relationship with Sephora, the company said that reviews generally are helpful for beauty brands regardless of their positive or negative tone.

“According to our research, over half of shoppers cite real customer reviews as the biggest factor in their final purchase decisions,” the company told Retail Dive via email. “For beauty specifically, 91% of consumers told us that it is a product category that is necessary to consult ratings and reviews before purchasing.”

Weintraub at True Beauty Ventures said that while large retailers don’t make incentivized reviews a strict requirement for brands they sell, the companies do heavily encourage it.

“Some retailers even connect brands with approved third-party platforms that help seed products and capture reviews, so there is an implicit expectation that brands will invest in this area,” she said.

Bazaarvoice said it stresses authenticity with the consumers that participate in its sampling campaigns.

“We encourage our reviewers who participate in sampling campaigns to leave their real, honest opinion,” the company said. “Good or bad. They are not penalized from participating in another campaign if they leave a negative or low-star review. This ensures that the [user-generated content] our clients receive is authentic, trustworthy and useful for those who will read them.”

A look at the r/Sephora Reddit forum shows that at least some shoppers are frustrated by the quantity of incentivized reviews for early access products and other listings.

In other industries, businesses may have more room to offer review incentives that don't directly impact ratings, according to Woolley. That could mean offering up exclusive information or access to a higher status for those who review products or services, similar to how peer-to-peer review platforms work.

In retail, that’s tougher, but the industry is unlikely to stop anytime soon.

“Transparency and balance are key to making incentivized reviews work without damaging consumer trust,” Weintraub said. “However, we feel that it is better to have reviews that say incentivized than no reviews at all.”

[TITLE]DHL eCommerce to buy out parcel locker partner in Poland:
[TEXT]
DHL eCommerce plans to acquire 100% of APM Solutions, the joint venture it started in Poland with Alibaba’s logistics arm, Cainiao, in 2023 to create an extensive parcel locker network, company CEO Pablo Ciano said in a LinkedIn post last week.

With full ownership, DHL eCommerce will accelerate the roll out of its branded parcel lockers, targeting 10,000 units in Poland by the end of 2026, he said. APM Solutions currently has more than 6,000 parcel lockers, according to its website.

“This transaction is a milestone in expanding the logistics ecosystem in Poland, giving merchants and consumers more choice, convenience, and flexibility in how they send and receive parcels,” Ciano said.

Poland is one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets in Europe. DHL eCommerce is complementing its door delivery options with more options in a country where up to 40% of consumers prefer to have shipments delivered to a parcel vending machine.

The move also gives DHL eCommerce, which provides cross-border and domestic B2C shipping service for e-commerce merchants, more infrastructure with which to compete with InPost, the dominant courier in its home market of Poland.

Over the past three years, DHL has invested an average of $275 million in Poland for its e-commerce, express, supply chain and freight forwarding business units.

DHL Group’s e-commerce logistics business in early 2023 purchased an equity stake in Cainiao’s Polish subsidiary to capture a larger share of the out-of-home delivery market. The companies initially invested nearly $70 million to install parcel lockers across Poland with the goal of forming one of the country’s largest access point networks.

DHL’s e-commerce logistics business continues to expand in Europe and the Middle East. In late August, the company acquired a share of Saudi Arabian courier Apex Logistics. InPost, too, is in rapid expansion mode, buying Spain-based courier Sending and Yodel, a large delivery company in the United Kingdom.

[TITLE]Asian firms shift investment towards Europe in supply chain 'realignment', ING says:
[TEXT]
Asian companies, particularly those in China, are undergoing a structural transformation in their supply chains, with many redirecting investments towards Europe amid a decoupling from the US, according to a senior banker at ING.

As Washington continues to negotiate with trade partners, companies active in the region - both local and international - recognised the need to diversify their supply chains, said Uday Sareen, CEO and head of wholesale banking for Asia-Pacific at the Dutch bank.

"We see a structural change in supply chain realignment," he said in an interview, noting that ING had collaborated with over 700 international corporations and a similar number of Asian firms across various sectors in the Asia-Pacific region. "The US tariff scenario is a significant component of costs for manufacturers and the supply chain."
