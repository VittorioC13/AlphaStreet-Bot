[TITLE]Folia Health Secures $10.5M in Funding to Transform Healthcare and Research With Patient-Reported Information:
[TEXT]
BOSTON, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Folia Health , the patient-driven health company and pioneer of home-reported outcomes (HROs), committed to transforming lived experiences into structured data insights to advance research and personalized care, today announced the close of a $10.5 million in Series A funding round led by S3 Ventures , alongside longtime partner Crosslink Capital and specialist fund Create Health Ventures . The investment will enable the company to double down on its mission to put power in the hands of patients, whose firsthand experiences with chronic and rare conditions make them valuable — and underutilized — healthcare experts.

Folia's platform enables individuals to track symptoms, treatments, and outcomes, and share them with unprecedented control. The company’s commitment to consent and radical transparency means that any data used for external research requires explicit consent, participants can see exactly how their information is being used and what is being learned through detailed Participant Reports, and can withdraw participation at any time. Folia also recognizes participants for their contributions to research studies through its revenue-sharing program, Data Dividends.

“This funding is an affirmation of our fierce dedication to making patient-focused healthcare a reality. Instead of trying to fix the system from the outside in, we’ve built Folia to harness the power of each individual patient — to make their healthcare make sense,” said company founder and CEO Nell Meosky Luo. “People live in their bodies 24/7 — they notice patterns, track what works, spot when something's off. Your own insights reveal your most burdensome symptoms, how different treatments and other things you’re trying are working for you; and also, the massive difference it can make when your treatments are working well. The knowledge held by each of our participants fills crucial knowledge gaps in traditional health data, which focuses on what happens when you’re at the clinic.”

By providing a platform giving direct value to patients, Folia Health’s approach generates high-quality, longitudinal real-world evidence (RWE) for researchers. This has informed FDA discussions and treatment guidelines, led to partnerships with leading life science companies, and generated research-grade data across conditions that have a major impact on peoples’ lives, including lupus, sickle cell disease, eczema, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Other Folia Health initiatives include:

Brian R. Smith, Managing Director at S3 Ventures, adds: “Folia is a validated research platform redefining how we understand chronic and rare diseases. Nearly a decade of peer-reviewed research positions Folia as the gold standard for patient-driven real-world evidence, and we are thrilled to support their growth across new conditions and partnerships.”

With the inevitable shift toward using AI tools to make personal health decisions, data based on real experiences is the foundation that is necessary for AI models to accurately reflect individuals’ unique health journeys. “What gets lost in the excitement over the power of AI is the fact that these new technologies require the right data to give us insights that are meaningful and useful,” said Dan Toffling, co-founder and CTO of Folia Health. “Right now we’re dependent on incomplete and skewed datasets, typically information that’s collected a few days out of the year during brief interactions with clinicians. In other words, would you want all your health decisions to be based solely on what’s in your doctor’s notes in your EHR?”

The funding announcement follows Folia’s recent launch of Mosaic, a community insights research initiative that enables participants to ask questions and get answers based on aggregated data from others with similar conditions. The program is currently active for users with eczema and PNH, with plans to expand to lupus and sickle cell disease in 2026.

About Folia Health

Folia Health is a patient-led health company and the pioneer of home-reported outcomes (HROs), transforming lived health experiences into valuable structured data insights to advance research and personalized care. The company's platform is built on the belief that the knowledge of patients and caregivers is the missing piece to enable precise, individualized care and high-impact research. Through a useful platform, radical transparency, explicit consent protocols, and data dividend payments, Folia bridges the gap between patients, clinicians, and researchers while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and patient autonomy. Founded in 2016 by family caregivers and based in Boston, Folia works with individuals across chronic and rare conditions to generate clinical-grade real-world evidence.

[TITLE]Nearly one million Minnesotans about to shop for health care will see big rate increases:
[TEXT]
Those shopping for Medicare Advantage plans, or through the MNSURE marketplace, will see increases between 14-22%. Expiring tax credits could add to the pain.

To stream KARE 11 on your phone, you need the KARE 11 app.

ST PAUL, Minn. — If you're a Minnesota farmer, small business owner or anyone else who relies on the MNSURE marketplace because you can't get health insurance through an employer, be warned.

"Health insurance rates for 2026 are going up, and the numbers are alarming," said Grace Arnold, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

During a news conference at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday, which Arnold called a "pivotal public awareness moment," the Department of Commerce announced the average rate increases that nearly 400,000 Minnesotans will encounter when shopping for healthcare in the weeks ahead.

According to the Department of Commerce, Individual Market rates are set to increase by an average of 22% for the 187,000 Minnesotans who rely on them.

Small Group Market rates are also set to increase by an average of 14% for another 202,000 Minnesotans.

"Middle-class Minnesotans are those that will be hit the hardest by these increases," Arnold said.

Arnold says middle-class Minnesotans are also at risk of losing enhanced premium tax credits, which have recently helped bring premiums down by hundreds of dollars a month for nearly 90,000 Minnesotans.

Those credits are now set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress votes to renew them. An extension has had bipartisan support, but Democrats want it to be part of a continuing budget resolution, and Republican leaders have said they want to deal with it separately.

"Time is running out," said Libby Cullum, CEO of MNSURE. "We've seen our uninsured rate in Minnesota drop over the last few years. I think in large part due to those tax credits. More people than ever before, more middle-class families can afford health insurance.

If they go away. You know, some folks are gonna have to make really, really tough decisions

[TITLE]Jim Cramer on Danaher: “It Has Been a Huge Disappointment”:
[TEXT]
Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer put under the microscope. Cramer discussed it while highlighting the performance of healthcare stocks. He said:

“Some of these healthcare stocks seem played out already to you, perhaps. I mean, Merck was up 7% just today. Charitable holding Danaher also leaped more than 7%. But these stocks have been down so long, they look up to me. I believe they’ve got a lot more upside before they run out of steam. My Charitable Trust owns Danaher, and it has been a huge disappointment. It needs to demonstrate it can capitalize off of all the new drug companies coming public right now, or it will go back to the 180s.”

Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) develops medical, life sciences, biotechnology, and diagnostic products, including bioprocessing technologies, lab equipment, genomic tools, and clinical instruments. Cramer mentioned the stock during the July 24 episode and said:

“Now, we bought this one in early 2022… I expected the business to stabilize and the stock to make a comeback like that. But for one reason after another, Danaher never really found its footing…

[TITLE]Building a Digital Backbone: How States Can Modernize Rural Healthcare with RHTP Funding:
[TEXT]
The Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP), a $50 billion federal initiative spanning five years, presents states with a historic opportunity to stabilize and modernize healthcare in rural communities. Central to sustaining rural healthcare is the hub and spoke model, where a large central hub hospital can provide managed services, specialist access, and technology support to smaller rural spoke facilities. This model enhances care coordination, resource sharing, and specialist availability, creating a sustainable regional healthcare ecosystem.

Scaling this model requires significant infrastructure investment to build a robust, secure, and high-performance digital backbone. Investments must ensure reliable broadband connectivity, secure networks, and scalable telehealth platforms tailored to the size and capacity of each rural hospital—from small Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to large regional hubs. We encourage states to form collaborative consortiums involving multiple healthcare providers to leverage economies of scale and regional coordination, a critical requirement of the grant. Cisco’s modular, scalable solutions enable states and their designated hubs to design and deploy this infrastructure, supporting continuous patient care, advanced cybersecurity, and operational efficiency.

By investing in digital resilience through the hub and spoke model, states can extend high-quality care to rural populations, support the delivery of care that can lead to improved health outcomes, and build sustainable healthcare ecosystems that withstand disruptions and grow with community needs. The application deadline for RHTP is November 5, 2025, making timely investment critical to leverage this historic funding opportunity.

This approach aligns with RHTP priorities by modernizing infrastructure, strengthening workforce capabilities, enabling innovative care delivery, and ensuring long-term sustainability through scalable, secure, and adaptable digital health ecosystems.

The need for digital resilience in rural healthcare

Infrastructure Challenges by Hospital Size: Rural hospitals vary widely—from small CAHs with fewer than 26 beds to larger rural emergency hospitals and regional referral centers. Digital resilience solutions must be customized to hospital size and capacity to optimize investment and impact.

[TITLE]Nearly one million Minnesotans about to shop for health care will see big rate increases:
[TEXT]
Those shopping for Medicare Advantage plans, or through the MNSURE marketplace, will see increases between 14-22%. Expiring tax credits could add to the pain.

Example video title will go here for this video

To stream KARE 11 on your phone, you need the KARE 11 app.

ST PAUL, Minn. — If you're a Minnesota farmer, small business owner or anyone else who relies on the MNSURE marketplace because you can't get health insurance through an employer, be warned.

"Health insurance rates for 2026 are going up, and the numbers are alarming," said Grace Arnold, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

During a news conference at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday, which Arnold called a "pivotal public awareness moment," the Department of Commerce announced the average rate increases that nearly 400,000 Minnesotans will encounter when shopping for healthcare in the weeks ahead.

According to the Department of Commerce, Individual Market rates are set to increase by an average of 22% for the 187,000 Minnesotans who rely on them.

Small Group Market rates are also set to increase by an average of 14% for another 202,000 Minnesotans.

"Middle-class Minnesotans are those that will be hit the hardest by these increases," Arnold said.

Arnold says middle-class Minnesotans are also at risk of losing enhanced premium tax credits, which have recently helped bring premiums down by hundreds of dollars a month for nearly 90,000 Minnesotans.

Those credits are now set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress votes to renew them. An extension has had bipartisan support, but Democrats want it to be part of a continuing budget resolution, and Republican leaders have said they want to deal with it separately.

"Time is running out," said Libby Cullum, CEO of MNSURE. "We've seen our uninsured rate in Minnesota drop over the last few years. I think in large part due to those tax credits. More people than ever before, more middle-class families can afford health insurance.

If they go away. You know, some folks are gonna have to make really, really tough decisions

Folia also recognizes participants for their contributions to research studies through its revenue-sharing program, Data Dividends.

“This funding is an affirmation of our fierce dedication to making patient-focused healthcare a reality. Instead of trying to fix the system from the outside in, we’ve built Folia to harness the power of each individual patient — to make their healthcare make sense,” said company founder and CEO Nell Meosky Luo. “People live in their bodies 24/7 — they notice patterns, track what works, spot when something's off. Your own insights reveal your most burdensome symptoms, how different treatments and other things you’re trying are working for you; and also, the massive difference it can make when your treatments are working well. The knowledge held by each of our participants fills crucial knowledge gaps in traditional health data, which focuses on what happens when you’re at the clinic.”

By providing a platform giving direct value to patients, Folia Health’s approach generates high-quality, longitudinal real-world evidence (RWE) for researchers. This has informed FDA discussions and treatment guidelines, led to partnerships with leading life science companies, and generated research-grade data across conditions that have a major impact on peoples’ lives, including lupus, sickle cell disease, eczema, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Other Folia Health initiatives include:

Brian R. Smith, Managing Director at S3 Ventures, adds: “Folia is a validated research platform redefining how we understand chronic and rare diseases. Nearly a decade of peer-reviewed research positions Folia as the gold standard for patient-driven real-world evidence, and we are thrilled to support their growth across new conditions and partnerships.”

With the inevitable shift toward using AI tools to make personal health decisions, data based on real experiences is the foundation that is necessary for AI models to accurately reflect individuals’ unique health journeys. “What gets lost in the excitement over the power of AI is the fact that these new technologies require the right data to give us insights that are meaningful and useful,” said Dan Toffling, co-founder and CTO of Folia Health. “Right now we’re dependent on incomplete and skewed datasets, typically information that’s collected a few days out of the year during brief interactions with clinicians. In other words, would you want all your health decisions to be based solely on what’s in your doctor’s notes in your EHR?”

The funding announcement follows Folia’s recent launch of Mosaic, a community insights research initiative that enables participants to ask questions and get answers based on aggregated data from others with similar conditions. The program is currently active for users with eczema and PNH, with plans to expand to lupus and sickle cell disease in 2026.
