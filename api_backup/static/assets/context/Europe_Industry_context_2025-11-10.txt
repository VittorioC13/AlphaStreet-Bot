[TITLE]Bajaj at the helm: All the latest developments at KTM:
[TEXT]
The stream of news coming out of KTM seems to be a flood at the moment, doesn’t it? And lately, it’s even more so, as the company’s shareholders see a big change. That’s right, Indian heavyweight Bajaj Auto has now received a go-ahead from the Austrian Takeover Commission to take control of Pierer Mobility AG, the parent company of Austrian motorcycle maker KTM AG.

So what’s the first thing Bajaj did after assuming control? Change the name of KTM’s parent company from Pierer Mobility AG to Bajaj Mobility AG, of course!

But that only scratches the surface. There have been a lot more developments over the past few days. "So far, what we observe is that there is an opportunity to reduce the overheads by more than 50 percent," Bajaj Managing Director, Rajiv Bajaj, explained to India’s CNBC-TV18 recently. "That covers R&D, that covers all marketing areas, including racing. That covers all the operational areas."

Bajaj Auto's shocking proposal to lay off more than half of KTM's white-collar personnel has sent shockwaves through the motorcycling world, and it appears the factory's MotoGP program will suffer the most KTM

Rajiv Bajaj was also highly critical of KTM's former management. "The previous management has already reduced headcount from 6,000 to 4,000, which is still considered too high," he revealed. "Interestingly, of these 4,000, only about 1,000 are blue-collar; 3,000 are white-collar, which is perplexing because the blue-collar employees make the motorcycles. Future volume shifts will impact blue-collar employees relatively lightly; the issue will be with expensive white-collar headcount." He finished by saying that "This is a problem not caused by 99% of KTM employees. This is a problem of the erstwhile top management of KTM, and most of them are gone."

Wow. That’s as scathing an attack on former KTM ownership as any I’ve seen in the last few years.

Bajaj Auto's shocking proposal to lay off more than half of KTM's white-collar personnel has sent shockwaves through the motorcycling world, and it appears the factory's MotoGP program will suffer the most. With rivals like Ducati and Aprilia maintaining their aggressive development efforts, any protracted halt at KTM risks expanding the performance gap.

KTM’s own production schedule is so far off that the 2025 model year 1390 Super Duke GT will not begin production until at least 2027 KTM

This year, KTM's RC16 already demonstrated the repercussions of limited development. Factory riders and team engineers suffered with recurring tire issues and chassis configurations that resulted in severe rear-end noise and a lack of front grip.

KTM’s MotoGP program is not the only department that will take the hit either. It recently surfaced that KTM also decided to end its subsidiary GasGas’ motorcycle production in Spain, with the intention of moving production to its factory in Mattighofen, Austria.

"This allows us to consolidate our expertise, optimize production processes, and strengthen efficiency within the company," a KTM official was quoted in the Austrian newspaper Salzburger Nachrichten as saying. While KTM commented that only 20 of the 300 employees at GasGas’ factory in Girona, Spain, will be affected, it’s not yet clear what the fate of the rest of the staff will be.

KTM also decided to end its subsidiary GasGas’ motorcycle production in Spain with intentions to move production to its factory in Mattighofen, Austria GasGas

KTM’s own production schedule is so far behind that the 2025 model year 1390 Super Duke GT will not begin production until at least 2027. "To put it very simply and bluntly, European manufacturing is dead," said Rajiv Bajaj. But models made and exported from India deliver an EBITDA (Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization) margin of "over 30 percent." Now that is a damning stat.

As an aside, Bajaj also partnered with Triumph for the production of its recently launched 400cc models. "Every single Triumph motorcycle that is made today is made either in Thailand [or], more recently, India," said the Bajaj MD. "If Triumph could do this 15 years back, why not KTM?"

Indian heavyweight Bajaj Auto has successfully received the go-ahead from the Austrian Takeover Commission to take control of Pierer Mobility AG (PMAG), the parent company of Austrian motorcycle maker KTM AG Bajaj

Bajaj sees the restructure as necessary to restore order, reduce waste, and return KTM to profitability. If it works, then making the case of other options will be moot.

Either way, KTM’s factory riders and engineers must prepare for a leaner period in which progress takes longer, and on-track pain may be the cost of salvaging the ailing motorcycle brand. Share your thoughts in the comments.

[TITLE]Slovakia’s Auto Empire Is Facing Its Biggest Test Yet:
[TEXT]
Slovakia’s car industry, the largest per capita in the world, is struggling under new U.S. tariffs and rising Chinese competition.

One of Europe’s automotive manufacturing powerhouses, Slovakia, has been hit hard by tariffs and increased competition, which are threatening its role in the global auto market. Since the creation of the Bratislava Automobile Works (BAZ) in the 1970s, Slovakia has gradually developed its reputation as a major automotive manufacturer. It now produces the highest number of cars per capita each year, with an annual output of over one million vehicles.

Slovakia became known as “Europe’s Detroit,” attracting automakers such as Volkswagen, Stellantis, Kia, and Jaguar Land Rover. Its automotive industry contributes around 11 percent of the country’s GDP, as well as half of its industrial output. It also accounts for roughly 10 percent of national employment.

In recent years, it has broken into the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing market, with plans from Sweden’s Volvo Cars to establish an EV facility in the central European country in 2026. This will be Slovakia’s fifth production plant. China’s Gotion High Tech and Slovakian partner InoBat also plan to launch an EV battery plant in Slovakia, which could attract more EV makers to the market.

However, growing challenges in recent years now threaten Slovakia’s reputation as Europe’s automaking powerhouse. These include the introduction of U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump and increased competition from China’s growing vehicle manufacturing sector. In addition, rising national taxes and a geopolitical shift away from the EU have hindered the country’s automotive sector.

At present, Slovakia’s exports to the United States account for around 4 percent of the country’s total exports, with vehicles contributing around 80 percent of that export volume. This has made Slovakia highly reliant on U.S. trade and means it has been hit hard by the introduction of high tariffs on foreign goods.

The EU succeeded in establishing a framework trade deal with the U.S. in July, which reduced the tariffs on most EU products from the anticipated 30 percent to a lower 15 percent rate, and decreased tariffs on the bloc’s auto sector from 27.5 percent. Zuzana Pelakova, from the Slovakia-based thinktank Globsec, said, “In the current situation, the U.S.-EU trade alliance has stabilised, and tariffs have been lowered to 15 percent, which is certainly better than the initial proposal but is still challenging.”

However, when new 15 percent tariffs are viewed alongside the broader set of challenges faced by Slovakia’s automaking industry, it becomes clear just how hard the sector will have to fight to maintain its position as a global leader. Increased domestic levies, following the introduction of a transaction tax under Prime Minister Robert Fico’s government, aimed at curbing the budget deficit and funding social programmes, are undermining profits in the country’s automotive sector.

Fico has come under fire from the EU for his longstanding relationship with Russia’s President Putin in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing war. In a July statement, Fico said, “I refuse the politics of the ‘iron fence’ that exists between the EU and the Russian Federation, and I would like to offer a hand of cooperation over this fence… When it comes to energy, I openly say that I view any plans of the European Commission to stop any import of gas, oil or nuclear fuel from Russia as insanity.”

The Slovakian government’s stance on Russia has led several European countries to view Slovakia as a less reliable partner, one that is unwilling to support the sanctions on Russian energy that are meant to put pressure on Moscow to end its conflict with Ukraine.

As around 90 percent of Slovakia’s foreign direct investment comes from EU countries, rising geopolitical tensions could threaten its economic stability. A survey from earlier in the year showed that among foreign chambers of commerce, 36 percent of European companies with assets in Slovakia did not plan to invest in the country again. This is reflected in Volkswagen’s decision to launch operations in Portugal instead of Slovakia for its new electric ID.1 model, while Stellantis NV opted to establish an EV facility in Spain.

Despite the challenges, many believe that Slovakia’s longstanding automaking industry will weather the storm, as it has done in the past. However, the country’s auto association, ZAPSR, believes that to make headway, the industry must engage with the government to improve policy and economic support for the sector.

“To maintain the transformation of production to electromobility, it is necessary that the state creates framework conditions for investors, with clear and stable foreign policy orientation, keeping in mind that in the last 15 years, 93 per cent of investment arrived from the EU countries, UK and USA,” ZAPSR said in a statement earlier this year. Meanwhile, ZAPSR’s president, Alexander Matusek, stressed, “These concerns about Slovakia’s place in the world are relevant. Besides the economic factors, investors also look at what the state does – we shouldn’t underestimate this.”

Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables. These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world. The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850. The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it. "

[TITLE]Payments firm Worldline plans 500-million-euro capital injection:
[TEXT]
Worldline on Thursday unveiled plans to raise 500 million euros ($583 million) by tapping some of France's biggest banks to fund a strategy aimed at turning around the payments firm following years of setbacks.

The two-stage capital increase will begin with a 110-million-euro reserved share sale to Bpifrance, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas, followed by a 390-million-euro rights issue open to all shareholders.

The three lenders have committed to subscribe around 135 million euros to the rights issue.

Upon completion of the capital raise, expected in the first quarter of 2026, Bpifrance will hold a 9.6 per cent stake in Worldline, Credit Agricole will own 9.5 per cent, with BNP Paribas at 7.9 per cent.

Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group, Worldline's biggest investor, said it has accepted dilution as it will not participate in the capital increase.

"We have very strong support from anchor shareholders, which are very large financial institutions in Europe," Vacheron said in a call with reporters. "When you look at the competition, they are not really in good shape."

[TITLE]Industry Divided on USTR’s China Port Fee Suspension:
[TEXT]
As the U.S. Trade Representative moves forward with a one-year suspension of port fees targeting China’s maritime dominance, stakeholders across the shipping and shipbuilding sectors are voicing sharply contrasting views on what the pause means for America’s maritime future.

The suspension, effective November 10, 2025 through November 9, 2026, halts fees that began just weeks earlier on October 14, 2025. The fees were designed to counter China’s state-backed shipbuilding advantages following a Section 301 investigation initiated by the United Steelworkers and labor coalition partners.

The USTR opened a one-day comment period on the suspension, prompting stakeholders to voice their opinions on the matter.

Several maritime organizations have welcomed the breathing room. Mike Jacob, President of the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association, emphasized the need for federal investment while supporting the pause: “The agreement to suspend current port fees in both the United States and China for one year will provide space for a continuation of the conversations in the current docket.”

Lasse Kristoffersen, President and CEO of Wallenius Wilhelmsen, framed the suspension as essential for planning: “In our view, a suspension is an appropriate step to allow U.S. shipyards, logistics providers, and supply chain partners to plan and execute capital investments with greater certainty”.

The Transportation Institute echoed support for the pause, noting that both Jones Act and international U.S.-flag fleets “are critical to the national and homeland security of the United States”.

Not everyone is celebrating, however. Joint comments from the USW, IAM Union, IBEW, and IBB expressed disappointment that promises of revitalization have given way to “short-term considerations,” stating that “workers, shipyards, and our broader economic and national security interests are once again being sidelined.”

Hunter Stires, Non-Resident Fellow with the Center for Maritime Strategy at the Navy League, called the suspension “a significant strategic mistake,” noting that China’s vehement opposition and retaliatory measures demonstrated how seriously Beijing took the threat.

Scott Paul, President of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, questioned whether negotiations can address China’s “predatory actions,” citing the country’s “consistent record of noncompliance”.

The brief period when fees were active had significant consequences. U.S. carrier Matson reported incurring $6.4 million in just three weeks of reciprocal Chinese fees, which pales in comparison to the estimated $1.5 billion in annual port fees China’s state-owned COSCO faced.

The fees targeted three categories of vessels: Chinese-owned or operated ships, operators of Chinese-built vessels, and foreign-built vehicle carriers—each with different fee structures designed to pressure specific segments of China’s maritime dominance.

The underlying concern remains stark: China commanded 53% of all global ship orders by tonnage during the first eight months of 2025. This concentration represents what critics call an unhealthy market dynamic for an industry with such significant impact on global trade.

As the comment period closed on Friday, the maritime industry faces a fundamental question: whether a one-year pause serves as a strategic reset for building domestic capabilities, or whether it represents another missed opportunity to confront decades of industrial policy challenges.

The Trump-Xi agreement that triggered this suspension may have ended an immediate trade standoff, but it has intensified a longer-term debate about America’s maritime industrial future.

MADRID -- The longest U.S. government shutdown on record is doing more than grind activities to a halt at home; an ocean away in Europe, local workers at U.S. military bases have started to feel the pain.

At least 2,000 people working at overseas bases in Europe have had their salaries interrupted since the shutdown began almost six weeks ago. In some cases, governments hosting the U.S. bases have stepped in to foot the bill, expecting the United States to eventually make good. In others, including in Italy and Portugal, workers have simply kept working unpaid as the gridlock in Washington drags on.

“It’s an absurd situation because nobody has responses, nobody feels responsible,” said Angelo Zaccaria, a union coordinator at the Aviano Air Base in northeastern Italy.

“This is having dramatic effects on us Italian workers,” he told The Associated Press.

The jobs foreign nationals do at U.S. bases around the world range from food service, construction, logistics, maintenance and other, more specialized roles. In some cases, foreign workers are employed by private companies hired by the U.S. government while others are direct hires.

How local employees are paid varies by country and is based on specific agreements the U.S. government has with each host nation, said Amber Kelly-Herard, a public affairs spokesperson for the U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa.

During the shutdown, Kelly-Herard said local employees were expected to continue to perform their jobs in accordance with their work contracts.

The AP reached out to the Pentagon with multiple questions on the pay disruption, but was only provided a brief statement that did not acknowledge it.

“We value the important contributions of our local national employees around the world,” it said. The official declined to answer any follow-up questions.

In Germany, the government has stepped in to pay the salaries of nearly 11,000 civilian employees that work on U.S. military bases, the nation's finance ministry said in a statement. American facilities in Germany include the Ramstein Air Base, a critical hub for operations in the Mideast and Africa and headquarters to the U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa.

Workers in other countries have not been so fortunate.

More than 4,600 Italian nationals work at the five U.S. bases in Italy, said union coordinator Zaccaria. Of those, over 900 local employees at U.S. bases in Aviano and Vicenza, and another 400 workers at a base in Livorno have not received their salaries since the shutdown began.

“We are waiting for urgent responses, as there are workers struggling to pay their mortgages, to support their children or even to pay the fuel to come to work,” Zaccaria said. He said the union had asked the Italian government to intervene but that, in the meantime, those affected were continuing to show up to work.

“Unfortunately, we see no political will to solve this situation, but we’re asking the Italian government to intervene," he said.

In Portugal, a similar situation was playing out at the Lajes Field base in the Azores archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, where more than 360 Portuguese workers have not been paid, according to Paula Terra, head of the Lajes base workers’ committee.

Terra said unpaid staff are still turning up because furloughs aren’t legally recognized in a U.S.-Portugal agreement on the base. Staying away could leave them open to disciplinary proceedings, she added.

But this week, the Azores Islands regional government approved a bank loan to pay the Portuguese workers at the base in the interim. Terra said she was waiting to hear when workers could claim the money.

Germany is counting on being repaid once the shutdown ends, the finance ministry's spokesperson told the AP, adding that during previous shutdowns, civilians were paid by the U.S. government.

The governments of Poland, Lithuania and Greenland did not respond to a request for comment from the AP

[TITLE]As data-center operator CoreWeave prepares for earnings, stock bears worry its finances are emblematic of an AI bubble:
[TEXT]
A vast data center in Plano, Texas, is a symbol of the enormous AI infrastructure boom that has boosted stock markets and driven U.S. economic growth over the past year. The data center occupies more than 450,000 square feet and cost $1.6 billion to construct and equip. It supplies 30 megawatts of computing power to train and run AI models. Yet the company that runs it is a leading candidate to be ground-zero for a future AI financial meltdown.

The data center is one of dozens around the world operated by CoreWeave, a company that develops and manages data centers and sells their computing capacity to technology companies. Its business is at the center of the AI economy—providing computing power to meet the voracious demand of the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI. But CoreWeave doesn’t own the Plano facility, nor does it own most of the data hubs it’s operating. And that is a part of the problem.

The company is built, by its own admission, on a mountain of debt—obligations it has piled up as it races to build out a network of server farms for its customers. And that mountain looms far larger than the piles of cash that CoreWeave has brought in the door so far. When the company announces earnings on Monday, bulls and bears alike will be watching to see how its revenue is growing, and whether it has been able to pare its losses. CoreWeave’s earnings are likely to be a bellwether for the state of the entire AI boom, and for the industry’s massive and expensive infrastructure buildout in particular.

CoreWeave has $7.6 billion in current liabilities—bills that fall due within 12 months—on its balance sheet, and $11 billion in debt overall, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report, filed in August. Coming from a tech giant like Google or Microsoft with tens of billions in free cash flow, such numbers wouldn’t raise an eyebrow. But CoreWeave’s revenues were only $1.9 billion in 2024. On its Q2 earnings call, CEO Michael Intrator told analysts that full year 2025 revenue would land between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. On the same call, the CEO said he expected CoreWeave’s capex for the year would total between $20 billion and $23 billion.

Those short-term figures pale beside a bigger and potentially more onerous obligation that isn’t on its balance sheet: the $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. Many of those payments are stretched over relatively long terms, of 10 years or more. Still, some of this is for data centers and office buildings that have not yet begun to operate or bring in revenue—representing a vulnerability if any of the as-yet-unprofitable startups CoreWeave sells computing services to are unable to meet their contractual obligations, or if construction delays mean CoreWeave is not able to provide capacity on time, allowing customers to cancel contracts.

In a sense, Coreweave is a metaphor for the broader AI industry at the present moment, as top companies commit to enormous capex spending today in the confidence that it’ll be justified by future revenue from AI platforms and services. Investors appear to be broadly convinced by the company’s narrative: CoreWeave’s stock price is up 160% since the company’s IPO in March.

But Fortune’s analysis of CoreWeave’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are laced with warnings and caveats, show how risky the company’s business model could be. In interviews with several analysts, bulls and bears agreed that CoreWeave’s fundamentals, as reflected in its filings, don’t currently add up. “A lot has to go right,” says Thomas Blakely, a managing director of software equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald, who rates CoreWeave “overweight.” (Of 26 equity analysts who currently cover the stock, 14 had the equivalent of buy or outperform ratings on the shares, while nine had “hold” ratings, and three had “underperform” or “sell” recommendations, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence.)

The bears see CoreWeave as a strong candidate to find itself underwater with its mounting liabilities, making it potentially the first domino to fall in the AI ecosystem. “To say they’ll scale out of this is questionable,” says Gil Luria, the head of technology research at the investment firm D.A. Davidson. “I don’t see how it becomes more profitable.” He believes that the likeliest outcome for CoreWeave on a five-year time horizon is bankruptcy—either because its current customers will be able to rely on their own infrastructure by then, or because an increasingly stretched CoreWeave will no longer be able to borrow.

In a statement to Fortune, a company spokesperson said that “CoreWeave’s capital structure and financial performance are strong and underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts signed with the world’s leading enterprises and AI labs who partner with CoreWeave because we deliver the best AI cloud.” The statement went on to say that the company structured its contracts to “support and repay any related debt obligations while generating additional free cash flow. CoreWeave operates in a supply-constrained market where demand far exceeds capacity, and our hyper-growth is evidence of the trust leading companies place in us to power their most critical AI workloads.”

Betting big on tomorrow’s revenue

With the company continuing to make huge new spending commitments even as it books new future revenue, AI investors’ attention will be glued to its upcoming quarterly earnings report. One number that everyone will be watching is CoreWeave’s “remaining performance obligations,” or RPOs—essentially revenues that CoreWeave has booked but that have not yet been paid. (Like its scheduled lease payments, CoreWeave’s RPOs are excluded from its balance sheet.)

If CoreWeave is booking the kinds of contracts that will pull it out of debt sooner rather than later, the RPOs level—and the forecast for how quickly those future bookings are likely to turn into actual cash—are where they would show up. The company has announced several major new deals since its last quarterly earnings announcement, including a $14.2 billion agreement to supply Meta with computing capacity, and an pact with AI startup Poolside for a data center stuffed with 40,000 Nvidia GPUs. So it is likely its RPO total will climb significantly. Wall Street analysts’ forecasts for the company’s 2026 revenue range from $10.9 billion to $14.9 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Bulls argue that this is exactly how the boom will play out in CoreWeave’s favor: The revenue will come through, in great quantity, and its scale will solve the company’s problems by catching up with and then outpacing its capital expenditures. In that scenario, the company becomes the next Levi Strauss or Amazon Web Services, providing the “picks and shovels” of the AI boom, and getting filthy rich. “The potential is beyond the scope of our imagination at this point,” says Kevin Dede, a senior technology analyst at the financial services firm H.C. Wainwright, which rates CoreWeave a “buy.”

But for now CoreWeave is miles away from being profitable and is bleeding cash, absent its ability to issue debt. The RPOs it reported in its most recent earnings that are likely to be realized in the next 12 months are not, on their own, sufficient to cover its current obligations and announced growth plans (more on that shortly). The company has razor-thin operating margins—1.6% in the past quarter. After accounting for its large interest expenses, those margins turn sharply negative. The company lost more than $600 million on $2.2 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025. “That’s not great,” Luria says. “Is there any way that gap closes?”

Barring an enormous surge in revenue over the next 12 months or so, the company will likely need to borrow more money, or renegotiate with creditors, in order to cover the obligations already on its books. To be sure, the AI boom could deliver that revenue surge—but even slight weakening in spending growth across the industry could hit CoreWeave disproportionately. Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm that is shorting the stock, is pithy in its conclusions: CoreWeave, it wrote in a September report, is “the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.”

A pivot to AI, fueled by debt

CoreWeave began as a crypto-mining company, a side project of a few friends who were hedge-fund traders. Crypto mining, like AI, relies heavily on graphic processing units, or GPUs, with the chips racing to solve complicated algorithms that spit out currency rewards for correctly verifying blockchain transactions, and CoreWeave was a steady buyer.

Over time, Brian Venturo, one of the company’s founders, realized that the rise in AI would be a major factor fueling the surge in demand for the computing power of the GPUs that CoreWeave was already accumulating. Beginning in October 2021, CoreWeave entered into two deals with asset management firm Magnetar Capital, raising first $50 million in convertible notes, and then a year later, an additional $125 million, also in convertible notes. The company used nearly all of it to buy GPUs from Nvidia. Over the next few years, CoreWeave would secure billions of dollars in a combination of debt and equity, building out a sprawling array of data centers across the U.S., and eventually expanding to the U.K.

This March, CoreWeave’s IPO made it one of the closest things to a pure-play AI company to debut on public markets. Initially, fears

[TITLE]Government needs a new plan for jobs:
[TEXT]
People who talk about a recession being good for the economy in the long run are ignoring these costs.

So, what’s the plan?

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is just back from yet another of his overseas trips where he’s been signing things called “comprehensive strategic partnerships”. The difference between these things and real trade deals is they contain no concrete actions, no reductions in tariffs, no new investments. Seems to me that a “comprehensive strategic partnership” seems like a fancy term for a bunch of empty words.

No help there.

And no help from Nicola Willis. The Finance Minister’s devoting all her energy to attacking the idea that landlords should pay tax on the profits when they sell a property, just like every business does when it makes a profit and every worker does when they get a pay cheque.

Meanwhile, David Seymour’s busy signing off taxpayer funding for a charter school to teach Latin and working with Erica Stanford to remove anything relating to Māori from the education system. Simeon Brown and Judith Collins are picking fights with our essential workers rather than paying them fairly, Chris Bishop is pouring billions (pulled from who knows where) into a handful of roads even as the costs blow out more and more, and Simon Watts is focused on gutting our climate laws.

Nobody in this Government seems to have their eyes on the economy and jobs. No ministers seem to have a serious plan for dealing with energy prices and saving what’s left of our manufacturing sector. And none of them seem open to changing their approach after two years of failure.

The “plan”, if it can be called that, seems to be to hope house prices take off again and the mortgage-laden middle class feels wealthier by the time it comes to vote next year.

If we want a prosperous future for our children in New Zealand, we need a better plan than just riding the house price boom/bust cycle over and over again.

Labour’s new policies are at least showing a different path is possible.

The NZ Future Fund would plough profits from the state-owned enterprises back into investing in growing New Zealand businesses. It’s one of those long-term investments, like the Cullen Fund, that will make us better off for decades to come.

The capital gains tax would encourage people to invest their money in the productive economy, rather than in housing speculation, and fund doctors’ visits at the same time. As a landlord myself, I’ve got to say: we are not going to get ahead as a country if we continue to see property investment as the easiest route to wealth.

I’ve also got no problem paying tax on the profit I will make when I come to sell my rentals. We tax hard work and business profits, why should landlord profits be exempt? And I back Barbara Edmonds’ Medicard free GP visits idea – make it easier for people to access healthcare before they get even sicker and wind up in hospital. In time, I would like to see Medicard extended to dental, as well.

Policies like these would see more government and private investment into the productive economy: manufacturing, renewable energy, construction, technology, research and education. As I travel around Europe, that’s what I see the most successful countries are doing.

That’s the path to more jobs and giving our young people a reason to stay in this country.

[TITLE]BAE Systems and Turkish Aerospace Announce Partnership to Develop Unmanned Aerial Systems:
[TEXT]
The Memorandum of Understanding envisages both companies combining their complementary capabilities in development of unmanned systems and exploring new market opportunities.

Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI or TUSAŞ – Türk Havacılık ve Uzay Sanayi A.Ş.) and U.K. arms major BAE Systems signed on Nov. 6, 2025 an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) to jointly develop unmanned aerial systems.

Neither company has mentioned the specific role and class of unmanned systems to be developed, or if they have already identified an existing uncrewed platform from TAI’s existing product line for use within Turkey. The latter is likely, given that both companies have stressed on mating their respective strengths, with existing aircraft in the class and advanced mission systems for customization and marketing experience to secure sales.
