[TITLE]Vaxxas secures ~A$90 million in funding to:
[TEXT]
Total equity and debt raising of ~$90 million provides runway to 2H 2027

Strong support from existing and new investors including SPRIM Global Investments

Funds will be used to scale-up production of needle-free vaccination delivery technology

Founding CEO David Hoey will transition to Strategic Advisor

Company well-advanced in search for new CEO to accelerate commercialisation.

BRISBANE, Australia, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxxas Pty Ltd, the biotechnology company pioneering the high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) for needle-free vaccine delivery, today announced that it has secured ~$90 million in its latest financing round.

The financing is one of the largest financings for a private biotech company in Australia this year and includes $49.22 million in new Series D equity and $40 million in debt facilities, with additional commitments under discussion as the Company continues to attract investor interest.

The equity financing was led by SPRIM Global Investments, the venture arm of global life sciences firm SPRIM, with strong participation from new investor LGT Crestone as well as existing investors OneVentures and Brandon Capital-Hostplus.

The funding will enable Vaxxas to accelerate the development and scale-up of its HD-MAP technology towards market readiness, including installation of semi-automated manufacturing lines and later-stage clinical trial programs.

Vaxxas’ HD-MAP technology represents a major advance in vaccine delivery, enabling needle-free administration that reduces temperature control requirements for vaccine storage and creates opportunities for self-administration in the home. This could dramatically improve vaccine access and uptake worldwide.

Chair of Vaxxas, Sarah Meibusch, said the capital raising represented an excellent achievement in a very difficult market for biotech. “This result underscores the confidence that leading investors have in Vaxxas’ disruptive technology and the progress the team has made toward scaling-up and commercialisation. Coupled with our sharp focus on commercialisation, this funding provides Vaxxas with a runway into the second half of 2027 as we focus on bringing our technology to market.”

Michael Shleifer, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of SPRIM Global Investments, said: “SPRIM is proud to lead this financing and support Vaxxas at this exciting juncture. We believe the HD-MAP platform has the potential to fundamentally transform vaccine delivery globally – expanding access, reducing costs, and improving uptake. The commercial opportunity is enormous, and we look forward to partnering with the team as they advance toward market.”

In addition to the Series D equity, Vaxxas has entered into a US$25.2 million (A$40 million) debt facility with SPRIM Global Investments, which the company can draw down based on eligible R&D activity under the Australian Government’s R&D tax rebate scheme and in line with the Company’s R&D needs.

Leadership and Board transition

After 14 years as CEO, David Hoey will transition to a new role as Strategic Advisor. Having led Vaxxas since 2012, Mr Hoey and the Board believe that this transition provides a strategic opportunity to put leadership in place for the coming years, as the Company accelerates its commercialisation efforts to bring the HD-MAP to market.

Mr Hoey said: “I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved to bring the company and its technology to this point in its growth. We have successfully validated the revolutionary potential of this vaccination delivery platform for a spectrum of diseases in global markets and have strong traction in product and market development. I look forward to continuing to be a part of the Vaxxas journey, supporting the executive team and Board as they drive forward.”

Under Mr Hoey’s leadership, Vaxxas has established a world-class team, strategic relationships with global leaders in vaccination, and raised more than $300 million to support the programs, of which almost $160 million has been injected into the Australian economy, including more than $140 million in Queensland.

Sarah Meibusch said: “We are deeply grateful to David for his tireless work to get Vaxxas to this stage. David and the Vaxxas team have grown the company from a spinout from The University of Queensland into a company with strong technical and operational capabilities and established a world-class development and manufacturing facility. This transition reflects the Company’s evolution from a high-potential startup to a commercially focused biotech scaling for global impact. David’s continued involvement as advisor and committed shareholder will help ensure a smooth transition and continuity.”

A global search for a new CEO is well advanced.

Vaxxas Chair Paul Kelly, who has been on the Board since Vaxxas was founded in 2011, has retired from the Board. Fellow OneVentures representative Sarah Meibusch has been appointed Chair. Ms Meibusch, OneVentures Healthcare Partner, has been closely involved with Vaxxas for a number of years and has been an alternate director since 2020.

[TITLE]Thoma Bravo to buy Verint in $2 billion deal as software acquisitions ramp up:
[TEXT]
Thoma Bravo will acquire Verint Systems in a $2 billion deal, including debt, the customer engagement platform said on Monday, marking the latest software buyout as private equity firms increasingly bet on AI to navigate an uncertain economy.

Software companies have emerged as prime acquisition targets as adoption of artificial intelligence and recurring revenue prove to be resilient markers in an economy pressured by tariffs and volatile customer spending.

Under the agreement, Verint shareholders will receive $20.50 per share in cash. The offer represents a premium of 4.2 per cent to the stock's closing price on June 30, before the talks were first reported, and implies an equity deal value of $1.23 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Shares of Verint — which provides an AI-powered platform to help enterprises organize, manage and improve customer interactions across various channels and digital operations — were down 1.2 per cent at $20.23.

The stock has lost 25 per cent of its value so far this year, pressured by strong competition and declining revenue in the past two quarters.

Still, some analysts expect Verint's focus on AI bots to result in higher demand as enterprise customers invest in automation and efficiency.

"We believe this was a strategic move for both entities as these organizations are closely aligned in terms of customer experience automation that leverages data and AI, with Thoma Bravo already heavily invested in this market," Wedbush analysts said in a note.

Thoma Bravo, which had about $184 billion in assets under management as of March 31, is among the largest software-focused investors globally. The private equity firm has acquired or invested in more than 530 software and technology companies.

Earlier this month, it had signed a $12 billion deal to acquire human resources software provider Dayforce.

The latest deal is expected to close before the end of Verint's current fiscal year.

[TITLE]Nvidia still hasn't finalized deal to kick 15% of H20 China chip sales back to the US government:
[TEXT]
Nvidia (NVDA) said Wednesday that the US government has not finalized a recent agreement that would require the AI chipmaker to share 15% of the revenue from sales of its H20 chips to China in exchange for export licenses.

“[US government] officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in a call following Nvidia’s second quarter earnings results. “But to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such a requirement.”

Nvidia was hit with a surprise export ban on sales of its H20 chips to China in April — a move that cost the chipmaker $2.5 billion in lost sales and $4.5 billion in inventory in the first quarter.

But the Trump administration said in July it would grant Nvidia export licenses for the H20 chips in exchange for 15% of the revenue from those sales. The government's unprecedented agreement with Nvidia is likely to face legal challenges due to the US Constitution’s ban on export taxes — a risk Nvidia acknowledged in its quarterly filing with the SEC.

“Any request for a percentage of the revenue by the USG may subject us to litigation, increase our costs, and harm our competitive position and benefit competitors that are not subject to such arrangements,” the company said in its filing.

While “a select number” of the chipmaker’s Chinese customers received licenses to buy the lower-power Nvidia chips in the past few weeks, the company hasn’t made any H20 sales based on those licenses.

"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," Kress said.

“If geopolitical issues reside, we should ship $2 [billion] to $5 billion in H20 revenue in Q3, and if we had more orders, we can bill more," Kress said.

Given that Nvidia made no H20 sales in the second quarter, the chipmaker's China revenue dove to $2.8 billion during the three months that ended July 27, down from $5.5 billion in the first quarter and $3.7 billion last year. On average, China accounted for roughly 15% of the company’s revenue over the prior 10 quarters. In the second quarter, that share fell to 5.9%.

Nvidia began sales of its H20 GPUs (graphics processing units) — less powerful versions of its prior-generation Hopper chips compliant with tightening US trade rules — to China in 2024.

Kress told analysts the US government began reviewing licenses for sales of the H20 chips to China in late July.

[TITLE]Ofer Harduf rejoins JPMorgan from venture capital firm as bank expands tech team, memo shows:
[TEXT]
By Milana Vinn

(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase has rehired Ofer Harduf from venture capital firm Fifth Wall as the bank continues to bolster its technology team, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Harduf, who will be a managing director in the technology M&A group, will be based in San Francisco. He returns to JPMorgan after spending the past four years as a partner at Fifth Wall, a technology-focused VC firm based in New York.

Prior to joining Fifth Wall in 2021, Harduf spent 9 years at JPMorgan where he focused on gaming, lodging, and real estate technology sectors.

“Ofer’s career spans both investment banking and venture capital, positioning him with a differentiated perspective informed by both principal investing and advisory work across the technology ecosystem,” Jay Hofmann, head of North America M&A, and Vineet Seth, who runs technology M&A for North America, said in the memo sent to employees on Wednesday.

Harduf has added to the growing list of JPMorgan’s recent hires in its tech M&A group on the West Coast.

Among tech bankers who recently joined JPMorgan are Mark Garcia, vice chair and global head of semiconductors; Eric Quanbeck, managing director and head of applied technology; Brett Miller, managing director and co-head of enterprise and cloud; Peter Duda, managing director supporting software clients; Mike Amex, managing director and head of mid-cap technology services; and Devin Thomas, managing director and head of technology software improvement group M&A.

JPMorgan is expanding its tech M&A group as the investment bank has seen momentum winning advisory mandates in the sector, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk announced in July.

Aerospacelab secures 94M EUR to expand satellite production and development

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Aug 26, 2025

Aerospacelab has closed an extended Series B funding round worth 94 million EUR (110 million USD), strengthening its industrial roadmap and positioning as a leading European satellite manufacturer. The round combined 56 million EUR (66 million USD) in new financing with a 38 million EUR (44 million USD) commitment from a European financial institution.

The investment is fueling the company's growth trajectory by advancing product readiness and enabling the delivery of fully developed satellites to customers across earth observation, telecommunications, and other sectors. A portion of the capital is supporting the vertical integration of key subsystems, reinforcing industrial autonomy, and accelerating product development.

"This Series B is more than just capital - it's a strong endorsement of our vision to deliver and scale our manufacturing capabilities powering the next generation of constellations," said Benoit Deper, CEO and Founder of Aerospacelab. "It reinforces our position at a pivotal moment: our products are mature and ready to deploy, our industrial infrastructure is scaling up for mass production, and we are prepared to meet rising global demand with speed and precision. We are ready for what's next."

The funding has already been applied to Aerospacelab's Megafactory project, an advanced satellite production site under construction since 2024. Designed for an annual capacity of up to 500 satellites, the facility is expected to produce its first spacecraft in 2026 and reach full-scale output by 2027. The capital is also driving expanded R and D, hiring of top-tier engineering talent, and full subsystem verticalization to improve reliability, performance, and delivery for commercial partners.

Supported by both new and returning investors, this Series B reflects growing market confidence in Aerospacelab's vertically integrated technology strategy and its ability to deliver innovation, speed, and scalability in satellite manufacturing.

[TITLE]Another artificial intelligence deal collapses — as Colorado lawmakers’ budget fixes near finish line:
[TEXT]
Colorado’s first-in-the-nation regulations on artificial intelligence may have to wait longer if the legislature approves a proposal advanced by the state Senate on Monday.

In a dramatic shift from Sunday night, when a deal on revamped regulations appeared within reach, Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez gutted the bill. The measure, proposed during a mostly budget-focused special session, had been aimed at regulating AI and increasing transparency around its use to make decisions affecting Coloradans.

Instead, the bill as amended would simply delay, by several months, the implementation of a law passed 2024 that is supposed to go into effect next February.

Under Rodriguez’s proposal, which still needs to pass the state House, those regulations would take effect at the end of June — giving the tech industry, lawmakers, and public-interest and consumer-protection groups another chance during the next regular session to nail down how to regulate the growing, affluent industry. The regular session convenes in mid-January.

“Overnight, the tech industry decided that they were so unhappy with the compromise that had been achieved by consumer-protection organizations, educators, labor and business that they would rather return to the (existing rules),” said Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and driving figure on AI regulations in the state.

The legislature met for its latest special session chiefly to address a $783 million budget deficit brought on by tax cuts and spending changes made by the federal government in July. But the AI regulations, which drew the ire of an industry that argues they are unworkable, was also specifically designated for new consideration in Gov. Jared Polis’ recall of the legislature this month.

Most budget-related bills finished

By the end of the fifth day of the session on Monday, the Democratic majority had sent to Polis the bulk of the bills they hoped would bite into the deficit. The single biggest revenue-raising measure, however, still needed at least two more votes.

The bills that have passed the legislature are:

House Bill 1001, which makes permanent a limit on certain business income deductions for people making more than $500,000 per year.

House Bill 1002, which cracks down on the use of foreign tax havens and adds several countries to that label.

House Bill 1003, which ends a tax incentive for insurance companies that keep offices in the state.

House Bill 1005, which ends a state subsidy to businesses for collecting sales taxes.

In total, those measures are expected to raise about $150 million. The fifth measure, House Bill 1004, would allow certain entities to sell tax credits that can be reclaimed at a discount in future tax years. Lawmakers expect that to bring in another $100 million, for a total of just over $250 million.

"Right now, we need to ensure that the families and the small businesses that truly need our help are getting it," said Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Jefferson County Democrat.

The revenue-raisers amount to nearly a third of the total $783 million budget gap. Polis' staff is preparing to address as much as a third of the gap through spending cuts. His office is expected to reveal its planned reductions later this week, after the revenue part has been adopted.

The rest of the hole will be filled from the legislature's piggy bank. That'll happen last: Whatever's not raised or cut will be pulled from the state's reserves. The governor's office has suggested roughly $320 million, which would reduce the current reserve level -- about 15% of the general fund budget -- by 2 percentage points.

That would mean his office was planning to propose about $200 million in spending reductions.

Liability at issue on AI

On the AI front, Rodriguez’s bill was sent Monday over to the House, where members have already debated a competing AI measure -- one that had also been watered down to simply delaying the 2024 regulations, in that case until October 2026. The House planned to take up Rodriguez's bill in committee and potentially for an initial floor vote Monday night, which would make a final vote possible Tuesday.

How to assign liability for bias apparent in the use of AI to make decisions -- between entities that use AI for things like screening job and rental applications and the entities that developed the AI tools -- was a key part of Rodriguez's measure before its gutting.

But that has been a key sticking point between the dueling bills.

“A delay is the prudent thing to do,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat and sponsor of the House bill, said. “We need to figure out a way where school districts, hospitals and other deployers aren’t left holding the bag for these regulations. We need to ensure that all stakeholders involved in this legislation are held equally accountable when bad things happen.”
