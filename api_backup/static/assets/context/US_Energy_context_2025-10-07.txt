NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — A group of countries that are part of the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries has agreed to a small boost in oil production, citing a steady global economic outlook.

The group said after a virtual meeting on Sunday that it will raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day in November, they same amount it announced for October. The group has been raising output slightly in a series of boosts all year, after announcing cuts in 2023 and 2024.

In a statement the group said the move was due to “a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals.” It added the production adjustments may be paused or reversed as market conditions evolve.

Saudi Arabia holds significant influence in OPEC+ as the dominant member of the OPEC producers’ cartel, and Russia is the leading non-OPEC member in the 22-country alliance.

Along with Saudi Arabia and Russia, the group that met Sunday is made up of Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman. Their next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 2.

[TITLE]U.S. Backs Historic Deal to Keep Kurdish Oil Moving:
[TEXT]
The U.S. Administration wants to ensure that the just-restarted oil exports from Iraq’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan continue to flow via pipeline to Turkey in the long run, an anonymous official at the U.S. Department of State told Bloomberg on Friday.

The Trump Administration is working toward the goal of keeping Kurdistan’s crude flowing in the long term to boost the Iraqi economy, counter Iran’s influence in the region, and benefit U.S. companies operating in Iraq, according to the official.

The U.S. has played a role in the deal that allowed the resumption of the exports from Kurdistan, the official told Bloomberg.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented last week on the agreement to restart exports, saying on X “We welcome the announcement that the Government of Iraq has reached an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government and international companies to reopen the Iraq-Türkiye pipeline. This deal, facilitated by the United States, will bring tangible benefits for both Americans and Iraqis while reaffirming Iraq’s sovereignty.”

Kurdistan’s oil exports resumed on Saturday, September 27, following a two and a half year suspension of the flows via the pipeline from northern Iraq to the Turkish Mediterranean coast.

Related: Supermajors Slim Down to Protect Shareholder Payouts

Eight foreign companies operating in Kurdistan have signed agreements with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Federal Government of Iraq to enable the restart of international crude exports from Kurdistan.

This agreement paved to way to the restart of exports, which were halted for two and a half years, after they were shut in in March 2023 due to a dispute over who should authorize the Kurdish exports.

The federal government in Baghdad and the regional Kurdish government in Erbil squabbled for more than two years over who should be responsible for the oil exports and the subsequent revenue distribution.

Under the agreement, hailed as historic by Iraq’s federal government, KRG is delivering about 190,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to Iraqi state marketing company SOMO. Kurdistan is also entitled to keep 50,000 bpd to use for local consumption.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies sells half of US solar portfolio, invests in natural gas assets:
[TEXT]

As anti-renewables sentiment swirls in the United States, French international energy giant TotalEnergies is offloading half of its North American solar portfolio in a transaction with an enterprise value of $1.25 billion. At the same time, the company has signaled its commitment to expanding natural gas production stateside, acquiring a 49% interest in assets owned and operated by Continental Resources in the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma.

The moves are part of a plan to cut annual capital spending by $1 billion and sell more power assets. However, the market still seems concerned with TotalEnergies’ recent rise in debt. Shares fell 2% after CEO Patrick Pouyanne hosted an investor day on Monday, according to Reuters. The company’s capex cut, to $15–17 billion a year for 2027 to 2030, is part of a drive to save $7.5 billion.

Selling Solar

On Monday, TotalEnergies signed an agreement with insurance vehicles and accounts managed by KKR, a leading global investment firm, for the sale of a 50% stake in its 1.4 gigawatt (GW) solar portfolio in North America. TotalEnergies expects to receive a total of $950 million at closing, following refinancing.

The transaction includes six utility-scale solar assets with a combined capacity of 1.3 GW and 41 distributed generation assets totalling 140 megawatts (MW), primarily in the United States. The electricity production of each project has either been sold to third parties or will be commercialized by TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies will keep a 50% stake in the assets and continue to operate them after the closing of the transaction.

“We are pleased to enter into this new strategic partnership with KKR in North America, a key deregulated electricity market, to expand our integrated business model”, said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables & Power at TotalEnergies. “Aligned with our strategy, this transaction unlocks value from newly commissioned assets and further strengthens the profitability of our Integrated Power business.”

TotalEnergies has committed more than $23 billion to date in energy transition investments.

“TotalEnergies’ North American solar portfolio is a great fit for us, representing high-quality renewable energy assets with long-term contracts,” observed Cecilio Velasco, managing director at KKR.

Buying Natural Gas

TotalEnergies also announced an agreement Monday with Continental Resources to acquire a 49% interest in natural gas-producing assets owned and operated by Continental Resources in the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma. This acquisition of low-cost and long-plateau assets, well connected to Henry Hub through existing midstream infrastructure, further strengthens TotalEnergies’ integration across the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain in the United States, according to the company.

The assets have the potential to reach a gross production of around 350 MMscfd by 2030 and to sustain this production level over the long term. They will enable TotalEnergies to secure a net gas production of around 150 MMscfd. This acquisition of non-operated shale gas assets complements the Dorado and Constellation acquisitions that TotalEnergies completed in 2024 in the Eagle Ford Basin. TotalEnergies also operates a technical production of around 500 MMscfd in the Barnett.

“This acquisition will further increase our natural gas production in the United States and consolidate TotalEnergies’ integrated LNG position with a competitive low-cost and low-emission gas production”, said Nicolas Terraz, President, exploration & production at TotalEnergies. “We are delighted to partner with Continental Resources, a reference operator in the Anadarko Basin, recognized for its strong technical expertise and operational excellence.”

[TITLE]RBC Capital Maintains Its $31.00 PT on Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC) with Outperforming Rating:
[TEXT]
Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC) is one of the 10 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts, supported by hedge fund interest and analyst-rated potential.

RBC Capital Maintains Its $31.00 PT on Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC) with Outperforming Rating

On September 26, 2025, RBC Capital maintained its $31.00 price target for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC) and retained its Outperforming rating. Growth visibility for the renewable energy company is “stronger than ever,” according to analyst Nelson Ng, demonstrating confidence in its long-term expansion plan. The rating follows weeks after Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC) reported lower-than-anticipated Q2 2025 profits, with EPS of -$4.16 versus an expected $0.01 and sales of $991 million against a prediction of $1.77 billion. Nevertheless, its hydropower and distributed energy companies made significant contributions to Funds From Operations, which increased 10% year over year to $371 million. A pipeline of U.S. M&A opportunities and investments in grid reliability technology support management’s continued goal of double-digit annual FFO per unit growth and 12–15% long-term total returns.

Hydro, wind, solar, storage, and other sustainable energy assets are owned and operated globally by Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE:BEPC). It is one of the most promising stocks.

While we acknowledge the potential of BEPC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
