[TITLE]Crude Prices Tumble as OPEC Projects a Global Crude Surplus:
[TEXT]
December WTI crude oil (CLZ25) today is down -2.14 (-3.51%), and December RBOB gasoline (RBZ25) is down -0.0400 (-1.99%).

Crude oil and gasoline prices are falling sharply today, with crude matching a 3-week low. Signs of global supply glut are weighing on crude prices after OPEC said a global crude surplus arrived sooner than expected. Dollar strength today is also negative for energy prices.

Crude prices tumbled today after OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output. OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus last month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit.

As a bearish factor, Saudi Arabia last Thursday lowered the price of its main crude grade to Asia for delivery next month to the lowest level in 11 months.

Crude has support amid expectations that the US government will reopen later this week, which would support economic growth and energy demand. On Monday, the Senate voted 60-40 to pass a temporary continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government, and the House will vote on the measure later today, when it is expected to pass. If approved, the bill goes to President Trump, who said he will sign it into law.

Strength in crude demand from China, the world's second-largest crude consumer, is supportive of prices, after a report last Friday showed that China's Jan-Oct crude imports rose +3.1% y/y to 471 MMT.

Oil prices have received support on recent reports that the US military may be on the verge of launching military strikes on Venezuela, which is the world's 12th largest oil producer.

OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members will raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's October crude production rose by +50,000 bpd to 29.07 million bpd, the highest in 2.5 years.

Reduced crude exports from Russia are supportive of oil prices. Ukraine has targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past three months, exacerbating a fuel crunch in Russia and limiting Russia's crude export capabilities. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries and oil export terminals curbed Russia's total seaborne fuel shipments to 1.88 million bpd in the first ten days of October, the lowest average in over 3.25 years, and have knocked out 13% to 20% of Russia's refining capacity by the end of October, curbing production by as much as 1.1 million bpd. New US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have also curbed Russian oil exports.

Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days rose +11% w/w to 95.18 million bbls in the week ended November 7.

Last Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of October 31 were -5.3% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -4.3% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -8.8% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending October 31 rose +0.1% w/w to a record high of 13.651 million bpd.

Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending November 7 remained unchanged at 414, modestly above the 4-year low of 410 rigs set on August 1. Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.

[TITLE]Crude Prices Climb on Dollar Weakness and Expected End of US Government Shutdown:
[TEXT]
December WTI crude oil (CLZ25) on Tuesday closed up +0.91 (+1.51%), and December RBOB gasoline (RBZ25) closed up +0.0409 (+2.07%).

Crude oil and gasoline prices rallied on Tuesday, with crude posting a 1-week high and gasoline posting a 6-week high. Tuesday's decline in the dollar index (DXY00) to a 1.5-week low is bullish for energy prices. Crude also has support amid expectations that the US government will reopen later this week, which would support economic growth and energy demand.

On Monday, the Senate voted 60-40 to pass a temporary continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government, and the House will vote on the measure on Wednesday, when it is expected to pass. If approved, the bill goes to President Trump, who said he will sign it into law.

[TITLE]Proposed rules for RE generators questionable:
[TEXT]
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has proposed a draft with significant changes to the Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM), which governs penalties when renewable generators deviate from their scheduled output. The reforms are aimed at strengthening grid stability or grid balancing, which is important looking at India’s main target to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based installed electricity capacity by 2030, a goal set at COP-26.

But, the proposed draft, on which CERC has sought industry feedback, is already creating concerns among the key players both in solar and wind energy categories. They argue that it could raise costs and risks for renewable energy developers, particularly wind projects. The Commission has invited stakeholder comments and industry bodies like Wind Independent Power Producers Association (WIPPA) have already appealed against the proposals.

So, what is grid balancing and why it is important? The textbook definition of grid balancing is the process of keeping electricity supply and demand equal at all times to maintain a stable power grid. The power plants do this by adjusting their output, while consumers adjust their usage to prevent blackouts or overloads. This has become increasingly important with the rise of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar. For balancing, services grid operators use mechanisms like battery energy storage, to quickly react to any imbalances and maintain a consistent grid frequency.

Key changes

What are these key changes that CERC proposes to bring into effective April 1, 2026? Under the current system deviations are measured against available capacity. Under the proposed system, a hybrid formula has been worked out based on both scheduled generation (expected supply to discoms) and available capacity, with more emphasis on the former with the passage of time. Deviation from scheduled generation is a factor in grid instability, as it disrupts discoms’ planning. This change will make deviation charges stricter and costlier for wind and solar projects.

It proposes tighter tolerance bands which would mean projects will be penalised for smaller deviations, raising compliance and forecasting pressures.

According to Aditya Pyassi, CEO of the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturer Association (IWTMA), “ The CERC endeavours of fostering greater grid discipline are welcome. However, we need to see and acknowledge the fact that India is on a historic path targeting the integration of 500 GW of renewable by 2030 and to maintain RE project viability, and it is very important to go

[TEXT]
The chief executive of British power firm SSE says a rapid build-out of renewable projects can help the U.K. to secure its energy security and bring costs down for consumers.

British utility SSE unveiled a 33 billion pound five-year investment plan on Wednesday, including a 2 billion pound ($2.68 billion) equity fundraising, as it seeks to upgrade the UK's regulated electricity networks and bolster its renewables business.

SSE's shares rose more than 11% to a record high. Analysts were positive

[TITLE]COP30 in Brazil: Can India lead the Global South on climate? – DW – 11:
[TEXT]
As rich nations drag their feet, India's role is pivotal in bringing together the Global North and South on climate action.

As nearly 200 countries debate the planet's climate future at the 30th UN Climate Conference (COP30) in Brazil's Amazonian city of Belem, India finds itself in a unique position in balancing the weight of its need for economic growth with its increasingly prominent role as a voice representing the Global South.

This year's climate negotiations follow last year's disappointing COP29 held in Azerbaijan, where countries missed the climate finance mark and agreed to raise $300 billion (€259 billion) annually by 2035 instead of the appealed $1.3 trillion.

Developing nations criticized countries with industrialized economies for dodging their responsibility by not pledging adequate climate financing. India said the pledged sum was "too little, too distant."

Standing on the shaky ground set by COP29, this year's summit aims to operationalize the climate finance targets and revise national climate plans called the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The host country, Brazil, has insisted this will be "the COP of implementation."

How is India balancing economic and climate needs?

For India, like other vulnerable countries in the Global South facing a disproportionate brunt of the climate crisis, the stakes and hopes are high. As one of the world's fastest growing economies, it walks a tightrope, balancing its economic ambitions with the collective responsibility of tackling the climate challenge.

In the past few years, India has made substantial progress in the field of renewable energy — particularly solar and wind. It has the fourth largest renewable energy generation capacity in the world, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

And a report published in October by the International Energy Agency (IEA) concluded that the country is set to become the second-largest renewables growth market globally, after China, by 2030.

Despite its achievements in harnessing renewable power, India still relies heavily on coal, which is estimated to generate around 75% of its electricity. The country is the world's second largest coal consumer, after China.

Amid strong economic growth and corresponding energy demand, India has seen a multifold jump in its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The country was responsible for the biggest rise in GHG emissions globally between 2023 and 2024, adding

Two European pioneers of the modern wind power industry are sounding the alarm on the Trump administration's clean energy cutbacks, warning Washington's anti-climate agenda is part of a broader energy transition challenge. Denmark's Henrik Stiesdal and Britain's Andrew Garrad, often referred to as the "Godfathers of wind" for their contributions in advancing the design, manufacture and deployment of wind turbines, said Trump's war on wind appears to be a symptom of more widespread climate apathy. Stiesdal is known for framing the early design principles for wind turbines and led the installation of the world's first offshore wind farm in 1991, while Garrad developed computer models to optimize and certify turbine and farm designs. "I think Trump's approach is symptomatic of a general shift," Garrad said, in comments echoed by Stiesdal, one that is opposed to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable technologies, such as wind and solar. "We are facing right now, a change of mood. We had a very easy beginning, then quite a big struggle, then general acceptance, and now the worm is turning. And that's something which we all have to address," Garrad told CNBC.

Since returning to office at the start of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump has actively sought to disrupt the development of high-profile wind projects. His push to wipe out the offshore wind industry has included stop-work orders and the removal of green incentives under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. "Trump is symptomatic. I mean an extreme symptom of that, but you can see it I think in all Western countries certainly, perhaps not elsewhere. And that's a big issue," Garrad said. "This isn't just a wind energy problem," Garrad said. "To do this sort of change is a very dangerous thing. And I think it has shown that this is a political business ... It's a personal decision by a politician, who happens to be a rather powerful one — and it has sent shockwaves around the place."

'Pathetic' and 'expensive'

Trump's onslaught against the wind industry has hit the business models of renewable energy giants particularly hard. Denmark's Ortsed, the world's biggest offshore wind farm group, is one notable example. Last week, Orsted reported a net loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner ($261.8 million) for the July-September period. The result, which was slightly better than analysts feared, was significantly down from profit of 5.17 billion Danish kroner in the same period last year. Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company, which have fallen more than 80% from a 2021 peak, notched a fresh record low in August after the Trump administration ordered the company to halt work on a near complete windfarm.

[TITLE]British utility SSE seeks to raise $2.7 billion for grid investments, shares soar:
[TEXT]
The chief executive of British power firm SSE says a rapid build-out of renewable projects can help the U.K. to secure its energy security and bring costs down for consumers.

British utility SSE unveiled a 33 billion pound five-year investment plan on Wednesday, including a 2 billion pound ($2.68 billion) equity fundraising, as it seeks to upgrade the UK's regulated electricity networks and bolster its renewables business.

SSE's shares rose more than 11% to a record high. Analysts were positive

[TITLE]Data Centers Devour Electricity. Private Equity Is Buying Utilities to Cash In.:
[TEXT]
The seizure of public utilities for the sake of profit may lead to a disaster for consumers — and the planet.

Ratepayers across the U.S. are facing rising electric bills — a trend that could be turbocharged by Wall Street’s growing effort to capture the electric utilities we all depend on.

A critical turning point in this development occurred in October when Minnesota state regulators greenlit the acquisition of Allete by asset management behemoth BlackRock — set to become Allete’s majority stakeholder — and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Allete owns Minnesota Power, the main electric utility in northern Minnesota. The approval came against significant community opposition and, as Truthout previously reported, an administrative law judge’s report that strongly recommended against the deal.

With the acquisition, BlackRock will turn Allete from a publicly traded company into a private one. Moreover, BlackRock is now gunning for utility giant AES, which has utilities in Ohio and Indiana along with other extensive U.S. and international operations, while another private equity titan, Blackstone, is seeking approval to acquire TXNM Energy, with hundreds of thousands of customers in New Mexico and Texas. Private equity’s escalating run on utilities is largely driven by the boom in data centers — massive consumers of electricity — and the guaranteed rates of return that utilities offer.

Critics of the buyouts say this is a deeply alarming trend, as firms like BlackRock and Blackstone will likely impose a private equity model — opaque, extractive, laser-focused on profit — over basic services. Even well-intentioned state regulators, opponents contend, will be no match for these massively-resourced companies as they look to bulldoze through any obstacles toward enriching their wealthy investors.

Alissa Jean Schafer, climate director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said the Allete deal’s approval was “precedent-setting” for private equity’s growing incursion into utilities.

“The approval of this deal sends a signal that our critical infrastructure is now up for sale to the highest bidder,” said Schafer.

Victory for BlackRock

When BlackRock’s infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), announced a $6.2 billion deal in May 2024 to acquire Allete and take the company private, many local organizers, community members, and ratepayers in Northern Minnesota staunchly opposed the deal, which needed approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC).

Their fears that a private equity takeover of their electric utility could weaken transparency and raise rates seemed vindicated in July when, after months of comments from all sides, an administrative law judge unequivocally recommended the Minnesota PUC reject the deal. The report stated in stark terms that BlackRock would “do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

“That’s when the influence wielding and the political machinations really ramped up,” Maggie Schuppert, an organizer with CURE, a rural community advocacy group intervening against the acquisition, told Truthout.

Minnesota’s Department of Commerce, an important and influential party that participated in the review process of the acquisition, soon reversed its initial opposition to the deal after some concessions from Allete. Records obtained by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project indicate that Pete Wyckoff, the commerce department’s deputy commissioner of energy resources, had cozy communications with Allete as a deal was being worked out.

Reporting from The Lever showed that a former Minnesota PUC commissioner now working on behalf of BlackRock appears to have coordinated with building trades unions to back the deal, which a representative of the union denied, despite evidence showing the former commissioner’s digital footprint on filings from the union in favor of the takeover. Meanwhile, some “clean energy” groups came out in favor of the acquisition after developing relationships with private stakeholders and BlackRock attorneys. In one instance, a “clean energy” nonprofit held a benefit with Allete as a “VIP sponsor.”

At the PUC’s first meeting on the acquisition, Schuppert said it became clear that commissioners were intent on approving the deal, even as PUC staff warned

[TITLE]What Climate Change Will Do to America by Mid-Century:
[TEXT]
Earlier this year, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, a graveyard was spared by the fire that sent thousands of Los Angeles residents fleeing into the coal-black night. Here, in Mountain View Cemetery, lie the bones of Octavia Butler, the famed science-fiction writer who spent her life in Pasadena and Altadena, both of which had burned. Trinkets offered by fans often decorate Butler’s unassuming grave. A footstone is inscribed with a quotation from her Parable of the Sower : ALL THAT YOU TOUCH, YOU CHANGE. ALL THAT YOU CHANGE, CHANGES YOU.

In that dystopian novel, published in 1993 and set in the mid-2020s, the United States still exists but has been warped by global warming, and its authoritarian government has ceded most of the administration of day-to-day matters to corrupt companies. In Butler’s neo-feudal vision, states and cities erect strict borders to deter migrants, the gap between rich and poor has widened, and massive wildfires in Southern California drive the state’s decline.

It has become commonplace to label Butler a prophet. She didn’t get everything right
