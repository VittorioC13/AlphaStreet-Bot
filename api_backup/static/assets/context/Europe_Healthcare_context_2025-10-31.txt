Product Sales, net (4)

Naloxone

For Q3 2025, revenues from Naloxone products decreased $20.4 million, or 21%, as compared with Q3 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales of OTC NARCAN® and lower Canadian sales of branded NARCAN®, primarily driven by an unfavorable price and volume mix, partially offset by an increase in KLOXXADO® sales.

Anthrax MCM

For Q3 2025, revenues from Anthrax MCM products decreased $10.0 million, or 88%, as compared with Q3 2024. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of timing of USG sales of BioThrax® as well as timing of international sales of CYFENDUS® in the prior year period. Anthrax vaccine product sales are primarily made under annual purchase options exercised by the U.S. Government ("USG"). Fluctuations in revenues result from the timing of the exercise of annual purchase options, the timing of USG purchases, the availability of governmental funding and Company delivery of orders that follow.

Smallpox MCM

For Q3 2025, revenues from Smallpox MCM products decreased $49.1 million, or 37%, as compared with Q3 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower USG ACAM2000® and CNJ-016® (VIGIV) sales due to timing, partially offset by an increase in international CNJ-016® (VIGIV), ACAM2000®, and TEMBEXA® sales. Fluctuations in revenues from Smallpox MCM result from the timing of the exercise of annual purchase options in the existing procurement contracts, the timing of USG purchases, the availability of governmental funding and Company delivery of orders that follow.

Other Products

For Q3 2025, revenues from Other Product sales increased $27.4 million, or 91%, as compared with Q3 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher USG BAT® sales due to timing, partially offset by a decrease in international sales orders.

All Other Revenues

Services

For Q3 2025, revenues from Services decreased $9.7 million, or 68%, as compared with Q3 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue from the Company’s Camden facility in the current year period, which was sold to Bora Pharmaceuticals in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in production at the Company's Winnipeg facility.

Contracts and Grants

For Q3 2025, revenues from contracts and grants decreased $0.9 million, or 9%, as compared with Q3 2024. The decrease was due to declines in overall funded R&D projects, partially offset by an increase in development work in connection with Ebanga™.

Operating Expenses

($ in millions) Q3 2025 Q3 2024 % Change Cost of product and services sales, net $ 85.9 $ 122.6 (30 )% Research and development (“R&D”) 13.5 13.8 (2 )% Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) 38.9 76.6 (49 )% Amortization of intangible assets 16.3 16.3 — % Total operating expenses $ 154.6 $ 229.3 (33 )%

Cost of Product and Services Sales, Net

For Q3 2025, cost of product and services sales, net decreased $36.7 million, or 30%, as compared with Q3 2024. The decrease was driven by decreases in cost of Services of $16.2 million, cost of MCM Product sales of $15.9 million and cost of Commercial Product sales of $4.6 million.

Research and Development Expenses

For Q3 2025, R&D expenses decreased $0.3 million, or 2% as compared with Q3 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in overhead and severance related costs, partially offset by an increase in unfunded R&D project spend and in Ebanga™ related development work.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

For Q3 2025, SG&A expenses decreased $37.7 million, or 49%, as compared with Q3 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of a one-time expense of $10.0 million recognized in the prior year period and the receipt of a one-time reimbursement of $10.5 million in the current year period related to settlements of our securities and shareholder litigation matters. These non-recurring items were coupled with decreases in compensation and other employee related expenses as a result of the restructuring initiatives that began during the first quarter of 2023, and lower marketing, professional services and legal expenses.

REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company manages the business with a focus on three operating segments: (1) a Commercial Products segment consisting of NARCAN® Nasal Spray and KLOXXADO® Nasal Spray, which product is currently being integrated into our distribution network, NARCANDirect®; (2) a MCM Products segment consisting of Anthrax - MCM, Smallpox - MCM and Other products and (3) a services segment consisting of our Bioservices offerings (“Services”). Commercial Products and MCM Products are our two reportable segments. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company’s determined that its Services operating segment no longer meets the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and did not meet the aggregation criteria set forth in Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and as such is categorized within “All other revenues” along with “Contracts and Grants”. The Company evaluates the performance of these reportable segments based on revenues and segment adjusted gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Segment revenue includes external customer sales, but does not include inter-segment services. The Company does not allocate contracts and grants revenue, R&D, SG&A, amortization of intangible assets, interest and other income (expense) or taxes to its evaluation of the performance of these segments.

Cost of MCM product sales decreased $15.9 million, or 29%, to $38.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. The decrease was primarily due to lower production costs of ACAM2000®, BioThrax®, and CNJ-016® (VIGIV), reflecting reduced volumes, combined with favorable manufacturing variances due to lower shut-down and severance costs, partially offset by an increase in costs related to higher BAT® sales volume.

MCM Product gross margin decreased $15.8 million, or 14%, to $97.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. MCM Product gross margin percentage increased 3 percentage points to 68% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Cost of MCM product sales decreased $33.2 million, or 23%, to $114.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The decrease was primarily due to lower productions costs of CYFENDUS®, BioThrax®, and ACAM2000® reflecting reduced volumes, no RSDL® related costs in 2025 due to the sale of RSDL® to SERB in the third quarter of 2024, combined with favorable manufacturing variances mostly due to lower shut-down and severance costs and lower Raxibacumab inventory reserves. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs for Anthrasil®, TEMBEXA®, CNJ-016® (VIGIV) sales due to higher unit volume.

FDA approved the supplemental application for the 4Kscore® Test regarding the availability of digital rectal examination information. In July, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved OPKO’s supplemental application enabling the performance of the 4Kscore® Test without digital rectal examination (DRE) information. The 4Kscore® Test is indicated for the assessment of the likelihood of aggressive prostate cancer in men age 45 and older who have age-specific elevated/abnormal screening PSA results. Two prospective controlled clinical studies (n=937) concluded that the 4Kscore® Test is a reliable (>96% sensitivity and accuracy) blood test to assess the probability of aggressive prostate cancer, before biopsy decisions. In the U.S., over 90% of PSA screening tests are ordered by primary care providers, potential users of the 4Kscore® Test who don’t routinely perform a DRE.

[TITLE]FDA Encourages Cheaper Generics Of Pricey Medications:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump’s top health advisers announced a push to cut health costs by bringing more cutting-edge generic drugs to market in a press conference on Wednesday.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will eliminate bureaucratic hurdles that protect monopolies on biologics, which include many of the world’s priciest drugs, the agency announced.

Biologics, medications sourced from living organisms, represent breakthrough biotechnology, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said. He added that the price tags can reach into the millions for a single course of the therapy and that patients without insurance or high deductibles experiencing sticker shock may never pick up prescriptions or ration doses.

The new actions are aimed at encouraging the development of biosimilars — generic versions of biologic drugs.

[TITLE]PDS Biotech to Seek Expedited Approval Pathway for PDS0101 in HPV16-Positive Head and Neck Cancer:
[TEXT]
Company aims to shorten time frame to make PDS0101 available to patients with HPV16-positive head and neck cancer, projected to be the most dominant type of head and neck cancer in the US by mid 2030s

Proposed Amendment to Ongoing VERSATILE-003 Trial to include PFS Endpoint Based Upon Final VERSATILE-002 Trial Data Showing Robust Median Progression Free Survival of 6.3 months and Increased Median Overall Survival of 39.3 months

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PDS Biotechnology Corporation (Nasdaq: PDSB) (“PDS Biotech” or the “Company”), a late-stage immunotherapy company focused on transforming how the immune system targets and kills cancers, today announced that after recent review of the final VERSATILE-002 data, the Company has requested a meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to explore an expedited approval pathway for PDS0101 in HPV16-positive Head and Neck Cancer. The FDA meeting request is based on the final results from its VERSATILE-002 trial and a proposed amendment to the VERSATILE-003 Phase 3 trial to reduce the number of patients, while maintaining statistical power, and to add progression free survival (PFS) as an earlier primary endpoint in addition to median overall survival (mOS). If the PFS endpoint is met, it would allow for an accelerated approval submission to the FDA. While the Company’s trial amendment is undergoing review by the FDA, the VERSATILE-003 trial will be temporarily paused.

“The final survival results and durable clinical responses from our VERSATILE-002 trial are very exciting. It’s the first time that a trial in the recurrent/metastatic Head and Neck Cancer population has reported a mOS of almost 40 months,” said Frank Bedu-Addo, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of PDS Biotech. “The fact that our Phase 3 study has mOS as its primary endpoint and PFS as a secondary endpoint inherently lengthens the duration of the trial. To shorten the trial duration, we believe a meeting with the FDA to discuss changes to the current trial protocol to include PFS as an earlier primary endpoint independent of mOS is warranted. We look forward to keeping all PDS Biotech stakeholders informed as our discussions with the FDA progress.”

Dr. Kirk Shepard, MD, Chief Medical Officer added, “Based on the increasing incidence of HPV16-positive head and neck cancer, our goal is to seek the fastest and most cost-effective regulatory pathway to approval. Our goal is to be efficient in providing a well-tolerated treatment without chemotherapy as an option for patients who currently have no effective therapies for this deadly disease. Treatment with PDS0101 for currently enrolled patients in our VERSATILE-003 Phase 3 trial will continue during the temporary pause of the trial.”
