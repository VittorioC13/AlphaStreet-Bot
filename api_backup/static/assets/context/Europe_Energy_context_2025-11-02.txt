Despite global momentum and policy support, the SMR revolution faces substantial execution risks, including cost control, supply chain maturity, regulatory bottlenecks, and the need for robust financing structures to ensure timely and on-budget delivery.

Key industry players such as NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy are moving SMRs from conceptual designs to billion-dollar commercial projects, with notable advancements in deployment programs, industrial heat applications, and corporate energy strategies.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are experiencing a significant comeback, driven by their scalability, siting flexibility, and ability to provide carbon-free baseload power, crucial for rising AI energy demands and industrial decarbonization.

After decades of stagnation, nuclear energy is staging a comeback — and it’s no longer the gigawatt-scale reactors of the past leading the charge. Small modular reactors, once dismissed as niche or speculative, have moved to the center of a global energy and geopolitical pivot. Their appeal lies in scalability, siting flexibility, and the promise of dedicated, carbon-free baseload power—a vital ingredient in an era defined by the AI energy demand surge and industrial decarbonization.

The shift from ambitious blueprints to billion-dollar commercial projects is officially underway, driven by key industry announcements throughout 2025. Some of the leading stakeholders include NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy.

NuScale Power: From De-Risking To Gigawatt-Scale Deployment

NuScale Power has cemented its role as the bellwether of the SMR movement, but its commercial success will depend on disciplined financing. In early September 2025, the company announced a landmark collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of its SMR technology within the TVA service region — the largest SMR commitment in U.S. history.

The structure of this deal is as important as its scale. Rather than placing the full “first-of-a-kind” financial and regulatory burden on TVA, ENTRA1 will reportedly finance, own, and operate the facilities, selling power back to TVA through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement. This off-balance-sheet approach could prove pivotal, unlocking institutional investment and moving SMRs from demonstration projects into a bankable, utility-scale asset class.

[TITLE]Deal for Nuclear Reactors Raises Safety Concerns:
[TEXT]
A huge nuclear deal announced by the Trump administration earlier this week provides a multi-billion-dollar incentive for the U.S. government to issue permits and approvals for new Westinghouse reactors—an unprecedented structure that critics say poses environmental and safety risks.

Under the agreement with Westinghouse Electric’s owners, Canada-based Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management, the U.S. government will arrange financing and help secure permits and approvals for $80 billion worth of Westinghouse reactors.

In return, the plan offers the U.S. government a path to a 20% share of future profits and a potential 20% stake in the company if its value surpasses $30 billion by 2029.

The deal is one of the most ambitious plans in U.S. atomic energy in decades, underscoring President Donald Trump’s agenda to maximize energy output to feed booming demand for artificial intelligence data centers.

But the financial incentives risk clouding regulatory scrutiny aimed at preventing nuclear accidents, according to safety advocates and regulatory experts.

“The things that could go wrong are Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima,” said Greg Jaczko, a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, pointing to three of the worst nuclear power accidents on record.

“All have causes tied to insufficient regulatory independence.”

The White House said concerns about safety were unfounded.

“The regulatory regime remains the same and is not compromised. There’s nothing in the deal about regulatory changes,” the White House said in an emailed statement.

Westinghouse owner Cameco declined to comment. Brookfield and Westinghouse did not respond to messages requesting comment.

TD Cowen analysts told clients in a research note this week they expect Westinghouse to have 10 new large-scale reactors—enough gigawatts to power several million homes—under construction by 2030 as a result of the deal.

Typically, it takes around a decade for a new nuclear power plant to get built, largely due to the rigorous permitting requirements and enormous costs and complexities associated with construction.

Patrick White, a nuclear regulatory and technology expert at the Clean Air Task Force, said effective regulation did not need to be a slow or extended process and there were benefits to moving more efficiently.

“Ensuring that nuclear regulation is also timely and predictable is in the best interest of both companies and the public,” White said.

Todd Allen, a nuclear expert at the University of Michigan, said the design of Westinghouse reactors is well established, but questioned how fast projects could progress.

“With that aggressive timeline, and demand for the reactors around the world, I wonder if there is a big enough workforce to handle all of these projects,” Allen said.

DELAYS TO PREVIOUS U.S. PROJECT

Westinghouse’s last U.S.-based nuclear project, building two nuclear reactors at the Vogtle power plant in Georgia, forced the company into bankruptcy protection in 2017.

The two reactors were about seven years behind schedule and cost about $35 billion, more than double the original estimate of $14 billion.

Patty Durand, director of nonprofit Georgians for Affordable Energy, has spent years analyzing that project and said she fears fast permitting would overlook the risks associated with climate change.

She said severe droughts have forced operators to curtail nuclear power in Europe and the United States to avoid overheating their reactors.

Westinghouse also had a slew of problems related to the modular design of its AP1000 reactors, such as some parts’ dimensions being wrong when they arrived on site. The AP1000 would also be used for the new reactors, built from prefabricated parts and assembled on site.

Edwin Lyman, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said he fears the Trump administration will exert too much power over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to get the new reactors permitted.

“If the White House fully takes over the NRC and it is no longer at all independent, then it could be used just as a tool for sweeping deals for which the White House could accelerate licensing on its preferred projects regardless of their actual safety implications, and that’s a dangerous thing,” Lyman said.

[TITLE]Oil Prices Unmoved by Trump-Xi Meeting:
[TEXT]
Significant developments in the energy sector include Gunvor acquiring Lukoil's international assets, Mozambique disputing the budget of a major LNG project, and new oil and gas exploration and production initiatives in Greenland and Colombia.

Geopolitical and economic factors are influencing regional oil markets, with Saudi Arabia expected to cut Asian prices, the US and China temporarily suspending port fees, and India continuing to import Russian crude.

The Trump-Xi meeting did not impact oil markets, with the upcoming OPEC+ meeting expected to be the next major market driver, likely resulting in a modest output increase.

This report provides an overview of global oil and natural gas market trends, including price changes, production data, and geopolitical developments impacting energy.

The Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea, frequently lauded as a potential icebreaker moment between the United States and China, failed to provide any momentum to oil markets as discussions centered more on fentanyl than crude oil or LNG. As such, this weekend’s OPEC+ meeting is the next trend-setting market for the market at large, even if this time around reports all seem to indicate the same outcome - a 137,000 b/d ‘modest’ increase. Thus, ICE Brent could linger around $65 per barrel for slightly longer.

Saudi Arabia Expected to Cut Prices. The combination of higher Middle Eastern exports and a flattening Dubai futures curve will prompt Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) to slash its Asian formula prices to multi-month lows, with analysts predicting a month-over-month cut of $1.00 to $1.50 per barrel.

US, China Temporarily Suspend Port Fees. China’s Commerce Ministry announced that Beijing and Washington have agreed to suspend reciprocal port fees that have buoyed shipping markets in recent months, however the Trump administration is still yet to confirm the one-year suspension.

India Never Stopped Buying Russian. India’s largest refiner Indian Oil bought five cargoes of Russian oil for December arrival from non-sanctioned entities this week, equivalent to a 120,000 b/d supply, saying that the company will continue importing Russian barrels if they are in compliance with sanctions.

Gunvor Mops Up Lukoil Assets. Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil (MCX:LKOH) said it had accepted an offer from global trading house Gunvor to buy its international assets, including Iraq’s giant West Qurna 2 oil field (producing 480,000 b/d) and several refineries across Europe.

Mozambique to Dispute LNG Development. The Mozambique government said it would challenge the updated budget and schedule of TotalEnergies’ (NYSE:TTE) 13 mtpa Mozambique LNG project, following reports that costs had risen by 4.5 billion in the four years that it was stalled due to security concerns.

China’s Teapots Come Back to Life. Improved refinery margins and returning downstream capacity have lifted refinery runs in China’s Shandong region to 71% in October, the highest reading in 2025 so far, however many will be forced to curb throughput as Beijing’s crude import quotas are running out.

Nigeria to Tax Fuel Imports. The Nigerian government has approved a 15% import duty on gasoline and diesel, part of its long-standing plan to boost domestic refining as the shaky performance of the 650,000 b/d Dangote refinery didn’t lead to a full halt in imports, still importing 170,000 b/d of gasoline.

Greenland Oil Drilling, Here We Go. According to US oil services firm Sproule, the gross recoverable resources of Greenland are estimated to be around 13 billion barrels with most of those volumes located in the untapped Jameson Basin in the east of the island, spurring drilling interest for 2026-2027.

Brazil Expands into Colombia’s Gas. Colombia’s state-controlled oil firm Ecopetrol (NYSE:EC) has formed a joint venture with Brazil’s Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) to market natural gas from the offshore Sirius block, holding an estimated 6 Tcf of natural gas and believed to start producing by 2029-2030.

Henry Hub Balloons on Surging LNG Exports. As the Henry Hub gas futures started trading December-delivery contracts, the US gas benchmark surpassed the $4 per MMBtu mark and jumped almost 20% from where the November 2025 contract settled on Wednesday, buoyed by robust feedgas demand.

Qatar Locks In More Indian Demand. QatarEnergy signed a 17-year sales and purchase agreement with India’s Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation to deliver 1 mtpa of liquefied gas, with first deliveries starting in 2026 on a delivered ex-ship basis and pricing believed to be near mid-12% of the Brent slope.

Kuwait Floods Asia with More Crude. Kuwait has sold 3 million barrels of extra crude to Asia after an unplanned outage at its giant 615,000 b/d Al Zour refinery, coming after a fire on October 21, lowered the country’s own oil needs, adding to oversupply concerns in the Asian markets.

Doctor Copper Surges Again. Copper is set to log a third straight monthly gain after hitting an all-time nominal high of $11,200 per metric tonne this Wednesday, only to subside towards the end of the week on a stronger dollar, boosted by hedge funds increasing their long positions to a 8-month high.

[TITLE]Orban Seeks U.S. Exemption for Hungary on Russian Oil Sanctions:
[TEXT]
Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban will seek to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to carve out an exemption for Hungary in the U.S. sanctions against Russia’s top oil firms.

“We have to make the Americans understand this strange situation if we want exceptions to the American sanctions that are hitting Russia,” Orban, a Trump ally and admirer, told Hungarian state radio on Friday, ahead of a visit to Washington D.C. next week for a bilateral meeting with President Trump.

Hungary, whose top officials have remained in contact with Russia’s leadership including Vladimir Putin, has continuously clashed with its fellow EU member states over plans to ditch Russian gas by 2027 and cut off oil supply from Moscow as soon as possible.

However, Orban suffered diplomatic setbacks last week after the U.S. called off a Trump-Putin meeting in Hungary’s capital city Budapest and sanctioned the two biggest Russian oil firms, Rosneft and Lukoil.

Following the U.S. sanctions, the U.S. has increased pressure on Hungary to cut off its reliance on Russian oil imports and vowed to work with Hungarian authorities and neighboring countries to help Budapest wean off Russian supply.

Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. Ambassador to NATO, rejected in a Fox News interview suggestions from Hungarian politicians that the U.S. is giving Hungary a pass to continue importing Russian oil.

“Hungary, unlike many of their neighbors, has not made any plans or made any active steps,” Whitaker told Fox News in an interview.

“So we’re going to continue to work with them and we’re going to work with their neighbors like Croatia, and other countries that can help them wean themselves off,” the Ambassador added.

Orban suggested earlier this week that “The battle is not over yet” over Hungary’s choice of oil supply.

So far, the U.S. appears unfazed by the Hungarian pledges to find a way to work around the American sanctions and Whitaker told Fox News in no unclear terms that the United States expects Hungary to prepare a plan to wean itself off of Russia’s energy supply.

[TITLE]Simply Blue secures investment from Japan’s Kansai Electric to drive offshore wind expansion:
[TEXT]
Hugh Kelly, co-founder and chief executive of Simply Blue Group with Toru Kuwahara, executive vice-president and general manager of global EX division of Kansai Electric Power Company.

Simply Blue Group, a multinational developer of renewable energy projects, has secured strategic investment from the Japanese-owned Kansai Electric Power Company (Kepco), which will facilitate expansion of its large-scale offshore wind projects.

Kepco has signed a share subscription agreement with Simply Blue’s offshore wind development arm, marking its first investment involving management participation in an offshore wind developer. It will acquire a majority stake in Simply Blue Energy Offshore Wind Ltd through its wholly owned subsidiary, KPIC Netherlands BV.

The Cork-headquartered company is engaged in offshore wind projects across Europe and elsewhere, specialising in development from the early stages of project formation.

Simply Blue Group co-founder and chief executive Hugh Kelly said on Friday that Kepco support provided the resources needed to scale operations and advance offshore wind. “Together, we are poised to deliver significant contributions to the clean energy transition.

“This investment will help further the development of our offshore wind portfolio in Ireland, supporting national renewable energy targets and strengthening our clean energy leadership.

“However, continued momentum now depends on timely Government action to unlock the full potential of these projects.”

Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the collaboration would help decarbonisation efforts in Ireland and elsewhere.

“Simply Blue has been a significant international actor in the fast-growing offshore renewable energy sector and this collaboration with Kepco will further bolster its capacity. Together they will help drive the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, in Ireland and further afield,” he added.

Kepco executive vice-president Toru Kuwahara said they were honoured to form a partnership with “a developer possessing a pioneering spirit and extensive expertise in the field of offshore wind power”.

“We aim to further advance offshore wind development for both companies and contribute to achieving a carbon-neutral society,” he said. Their investment reflected the Japanese utility’s long-term vision “to ensure the sustainable, stable supply of clean energy worldwide”.

Through its offshore subsidiary, Simply Blue Energy is developing a significant renewable energy portfolio, including 8 gigawatts (GW) of floating offshore wind and 4GW of fixed-bottom wind projects across multiple markets.

It has two European projects; in Spain through the Iberblue Wind partnership and in Portugal, with the Creoula and Botafogo projects using innovative floating offshore wind technologies to produce zero-carbon electricity. It is also involved in another pipeline development as part of a joint venture in Greece with Archirodon, branded as ArcoBlue.

Through Octopus Energy Generation, it is engaged sustainable fuels project targeted at aviation and marine transport in Nova Scotia, Canada.

[TITLE]The impact of structure adjustment of energy consumption on the structural upgrading of the construction industry:
[TEXT]
Abstract Using spatial Durbin model on panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2022, this article explores the technical effect, price effect, and spatial effect of energy consumption structure on the structure of the construction industry. It is found that structure adjustment of energy consumption (SAEC) has a significant promoting effect on structural upgrading of the construction industry (SUC), exhibiting a negative spillover effect in space. Technology spillovers and research and development (R&D) are also the main channels through which SAEC affects SUC, while the channel effect of energy price effect is not significant. Further research has found that reducing the proportion of coal, oil, and natural gas consumption can promote SUC, with natural gas having the strongest effect. At the regional level, SAEC has a stronger promoting effect on SUC in the central and western regions, but its spatial negative spillover effect is more pronounced in the eastern region; On the temporal level, the promotion effect of SAEC on SUC was stronger from 2008 to 2014, while its spatial negative spillover effect was more pronounced from 2015 to 2022. In addition, with the increase in energy prices and human capital levels, it can further stimulate the promoting effect of SAEC on SUC.

1. Introduction China’s economy has transitioned from high-speed to high-quality growth, making structural upgrading imperative [1,2]. The construction industry, which contributes 7% of GDP and absorbs nearly 30% of national energy use, is simultaneously tasked with alleviating employment pressure and achieving the “dual-carbon” goal [3,4]. Yet the prevailing energy mix—dominated by coal, oil and natural gas—remains carbon-intensive and is widely believed to constrain the sector’s shift toward green, specialized and high-tech production [5,6]. Whether, how and to what extent the structure adjustment of energy consumption (SAEC) drives the structural upgrading of the construction industry (SUC) therefore constitutes a critical but unresolved question. Empirical studies have relied on three main analytical tools: (1) input–output or optimization models to quantify energy-saving potential from industrial restructuring [7,8]. (2) index-decomposition techniques such as LMDI to trace energy-structure effects [9,10]. (3) provincial or national panel data sets drawn from China Energy Statistical Yearbook, China Industrial Economy Statistical Yearbook and China Construction Industry Statistical Yearbook to estimate elasticity or causality between energy variables and industrial performance [11,12]. These works, however, rarely integrate spatial dependence or sector-specific upgrading metrics. Early international evidence indicates that foreign entry can enhance host-country construction market structure [13]. Tian et al. (2017) empirically verified that industrial structure adjustment reduces energy consumption by 19% through factor reallocation, supported by panel data from 30 Chinese provinces [14]. Regarding energy-to-industry causality, Woo (2018) finds that deteriorating energy conditions hinder industrial upgrading in Korea [15], whereas Sajadifar and Mohamadbagheri (2018) establish a long-run nexus between aggregate energy use and industrial structure in fifteen developing economies [16]. Zhu and Shan (2020) further reveal an inverted-U relationship between sectoral energy intensity and output share for heavy, light and knowledge-intensive industries [17]. Collectively, these studies confirm that energy and industry co-evolve, but they stop short of unpacking the mechanisms inside the construction sector. The European Union has mandated through the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive that new buildings adopt renewable energy sources (such as solar energy and geothermal energy) and established a “green building certification system” to promote the transformation of the construction industry from reliance on high-carbon energy to low-carbon energy [18]. The United States provides tax incentives for new energy building projects through the Energy Policy Act, while encouraging cooperation between construction enterprises and energy companies in research and development of low-carbon technologies. Its experience shows that the combination of “policy mandatory measures+market incentives” can effectively accelerate structural upgrading [19]. India has included the new energy utilization rate in the construction industry into the assessment indicators of local governments through the “National Solar Energy Plan” to force high-energy-consuming construction enterprises to transform. However, due to insufficient technical reserves, a “policy implementation gap” has emerged [20]. Brazil, on the other hand, has replaced traditional fossil energy with biomass energy (such as electricity generated from bagasse), reducing the construction industry’s dependence on imported energy. Its model of “local energy+construction industry linkage” has reference value for central and western regions of China [21]. International experience shows that policy effects are closely related to the energy endowments of various countries (such as resource reserves and technical level). China needs to take into account its energy structure characterized by “abundant coal, poor oil, and little gas”, avoid blindly copying the high-subsidy models of Europe and the United States, and instead focus on the combination of differentiated regional policies and independent technological innovation [22]. Government interventions play a critical role in mediating the relationship between energy structure adjustment and industrial upgrading. Existing studies have highlighted that policy tools such as energy quotas, carbon pricing, and green subsidies can accelerate fossil energy substitution [23,24]. For the construction sector specifically, Franco et al. (2021) found that government-mandated green building standards significantly promote the adoption of low-carbon technologies [25], while Lin and Zhou (2021) emphasized that regional industrial policies can mitigate spatial imbalances in structural upgrading [26]. However, few studies have systematically analyzed how these interventions modulate the technical, price, and spatial effects of SAEC on SUC, leaving a critical theoretical gap. Despite these advancements, four critical gaps remain: First, the construction industry, despite its energy intensity, has received scant attention in the energy-structure literature. Second, existing analyses largely ignore spatial spillovers arising from cross-regional factor mobility and asymmetric regulation, precluding a full picture of SAEC impacts. Third, measurement of industrial upgrading remains coarse; few papers adopt firm-level specialization ratios to proxy SUC. Lastly, endogeneity between energy structure and industrial upgrading is seldom addressed, leaving causal inference open to challenge. This paper therefore aims to (1) theorize and empirically test the technical, price and spatial channels through which SAEC affects SUC; (2) apply spatial econometric models to 30-province panel data while controlling for endogeneity via instrumental variables; and (3) examine heterogeneous effects by energy type, region and time period. The findings are expected to inform targeted policies, such as differentiated energy quotas, regional coordination schemes and human-capital initiatives, that simultaneously accelerate the green transformation of energy use and the high-quality upgrading of China’s construction industry. This paper contributes to the journal’s focus on ‘energy transition and industrial high-quality development’ by unpacking the mechanisms through which energy structure adjustment drives the construction industry’s upgrading, with specific attention to policy interventions and spatial coordination—key issues for sustainable development in emerging economies.

2. Theoretical mechanism Energy is both a consumer good and an input factor, running through every aspect of economic operation. Based on the relevant literature mentioned above, this article analyzes the mechanism of SAEC on SUC from three aspects: technical effect, price effect, and spatial effect. 2.1 Technical effect The technical effect of SAEC on SUC depends on the relative size of technical progress effect and technical rebound effect. (1) The technical progress effect. The SAEC will make it difficult for construction enterprises to meet their fossil energy needs, and they will develop, introduce, and use advanced technologies to reduce energy consumption per unit output [27]. As consumers’ income levels continue to rise, their requirements for the quality of the construction industry will also increase. In order to meet consumers’ demand for construction products, construction enterprises will continuously improve their technical level and further promote the technical progress of the entire construction industry. (2) The technical rebound effect. While SAEC drives technical progress (e.g., energy-efficient construction equipment or low-carbon building materials), it may inadvertently weaken incentives for long-term structural upgrading through a rebound mechanism. For example, if construction enterprises adopt energy-saving technologies that reduce fossil energy costs per unit output, they might expand production scales (e.g., increasing the number of high-energy-consuming projects like traditional concrete production) instead of shifting to low-carbon sectors (e.g., prefabricated building systems). This expansion reinforces reliance on existing fossil energy-dependent production models, creating path dependence and offsetting the intended upgrading effect of SAEC. Thus, technical progress induced by SAEC can have countervailing impacts: promoting efficiency in the short term but hindering structural transformation if the rebound effect dominates. 2.2 Price effect Price effect refers to the total impact of changes in fossil energy prices on the energy purchases of enterprises (fossil energy, new energy), including income effect and substitution effect. (1) The income effect. The strengthening of SAEC has limited the fossil resources used in the construction industry for production, resulting in a decrease in the supply of production factors, which will lead to an increase in production costs and a decrease in the actual income level of enterprises. Some construction enterprises will reduce their investment scale or exit the market [28]. It will induce the transfer of factors such as technology, labor, and capital, which is conducive to promoting the SUC. (2) The substitution effect. The changes in the relative prices of fossil fuels and new energy will encourage enterprises to replace fossil fuels with new energy, increase their demand for new energy, and drive the development of the new energy industry. It includes links such as raw material supply, component production, complete machine assembly and manufacturing, and energy utilization and conversion. Among these links, the optimal products that should be developed in the construction industry are derived, such as emerging construction industries and high-tech industries, promoting the SUC. 2.3 Spatial effect The spatial effect refers to the impact of SAEC on the structural changes of the construction industry in adjacent areas, including positive spillover effect and negative spillover effect. (1) The positive spillover effect. Energy consumption assessment is a binding indicator for the development of the national economy. If a certain area strengthens the SAEC, it is highly susceptible to being imitated by neighboring areas. Adjacent regions have obvious advantages in experience learning, factor flow, and industrial coordinated development, which can to some extent weaken the negative impact of SAEC on the construction industry structure and promote the coordinated improvement of the construction industry structure between regions. (2) The negative spillover effect. In reality, the SAEC often exhibits asymmetry among regions, while reducing the proportion of fossil energy consumption increases the production costs of the high-energy consuming construction industry, which naturally shifts towards neighboring regions with relatively loose energy consumption regulations. In contrast, the high-tech construction industry is less affected, making it easier to gain comparative advantages in green development and attract a large amount of production factors (such as material capital and human capital) to flow into the industry [29]. Driven by the cyclic cumulative causal relationship, high-energy consuming construction enterprises and high-tech construction enterprises will flow in opposite directions, leading to significant differentiation in the structure of the construction industry between regions. Fig 1 illustrates the three channels through which SAEC affects SUC. Firstly, technical effect. Driven by SAEC, construction enterprises develop energy-saving technologies (technical progress effect), but may also expand high-energy activities due to reduced costs (technical rebound effect). Secondly, price effect. Changes in energy prices (e.g., fossil fuel price hikes) trigger income effects (shrinking profits for energy-intensive firms) and substitution effects (shifting to new energy and high-tech sectors). Thirdly, spatial effect. SAEC in one region may induce positive spillovers (neighboring regions imitating green practices) or negative spillovers (high-energy firms relocating to regions with lax regulations).

3. Model setting and indicator selection 3.1 Model setting For empirical analysis, this article establishes the benchmark model, as shown in Eq.(1): (1) Where i represents the region, t represents the year, c is a constant term, is corresponding regression coefficient of the SAEC, k is the number of control variables, represents the n-th control variable in year t of the i-th region, is the regression coefficient of the corresponding control variable, represent individual fixed effects, time fixed effects, and random error terms, respectively. Based on Eq.(1), set the following spatial econometric model, as shown in Eq.(2): (2) When , Eq.(2) is the Spatial Lag Model (SLM); When , Eq.(2) is the Eq.(2) is Spatial Error Model (SEM); and when , Eq.(2) is the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM). The specific choice of SLM, SEM, or SDM for analysis needs to be determined based on LR test. In addition, is the spatial weight value between province i and province j. And the spatial weight matrix W used in this article is the economic distance matrix. 3.2 Indicator selection and data sources 3.2.1 Explained variable. The explained variable of this article is structural upgrading of the construction industry (SUC). Construction enterprises can be divided into two types: comprehensive and professional. Comprehensive enterprises mainly refer to construction general contracting enterprises, while professional enterprises refer to enterprises that provide construction production for professional fields, including professional contracting enterprises and labor subcontracting enterprises. The higher the degree of specialization, the more niche markets in the construction market, which can provide various types of construction project engineering and products. At present, the proportion of specialized construction enterprises and comprehensive construction enterprises in China is imbalanced. The number of specialized enterprises is small and not specialized, and the number of comprehensive enterprises is many but not strong, leading to excessive competition in the construction market and hindering the improvement of production efficiency and technological level in the construction industry. Therefore, in order to achieve the SUC, it is necessary to vigorously develop professional construction enterprises and increase their proportion in the entire construction market. This article uses the proportion of professional construction enterprises to the total number of construction enterprises to measure the SUC. The calculation formula is as Eq.(3): (3) Where P represents the number of professional contracting units, and T represents the sum of professional contracting and general contracting units. 3.2.2 Core explanatory variable. The core explanatory variable of this article is structure adjustment of energy consumption (SAEC). Reducing the proportion of fossil energy consumption while ensuring stable energy supply is an important measure to achieve the “dual carbon” goal. This article takes the change rate of total regional energy consumption (including fossil energy and new energy such as electricity) as a reference object, obtains the actual change rate of fossil energy consumption (including coal, oil, and natural gas) in a certain region, and calculates SAEC. The specific formula is as Eq.(4): (4) Where represents the change rate of total energy consumption in province i in year t, and represents the change rate of fossil energy consumption in province i in year t. If , it represents a decrease in the proportion of fossil energy consumption in year t and an improvement in the energy consumption structure; If , it represents that the proportion of fossil energy consumption remains unchanged in year t; If , it represents an increase in the proportion of fossil energy consumption in year t and a deterioration in the energy consumption structure. 3.2.3 Control variable. (1) Foreign direct investment (fdi): Measured by industrial foreign direct investment. (2) Energy price (ep): Measured by purchasing price indicators for industrial producers of fuel and power. (3) Investment scale (is): Investment scale is one of the important factors affecting the SUC, especially the scale of fixed assets investment. This paper uses the proportion of fixed assets investment in GDP to measure it. (4) Human capital (hc): Based on the perspective of education investment, this article regards human capital as the result of education investment and uses education funds to measure it. (5) Technology R&D investment (tri): Measured by the annual R&D investment of domestic enterprises. The relevant data in this article are all from the “China Statistical Yearbook”, “China Industrial Economy Statistical Yearbook”, “China Energy Statistical Yearbook”, and “China Construction Industry Statistical Yearbook” from 2008 to 2022. The research object is 30 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) in China, but due to data limitations, it does not include the Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. The descriptive statistics of the data are shown in Table 1. PPT PowerPoint slide

5. Conclusion and policy implications This article explains the theoretical mechanism of SAEC on SUC from three aspects (technical effect, price effect, and spatial effect), and then conducts empirical testing. The research results indicate that: At the national level, SAEC has a significant promoting effect on SUC, and after endogeneity analysis using instrumental variable method, the promoting effect remains robust. In terms of spatial effects, SAEC has a significant negative spillover effect on SUC, and SAEC also has an impact on SUC through technology spillover and technology R&D, but the mechanism of price effect is not obvious. Further research has found that reducing the proportion of coal, oil, and natural gas consumption can promote SUC, with natural gas having the strongest effect, while increasing the proportion of new energy consumption has a weak promoting effect on SUC. At the regional level, SAEC has a stronger promoting effect on SUC in the central and western regions, but its spatial negative spillover effect is more pronounced in the eastern region. At the time level, it shows a decreasing trend in marginal effects. From 2008 to 2014, SAEC had a stronger promoting effect on SUC, while its spatial negative spillover effect was more pronounced in 2015–2022. In addition, optimizing the external environment such as human capital levels and energy prices will further enhance the promoting effect of SAEC. Based on the research conclusions of this article, the following policy implications can be obtained: (1) Promote the continuous optimization of energy consumption structure. Firstly, continuously develop and utilize new energy sources, such as increasing the proportion of solar power generation, promoting the use of biological intelligence, and supporting the development of new energy vehicles. Secondly, curb high carbon energy consumption and improve the competitiveness of cleaner energy. Finally, the focus is on strengthening the management of natural gas consumption. China’s energy endowment is characterized by “rich coal, poor oil, and little gas”, and its natural gas reserves are insufficient. The reduction in the proportion of natural gas consumption can help promote the SUC. (2) Construct a coordinated development pattern for the regional construction industry. Pay attention to the interactive mechanism of the construction industry at the spatial level, especially in the eastern region. Promote the formulation of industrial coordinated development plans between regions with close geographical locations and similar resource endowments, so as to leverage the radiation and drive of high-level areas of the construction industry to low-level areas. For the central and western regions, the structural level of their construction industry is relatively low. It should leverage their comparative advantages such as low production factor costs, actively undertake industrial transfer and introduce advanced technologies, promoting SUC. (3) Promote the coordination of energy policies with the construction industry structure. The dependence on fossil fuels in the eastern region is relatively weak, and in the future, efforts should continue to increase the optimization of energy consumption structure in the eastern region to improve the marginal effect of SAEC on SUC. For the western region, the sufficient supply of new energy leads to significant consumption pressure. Therefore, it is necessary to moderately promote the transfer of energy intensive construction industry in the eastern region to the central and western regions, achieve spatial coupling of new energy supply and demand. At the same time, it should actively guide and encourage the agglomeration and development of high-tech construction industry in the upstream and downstream of new energy, and use the demand effect of new energy to drive the SUC. (4) Integration of international experience and localized adaptation. Formulate regional mandatory standards for the utilization rate of new energy in the construction industry (e.g., 30% in eastern regions by 2025 and 20% in central and western regions by 2030), and provide carbon emission rights trading quota rewards to enterprises that overfulfill the targets. Incorporate energy structure adjustment into the “assessment of high-quality development of the construction industry” for local governments, while adding “technical assistance” clauses, such as the transfer of new energy building technologies from eastern regions to central and western regions. Introduce Germany’s energy-saving technologies for prefabricated buildings and Denmark’s experience in wind energy application in buildings, and at the same time export China’s low-cost solutions for building-integrated photovoltaics to form two-way technological spillover. Connect with the “Building Decarbonization Alliance” under the Paris Agreement, and incorporate China’s experience in regional heterogeneity into the international policy reference framework. In addition, China needs to balance multiple new energy sources such as solar energy, wind energy, and biomass energy to avoid structural vulnerability caused by over-reliance on a single energy source. Under China’s “dual carbon” goals, a dual control system has been implemented for both the total amount and intensity of energy consumption. Local governments exercise mandatory quota management over fossil energy consumption. This top-down policy-driven model differs from the market-oriented energy regulatory systems in Europe and the United States, which may have strengthened the forcing effect of energy consumption structure adjustment on industrial upgrading. China’s construction industry features a distinct “government-led” development model, where large-scale projects rely on government investment, and there are strong administrative interventions in areas such as industry access and qualification management. In addition, the long-term low proportion of professional enterprises in China’s construction industry leads to a significant difference in market structure compared with developed countries (e.g., Singapore, the United Kingdom). This may make the role of energy structure adjustment in promoting professional upgrading more prominent. The research conclusions of this paper are of high reference value for transition economies (e.g., India, Brazil), as they face similar pressures of fossil energy dependence and industrial upgrading. However, for developed countries with a high degree of energy marketization and mature construction industries, policy implications need to be adjusted in combination with their market mechanisms. However, this article also have some limitation. Firstly, the measurement of human capital in this study relies on education investment, which may not fully capture the actual skill levels of the construction workforce. Factors such as on-the-job training, technical certifications, and practical experience—key indicators of workforce quality in the construction industry—are not included, potentially weakening the precision of the human capital channel analysis. Future research could integrate micro-level data on worker skills (e.g., vocational qualification statistics) to improve measurement accuracy. Secondly, although the afc satisfies the exogeneity and correlation conditions for an instrumental variable, it has a limitations: the afc is closely related to regional topography and climate (e.g., wind speed, terrain relief), which may vary significantly across countries. Its validity as an instrument is primarily applicable to China’s provincial panel data, limiting the generalizability of findings to other regions with different geographical characteristics.

[TITLE]AI Energy Crunch: Hyperscalers Turn to Small Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Despite global momentum and policy support, the SMR revolution faces substantial execution risks, including cost control, supply chain maturity, regulatory bottlenecks, and the need for robust financing structures to ensure timely and on-budget delivery.

Key industry players such as NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy are moving SMRs from conceptual designs to billion-dollar commercial projects, with notable advancements in deployment programs, industrial heat applications, and corporate energy strategies.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are experiencing a significant comeback, driven by their scalability, siting flexibility, and ability to provide carbon-free baseload power, crucial for rising AI energy demands and industrial decarbonization.

After decades of stagnation, nuclear energy is staging a comeback — and it’s no longer the gigawatt-scale reactors of the past leading the charge. Small modular reactors, once dismissed as niche or speculative, have moved to the center of a global energy and geopolitical pivot. Their appeal lies in scalability, siting flexibility, and the promise of dedicated, carbon-free baseload power—a vital ingredient in an era defined by the AI energy demand surge and industrial decarbonization.

The shift from ambitious blueprints to billion-dollar commercial projects is officially underway, driven by key industry announcements throughout 2025. Some of the leading stakeholders include NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy.

NuScale Power: From De-Risking To Gigawatt-Scale Deployment

NuScale Power has cemented its role as the bellwether of the SMR movement, but its commercial success will depend on disciplined financing. In early September 2025, the company announced a landmark collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of its SMR technology within the TVA service region — the largest SMR commitment in U.S. history.

The structure of this deal is as important as its scale. Rather than placing the full “first-of-a-kind” financial and regulatory burden on TVA, ENTRA1 will reportedly finance, own, and operate the facilities, selling power back to TVA through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement. This off-balance-sheet approach could prove pivotal, unlocking institutional investment and moving SMRs from demonstration projects into a bankable, utility-scale asset class.

[TITLE]$110 Billion Hydrogen Boom Meets Bureaucratic Bottlenecks in Europe:
[TEXT]
The global hydrogen industry came into view, specifically from importing countries’ perspective, at European Hydrogen Week earlier this month in Brussels.

There was a palpable sense of frustration with what many consider an overbearing regulatory framework causing delays. But also a sense of inevitability, with hydrogen mandates in place and pipeline construction now underway. Europe is set to be the world’s largest demand center for low-carbon hydrogen.

There was also a sense of determination in the face of a growing number of project cancelations.

“The tourists are gone,” said Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, CEO, Hydrogen Europe, an industry group based in Brussels. As weaker projects have fallen by the wayside, he emphasized the need for realism with policies such as mandatory minimum offtake requirements for large industries.

Hydrogen, he said, is now at a crossroads and there is a need to relax regulations to allow the clean hydrogen market to take shape.

Projects and progress

Progress on a few big projects was highlighted, such as the recent offtake agreement between the German energy company RWE AG and the French oil major TotalEnergies. Some 30,000 metric tons green hydrogen, produced at RWE's 300-megawatt electrolysis plant in Lingen, will move annually by pipeline 600km to Total’s refinery in Saxony-Anhalt beginning in 2030.

Progress was also reported at Port of Rotterdam, where Shell is building electrolyzer capacity of 200 MW to produce some 22,000 metric tons green hydrogen annually. This will move from the production site on Maasvlakte

[TITLE]Southern inks 7 GW of large load contracts, eyes 50 GW more:
[TEXT]
By the numbers: Southern Co. Q3 2025 50 GW Across multiple utility service territories and 10 years, Southern Co. says it has a pipeline of more than 50 GW of possible large load additions. 12% annual sales growth Southern sees electric sales rising 8% across its service territories, but most notably in Georgia Power’s footprint where it predicts double-digit growth through 2029. 10 GW New resources Southern expects to need in Georgia. It is proposing five gas combined cycle units and 11 battery energy storage facilities to meet the need.

Southern Co., which serves 9 million energy customers across the Southeast, has a pipeline of more than 50 GW of new large load additions within the next decade, officials said Thursday during the company’s third quarter earnings call.

“Over the last two months, we have [signed] four contracts with large load customers in Georgia and Alabama, representing over 2 GW of demand,” said Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO

The utility company is requiring “strong customer protections and credit provisions” to protect against rate increases to serve the new loads, said Chief Financial Officer David Poroch. “Our pipeline of large load data centers and manufacturers continues to be robust across our electric subsidiaries. The total pipeline remains more than 50 GW of potential incremental load by mid 2030s.”

Southern’s subsidiaries include Georgia Power, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power. The utility company on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings of $1.7 billion, or $1.55/share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $1.40/share, in the same period last year.

The company saw sales growth “across all customer classes” in the third quarter, officials said. There were 12,000 new residential customers, “well above historical trends,” and data center usage was up 17% relative to the same period last year, according to an earnings presentation. Higher industrial usage was led by growth in the primary metals and electronics sectors.

“In the third quarter alone, the commercial sector grew 3.5% on a weather-normal basis compared to the third quarter of 2024,” Poroch said. “This growth was driven partially by increased sales to existing and new customer and new data centers.”

Economic development activity across Southern’s footprint “remains robust,” Poroch said, with 22 companies making announcements “to either establish or expand operations in our service territories during the third quarter.”

“Projects within our pipeline are maturing into executed contracts,” Poroch said, which “solidifies a substantial portion of our total forecasted electric sales growth.” Southern sees sales growing 8% annually through 2029, including average annual growth at Georgia Power of 12% through the same period.

“Across Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, we now have contracts in place with large load customers representing 7 GW through 2029,” Poroch said. That ramps to 8 GW in the 2030s “and we are in advanced discussions for several more gigawatts of load,” he said.

The 8 GW of contracts is a 2 GW increase over the prior quarter, officials said. “Contracts cover incremental costs with pricing and terms designed to benefit [and] protect existing customers,” the earnings presentation noted.

To meet the load, Southern utilities are looking to add generation resources. Womack said that within the last month, as a part of Georgia Power's ongoing request for proposals certification proceedings, the utility filed an update to its load forecast projecting capacity needs aligned with the 10 GW of capacity resources being requested, including five gas combined cycle units and 11 battery energy storage facilities.

“These proceedings are scheduled to have a final determination by the commission by the end of this year,” Womack said. Separately, Alabama Power has completed the acquisition of a 900-MW gas generating facility to serve projected long term capacity needs.

“In addition, construction continues on approximately 2.5 GW in both Georgia and Alabama, which includes three natural gas combustion turbines and battery storage facilities, all of which are projected to go online over the next two years,” he said.
