[TITLE]Bakkt and ICE Strengthen Long-Term Alignment Through Board Transition:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bakkt Holdings, Inc. (“Bakkt” or the “Company”) (NYSE:BKKT) announced today that David Clifton, an ICE executive and a founding member of Bakkt’s Board, has stepped down from his position on the Company’s Board, following years of service in establishing and guiding the Company’s foundation.

Jeff Sprecher, Founder, Chair and CEO of ICE, commented, “ICE’s support for Bakkt has never been stronger. Under Akshay Naheta’s leadership and with Bakkt’s proven regulatory and technological foundation, we believe Bakkt is well-positioned for long-term success.”

In addition to his role on the Board, Mr. Clifton also served as interim CEO of the Company in 2020, prior to its initial public offering. Under the terms of the IPO, ICE retained the right to designate one member of the Company’s Board for two years after the IPO, and designated Mr. Clifton for that position; however, Mr. Clifton served an additional two years to help build the business. The Company believes that the timing of this transition is appropriate: ICE remains a major shareholder fully aligned with Bakkt’s success, while Bakkt continues with an increasingly independent board and a new leadership team.

Akshay Naheta, Bakkt’s CEO, stated, “We are grateful to David Clifton for his instrumental role in Bakkt’s journey from inception. We also value ICE’s enduring support as we approach the completion of our transformation this year and prepare to enter Bakkt’s next phase of growth starting in 2026.”

Mr. Clifton said, “Bakkt was built to operate with the rigor and independence expected of a public company, and this transition reflects that maturity. I’m proud to have been a part of a business that continues to evolve under Akshay’s leadership and a strong, independent board.”

[TITLE]French consumer watchdog reports Shein over childlike sex doll:
[TEXT]
Back in May, the European Commission and consumer protection authorities had also notified the platform of alleged violations of consumer protection law, including fake discounts and misleading sustainability claims. EU Justice Commissioner Michael McGrath later said he was determined to crack down on the sale of goods on Temu and Shein that do not comply with EU regulations.

"As a reminder, the distribution of child pornography via an electronic communications network is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine of €100,000," the French DGCCRF said in Saturday's statement. The agency also reached out to the French platform regulator Arcom, which is responsible for regulating companies such as Shein.

The platform was ordered to take appropriate measures swiftly. Shein told Agence France-Presse the items have been removed from the platform and an investigation was launched to find out how the sellers managed to circumvent the control processes.

The DGCCRF also reported to the prosecutor and Arcom that pornographic content such as adult-looking sex dolls is available without filtering measures to restrict access to minors, which is also against French law.

Shein is especially controversial in France: The most recent incident is the platform's arrival at the flagship department store BHV in Paris, which sparked outrage among suppliers.

Market Introduction

Pet perfume is a grooming product formulated to neutralize unpleasant odors and leave a mild, pleasant fragrance on pets. It is designed to enhance cleanliness between baths and contribute to a fresh-smelling coat. Pet perfumes are commonly used by pet owners, groomers, and veterinary professionals as part of routine grooming practices.

Formulated using water-based or alcohol-free solutions, pet perfumes often incorporate natural or synthetic fragrances along with skin-friendly ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, or oatmeal extract. These components help maintain coat hygiene without causing irritation. Beyond masking odors, pet perfume may offer additional benefits like calming effects or flea-repelling properties, depending on the formulation. Safe when used as directed, it supports overall grooming by improving both hygiene and pet-owner interaction.

Market Growth & Opportunities Factors:

The rise in demand for natural and organic pet products has reshaped formulation strategies in the global pet perfume market. Consumers increasingly seek grooming solutions that exclude synthetic fragrances, alcohol, parabens, and sulfate. Manufacturers are responding by using organic floral waters, plant-based essential oils, and non-toxic emulsifiers. Health-conscious consumers and urban households are accelerating the shift toward clean-label and safe pet fragrances, aligning with larger wellness and sustainability trends in the pet care industry. Transparency in ingredients and a focus on skin sensitivity have contributed to stronger market uptake, especially in developed regions.

In addition, organic pet perfumes have gained higher visibility across retail shelves and online platforms due to growing interest in hypoallergenic and eco-conscious options. Branding now highlights cruelty-free claims, biodegradable formulas, and responsibly sourced inputs. Demand in North America and Europe remains strong due to premium pet spending and regulatory support for safe grooming solutions. Brands are increasingly offering alcohol-free and skin-soothing fragrances with clearly labeled compositions, helping consumers identify and trust product safety, further strengthening their presence in the premium segment of the market.

Simultaneously, innovations in long-lasting and multifunctional pet perfumes are influencing buying preferences. Microencapsulation technologies offer extended scent duration, while added functionalities such as antibacterial action or coat detangling improve product value. Spray-on perfumes with dual calming and grooming benefits are gaining traction among time-constrained consumers. Specialty stores and veterinary clinics in markets such as Japan, the U.S., and Germany report higher demand for such solutions. Expansion of organized pet retail formats, featuring in-store testers and post-grooming product demonstrations, has improved trial and repeat purchases. Retailers offer brand exclusives and loyalty programs, encouraging regular buying. In developing markets, increasing access to structured pet retail is educating consumers and strengthening interest in pet perfumes, supporting global pet perfume market growth.

Major Challenges in Industry & Solutions:

Skin allergies and reactions in pets have created skepticism around pet perfumes, especially among owners of sensitive breeds such as Bulldogs and Persian cats. Concerns over artificial additives, alcohol, and essential oils have led to reports of rashes and inflammation, deterring trial purchases. Limited dermatological testing and lack of regulatory uniformity further undermine consumer confidence and market expansion.

However, pet perfume manufacturers can address allergy concerns by investing in clinical dermatological testing and securing hypoallergenic certifications from recognized veterinary boards. Formulating products with minimal, transparent ingredients and excluding alcohol, parabens, and known irritants can reduce adverse reactions. Marketing products with veterinarian endorsements, breed-specific suitability, and allergy-tested claims helps reassure pet owners. Expanding fragrance-free variants or sensitive skin formulas further attracts cautious consumers while aligning with growing demand for safe grooming options.

In addition, organic pet perfumes, lacking synthetic preservatives, often degrade due to light, temperature, and microbial exposure. This short shelf-life complicates storage and inventory, especially for long supply chains and e-commerce. Consumers experience reduced product performance, such as scent loss or spoilage, which leads to distrust and low repurchase rates. Retailers avoid stocking fragile products, hindering wide distribution and market growth for natural formulations.

To address this restraint, brands can extend shelf-life by using natural preservatives like potassium sorbate, grapefruit seed extract, or fermented radish root filtrate that comply with organic standards. Airless pump packaging, amber glass bottles, and cold-chain logistics improve stability during storage and shipping. Educating retailers and consumers

Target's merchants and designers have drawn inspiration from traveling to rodeos, ski lodges and college campuses. Some of the retailer's fall accessories have western accents, such as purses with fringe and cowgirl-inspired hats. Melissa Repko | CNBC

MINNEAPOLIS — When shoppers browse Target 's aisles this fall, they will see purses with fringe accents, dresses made of suede-inspired fabrics and hats with a cowgirl flair. As winter comes, they'll find cozy sweaters with a ski lodge spin. Target's creative team has traveled the world to find inspiration for its brands, from a rodeo in Colorado to ski lodges in the French Alps and restaurants in New York's Hudson Valley. With global trips, an artificial intelligence-powered tool and sharper critiques of its own merchandise, the big-box retailer wants to get back to its roots: designing attention-grabbing, fashion-forward clothing and home decor at an affordable price. Target's merchandise was once a competitive advantage, but even the company admits it has lost that edge. The big-box retailer's sales have declined in some categories that it's best known for, such as home goods, as competitors lure away customers. As consumers' enthusiasm for Target's offerings has faded, annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and the company expects sales to decline this year. Shares of Target have tumbled

[TITLE]Princes Group unveils London listing in major vote of confidence in UK economy:
[TEXT]
Princes Group - leading manufacturer known for producing tinned tuna and Napolina tomatoes - lists on London Stock Exchange in major vote of confidence in UK’s capital markets.

The IPO will help drive growth and investment in key sectors – reflecting the Government’s modern Industrial Strategy and Plan for Change.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle calls Princes Group a ‘Great British success story’ and calls for more firms to follow in their footsteps.

In a major vote of confidence in UK capital markets, Princes Group has listed today on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in a move that cements the City’s position as a leading hub for global capital.

Today, Business Secretary Peter Kyle joined Princes Group at the LSE for its market debut, where he delivered a speech and championed the long-established company as a “great British success story”.

The listing on the LSE of the manufacturer of some of Britain’s best loved brands is a boost for the government’s modern Industrial Strategy and will help leverage further investment into the UK, in particular the food and drink and advanced manufacturing sectors.

The news builds on Make UK and RSM UK’s positive findings this week that more than a third of manufacturing firms will accelerate investment projects as a direct result of the government’s modern Industrial Strategy.

London is making a strong comeback following the government’s capital market reforms, which includes modernising UK listing rules to provide firms more flexibility to raise capital, reforming the rulebook for wholesale markets to improve liquidity for UK listed companies, as well as cutting paperwork and making it easier for companies to raise larger sums.

It follows a trend of more companies turning to the City to list and raise capital, including Shawbrook, Metlen, Fermi and The Beauty Tech Group - and more expected to follow.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

The London Stock Exchange is a renowned global trading hub and the Princes Group is a great British success story. The firm’s decision to list is not only a huge vote of confidence in this Government’s reforms to capital markets but in British business. With the FTSE 100 continuing to trade close to all-time highs, we’re making sure the UK is the best place in the world for businesses to start, scale, list and stay. I want this to just be the start – with more firms following in their footsteps and choosing London as the financial home for their thriving futures.

Angelo Mastrolia, Executive Chair of Princes Group said:

Choosing to list in London is a natural step for Princes group. Around 70% of our revenues come from the UK, which remains our largest and most dynamic market. London offers deep liquidity, a world-class regulatory environment, and access to a broad international investor base, making it the ideal home for our next stage of growth.

London remains the first listing choice for UK and international companies, with 91% of UK-incorporated public company IPOs listing in the UK between 2017–2022. London is also a leading hub for global capital and the largest equity capital market in Europe, consistently ranking among the world’s top exchanges and outperforming all other European centres every year for the past two decades.

With thousands of employees working at Princes Group facilities across the UK, including its HQ at the iconic Royal Liver Building in Liverpool, today’s announcement delivers a significant boost for the workforce and reinforces support for local communities and future growth.

Since entering office, the government has been focused on restoring economic stability and encouraging British businesses to grow and expand to reach their full potential, backing the Plan for Change.

[TITLE]Business mogul Ben Mallah claims he's earned ‘infinite returns’ on American real estate — here's the method he uses:
[TEXT]
Mallah described a strategy where, once a property’s value has increased, you “get your money back” through refinancing. By pulling out his original investment, Mallah is no longer out-of-pocket on the property, yet it continues to generate rental income.

“Infinite,” both Mallah and Stephan replied. Let’s take a closer look at the math behind this claim.

Mallah emphasized how this approach transforms his returns. “The ultimate goal to me, has always been in real estate is, you buy something, you improve it — now it's worth more money, then you get your money back. So now I have nothing invested in my property, but I still cash flow. What kind of return is that?” he asked.

This is a real estate investment strategy more commonly known as the BRRRR method, where BRRRR stands for buy, rehab, rent, refinance and repeat.

Refinancing a property involves replacing the existing mortgage with a new loan. If the property has appreciated in value, an investor can often take out a larger loan based on the higher current value. For example, in a cash-out refinance, an investor takes out a larger loan, uses it to pay off the old mortgage, and receives the remaining balance as cash. Since the proceeds from a refinance are technically a loan rather than income, they’re generally not subject to taxes. This strategy allows investors to tap into the property’s equity while still retaining ownership and cash flow.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP

Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how

“Every time I had a property, I improved it and I went and I increased the value in it, I would refinance it … because that's a non-taxable event — pull my money out of it and still cash flow,” he explained.

During an appearance on “The Iced Coffee Hour” podcast with Graham Stephan and Jack Selby, Mallah shared his preferred wealth-building strategy in real estate.

Real estate has long been known for generating significant returns, helping investors build wealth steadily over time. However, according to real estate mogul and YouTube personality Ben Mallah, the potential gains can far exceed even the most ambitious expectations.

Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.

Story Continues

In simple terms, Mallah argues that by removing his initial investment through refinancing, his personal capital in the property effectively becomes zero. If you calculate the return by dividing the property’s cash flow by the remaining personal investment (now zero), the result could be infinite.

To be clear, when you divide a number by zero, it’s undefined. And while dividing a positive number by something approaching zero can result in a value approaching positive infinity, “infinite return” here is more of a conceptual term. It reflects that he continues to generate cash flow with no initial investment capital remaining at risk, but from an accounting perspective, the initial investment isn’t truly erased — it’s just been recouped. And for accounting, the return would be calculated based on the full cycle of the cash flows and capital involved, making the “infinite” concept more motivational than strictly accurate.

There are potential pros of the BRRRR method, like the wealth building opportunities, but there are several pitfalls and risks investors should be aware of. Chase Bank mentions high starting costs, the difficulty of finding properties that have potential for renovation and adequate rental income, the possibility of investing in property that won’t appreciate in value or gain tenants and the significant commitment required for renovating and managing rental properties.

“The BRRRR method isn’t for everyone. BRRRR investors need to devote time to identifying worthwhile properties, rehabbing them, and then serving as a landlord for potentially multiple tenants simultaneously. You also need to have knowledge and experience in real estate and a keen eye when it comes to renovations. If you fail to miscalculate market value, rehab costs, or failure to secure tenants when you need them, you can take a loss,” says David Greene, a real estate broker writing for BiggerPockets. “If you’re going to BRRRR, we don’t recommend doing it alone. Work with a team of skilled experts who have the time and know-how to make the most of the BRRRR experience.”

Still, Mallah highlighted the power of this strategy: “So now here I am. I'm sitting with all these properties that I refinanced. I got all my money back so I can deploy it in other deals, or whatever, spend it, and I'm still cash flowing, and that's great. I own businesses, real estate, without any money invested.”

[TITLE]Adidas’ Record-Breaking Q3: How Long Can Sales Success Go On?:
[TEXT]
This story was updated at 6.14 p.m. EST.

BERLIN – After just three years in the job, Adidas chief executive Bjorn Gulden has almost achieved the goals of his initial four-year plan — one year ahead of schedule.

When he took on the job in 2023, Adidas was suffering financially because of a canceled collaboration, the very profitable Yeezy line, with the musician formerly known as Kanye West. In 2025, Gulden said he wanted Adidas to be a “healthy company” by 2026.

On Wednesday, the German sportswear giant announced record-breaking results for the third quarter of 2025, with sales revenues growing 12 percent in currency neutral terms to 6.63 billion euros and operating profit increasing 23 percent to 736 million euros.

The sales are the highest Adidas has ever notched up in a quarter and the operating margin for the first nine months of the year is now at 10.1 percent, just slightly above the 10 percent margin Gulden was targeting. The results were in line with market expectations, as Adidas had released preliminary results last week.

The company also raised guidance for the full year. It now expects currency-neutral revenues will increase around 9 percent and operating profit will come in at

[TITLE]Stock Market highlights 29th Oct 2025: Sensex up over 400 points, Nifty tops 26,000 amid foreign fund inflows, global optimism:
[TEXT]
Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group

As mutual fund houses resume investments in Silver ETFs, should investors consider taking a fresh entry?

The lull in silver fund investments by mutual fund houses previously was spurred by supply inadequacies and high premiums on physical silver, now relaxed as global supply chains stabilize. Silver price has also corrected on its peak, creating a healthier entry point for long-term investors. Silver is unique because it can be utilized as a store of value, similar to gold, and it’s also a critical industrial metal that finds applications in semiconductors, electronics, solar panels, and electric vehicles. In the future, the structural demand for silver is set to continue being robust in the face of the global energy transition, increasing renewable capacity, and technological advancement. But investors should keep in mind that silver as a commodity is still a volatile and cyclical asset, which tends to react sharply to changes in global interest rates, inflation expectations, and industrial demand changes. Rather than attempting timing of entries, investors need to invest systematically in order to average out volatility and sharp corrections.

How much allocation to Silver ETFs (as a percentage of the overall portfolio) would be advisable for investors as these units become more accessible?

The entrance of Silver ETFs, thanks to the fund offerings from various Indian AMCs, opened a new avenue for the investors to invest in silver more comfortably. Nonetheless, the investors’ commitment to having a varied portfolio is still vital, as the precious metal generally experiences more volatility and cycles than investments in stocks or bonds. A diversified portfolio is one where silver exposure of 5-10% through ETFs or mutual funds is usually recommended. Given the nature of silver prices being so volatile, it is wise to adhere to SIPs (systematic investment plans) instead of taking all at once. This approach works by outputting the costs of buying and also cutting down on the risk of poor timing. Moreover, it is also important for the investors to keep an eye on the trading of ETFs at premium or discount prices before they invest since these aspects can have a big influence on the returns. All in all, Silver is an investment category that is very much a part of the diversification and inflation-hedging worthiness.

What strategy should existing Silver ETF investors adopt in the current market scenario?

For investors already holding silver, staying patient is crucial in the current market. The long-term fundamentals of the metal remain strong due to its steady structural demand. Silver surged to its historic highs in 2025 before correcting sharply, and while Indian ETF premiums have normalized post-Diwali, supply-demand tightness continues. Since silver’s growth story is still intact, investors should view their investments with a long-term holding perspective rather than responding to short-term corrections. With its widespread use in electronics, solar energy systems, batteries, and semiconductors, the metal is crucial to today’s technologically driven world. The technology evolution and the move to using renewable sources of energy keep the silver demand steady, thus reinforcing its long-term price trend. For investors, opting for a staggered investment strategy over gold/silver ETFs or mutual fund is an excellent way to cope with the volatility and possible corrections after such a steep rally, besides seizing the long-term trend.

Silver ETFs have delivered strong returns so far. As geopolitical tensions ease and supply-demand concerns persist, what is the outlook for silver and silver-backed assets in the near term and long term?

This year, silver has been a very profitable investment, which can be attributed to the strong demand from both industries and investors. Currently, both physical silver and ETFs are experiencing the same supply-demand pressure with demand being the reason for premium trade due to the limitations. Although the trading volumes may be reduced temporarily due to the calming of geopolitical tensions, the fundamentals of the metal are still very strong. Silver is still a key component in the green technologies area, which includes solar panels, EVs, and advanced electronics, so the industrial demand is constant. The prices of silver are backed by the structural demand which the global production cannot meet. The strong demand for this precious metal is a fact that is supported by the market speculations throughout the whole short-term period. Pullbacks in the price of silver should be considered to be the normal phases of a broader uptrend and not a ground for worry by the investors.

The Online Event Ticketing Market is expected to reach US$ 101.44 billion by 2033 from US$ 60.5 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 5.91% from 2025 to 2033.

Key Factors Driving the Online Event Ticketing Market Growth

An increase in musical events: The online event ticketing business, which includes lucrative sales for all music-related events, including concerts, festivals, musicals, music shows, and operas, is dominated by the music events segment. Ticketmaster, a well-known online ticketing company, claims that music has contributed to over 80% of the recent development in GTV. Because of the growth of aspiring artists, music talent shows, and music streaming services for performers, concerts are the main source of income for online ticket sellers.

[TITLE]Primark seizes US opportunity as Trump hits online rivals:
[TEXT]
Primark is accelerating its US store openings and ramping up marketing, betting that President Donald Trump's move to scrap a duty exemption on e-commerce parcels will drive budget-conscious shoppers away from online rivals and back to stores.

Primark trades as Penneys here.

The US administration in May ended "de minimis" duty-free treatment of goods under $800 ordered online from China, hurting online fast-fashion platforms like Shein and Temu that ship directly from Chinese factories to shoppers' doorsteps.

The move forced Shein and Temu to raise US prices and tilted the playing field in favour of retailers like Primark that sell in stores and import in bulk to US warehouses.

While Primark's own prices have also risen due to Trump's broader tariff hikes, it is now more competitive versus online rivals that face duties on their products for the first time.

Primark, the flagship of the London-listed Associated British Foods conglomerate, sells trendy, low-priced clothing through 475 stores in 18 countries, generating nearly £10 billion in annual sales and more than £1 billion in profit - all without offering home delivery.

Primark says shipping to homes does not make financial sense given its low prices and the high fulfilment costs, though shoppers can view its ranges online and Click & Collect is available in some of its markets.

Having built a loyal following in Europe, Primark sees an opportunity to crack the US market, and believes its budget focus can help it succeed where less-differentiated UK retailers like Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Topshop failed. The US currently accounts for
