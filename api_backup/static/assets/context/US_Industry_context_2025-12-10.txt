Bengaluru: Industries Minister M B Patil on Thursday asked officials to draft a document that will support mobile and electronic product manufacturing and design in the state, targeting $150 billion in investments over the coming years.Patil met with high-level delegations led by Pankaj Mohindroo , chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association ICEA ), at his Vidhana Soudha office on Thursday to discuss the initiative."The proposal is still in the draft stage," Patil said in a statement. The government is currently studying the scheme's feasibility and plans to run it parallel to the Central government's electronics components manufacturing scheme announced in April this year.The minister said that the state holds significant potential not only in mobile phone components but also in industrial and strategic electronics. He has instructed officials to study the centre's scheme alongside similar policies that other states have implemented.Mohindroo said that the Union scheme prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment. The programme offers performance-linked incentives and up to 25 percent capital subsidy, with the centre earmarking Rs 22,900 crore for the scheme.He added that the centre has cleared 17 investment proposals worth Rs 7,172 crore until November this year. These projects will create 11,800 direct jobs and generate products valued at over Rs 65,000 crore.Industries department principal secretary S Selvakumar , industries commissioner Gunjan Krishna , and other senior officials attended the meeting.

[TITLE]Karnataka eyes to attract $150 b investment in electronics manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Karnataka is targeting investments worth $150 billion in mobile and electronic product manufacturing and design over the next decade.

Industries Minister MB Patil held discussions on Thursday with a delegation led by Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), to chart a roadmap for the sector.

The Union Ministry of Electronics and IT launched an electronics components manufacturing scheme in April 2024, offering performance-linked incentives and up to 25 per cent capital subsidy.

The Centre has allocated ₹22,900 crore for the program, which prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment.

Pankaj Mohindroo said the Union scheme prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment. He added that the programme offers performance-linked incentives and up to 25 per cent capital subsidy. The Centre has earmarked ₹22,900 crore for the scheme, he said.

Karnataka is also now exploring the possibility of introducing a parallel State-level scheme, noted Patil. “The proposal is still in the draft stage, and we welcome suggestions from ICEA,” Patil said after the meeting.

Till November 2024, the Union Government had approved 17 investment proposals worth ₹7,172 crore under the scheme. These projects are expected to create 11,800 direct jobs and generate products valued at over ₹65,000 crore, said Mohindroo.

The meeting was attended by Industries Department Principal Secretary S Selvakumar, Industries Commissioner Gunjan Krishna, and other senior officials.

[TITLE]India Invests in Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
India Approves $7 Billion Plan to Boost Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing

The Indian government has approved a significant rare earth manufacturing program worth approximately $7 billion (7 billion Rupees). This ambitious initiative, known as the ‘Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Manufacturing Promotion Scheme,’ represents a major step towards establishing a robust domestic rare earth permanent magnet (REPM) production capacity in India.

According to India’s Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the program aims to achieve an integrated annual production capacity of 6,000 metric tons of REPM. These magnets are considered among the most powerful permanent magnets available and are crucial components in various rapidly growing industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defense.

The approved plan will foster the development of integrated manufacturing facilities. These facilities will cover the entire process from converting rare earth oxides into metals, metals into alloys, and finally, alloys into finished rare earth permanent magnets. This integrated approach is expected to streamline production and reduce reliance on external suppliers.

The surge in demand for rare earth materials and rare earth magnets is primarily driven by the rapid expansion of EVs, the renewable energy sector, diverse industrial applications, and increasing consumption of consumer electronics. Currently, India heavily relies on imports to meet its demand. In the fiscal year ending March 2025, the country imported around 53,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets.

Currently, China dominates the market for these essential elements. Recently China has tightened export regulations on these magnets, especially after the US increased tariffs. Rare earth magnets are permanent magnets made from alloys of rare earth elements. Their power makes them indispensable for devices like electric motors, generators, and hard disk drives.

Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, creating a substance with enhanced properties. Rare earth magnets are known for their superior magnetic strength, high coercivity, and strong energy production capabilities. Magnetic strength defines a magnet’s power to attract or repel another magnet. Coercivity is the resistance of a magnet to demagnetization.

Energy product describes the total magnetic energy that a magnet can store. The high magnetic strength of rare earth magnets stems from the large number of unpaired electrons in their alloys, creating an exceptionally powerful magnetic field.

The high coercivity is attributed to the high magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which aligns the magnetic moments of atoms within the magnet strongly in one direction, making it difficult to demagnetize.

The high energy product of rare earth magnets is a result of the combination of their high strength and high coercivity, enabling them to store substantial amounts of energy.

Key Applications of Rare Earth Magnets:

* Electric Motors

* Generators

* Hard Disk Drives

* MRI Machines

* Headphones

* Microphones

* Magnetic Separators

* Magnetic Bearings

* Magnetic Jewelry

This initiative is poised to transform India’s manufacturing landscape, creating new opportunities in the rare earth magnets sector and contributing to the growth of various key industries.
