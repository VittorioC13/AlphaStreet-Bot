[TITLE]Eledon Reports Preliminary Data from First Six Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Treated with Tegoprubart as the Core Immunosuppressant Following Islet Transplantation in Investigator-Initiated Trial at U:
[TEXT]
IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eledon”) (NASDAQ: ELDN) today announced preliminary results from an investigator-initiated trial conducted at the University of Chicago Medicine’s Transplant Institute and presented at the Rachmiel Levine-Arthur Riggs Diabetes Research Symposium, held November 14-17, 2025 at City of Hope in Los Angeles, California.

The ongoing trial, which has been extended to include a total of 12 subjects, is evaluating tegoprubart, Eledon’s investigational anti-CD40 Ligand (anti-CD40L) antibody, as the core of a tacrolimus-free immunosuppression drug regimen for the prevention of islet transplant rejection in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The results, presented by Piotr Witkowski, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Pancreas and Islet Transplant Program at UChicago Medicine, provide updated preliminary data on the first six subjects in the trial, demonstrating the ability of tegoprubart to prevent the rejection of transplanted islet cells in the absence of calcineurin inhibition resulting in sustained insulin-free management of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) in patients with T1D.

All six transplanted subjects demonstrated marked improvements in glycemic control, achieving and maintaining insulin independence after one or two islet transplants, primarily depending on the subjects’ body mass and baseline daily insulin requirements. The first three participants were transplanted over a year ago and have remained insulin-free, including a patient who has maintained stable blood glucose control reflected by an HbA1c as low as 4.7%, for over 15 months without the use of exogenous insulin. Two subsequent subjects transplanted in July 2025 achieved insulin independence within approximately four weeks following a single islet transplantation and have maintained an HbA1c below 6% for over 3 months. A sixth subject, who was transplanted in early August 2025, recently underwent a second islet infusion and is now insulin free with an HbA1c of 5.3%. All six patients have been free of severe hypoglycemic episodes since their transplants. Tegoprubart was generally well tolerated, with no reported serious infections, no thromboembolic or rejection events, and no signs of the kidney or neurological toxicity often observed with traditional calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression.

“For years, clinicians have been working to find a new medication that can prevent rejection of islet cells while offering a better safety profile than calcineurin inhibitors including tacrolimus, which remain the current standard of care but are often associated with debilitating metabolic, neurologic, and cardiovascular toxicities,” said Dr. Witkowski. “These preliminary data in the first six subjects with T1D as part of our UChicago Medicine clinical trial are very encouraging, with all six subjects achieving insulin independence, and suggest that tegoprubart may be the innovative immunosuppression therapy we need to transform islet transplantation in the years ahead.”

“Breakthrough T1D continues to be encouraged by the data from the investigational use of tegoprubart as a novel immunosuppression alternative to advance islet transplantation,” said Esther Latres, Ph.D., Breakthrough T1D Senior Vice President, Research. “We look forward to continuing to support this promising research and to more data on tegoprubart in islet transplants in the future.”

This clinical trial is funded by Breakthrough T1D (formerly JDRF), with initial support from The Cure Alliance. Breakthrough T1D has also committed to fund a second study evaluating tegoprubart as part of a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppression drug regimen to prevent islet transplant rejection in individuals with T1D and chronic kidney disease.

[TITLE]Hemophilia A Research Report 2025-2035: Market Driven by Innovation from Alnylam, Pfizer, Roche, Novo Nordisk, and Takeda as Next-Generation Therapies and Emerging Market Expansion Bolsters Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Hemophilia A Market - A Global and Regional Analysis: Focus on Treatment Type, Country, and Region - Analysis and Forecast, 2025-2035" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global hemophilia A market is highly competitive, with several leading companies driving innovation and market growth, such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Novo Nordisk A/S, Takeda Pharmaceutical.

These companies are at the forefront of developing novel therapies that are significantly improving patient outcomes. Through strategic investments in research and development (R&D), expanding product portfolios, and increasing global access to cutting-edge treatments, these industry leaders are shaping the future of hemophilia A care and contributing to the dynamic growth of the market.

Additionally, expanding into emerging markets and increasing their presence through regional distribution networks are key strategies to tap into underserved patient populations. These strategies are enabling companies to strengthen their market position and accelerate growth in the competitive hemophilia A treatment landscape.

The growth of the hemophilia A market is driven by advancements in treatment options that have significantly improved patient outcomes. Traditionally, factor replacement therapy required frequent infusions, but extended half-life clotting factors have reduced infusion frequency, improving convenience. For patients with inhibitors, non-factor replacement therapies like Emicizumab offer an effective alternative with less frequent dosing. Additionally, gene therapy has emerged as a groundbreaking solution, potentially offering long-term or curative treatment by addressing the genetic defect causing Hemophilia A. These innovations provide more effective, flexible, and long-lasting treatments, enhancing patient care and driving market growth.

Additionally, rising awareness of hemophilia A, coupled with improved diagnostic techniques, has led to earlier detection and more accurate diagnoses. Better awareness among both healthcare providers and the general population has resulted in more individuals being diagnosed at an earlier stage, which is critical for effective management and treatment. Early diagnosis allows for timely interventions, which help prevent complications, such as joint damage and excessive bleeding episodes, and improve overall patient outcomes. This growing recognition of the condition has contributed to a steady increase in demand for specialized therapies, expanding the market further.

Despite these advances, the hemophilia A market faces several challenges. One significant hurdle is the high treatment costs of hemophilia A. While traditional factor replacement therapies have been around for years, new treatments such as extended half-life clotting factors and gene therapies come with a much higher price tag. For instance, gene therapies can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single treatment. Extended half-life products, while reducing the frequency of infusions, are also more expensive than standard therapies. These high costs present a financial burden for both healthcare systems and patients, particularly in regions with limited resources. This pricing issue limits the accessibility of these advanced therapies to many patients, especially those in low- and middle-income countries, where healthcare infrastructure and insurance coverage may be inadequate or lacking.

Another challenge is the regulatory challenges and approval delays. New therapies, particularly gene therapies, face significant regulatory hurdles. Developing and gaining approval for innovative treatments requires long, expensive clinical trials and substantial evidence of safety and efficacy. These trials can take years to complete, slowing the rollout of new therapies. Additionally, regulatory agencies in different regions such as the FDA in the U.S. and EMA in Europe have varying approval processes and timelines, causing delays in making new treatments available globally. These regulatory complexities slow down the global rollout of new therapies, limiting their timely access to patients and hindering market growth.
