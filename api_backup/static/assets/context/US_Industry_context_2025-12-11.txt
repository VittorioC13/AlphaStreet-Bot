[TITLE]Karnataka eyes to attract $150 b investment in electronics manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Karnataka is targeting investments worth $150 billion in mobile and electronic product manufacturing and design over the next decade.

Industries Minister MB Patil held discussions on Thursday with a delegation led by Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), to chart a roadmap for the sector.

The Union Ministry of Electronics and IT launched an electronics components manufacturing scheme in April 2024, offering performance-linked incentives and up to 25 per cent capital subsidy.

The Centre has allocated ₹22,900 crore for the program, which prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment.

Pankaj Mohindroo said the Union scheme prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment. He added that the programme offers performance-linked incentives and up to 25 per cent capital subsidy. The Centre has earmarked ₹22,900 crore for the scheme, he said.

Karnataka is also now exploring the possibility of introducing a parallel State-level scheme, noted Patil. “The proposal is still in the draft stage, and we welcome suggestions from ICEA,” Patil said after the meeting.

Till November 2024, the Union Government had approved 17 investment proposals worth ₹7,172 crore under the scheme. These projects are expected to create 11,800 direct jobs and generate products valued at over ₹65,000 crore, said Mohindroo.

The meeting was attended by Industries Department Principal Secretary S Selvakumar, Industries Commissioner Gunjan Krishna, and other senior officials.

[TITLE]How high does RBC Capital think JB Hi-Fi shares can go?:

How high does RBC Capital think JB Hi-Fi shares can go?

Shares in consumer goods retailer JB Hi-Fi Ltd (ASX: JBH) have come down from levels well above $100 recently, which the team at RBC Capital Markets says creates a buying opportunity.

The shares closed at $113.52 the day before the company's annual general meeting on October 30, when the company also released a trading update which said sales for the first quarter were "in line with the group's expectations".

The market did not appear to like the numbers in the update, however, which showed that comparable sales at JB Hi-Fi Australia were up 5% compared with the same period the previous year, and sales at The Good Guys were up 2.4%.

Performing well on costs

RBC Capital Markets has initiated coverage of JB Hi-Fi with a sector perform rating, and is positive on the company's outlook, saying the company has an "industry-best cost base efficiency".

In terms of competition, however, they are forecasting heavy market share gains for online competitor Amazon.

RBC analysts had this to say about JB Hi-Fi:

JB Hi-Fi runs one of the leanest cost of doing business margins and capex/ sales ratios in global consumer electronics retail. JB Hi-Fi's seamless omnichannel experience is a competitive advantage, in our view. Surveys indicate about 85% of consumers still want to shop in-store to varying extents, and we forecast about 60% – 70% of JB HiFi's sales growth to come from bricks and mortar over the next three years.

In terms of specific products which will provide a boost, the end of support for Windows 10 "is a hard catalyst for a refresh with Microsoft's own support stressing security risks following end-of-support''.

RBC also notes that there is room for further growth in the robot vacuum sector, with penetration being low in Australia and forecasted to grow at a rate of up to 16.2% year over year.

Amazon looms as major competitor

On the downside, Amazon "poses a material and growing competitive threat'', RBC said.

Amazon now has the levers of range, price and fulfilment in place to facilitate a large step-change in market share, in our view. We estimate Amazon's share of total Australian online retail will about double over the next 5 years, to about 24%. Relative to comparable markets, this level of penetration is still low.

RBC stated that, over the Black Friday sales period, Amazon was approximately 2.3% cheaper than JB Hi-Fi on average across the nine categories they surveyed.

RBC has a price target of $101 on JB Hi-Fi shares, compared with the company's closing price of $92.92 on Tuesday.

JB Hi-Fi also pays a fully franked dividend of about 4% according to the ASX website.

Transportation Secretary Duffy Launches “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” Campaign, Announces $1B in Funding to Support Initiative

Posted on by Miami Rebel

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy today launched his “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” campaign ahead of a busy holiday travel season. The goal of the campaign is to address a common refrain from the public – it can be challenging to travel as a family. From needing more dedicated spaces for young children and exercise equipment, to finding places for mothers to nurse their children, to staying fit on the go, or struggling to find more healthy food options, the Trump Administration is committed to making every stage of the travel journey more seamless.

To improve families’ experiences in airport terminals, Secretary Duffy announced $1 billion in funding to incentivize more family-friendly resources in airport terminals. This can include:

Creating more children’s play areas or exercise areas Adding mothers’ rooms or nursing pods Reconfiguring security checkpoints to create family screening lanes Building sensory rooms for children with special needs Other creative terminal projects that focus on enhancing the family travel journey As part of the campaign launch, Secretary Duffy was joined by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Paul Saladino, a double board-certified Physician Nutrition Specialist, Isabel Brown, a content creator and young mom, and Luke Saunders, the CEO and Founder of Farmer’s Fridge.

In addition to the federal funding USDOT is providing to enhance physical infrastructure, the group also emphasized the administration’s interest in collaborating with airports and private sector partners to improve access to nutritional food options.
