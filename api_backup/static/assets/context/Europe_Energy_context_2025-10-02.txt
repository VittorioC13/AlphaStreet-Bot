[TITLE]Nayara Energy Adapts to EU Sanctions With Rupee Oil Payments:
[TEXT]
Nayara Energy, the Indian refiner that was slapped with EU sanctions because of its partial ownership by Rosneft, has started to recover from the blow, turning to payments in rupees for the oil it sources from the Russian company.

Bloomberg reported that Nayara had sought help from the Indian government and was currently working with local banks, including the State Bank of India, to pay for its crude oil purchases in local currency, according to unnamed sources.

Nayara Energy accounts for some 8% of India’s total refining capacity. It operates a 400,000-bpd refinery in Vadinar, which is the second-largest in the country. The facility is 49% owned by Russia’s Rosneft. Currently, the Vadinar facility is operating at 75% of capacity, and the level is rising, one of the Bloomberg sources told the publication.

The European Union included Nayara Energy in its 18th sanction package against Russia, announced in July. The sanctions disrupted the refinery’s operations, stranding tankers carrying fuels produced at the refinery en route to their destinations and prompting cancellations of purchase orders for the facility. That’s despite the fact that Nayara Energy was not really exporting any fuels to the European Union. Its main market in Europe was the UK, which has not adopted special sanctions against the company.

Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco and Iraq’s state oil marketing company SOMO stopped selling crude oil to the Nayara Energy refinery following the approval of the EU’s 18th sanction package. As a result, the refinery has boosted its intake of Russian Urals.

Also as a result of the sanctions, Nayara Energy has increased its focus on the domestic market. The company supplies more than 6,500 fuel stations in India, per Bloomberg, and has started selling more to a fellow refiner, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Nayara Energy has started loading more crude into floating storage and using tankers under Western sanctions to export its fuels.

[TITLE]US ‘ready to displace’ all Russian gas and oil in EU – energy secretary:
[TEXT]
Moscow has said American LNG would be much more expensive for European consumers

The US stands ready to substitute all Russian gas and oil going to the EU, Energy Secretary Chris Wright has claimed, arguing that market hegemony for America would help end the Ukraine conflict.

In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Wright praised the bloc for its efforts to phase out Russian energy but said it is “not as fast as we’d like.”

“America stands ready today to displace all of the Russian gas that goes into Europe and all of the Russian refined products from oil as well,” Wright said. He added that he had been holding extensive talks with EU leaders to reassure them that this is feasible.

”We’re ready to serve their needs. And President [Donald] Trump’s agenda is peace. And to get peace, we have to starve [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Wright claimed, referring to revenues from energy exports.

The EU has said it will seek to wean itself off Russian energy following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, and plans to end imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) by the end of 2027. Wright, however, said the US could act “much faster” to replace it.

Bloc members Hungary and Slovakia, however, have pushed back against plans to cut energy ties with Russia, citing their heavy reliance on supplies from the country and the fact that their infrastructure is built around receiving Russian energy.

Wright’s push comes as Trump has pressured the EU, India, and China to stop procuring Russian oil, describing the move as an effort to advance a potential Ukraine peace settlement. Moscow has criticized the effort, saying that sovereign nations have the right to choose their trade partners.

Russia has also argued that the EU’s tilt to pricier LNG is hitting consumers. “This has placed an additional burden on [European] budgets and, in turn, on the pockets of their taxpayers,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

[TITLE]Wall Street Rediscovers Oil and Gas:
[TEXT]
Encouraged by the U-turn in the U.S. energy policies under President Trump, investors are back to backing oil and gas majors as the self-righteous ESG hype is waning, especially in corporate America.

For all the environmental, social, and governance craze of the past few years in markets, ESG has done value investors one big favor—it has helped sink the valuations of oil and gas companies to bargain levels, alongside the oil price crash of 2020, of course.

These super-low valuations of Big Oil and other oil and gas firms have encouraged bargain hunters and contrarian investors to continue betting on fossil fuels amid a major market and ideological drive against these.

The Big Pivot

For example, for most of 2020 and 2021, ExxonMobil, the biggest U.S. oil firm by valuation, saw its share price dive to less than the per-share value of all its assets. The price to tangible book value per share slumped to below 1, compared to

[TITLE]Ellomay Capital Reports Results for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2025:
[TEXT]
Tel-Aviv, Israel, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and the USA, today reported its unaudited interim consolidated financial results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025.

Financial Highlights

Total assets as of June 30, 2025 amounted to approximately €729.3 million, compared to total assets as of December 31, 2024 of approximately €677.3 million.

Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025 were approximately €11.3 million, compared to revenues of approximately €11.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025 were approximately €20.1 million, compared to revenues of approximately €19.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Loss for the three months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €8.4 million, compared to profit of approximately €1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Loss for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €1.6 million, compared to loss of approximately €3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €3.2 million, compared to EBITDA of approximately €4.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €6.1 million, compared to EBITDA of approximately €6.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. See below under “Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for additional disclosure concerning EBITDA.

Financial Overview for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2025

Revenues were approximately €20.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €19.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in revenues mainly results from revenues generated from the Company’s 19.8 MW and 18.1 MW Italian solar facilities that were connected to the grid in February-May 2024 and in January 2025, respectively. Such increase was partly offset by lower revenues from one of the Company’s Dutch biogas plants, which experienced a biology-related production issue that affected output in January and April 2025 and by slightly lower revenues from the Talasol facility, which in July 2024 sustained damage due to a fire that has since been repaired and restored to nearly 97% output, though not yet fully recovered.

Operating expenses were approximately €9.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €9.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in operating expenses mainly results from lower costs in connection with the acquisition of feedstock by the Company’s Dutch biogas plants, partially offset by the achievement of preliminary acceptance certificate (PAC) of the Company’s 19.8 MW Italian solar facilities subsequent to June 30, 2024, upon which the Company commenced recording operating expenses of the solar facilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately €8.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Project development costs were approximately €2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in project development costs is mainly due to development expenses in connection with solar projects in the USA and Italy.

General and administrative expenses were approximately €3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in general and administrative expenses is mostly due to higher consultancy expenses.

The Company’s share of profit of equity accounted investee, after elimination of intercompany transactions, was approximately €12 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to share of profits of equity accounted investee, after elimination of intercompany transactions, of approximately €1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in share of profits of equity accounted investee was mainly attributable to increased financing expenses recorded by Dorad Energy Ltd. (“ Dorad ”) due to the impact of the USD/NIS exchange rate fluctuations on deposits in USD and forward contracts and the reduced demand for electricity in Israel during the June 2025 war between Israel and Iran.

Other income was approximately €1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to €0 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The income during the six months ended June 30, 2025 was recognized based on agreed compensation expected to be received from the EPC contractor of two of the Company’s USA solar facilities for loss of income due to delays in construction.

Financing expenses, net was approximately €1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to financing expenses, net of approximately €2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The change in financing expenses, net, was mainly attributable to higher income resulting from exchange rate differences that amounted to approximately €5.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately €1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, an aggregate change of approximately €4.6 million. The exchange rate differences were mainly recorded in connection with the New Israeli Shekel (“ NIS ”) cash and cash equivalents and the Company’s NIS denominated debentures and were caused by the 4.2% devaluation of the NIS against the euro during the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to 0.2% during the six months ended June 30 2024. The increase in financing income for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was partially offset by a decrease in financing income of approximately €2.4 million in connection with derivatives and warrants for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was also partially offset by increased interest expenses resulting from the issuance of the Company’s Series G Debentures in February 2025 and Series F Debentures in August and November 2024.

Tax benefit was approximately €1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to tax benefit of approximately €1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The change is primarily attributable to the tax impact of the investment transaction with Clal Insurance Company Ltd.

Loss for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately €1.6 million, compared to loss of approximately €3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Total other comprehensive loss was approximately €8.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to total other comprehensive income of approximately €5.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The change in total other comprehensive income (loss) is primarily as the result of foreign currency translation adjustments due to the change in the NIS/euro exchange rate and by changes in fair value of cash flow hedges, including a material decrease in the fair value of the liability resulting from the financial power swap that covers approximately 80% of the output of the Talasol solar plant (the “ Talasol PPA ”). The Talasol PPA experienced high volatility due to the substantial change in electricity prices in Europe. In accordance with hedge accounting standards, the changes in the Talasol PPA’s fair value are recorded in the Company’s shareholders’ equity through a hedging reserve and not through the accumulated deficit/retained earnings. The changes do not impact the Company’s consolidated net profit/loss or the Company’s consolidated cash flows.

[TITLE]Russian oil keeps flowing despite US pressure – Bloomberg:
[TEXT]
Crude exports have reportedly remained near peak levels as global buyers ignore Washington’s demands to halt purchases

Russia’s seaborne crude exports have remained near a 16-month high over the past four weeks, showing little impact from US President Donald Trump’s efforts to pressure global buyers into halting imports from Moscow, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

According to vessel-tracking data through Saturday compiled by the outlet, average daily shipments held steady at 3.62 million barrels, matching the highest level since May 2024. The continued flow comes despite targeted US efforts to persuade countries to curb imports.

Trump has pressured the EU, India, and China to stop purchasing Russian oil, describing the move as an effort to advance a potential Ukraine peace settlement. Moscow has criticized Washington's strong-arm tactics, saying that sovereign nations have the right to choose their trade partners.

New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil have in particular drawn the ire of the US. In August, Washington imposed 25% punitive tariffs on India on top of the earlier 25% tariff imposed after the two countries failed to reach a trade deal. India has refused to scale back imports from Russia and described Washington's policy as economic coercion.

China has taken an even firmer stance, with its Ministry of Commerce reaffirming intentions to deepen energy cooperation with Russia. The ministry says Beijing will defend its interests as the US pushes G7 nations to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.

European buyers are also resisting. Hungary and Slovakia, which are both reliant on pipeline shipments, have cited economic and logistical obstacles to ending Russian oil imports. Turkish imports have remained steady as well, averaging around 300,000 barrels per day.

Meanwhile, the redirection of oil from Russian refineries damaged by Ukrainian drone strikes may be contributing to the continued export volumes, according to Bloomberg. Export terminal capacity, however, could become a limiting factor if strikes intensify, the outlet adds.

In the most recent week, 36 tankers carried 26.75 million barrels of Russian crude, a rise from the previous week’s 23.69 million, Bloomberg data shows. The total value of exports in the week to September 28 rose by $240 million to $1.57 billion.

[TITLE]Republika Srpska: Milorad Dodik steps aside – DW – 09:
[TEXT]
After dominating politics in Republika Srpska for 27 years, Milorad Dodik is stepping down in the face of national court rulings and international pressure, paving the way for a presidential election on November 23.

Former President Milorad Dodik on Monday withdrew from all official roles in Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority entity that makes up half of Bosnia and Herzegovina, after almost three decades in power.

A months-long standoff with the state judiciary has thus ended with Dodik's complete capitulation.

It began in February, when a Bosnian federal court sentenced him to one year in prison and barred him from politics for six years for flouting decisions by High Representative Christian Schmidt, the international envoy tasked with enforcing the Dayton Agreement peace deal that ended the Bosnian War 30 years ago.

In August, Bosnia's Central Election Commission stripped Dodik of the presidency of Republika Srpska.

Initial defiance

"I won't step down. There will be a referendum at the end of September," Dodik repeatedly insisted, both after the court's decision and after being stripped of the presidency.

While he avoided a prison sentence by paying a fine, he is still barred from all political activity for six years.

But now, even the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), the party Dodik has led for as long as he has been in power, has reversed its defiant stance.

After months of threatening secession in response to Dodik's conviction, the party has ultimately conceded.

Dodik has asked that the National Assembly of Republika Srpska appoint an interim president until a new one is elected in an early presidential election on November 23.

"This is part of our broader strategy — a move to resist threats aimed at undermining Republika Srpska," Dodik said on Monday.

Dodik's divided party

Despite stepping back, Dodik remains the head of the SNSD, his brainchild and the party that paved the way for his rise to political power.

But from once exercising near-total control over the entity of Republika Srpska, and even exerting major influence on national politics by either granting or withholding Republika Srpska's support for decisions at the Bosnian level, Dodik now finds himself reduced to leading a party that is fragmented by internal rifts.

Indeed, his withdrawal could mean the unraveling of the SNSD itself and with it, the fading legacy of what former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the West once described as a "breath of fresh air in the Balkans."

Rise and self-inflicted fall

Following the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina was split into two highly autonomous entities: the predominantly Serb Republika Srpska and the predominantly Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Dodik rose to power in 1998 when he assumed the leadership of Republika Srpska, where he ruled unchallenged for most of the intervening period until his conviction earlier this year.

Ironically, it was Dodik himself who set recent events in motion by bringing a case to the Constitutional Court. He expected to be able to discredit the High Representative, Christian Schmidt, who had introduced legal reforms allowing elected politicians to be criminally prosecuted.

Instead, the result was a verdict that triggered a months-long — and ultimately futile — effort to cling to power.

Even the recurring threats of a referendum, which Dodik invoked more than 50 times to portray himself as the sole defender of Serb national unity, couldn't save him.

A devastated economy

More than two decades of unchecked corruption, cronyism, nepotism and patronage politics have devastated the economy of Republika Srpska.

Public utilities and industries have been hollowed out as a result of shady tenders, fake concessions and legal settlements.

Throughout his presidency, Dodik publicly championed Serb unity. He is pictured here with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Image: Miomir Jakovljevic/Anadolu/picture alliance

The power distribution company of Republika Srpska was bankrupted in just a few years, and thermal power plants — once major exporters of energy — now teeter on the brink of collapse.

Champion of Serb unity?

While Dodik publicly championed Serb unity, the unity Dodik relied on ultimately served only the interests of his family and political circle.

His leadership delivered everything but the things Republika Srpska truly needed: economic growth, post-war recovery and reconciliation.

Weakening the central state and paving the way for Republika Srpska's potential future secession became a central aim of Dodik and the SNSD.

After the 1992-1995 Bosnian War, Republika Srpska had a population of nearly 1.5 million. Today, that number is estimated to have shrunk to barely 700,000.

Allies in Moscow, Budapest and Belgrade

Although he initially came to power with Western support, Dodik later pivoted to Moscow, forging strong ties with President Vladimir Putin. He also developed close links to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

Dodik was convinced that Moscow would give its unwavering support if Republika Srpska's secession from Bosnia and Herzegovina ever became viable.

But no such support ever materialized — neither from the Kremlin nor from Budapest or Belgrade. In short, the much-anticipated Balkan political bloc never came about.

Relations with the High Representative

Dodik's downfall can be traced back to a key court ruling in 2020 that assigned state property that had belonged to the government of the Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia before the 1992 war to the central government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Dodik considered the ruling unacceptable because it challenged the notion of Republika Srpska having exclusive control over its territory.

A political clash followed with then-High Representative Valentin Inzko of Austria, who introduced a law criminalizing genocide denial. This was seen as a direct affront to Republika Srpska's leadership, which continues to deny the internationally recognized Srebrenica genocide.

Inzko was succeeded by Germany's Christian Schmidt, whom Dodik declared persona non grata for enforcing laws he saw as harmful to Republika Srpska. Dodik even ordered police to arrest Schmidt if he entered the entity — a threat that was never acted upon.

Ultimately, by stepping down and halting further confrontation with the international community and national institutions, Dodik has tacitly accepted both Schmidt's authority and the legitimacy of the Bosnian court that sentenced him.

[TITLE]Virginia Could Show How to Manage Data Center Growth. So Far, It’s a Case Study in Stalling Legislation:
[TEXT]
RICHMOND, Va.—You might think the state that is the undisputed epicenter of global internet traffic has a leg up on managing the challenges of the artificial intelligence arms race.

So far, it’s not working out that way.

Nationwide, that push by Silicon Valley is gobbling up energy, increasing average customers’ electricity bills and threatening progress on decarbonization. In Virginia, data-center developers warned the utility Dominion Energy at the end of last year that their upcoming projects would need 40 gigawatts of electricity—the energy equivalent of increasing Virginia’s households nearly fourfold.

Dominion plans to respond by building more natural gas power plants, which could raise utility bills for households and businesses both here and beyond the Mid-Atlantic state.

Virginia’s legislators certainly took notice. At least 33 unique bills were introduced in the last session to address various data-center dilemmas, an Inside Climate News analysis found.

“We are practically providing data centers for the entire world and I don’t want that cost to be borne by ratepayers in my district,” said state Del. Shelly Simonds, a Democrat representing the port city of Newport News.

But almost all of the bills ran aground, meeting cumulative resistance from tech businesses, local governments, labor unions and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Of the four that made it into law, only two were more than a symbolic measure.

The data-center growth spurt was already putting pressure on the state’s power supplies before this year. Virginia overtook California, the most populous state, in 2023 to emerge as the top importer of electricity, driven by rapid growth in commercial power consumption.

That means the impact of Virginia’s data-center decisions extends to the wider region. It shares an interconnected grid with much of the Mid-Atlantic, and that grid’s operator is increasingly under pressure from state governors as costs spike.

“Virginia cannot produce the amount of power needed for the data centers, so we’re going to have to pipe in power from neighboring states. And if Maryland is enhancing its grid and building infrastructure, then odds are Marylanders are going to be paying for that when the power is coming here,” said Del. Ian Lovejoy, who sponsored four data-center bills last session, none of which passed.

The skyrocketing power demand is also creating hurdles for the state’s ambitions to completely wean its two largest electric utilities off planet-warming fossil fuels in the next few decades. Many data centers also have on-site diesel generators that are meant for backup power but are being run more frequently, worsening air quality and prompting noise complaints from residents.

As a result, “the rapid growth of data centers [has] surpassed all environmental issues in Virginia practically, so it’s something that demands our attention,” Simonds said.

But the failure last session of nearly all 33 bills on the subject, most without even getting a hearing, underscores the challenge of legislating on data centers in a state home to the greatest number of them.

Legislative Roadblocks

The most ambitious of the five data-center bills that the Virginia General Assembly passed was vetoed by Youngkin.

That bill would have required jurisdictions considering a data-center proposal to mandate a noise study if the site is close to homes and schools, and to review with the local utility any electric substation upgrades that would be needed.

The majority of bills, 22, never even made it out of committee. That’s the stage where a bill must get approval from a smaller group of legislators before it advances to the full chamber.

Some of the bills had bipartisan backing. But interviews with a dozen state lawmakers pointed to a range of hurdles—chief among them a muscular lobbying effort by tech companies as well as the fraught politics of treading on the decision-making domain of local officials.

Nineteen of the 33 bills were primarily sponsored by Democrats, while Republicans were the primary sponsors of the other 14. Geography, rather than politics, helps explain who pushed for change.

“In areas that are affected most egregiously by overdevelopment of data centers, you have bipartisan support for regulation,” said Lovejoy. The Republican’s district covers part of Prince William County where a local rezoning fight is unfolding over an upcoming 1,700-acre data center corridor.

“It’s when you move away from the blast zone of the impact of the data centers, people become less concerned,” Lovejoy said.

The legislative proposals covered a variety of issues: improving transparency, reforming tax incentives, protecting ratepayers, increasing state oversight and overhauling data-center siting and zoning.

Two bills that would have required data centers to disclose their often-massive water and power usage died in committee. Another seven bills that sought to change the tax incentives for data centers—some by requiring clean energy use, higher energy-efficiency or wage minimums—also all died in committee.

A handful of bills sought to explicitly protect ratepayers from bearing the costs of infrastructure that will be built to accommodate data-center growth. Under the current system, everyone pays. Two of those measures got merged, and variants passed in the House and the Senate. But the chambers could not resolve the differences.

One ratepayer-protection measure did make it into law, and it’s a meaningful change—but only for the roughly 700,000 customers served by the state’s nonprofit electric co-operatives, a fraction of the total customer base in Virginia. The new law creates a path for the co-ops to create an affiliate to serve large electricity users in order to reduce their impact on average ratepayers.

Of three bills attempting to increase state oversight, one became law—after an amendment wiped out nearly all the extra oversight it would have brought.

The original version would have required electric utilities to create a separate classification for data-center customers. The enacted version requires the state utility regulator to exercise authority it already has: to determine whether existing customer classifications are reasonable when considering rate increase requests from Dominion or Appalachian Power Co., the state’s biggest electric utilities.

Dominion now has a rate case before that regulator, the State Corporation Commission, with the powerful utility and big tech companies squabbling over what fair rates for data centers should be.

“The issue is none of this stuff has enough teeth,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, a Prince William County Democrat who voted for the weakened bill and had sponsored one of her own that stalled. “What ultimately got passed was a significantly watered-down version.”
