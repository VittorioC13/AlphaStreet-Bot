Further details on each of these updates is provided below.

Illuccix China Phase 3 Registration Study

Telix is pleased to announce positive top-line results from its Phase 3 registration study of TLX591-CDx (Illuccix®, Kit for the preparation of 68Ga-PSMA-11) for prostate cancer imaging in Chinese patients. The Illuccix China2 trial met its primary endpoint of patient-level positive predictive value (PPV) for the detection of tumors in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer following prior radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The study confirms that the clinical experience of TLX591-CDx PSMA-PET3 imaging in Chinese patients is comparable to that observed in patients studied elsewhere.

Illuccix China is a Phase 3 prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study conducted in collaboration with Telix’s strategic commercial partner for the Greater China region, Grand Pharmaceutical Group Limited (Grand Pharma). The study in 140 patients delivered a strong result for the primary endpoint, with an overall patient-level PPV of 94.8% for the detection of tumors with TLX591-CDx (95% confidence interval [CI]: 85.9%, 98.2%), with the lower bound of the 95% CI (85.9%). The region-level PPV was 100.0% in the prostate bed and in the extra-pelvic soft tissue, lymph nodes, and organ metastases (non-bone); 94.7% in the pelvic region outside of the prostate bed, including lymph nodes; and 87.0% in bone metastases.

In the study, patients with suspected BCR were stratified into groups according to their baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. TLX591-CDx PSMA-PET imaging demonstrated high PPV in all patient groups, including at very low baseline PSA levels.

Baseline PSA PPV (95% CI) ≥ 5.0 ng/mL 100.0% (78.5%, 100.0%) < 5.0 to 2.0 ng/mL 100.0% (67.6%, 100.0%) < 2.0 to 1.0 ng/mL 90.9% (62.3%, 98.4%) < 1.0 to 0.5 ng/mL 90.0% (59.6%, 98.2%) < 0.5 to 0.2 ng/mL 93.3% (70.2%, 98.8%)

More than two-thirds (67.2%) of patients experienced a change in their treatment plan as a consequence of TLX591-CDx PSMA-PET imaging compared with the initial plan at baseline. This outcome confirms that PSMA-PET imaging with TLX591-CDx had a meaningful impact on clinical decision-making in Chinese patients, potentially leading to improved treatment strategies for participants with BCR. Final data from the study will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication.

Dr. David N. Cade, Group Chief Medical Officer, Telix, commented, “This is an outstanding result. The primary endpoint of the study was met decisively, with the positive predictive value significantly exceeding the performance threshold agreed with the Chinese regulator. Importantly, the high PPV was consistent even in patients with very low PSA values, and across differing metastatic locations, demonstrating broad clinical applicability. These compelling data will enable Telix and our partner Grand Pharma to submit a New Drug Application for Illuccix in China, a strategically important market.”

In China, more than 134,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 20224, increasing by approximately 6% each year5. In line with government policy supporting wider geographic access to nuclear medicine, the number of PET/CT cameras installed in China is expected to surpass 1,600 by the end of 20256, compared with 133 in 20107.

FDA Resubmission Update: TLX101-CDx

Telix advises that its New Drug Application (NDA) resubmission for TLX101-CDx, (Pixclara®1, 18F-floretyrosine) to the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is progressing well. The Company has had collaborative interactions with the FDA around providing additional clinical data and a revised statistical analysis plan.

Following a productive Type A meeting to review the basis of the Complete Response Letter (CRL)8, Telix is currently finalizing its package for resubmission. The Company will provide a further near-term update when the resubmission has been filed and accepted by the FDA. The approved Expanded Access Program (EAP)9 remains active for TLX101-CDx, reflective of Telix’s commitment to serving patients.

FDA Resubmission Update: TLX250-CDx

Telix has recently participated in a Type A meeting to discuss the CRL it received following review of the Biologics License Application (BLA)10 for TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®1, 89Zr-DFO-girentuximab). Telix believes it has reached alignment with the FDA on the remediation of identified deficiencies regarding the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) package, which formed the substantive basis of the CRL.

The FDA has collaboratively granted Telix an additional meeting in January to review Telix’s plan for the additional data requested to establish comparability between the drug product used in the ZIRCON Phase 3 clinical trial11 and the scaled-up manufacturing process intended for commercial use. Telix will provide a further update following receipt of the official FDA meeting minutes of both Type A meetings. The approved Expanded Access Program (EAP)12 remains active for TLX250-CDx, reflective of Telix’s commitment to serving patients.

[TITLE]The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology Publishes Long Term Results from the QALSODY Phase 3 VALOR Study and its Open-Label Extension in SOD1-ALS:
[TEXT]
Long-term data published in JAMA Neurology further illustrate the effects of Biogen’s QALSODY on function, strength, and survival in SOD1-ALS

Over 3 years, a subset of QALSODY-treated participants regained previously lost function and strength, something not previously reported in the natural history of SOD1-ALS

Biogen is committed to advancing additional ALS research, including the ongoing QALSODY ATLAS study in pre-symptomatic SOD1-ALS and a robust discovery pipeline in ALS

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) – today announced that The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology has published final results from the completed Phase 3 VALOR study and its open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating QALSODY® (tofersen) for the treatment of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with over 3.5 years of follow-up. These results show that early initiation of QALSODY was associated with numerically slower decline in measures of clinical function, breathing and strength, as well as reduction in the risk of death or permanent ventilation. Sustained reductions in neurofilament, a marker of neurodegeneration, further validate the clinical results and demonstrate QALSODY’s impact on the underlying biology of SOD1-ALS.

“The final VALOR/OLE data further emphasize that, with the right target paired with the right therapeutic approach, we have the potential to meaningfully impact the course of ALS and improve the outlook for people living with this devastating disease. Supported by these data, treatment-driven reductions in neurofilament are now being used as an early decision-making endpoint to accelerate future research,” said Stephanie Fradette, Pharm.D., Head of the Neuromuscular Development Unit at Biogen. “We are excited to share this progress which would not have been possible without the study participants and their caregivers, investigators and site staff, and all who have contributed to the development of QALSODY over many years.”

QALSODY 100 mg/15mL injection is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in adults who have a mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. In the United States, QALSODY received accelerated approval based on reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) observed in patients treated with QALSODY. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).

QALSODY has received approval in 44 countries around the world, including accelerated approval in the US and conditional or standard approval in other countries.
