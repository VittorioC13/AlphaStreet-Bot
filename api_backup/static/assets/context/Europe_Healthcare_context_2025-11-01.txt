WALTHAM, Mass., Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLS), today announced its third quarter 2025 financial results and business highlights.

“The third quarter was marked by strong execution and meaningful progress across our commercial and development portfolio. We were thrilled to receive our third regulatory approval in just four years, introducing a first-in-class C3 therapy for patients with C3G and primary IC-MPGN, many of whom previously had no available treatment options. The positive reception from the nephrology community reflects recognition of EMPAVELI’s compelling efficacy and safety profile, and strengthens our confidence in its potential to become the treatment of choice for patients,” said Cedric Francois, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer at Apellis. “At the same time, SYFOVRE continues to lead the geographic atrophy market and deliver a steady, durable revenue stream that supports our long-term growth ambitions. Combined with our strong financial position, these achievements enable us to enter the fourth quarter and 2026 with a solid foundation and clear momentum for continued growth.”

Third Quarter 2025 Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones

Maximizing EMPAVELI’s impact in rare diseases

Recorded $26.8 million in EMPAVELI U.S. net product revenue for the third quarter 2025.

C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and primary immune complex glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN): On July 28, 2025, EMPAVELI was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first treatment for C3G and primary IC-MPGN for patients 12 and older. Approval was based on the trifecta of positive outcomes in the Phase 3 VALIANT study including a 68% reduction in proteinuria, stabilization of kidney function, and substantial clearance of C3 deposits as measured by C3 staining, compared to placebo. Launch is underway with 152 patient start forms received as of September 30, 2025. This number includes approximately 50 patients from the Company’s early access program who are in the process of transitioning to commercial product. Sobi, the Company’s ex-U.S. commercialization partner, expects an opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for its indication extension application for Aspaveli (the brand name for EMPAVELI outside the U.S.) in C3G and primary IC-MPGN before year-end 2025. Seven abstracts were accepted for presentation at the upcoming American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week, including new 52-week data from the Phase 3 VALIANT study that reinforce the robust and sustained efficacy profile of EMPAVELI in C3G and primary IC-MPGN.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): The Company continues to see high patient compliance rates of 97%.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and delayed graft function (DGF): The Company expects to initiate two pivotal studies by year-end 2025, one in FSGS and one in DGF, two rare kidney diseases with significant complement pathway involvement and no approved therapies.

Transforming the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD)

SYFOVRE: Generated $150.9 million in SYFOVRE U.S. net product revenue in the third quarter of 2025 Total injections grew 4% quarter-over-quarter. SYFOVRE remains the market leader in GA with total market share exceeding an estimated 60% and 52% of new patient starts during the quarter. Utilization of SYFOVRE free goods remained elevated during the quarter and impacted revenue by approximately $15 million. Delivered approximately 101K SYFOVRE doses to physician offices, including ~86K commercial doses and ~15K free goods doses. The Phase 2 study of SYFOVRE + APL-3007, a potential next generation treatment aimed at comprehensively blocking complement activity in the retina and choroid, is ongoing.

Business Update

Apellis and Sobi announced a capped royalty purchase agreement in July in which Apellis will receive up to $300 million in exchange for 90% of Apellis’ future ex-U.S. royalties for Aspaveli. Per the companies’ 2020 collaboration agreement, Apellis is eligible for tiered royalties on ex-U.S. sales of Aspaveli ranging from high teens to high twenties. Under the terms of the royalty purchase agreement, Sobi acquired 90% of Apellis’ ex-U.S. royalties for Aspaveli for $275 million in cash. Apellis is also eligible for up to $25 million in milestone payments upon EMA approval of Aspaveli for C3G and IC-MPGN. The agreement is subject to defined caps tied to Aspaveli’s performance. Sobi retains 90% of ex-U.S. royalties until these caps are achieved, after which 100% of all ex-U.S. royalties revert to Apellis.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Total Revenue

Total revenue was $458.6 million for the third quarter of 2025, which consisted of $150.9 million of SYFOVRE U.S. net product revenue, $26.8 million of EMPAVELI U.S. net product revenue, the $275.0 million upfront payment from Sobi in connection with the Aspaveli royalty purchase agreement, and $5.8 million in licensing and other revenue associated with the Sobi collaboration. Total revenue was $196.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, which consisted of $152.0 million of SYFOVRE U.S. net product revenue, $24.6 million in EMPAVELI U.S. net product revenue, and $20.3 million in licensing and other revenue associated with the Sobi collaboration.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales was $24.5 million for the third quarter 2025, compared to $33.6 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by lower volumes of product supplied to Sobi, a decrease in expenses incurred related to excess, obsolete or scrapped inventory and a decrease due to costs incurred in connection with cancellable purchase commitments. The decreases were partially offset by a higher volume from commercial sales and product provided under our patient assistance programs.

R&D Expenses

R&D expenses were $68.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $88.6 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by lower program-specific and non-program-specific external costs, and lower compensation and related personnel costs.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses

SG&A expenses were $142.7 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $122.0 million for the same period in 2024. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher general commercial activities, personnel costs and general and administrative expenses, including office expenses, travel expenses, insurance expenses, professional and consulting fees, and other expenses, partially offset by lower personnel costs and lower factoring fees.

Net Income

Apellis reported a net income of $215.7 million for the third quarter 2025, driven by the one-time $275.0 million upfront payment from Sobi in connection with the Aspaveli royalty purchase agreement. This compared to a net loss of $57.4 million for the same period in 2024.

Cash

As of September 30, 2025, Apellis had $479.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $411.3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024. Based on its strong cash position, the Company elected to discontinue factoring its receivables during the quarter. Apellis now carries the incremental $80.6 million in receivables from the first three quarters of the year on its balance sheet and expects to realize cost savings of approximately $4.8 million on a go-forward annual basis. The Company continues to expect that its cash, combined with expected product revenues, will fund the business to profitability.

Conference Call and Webcast

Apellis will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its third quarter 2025 financial results and business highlights today, October 30, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

What is CAR T-Cell Therapy?

The CAR T-cell therapy market refers to the production, distribution, and use of CAR T-cell therapy, which is a cancer treatment that takes cells from the body and genetically changes them so they can fight cancer. It is most commonly used to treat cancers that affect blood cells, like specific types of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. CAR T-cell therapy is available for some children and adults with leukemia. The CARs help the cells to latch on to specific proteins, known as antigens, that are present on cancer cells.

CAR T-cells can cure specific types of blood cancer. The benefit of CAR T-cell therapy is the short treatment time required for completion. It scores over the other traditional cancer treatments in long-term remission with a better quality of life for the patient. CAR T-cell therapy modifies a patient's T-cells to target and destroy cancer cells.

Major Government Initiatives in CAR T-Cell Therapies:

France 2030 – Universal CAR-T Grant to Allogenica : Under the French government’s Innovations in Biotherapies and Bioproduction component of the France 2030 program, Allogenica was awarded a €2.5 million grant to industrialize a universal (allogeneic) CAR-T platform. This aims to boost scalability, reduce costs, and strengthen France’s domestic biomanufacturing ecosystem for CAR-T therapies.

EU / European Innovation Council (EIC) Support for Clinical Trials: Through EU-level funding mechanisms (like the European Innovation Council’s Accelerator programme), governments are financing CAR-T clinical trials to de-risk early development. An example is Elicera Therapeutics getting €2.5 million from EIC to fully fund its phase I/II trial (ELC-301) for treating B-cell lymphoma.

What are the Key Trends of the CAR T-Cell Therapy Market?

Expansion into Solid Tumors : While CAR T-cell therapies have shown strong success in blood cancers, researchers are now applying them to solid tumors like glioblastoma and lung cancer. Overcoming tumor microenvironments and antigen heterogeneity is a major focus of ongoing clinical trials.

Case Study: Gilead Sciences & Arcellx – Redefining CAR T-Cell Therapy Through Next-Generation BCMA Innovation

CAR T-cell therapy, once an experimental treatment for rare blood cancers, has rapidly evolved into one of the most promising frontiers in oncology. Among the therapeutic targets, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has emerged as a crucial focus for addressing relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This market segment is witnessing exceptional growth, projected to register a CAGR of over 46% from 2025 to 2034, driven by novel therapies demonstrating improved efficacy, scalability, and patient outcomes.

In this context, Gilead Sciences (via its Kite Pharma subsidiary) and Arcellx Inc. have formed one of the most strategically impactful alliances in the CAR-T ecosystem. Their lead investigational product, anito-cel (formerly known as CART-ddBCMA), represents a new generation of CAR T-cell therapy targeting BCMA with enhanced safety and durability of response.

Challenge:

Despite remarkable success in hematologic malignancies, CAR T-cell therapies have faced three key limitations:

[TITLE]Alethio Therapeutics Launches with New CEO and Chair to Advance Two Targeted Medicines for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (Chronic Blood Cancers):
[TEXT]
Leveraging deep scientific and clinical expertise in MPNs to drive a pipeline of disease-modifying precision therapies that selectively target disease-driving cells

Advancing AT-01, a first-in-class ADC programme, with strong preclinical validation towards IND/CTA-enabling studies, expected to begin in the first half of 2026

AT-02 further expands ADC portfolio by targeting mutant CALR, a key MPN driver mutation

Leadership and Board strengthened with appointments of Dr Rohit Batta as CEO and Mike Grey as Chair

Oxford, UK - 30 October 2025 – Alethio Therapeutics, a biotech company advancing therapies designed to help people with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) live longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives, today emerges from stealth with two antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) programmes and the appointments of Dr Rohit Batta as Chief Executive Officer and Mike Grey as Chair of the Board. Backed by deep scientific and clinical expertise, Alethio Therapeutics is focused on translating its discovery insights into a pipeline of precision, disease-modifying therapies.

MPNs form a group of chronic, incurable and ultimately fatal blood cancers. Approximately 300,000 people in the US live with MPNs and existing approved therapies, such as JAK inhibitors, are largely symptomatic, meaning they do not eliminate the malignant cells or alter disease progression. Patients face premature death and severe quality-of-life impairment, and disease-modifying treatments are desperately needed.

Leveraging deep expertise in MPNs to drive a pipeline of disease-modifying therapies

Alethio Therapeutics brings decades of clinical expertise in MPNs and MPN biology from its founders, Professors Adam Mead and Beth Psaila from the University of Oxford. Alongside this, its powerful ARTEMIS discovery engine enables the Company to identify and validate novel targets, using access to one of the world’s largest MPN patient cell repositories, and to develop first-in-class medicines against these targets. ARTEMIS also enables Alethio Therapeutics to de-risk candidates before clinical trials using advanced human bone marrow organoid models that replicate patient biology.

Advancing AT-01, a first-in-class ADC programme targeting disease-driving cells in MPN towards clinical proof of concept

Alethio Therapeutic’s lead programme, AT-01, discovered and validated using ARTEMIS, is a first-in-class ADC designed and optimised to penetrate fibrotic bone marrow and target and eliminate disease-driving cells in MPN. AT-01 is based on a novel target, which is uniquely upregulated on disease-driving stem cells and fibrosis-driving megakaryocytes.

AT-01 has demonstrated compelling disease-modifying potential in preclinical studies, with a favourable therapeutic index for MPNs, including:

Potent selectivity and cytotoxicity in eliminating mutant stem cells while sparing healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and

Reducing spleen size and fibrosis-driving cells, both predictive of improved clinical benefit

Validation across multiple in vivo disease models, including founder-developed systems built over decades of research, as well as models using patient-derived cells in human bone marrow organoids that mimic the immunologically hostile myelofibrotic tumour microenvironment.

Alethio Therapeutics’ goal is to shift MPN treatment from symptom control towards disease modification to meet a critical patient need. The Company is currently preparing AT-01 for IND/CTA-enabling studies, expected to begin in the first half of 2026.

The Company is also advancing a second ADC programme AT-02, which targets mutant CALR and is undergoing preclinical evaluation. Mutant CALR is a major driver of MPN, found in ~30% of patients. It’s a standout target that is mutant-specific, surface-exposed, and ideal for an ADC therapeutic.

Strengthened leadership and board driving Alethio Therapeutics’ focused strategy

To drive Alethio Therapeutics’ discovery and development strategy in MPN, the Company today announces a strengthening and expansion of the leadership team and board with the appointments of Dr Rohit Batta as Chief Executive Officer and Mike Grey as Chair of the Board, succeeding Mark Throsby who remains on the board as a Non-Executive Director.

Rohit Batta joins Alethio Therapeutics from Ferring Ventures, where he served as Managing Director and Head of the group company. Previously, he was Chief Medical Officer at Vicore Pharma and also held senior leadership roles at GSK, where he led the clinical strategy for haemoglobinopathy gene therapies and played a pivotal role in launching the world’s first gene therapy for a paediatric rare disease – an achievement that earned his team a prestigious Prix Galien award. Rohit brings 20 years of industry experience in translating breakthrough science into therapies and strategic partnerships. He began his career as a physician in the UK’s National Health Service, and has worked across multiple clinical specialties including oncology.

Mike Grey is a seasoned leader with over 45 years of operational and board experience from biopharma, global pharma and venture capital. He has founded and grown several biotechnology companies and is currently Chair/Executive Chair of Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Sorriso Pharmaceuticals, Spruce Biosciences, Plexium and Theolytics. He also serves as Venture Partner with Pappas Capital.

He joins Mark Throsby, Suman Shirodkar, and Beth Psaila on the Alethio Therapeutics Board. Mark Throsby is a biopharma executive and antibody engineering expert with leadership roles at Crucell, Merus, and Gadeta, and over 40 publications and multiple patents. Suman Shirodkar is a biotech leader with 25 years of experience, who led the European launch of Jakafi for MPN – contributing to its over $3B annual revenue – and most recently served as CEO of Larkspur Biosciences and Cambridge Epigenetix, and is Chair of NanoPhoria.

Founding investor Oxford Science Enterprises is represented on the Board by Sally Dewhurst and Sanne De Jongh bringing significant experience in venture investing and company building based on cutting-edge science.

Alethio Therapeutics is headquartered at Abingdon Science Park, near Oxford, with state-of-the-art labs supporting its growth and the delivery of key development milestones with AT-01 and across its pipeline. Formerly known as Alethiomics, the new company name marks the next chapter in Alethio Therapeutics evolution – from early scientific exploration to the development of disease-modifying precision medicines for MPNs.

“With no curative options, MPNs expose patients to ongoing risk of disease evolution and poor outcomes,” said Rohit Batta, CEO. “Alethio Therapeutics is entering a new chapter with the ambition and team to deliver the first disease-modifying ADC therapies for MPNs. While current treatments are largely symptomatic, our unique expertise and approach enable us to directly target the drivers of disease progression, with the aim of shifting the treatment paradigm for MPNs and transforming outcomes for patients. It’s an exciting time to be joining Alethio Therapeutics, and I look forward to working with our founders, Beth Psaila and Adam Mead – leading MPN clinicians – our strategic board, and a talented team with deep expertise in cancer cell biology, organoid development, and bioinformatics, as we advance AT-01 and build our pipeline.”

“Alethio Therapeutics is advancing its lead programme to the clinic, benefitting from the capabilities it has assembled for the creation of disease-modifying medicines for chronic blood cancers where existing treatments are inadequate,” added Mike Grey, Chair of the Board. “The Company combines a wealth of expertise around MPN disease biology and treatment, target discovery and ADC development, which has the potential to unlock untapped opportunities in MPNs and fuel a pipeline of disease-modifying precision therapies. I’d like to thank Mark Throsby for his leadership as Chair and look forward to working alongside him and the broader team as we execute our new, focused strategy.”
