[TITLE]ARM Energy Approves $2.3B Texas Gas Pipeline:
[TEXT]
ARM Energy announced a final investment decision to proceed with the Mustang Express Pipeline project, designed to add 2.5 Bcfd of natural gas transport capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast.

ARM Energy Holdings LLC on Thursday announced a FID (final investment decision) to proceed with the Mustang Express Pipeline project, designed to add 2.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas transport capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast.

The pipeline system represents an investment of $2.3 billion, ARM Energy and Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO) said in a joint statement. "Mustang Express Pipeline will be constructed and operated by ARM Energy, along with its financial partners, PIMCO and associated co-investors", they said.

Expected to be completed late 2028 or early 2029, the project will have a 178-mile mainline from the Katy Hub to Port Arthur. The conveyor, 42 inches in diameter, will total 236 miles in length, the companies said.

Mustang Express is supported by an anchor shipper commitment from Sempra Infrastructure for the provision of feed gas for its Port Arthur LNG Phase II project, the statement said.

Houston, Texas-based ARM Energy plans an open season this month for the project's remaining capacity.

ARM Energy contracted Jindal Tubular USA for the mill capacity and Solar Turbines Inc for the turbines for the project's three gas-driven compressor stations, which will have a total capacity of 300,000 horsepower, the statement said.

Mustang Express will "significantly enhance the efficiency of the U.S. natural gas supply chain", ARM Energy chief executive Zach Lee said. "By linking two of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the U.S. directly to LNG export facilities in Texas, we are helping ensure a reliable supply of natural gas for liquefaction and export with a route that crosses four storage facilities - delivering positive impacts for global energy needs and Texas communities".

PIMCO managing director and portfolio manager Adam Gubner said the project "reflects our commitment to invest in infrastructure to support LNG expansion in the U.S., while also providing compelling long-term investment opportunities for our clients looking for attractive risk-adjusted returns".

Last month Sempra announced a positive FID on the project, which it said would double the current terminal's liquefied natural gas capacity to 26 million metric tons per annum (MMtpa).

In May the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) granted phase II a permit to export to countries without a free trade agreement (FTA) with the U.S., marking the resumption of federal permitting for LNG export to non-FTA nations following a pause by the previous administration.

Phase II is now authorized to export the equivalent of 698 billion cubic feet a year of natural gas, or about 13.5 MMtpa of LNG according to Sempra, to FTA and non-FTA countries on a non-additive basis until 2050. Sempra received the FTA portion of the permit July 2020.

[TITLE]Groups push back on Alberta’s strategy to deal with inactive oil and gas wells as plan moves forward:
[TEXT]
A consortium of advocate groups is renewing calls to scrap the Alberta government’s proposed plans for dealing with aging oil and gas infrastructure, but the province is moving ahead.

The Coalition for Responsible Energy (C4RE), which is composed of more than 15 land rights, surface rights, environmental, health, science, Indigenous and civil advocate groups, has been campaigning across Alberta over the past several months.

The current core issue for C4RE is the government of Alberta’s mature asset strategy, a plan to deal with the inventory of aging oil and gas infrastructure and the issues surrounding it.

“We would like to see the mature asset strategy scrapped," campaign organizer Phillip Meintzer said.

“I just think you need to go back to the drawing board with meaningful and open public consultation.”

The strategy was a focal point in a recent mandate letter from Premier Danielle Smith to Energy Minister Brian Jean and is informed by a report of 21 recommendations published by the province in April.

The energy and minerals ministry told CBC in an emailed response to questions that it is moving forward with 20 of the 21 recommendations, but didn’t say which one is not being adopted.

After the draft version of the report was leaked, the final version had some reworded sections, including the suggestion that the province should manage a new insurance fund as opposed to backstopping liabilities with taxpayer dollars.

C4RE says it believes the development of the report was closed off to the public, one-sided towards industry and fails to hold the oil and gas sector accountable to its closure responsibilities.

The report describes a plan to tackle the cleanup, decommissioning and possible repurposing of 275,000 oil and gas-related assets deemed mature. This includes orphan wells, but also other inactive and marginally productive facilities nearing or at the end of expected life cycles.

The report was developed internally and included a consultation process that involved 97 entities and 200 people. It initially drew attention in March when a draft version was leaked and reported on.

The oil and gas assets referenced in the report are understood to be potentially hazardous to human health and pose environmental risks as well, according to reports from Alberta’s auditor general. Reports from the Alberta Energy Regulator estimate the total liability of these oil and gas assets to be around $38 billion.

It's just going to be used as a way to offload company cleanup obligations onto the public . - Phillip Meintzer, campaign organizer with the Coalition for Responsible Energy

Meintzer said he’s especially concerned that the mature asset strategy’s report, in his view, may violate the polluter pays principle, a long-held Canadian legal rule that holds polluters responsible for managing their pollution.

Part of the report calls for legislation to allow for the creation of special-purpose companies that could take on the responsibility for the closure of some oil and gas wells. If these companies fail, Meintzer worries that taxpayers could be on the hook.

“It's just going to be used as a way to offload company cleanup obligations onto the public,” he said.

In an email to CBC News, Alberta’s energy ministry said it continues to support the polluter pays principle and that taxpayer dollars will not be used to clean up private company wells.

CBC News followed up with another email with questions for the ministry regarding what kind of companies could be tasked with dealing with aging energy infrastructure. As of publication, the ministry had yet to reply.

Wellbore blues

Some within the industry say the cleanup issues are seeing progress. Changes made in recent years have been ramping up the closure of wells, said Richard Wong, vice-president regulatory and operations with the Canadian Association Petroleum Producers.

Wong said in an emailed response to questions from CBC, that inactive wells peaked in 2020 and have steadily declined, and well licensees were exceeding closure spending requirements.

Still, tense relationships and trust issues between the province, industry, landowners and municipalities over the management of aging oil and gas infrastructure are also mentioned in the mature asset strategy’s recommendations report.

A report published by the Rural Municipalities of Alberta earlier this year, claims that its members are owed close to $254 million in unpaid taxes from oil and gas companies.

“I won’t blame the current government for where we’re at,” said Kara Westerlund, the president of RMA.

She said the issue is complex, and results from decades of neglect. Moving forward, she hopes that the province will work to hold polluters accountable and ensure that municipalities and landowners are paid properly.

While RMA was a part of the consultation process, Westerlund said she shares some of C4RE’s concerns

In the third quarter, the portfolio recovered from the significant drawdowns from November 2024 to June 2025. The composite returned 20.78% (net of fees) in the quarter, compared to 12.39% for the Russell 2000 TR, 8.12% for the S&P 500 TR, and 9.01% for the NASDAQ 100 TR. The portfolio compounded at 21.06% (net of fees) since its inception vs. 4.60% for the Russell 2000 TR, 11.46% for the S&P 500 TR, and 13.48% for the NASDAQ 100 TR.

In its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Kingdom Capital Advisors highlighted stocks such as United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI). United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) distributes natural, organic, specialty, produce, and conventional grocery and non-food products. The one-month return of United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) was 42.11%, and its shares gained 98.65% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 13, 2025, United Natural Foods, Inc.

Kingdom Capital Advisors stated the following regarding United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:

"United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) exemplifies our approach to developing edge through misunderstood situations. Despite a cyber-attack that paralyzed their distribution network for over 10% of the most recent quarter, management still exceeded sales guidance — demonstrating exceptional execution under pressure. The cyber event appears mostly covered by insurance and has deepened customer relationships rather than strained them. Management's September 30th guidance for the upcoming year shows continued execution well ahead of Wall Street expectations. With $300m of free cash flow expected from operations in FY26, another $150m from cyber insurance proceeds and asset sales, UNFI trades below 6x EV/EBITDA—a persistent discount to peers."

Is United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI) the Best Food Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?

United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. According to our database, 27 hedge fund portfolios held United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) at the end of the second quarter, up from 26 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]‘No trade-off’ between sustainability and growth, India can grow by 7.5-8%: Nicholas Stern:
[TEXT]
There is no trade-off between economic growth and moving to renewable sources of energy and India can even increase its GDP growth rate to 7.5-8 per cent from 6.5 per cent currently by aggressively investing in its green transition, according to NICHOLAS STERN, the IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government at the London School of Economics.

“…you still get that residual argument that somehow a developing nation will have to choose between sustainability and climate on the one hand and growth in incomes on the other. That’s absolutely wrong…and it’s very important we are very clear that there is no trade-off,” he said in an interview with The Indian Express. Stern also said the path India takes to becoming a developed economy by 2047 will be crucial for the world and that it needs to increase its investment-to-GDP ratio by 5 percentage points, remove impediments to investment, get the incentives right to invest in modern technologies – particularly green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Edited excerpts:

US President Donald Trump’s focus has been on tariff policies. But he is also undoing years of progress made in the renewables sector. Is that more dangerous than the chaos the trade disruptions are causing?

Trump has been disruptive in a number of directions. One, of course, is the tariffs and the structure of world trade. Another is health, where he’s taking the US away from the World Health Organization (WHO) and attacking vaccinations. On security, he is backing off from the defence of Europe. Aid has been dismantled.

Story continues below this ad

One important way forward for the rest of the world is to stay united on these issues. If the US is undermining WTO, which it is, then try to find trade agreements between nations which look quite similar. I think it would be very good if the EU trade agreement (with India) – which I think is coming – looks like the one with the UK. I hope there’ll be more trade agreements with Asia. The more they look similar, the more we’re sustaining the idea that trade should be symmetric and with minimal barriers because we all benefit from that.

In many ways, climate is similar (to health and trade) – we have the international fora where we can find agreements and carry on. At the same time, the cost of solar and batteries has fallen dramatically. If we compare with 1975, it’s not that it has fallen by a factor of 100 – it’s fallen by a factor close to 1,000, which is extraordinary. It is unambiguously the cheapest form of electricity generation.

On the climate side, the forces of change are strong. But we are going nowhere near fast enough. We are probably heading, given current policies, to something like 2.5-3°C (rise in temperatures); we’re already at
