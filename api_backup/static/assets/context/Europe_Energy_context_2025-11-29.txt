[TITLE]Electric container ships won’t work – but a fleet of auxiliary battery ships could clean up shipping:
[TEXT]
Shipping moves 90% of global trade and produces nearly 3% of global emissions. The sector has proved challenging to clean up, as cargo ships can travel for weeks between ports and typically rely on cheap, energy-dense and extremely polluting heavy fuel oil.

Earlier this year, international efforts to move shipping towards net zero by using cleaner fuels fell apart under pressure from the United States. But as battery prices fall year on year, there might be another way forward.

Electric ferries already shuttle passengers and cars on short routes, while harbour tugs and inland cargo vessels are also going electric. At present, electrification works best over modest distances where charging can happen at the dock.

Could it ever work for container ships crisscrossing oceans? These giants can travel from China to Europe without refuelling due to the energy density of oil. The weight and expense of battery packs means it would be hard to swap oil for batteries.

But electrification isn’t all or nothing. Batteries would need to begin by operating alongside liquid fuels. In recent research, I lay out two potential ways to do this: using onboard battery packs and charging at ports, or connecting container ships to dedicated battery vessels.

How can batteries best help move cargo?

Electrification is worthwhile as a way to cut emissions and potentially save money. The question is how to do it – and whether it stacks up economically.

Placing batteries permanently on the ship is intuitive, matching the main way battery packs are used in electric cars, buses and trucks. In this scenario, ships would recharge in ports and also ideally at sea to make the most of the expensive batteries.

The second approach is different. Here, container ships able to propel themselves using fuel or electricity would tap into a global fleet of smaller battery vessels.

A container ship would link to a battery vessel and use its stored power as the vessel moves alongside it. The battery vessel would then peel off and return to port to charge up again. Battery vessels already exist, but at smaller scale. One option would be tightly integrating battery vessels, like the submarine swallowed by the ship in the Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me.

My modelling shows a container ship going from China to Europe could be powered by battery vessels between Chinese ports and Singapore. It would then use fuel to go from Singapore to Sri Lanka and then to the Horn of Africa. A lack of nearby land means battery vessels would have to power the ship for more than four days, which would be economical only if marine-rated battery prices fell extremely low (under A$100 per kilowatt-hour).

Once at the Horn of Africa, the ship could switch back to battery vessels that charge using the region’s booming solar capacity to go through the Red and Mediterranean Seas to northern Europe. My modelling suggests it would take 33 battery vessels to go from China to northern Europe.

Is it economically viable?

My modelling suggests it doesn’t make economic sense to install large battery packs on ships. For each giant New Panamax container ship, it would cost almost A$150 million to install 600 megawatt-hours of storage at $232,000 per MWh. Batteries rated for ocean conditions are more expensive. Fully charged, this giant battery pack would propel a container ship for 24 hours –

[TITLE]A flawed but authentic COP30 in the Brazilian Amazon:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

Welcome to our weekly newsletter where we highlight environmental trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world.

Susan Ormiston and Jill English here, covering our fourth UN climate conference, share our notes on COP30 in the Brazilian Amazon talks — where the drama played out both in and outside the negotiating rooms.

A flawed but authentic COP30 in the Brazilian Amazon

Flames inside COP30 sent everyone fleeing, torrential rains outside caused leaks and periodic flooding and a riot by demonstrators bursting through the entrance turned the climate talks in Belém, Brazil, into one of the most surprising UN climate conferences.

When protestors burst into the venue one night, CBC producer Jill English hustled down to the entrance from our office to see if there was indeed danger. Local Brazilian security guards, arms linked, were struggling to push the protests back. UN security, caught by surprise, were yelling at people to get out.

That was our first hint that drama, usually in the negotiating rooms, was everywhere.

WATCH | Leaky venue plagues UN climate conference: Leaky venue plagues UN climate conference | Duration 0:29 The Radio-Canada team works under umbrellas during a thunderstorm in the leaky venue for the COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil.

Brazil hatched its bold plan to host the UN climate talks in the Amazonian city, ill-prepared to host 50,000 people, as a move to bring state leaders, climate negotiators, delegates, Indigenous peoples and international media all to a place emblematic of climate change. Situated near the equator, Belém was hot, intensely humid, and the air conditioning which bellowed through the conference halls was like a windstorm.

Adapting to climate change is messy, imperfect and strewn with politics, and, in a funny way, the Amazonian COP, though deeply flawed, was authentic.

But it won’t be remembered as a landmark COP, its conclusion was rancorous and struggled to meet even the lowest ambitions.

While it was politics inside the Blue Zone, the negotiating area of the conference, the Green Zone, a kind of a climate-focussed trade show, had an altogether different kind of energy.

Small coffee growers, Indigenous craft sellers, and companies were hawking all kinds of potential solutions towards adapting to climate changes, many of them designed for developing countries.

The place was packed with young Brazilians and others soaking up the possibility of creating small-scale solutions at local levels to deal with impossible heat and to grow renewable energy. Official power wasn’t in the Green Zone, but it felt as powerful.

Brazil launched COP30 with beautiful images of the Amazon waterways, toucans and untouched jungle. “It was very important for us to show the Amazon as it truly is,” said President Luiz Anácio Lula da Silva, “to embed it in the minds of people around the world.”

Yet on the political side, as we reported from Oiapoque,1,000 km north, Brazil greenlighted a first exploratory oil well off the Amazon coast, reupping its position as a proud and significant oil producer.

Lula, who is running again for president next year, was vocal in trying to assure the world that he supports moving away from oil and gas, and called for a “roadmap” to do so.

“Everyone must understand their responsibility,” he said. “We must show society that we are serious … we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Lula told delegates halfway through the conference.

But that push for a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels was a non-starter . The same powerful oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and others, and some developing countries who want to exploit their own resources, shut it down.

Canada concluded that pushing for a roadmap on fossil fuels at this conference was impractical. In a statement from Environment and Climate Change Canada, it said it still supports transitioning away from oil and gas, even as Prime Minister Mark Carney this week threw political support behind the possibility of a new oil pipeline in the west.

The Amazonian COP also promised Indigenous participation not seen before, accrediting over 360 delegates and encouraging side events for hundreds of others. A flotilla of boats sailed for 27 days crossing three international borders, picking up Indigenous participants from the Andes to the Amazon, before arriving in Guajará Bay in Belém. Demonstrations during the conference pushed the leadership to give them more voice.

We spoke with one of the travellers, an Indigenous man from Ecuador who came by boat.

“It was a good experience,” said Wia Kawia.

“The most important thing is we are here together, because today we have borders that divide people but at the end of the day we are all brothers and sisters part of the same humanity.”

“Here we are moving in the same direction with the same goals to preserve nature,” he said.

But on the question of fossil fuels, this conference did not move in the same direction.

In fact a splinter group is taking things into their own hands.

Columbia, with the Netherlands, and with the support of Brazil, is hosting its own conference in April to tackle the thorniest issue which defies consensus: How does the world move away from oil, coal and gas?

[TITLE]Oil Markets Lackluster Amid Russia Peace Deal, China’s Stockpiling:
[TEXT]
Sentiment in oil markets remains overwhelmingly negative, driven by perceived market oversupply and negative global demand indicators. Brent crude for January delivery was trading at $63.10 per barrel in Thursday’s intraday session, little changed from $62.97 a week ago while the corresponding WTI contract ticked up slightly to $58.70/bbl from $58.46. Meanwhile, the recent rally in oil product prices has cooled off, with ICE Gasoil-Brent crack dropping from a 35.84/bbl peak on 18 November to ~$26/bbl. This is partly due to the easing of panic over the delivery specification into the ICE gasoil futures contract.

Market focus remains firmly on the supply-side, with a view that any progress towards a ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine could lead to easing of heavy U.S. sanctions on Russian producers. The Trump administration has drafted a new 19-point peace plan that’s far more favorable to Ukraine compared to the original 28-point plan. Some of the critical amendments in the new plan include no handover of the Donbas region to Russia for free, no automatic veto on Ukraine joining NATO in the future, and provision of Article 5-style protection for Ukraine, meaning the U.S. would be bound to intervene if Russia invades in the future. A proposal for full amnesty for war crimes that was part of the first plan has also been removed.

China remains the leading buyer of Russian crude, with imports increasing by 275.6 kb/d over the past two months to ~2.15 mb/d. Overall, China’s crude imports have increased by 866 kb/d Y/Y to 11.44 mb/d as the country continues to stockpile crude. Rystad Energy estimates that China has stockpiled more than 1 million barrels of crude per day in some months, socking away nearly 160 million barrels in the first nine months of 2025. The buying spree has been triggered by strategic concerns like energy security and potential conflicts, as well as taking advantage of low oil prices. China is expected to continue stockpiling crude oil at least through 2026, supported by new laws and infrastructure development that allow for greater storage capacity, though some analysts suggest the pace might slow as storage limits are reached.

Potential U.S. intervention in Venezuela has also added to the bearish sentiment after the Trump administration designated Cartel de los Soles, which it alleges is led by President Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. The US’ Operation Southern Spear has been targeting boats suspected of trafficking drugs in the region, with the hawks linking the moves to Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the largest of any country.

Venezuelan oil production has been on a sharp decline since 2017, with a slew of sanctions prohibiting its access to financial markets. However, production has been slowly rising, from 360 kb/d in 2020 to around 1 mb/d currently, supported by black-market sales. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that it will take years before the South American country can hit peak production of around 2.5 mb/d that it achieved in the 2011-2015 period thanks to years of underinvestment in maturing oil fields as well as a lack of exploration drilling. Shortages of equipment, supplies and labour have also taken a toll on Venezuela’s energy sector. Further, the country is likely to have a hard time attracting fresh capital after the ConocoPhilips (NYSE:COP) debacle. The Venezuelan government under the late Hugo Chávez, and continued under Nicolás Maduro, expropriated ConocoPhillips' oil assets in 2007 during a wave of nationalizations of foreign oil investments. This led to ConocoPhillips receiving two major international arbitration awards totaling over $8 billion. Venezuela's attempts to annul the awards have failed, and ConocoPhillips is now pursuing legal avenues to enforce the rulings and collect the compensation from Venezuela's remaining overseas assets, such as those related to the Citgo refinery.

On the gas front, European natural gas prices have softened, with the front-month Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) contract for December delivery settling below EUR 30 per megawatt hour

(MWh) at EUR 29.5/MWh, its lowest settlement in 18 months. European natural gas inventories drew by 3.76 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 91.97bcm on 23 November, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. This marks the largest weekly fall in inventories since late February 2025. Recent cold weather has not supported prices, and there are now mild forecasts for the rest of December.

In contrast, U.S. gas prices have continued rallying, with gas futures hitting $4.6/MMBtu on falling inventories coupled with expectations of higher demand. Weather forecasts suggest temperatures will remain mostly below normal over the next two weeks, boosting demand. Further, U.S. LNG exports are rising, with flows averaging a record 18 bcfd in November, up from October’s 16.6 bcfd.

[TITLE]Europe's energy capital: How the Budget's going down in Aberdeen:
[TEXT]
Europe's energy capital: How the Budget's going down in Aberdeen

1 day ago Share Save Craig Williams and Rebecca Curran BBC Scotland Share Save

PA Media The city and port of Aberdeen are tied into the North Sea oil and gas industry

Aberdeen is an oil and gas city and has been for more than 50 years. The city's port is filled with the busy traffic which services the North Sea industry. The skies above buzz with the helicopters which dart back and forth between the city's airport and the near 300 platforms which sit in the UK's waters. The industry serving those is huge and covers all sectors from cutting edge technology through engineering and logistics to those firms which feed and water the workers offshore. An estimated 200,000 jobs rely on what happens in the waters of the North Sea. That includes those who work in Aberdeen's pubs and hotels and even those who drive its taxis. And that's why what was announced in Wednesday's Budget matters.

The news that there would be some relaxation of restrictions on new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea was something those in the sector could welcome. A UK government review will allow small "tiebacks" - subsea links permitting extraction to go ahead in fields where existing oil and gas fields stray into currently-unlicenced areas. That ought to help prolong the future of the sector, perhaps keeping people in skilled jobs while the UK economy moves its energy balance away from fossil fuels towards renewables. It also brings UK ministers closer to their counterparts in Edinburgh, where the Scottish government has moved away from its earlier "presumption against" new oil and gas extraction. But there was disappointment that the Chancellor made no move to scrap the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) - the so-called "windfall tax" - which was introduced by the Conservative government in 2022 following a boost in oil and gas profits caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's due to stay in place until 2030 and there have been constant and repeated calls for it to be scrapped amid claims it's damaging the North Sea industry.

Mark Milne has owned the Spider's Web bar in Dyce for 36 years

Mark Milne is one of those Aberdeen business owners who, at first glance, doesn't seem connected to the oil and gas industry. But he is. He's owned the Spider's Web pub for 36 years. It sits in the suburb of Dyce, on the north-west edge of the city. It's close to a heliport and is the first stop for many workers touching down after weeks offshore. That leaves him well qualified to notice what's happening. To his own living and to his customers' businesses and jobs. "We've seen a dip in the oil and gas customers and that's onshore and offshore. A lot of the oil offices that were here are not. There's a horrible example just along the road of a great office building torn down this week," he said. "Those were all my customers. We do still get plenty of oil and gas people coming in but maybe not as many and, are they as confident to spend?". Mark says this is a worry for him, his staff, his neighbours. "I speak to the hairdresser up the road. There's not the same people going through Dyce. It affects everybody." He says "100%" of his oil and gas customers believe the UK government is not doing enough for the industry, both through the windfall tax and "the green issues, not allowing redevelopments and what have you". "It's a great industry with a great future. It creates wealth, it creates jobs. Well-paid jobs. And it seems like the government is happy to see these things go," he said.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks MP was visiting Aberdeen after the Budget

On the day after the Budget, UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks was in Aberdeen, where his government has committed to basing the state-owned energy company Great British Energy. Visiting an offshore training centre, he defended the importance of the ELP, which he said had raised £11bn for investment in public services. He believes the oil and gas sector has to do its bit and contribute to the overall tax take. But speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live, he said the problems being experienced in the North Sea could not be blamed on the ELP. "This isn't a short-term transition that suddenly arrived in the North Sea. We hit peak oil and gas more than 20 years ago," he said. "We've been a net importer since 2003 and we have lost more than 70,000 jobs in the past decade. So the idea that somehow this isn't a transition that isn't already underway, I think is quite wrong. "Our plan as a government is to say: 'Look, oil and gas is hugely important and will be for decades to come. But in order to make sure that that this is genuinely a prosperous and just transition we also have to drive forward the investment in what comes next'. "That means investment in offshore wind, carbon capture, hydrogen. But it also means making it as easy as possible for people to find those jobs."

[TITLE]The EU’s grand new plan to replace fossil fuels with trees:
[TEXT]
At the center of the strategy is carbon, the fundamental building block of a wide range of manufactured products, not just energy. Almost all plastic, for example, is made from carbon, and currently most of that carbon comes from oil and natural gas.

But fossil fuels have two major drawbacks: they pollute the atmosphere with planet-warming CO2, and they are mostly imported from outside the EU, compromising the bloc's strategic autonomy.

The bioeconomy strategy aims to address both drawbacks by using locally produced or recycled carbon-rich biomass rather than imported fossil fuels. It proposes doing this by setting targets in relevant legislation, such as the EU's packaging waste laws, helping bioeconomy startups access finance, harmonizing the regulatory regime and encouraging new biomass supply.

The 23-page strategy is light on legislative or funding promises, mostly piggybacking on existing laws and funds. Still, it was hailed by industries that stand to gain from a bigger market for biological materials.

“The forest industry welcomes the Commission’s growth-oriented approach for bioeconomy,” said Viveka Beckeman, director general of the Swedish Forest Industries Federation, stressing the need to “boost the use of biomass as a strategic resource that benefits not only green transition and our joint climate goals but the overall economic security.”

How renewable is it?

But environmentalists worry Brussels may be getting too chainsaw-happy.

[TITLE]PetroChina and PipeChina Launch $3.6 Billion Gas Storage Joint Ventures:
[TEXT]
China’s PetroChina and state-owned pipeline operator PipeChina have jointly established two major gas storage companies, part of Beijing’s broader effort to expand natural gas capacity and stabilize energy supply amid growing demand.

According to corporate registration data, the new ventures — Liaohe Gas Storage in northeast China and Xinjiang Gas Storage in the northwest — were officially set up this week with combined registered capital exceeding 25.6 billion yuan ($3.62 billion). Liaohe will focus on storage and logistics, while Xinjiang will handle gas production and supply.

The move follows PetroChina’s earlier proposal to acquire these assets, along with the Xiangguosi Gas Storage in southwest China, from its parent company CNPC in a 40.02-billion-yuan ($5.65 billion) deal. Once complete, the transactions will add nearly 11 billion cubic meters (bcm) of working gas storage capacity to PetroChina’s portfolio, marking a significant expansion of its domestic infrastructure.

China’s Rapid Rise in Gas Storage Capacity

China has made the largest gains in underground gas storage (UGS) capacity globally since 2022, according to a new International Gas Union (IGU) report. The country added 6 bcm of new capacity, lifting it to sixth place worldwide, behind the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, Canada, and Germany.

The IGU noted that while gas storage growth in developed markets has plateaued, China continues to expand aggressively, viewing gas as both a bridge fuel for its energy transition and a safeguard against volatile global LNG prices.

Securing Supply and Reducing Volatility

By bolstering domestic storage, Beijing aims to reduce reliance on imported spot LNG cargoes — a key vulnerability during global energy price swings. Earlier this year, PetroChina’s purchase of CNPC’s storage assets consolidated control over a vital segment of the gas value chain, enhancing its ability to manage seasonal demand surges.

China’s first underground salt cavern gas storage facility, recently expanded and operational, further strengthens the nation’s resilience to winter demand spikes.

With natural gas positioned as a transitional energy source, China’s growing storage capacity underlines its strategy to ensure reliability, affordability, and supply security in an era of fluctuating global markets.

China remains the leading buyer of Russian crude, with imports increasing by 275.6 kb/d over the past two months to ~2.15 mb/d. Overall, China’s crude imports have increased by 866 kb/d Y/Y to 11.44 mb/d as the country continues to stockpile crude. Rystad Energy estimates that China has stockpiled more than 1 million barrels of crude per day in some months, socking away nearly 160 million barrels in the first nine months of 2025. The buying spree has been triggered by strategic concerns like energy security and potential conflicts, as well as taking advantage of low oil prices. China is expected to continue stockpiling crude oil at least through 2026, supported by new laws and infrastructure development that allow for greater storage capacity, though some analysts suggest the pace might slow as storage limits are reached.

Potential U.S. intervention in Venezuela has also added to the bearish sentiment after the Trump administration designated Cartel de los Soles, which it alleges is led by President Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. The US’ Operation Southern Spear has been targeting boats suspected of trafficking drugs in the region, with the hawks linking the moves to Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the largest of any country.

Venezuelan oil production has been on a sharp decline since 2017, with a slew of sanctions prohibiting its access to financial markets. However, production has been slowly rising, from 360 kb/d in 2020 to around 1 mb/d currently, supported by black-market sales. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that it will take years before the South American country can hit peak production of around 2.5 mb/d that it achieved in the 2011-2015 period thanks to years of underinvestment in maturing oil fields as well as a lack of exploration drilling. Shortages of equipment, supplies and labour have also taken a toll on Venezuela’s energy sector. Further, the country is likely to have a hard time attracting fresh capital after the ConocoPhilips (NYSE:COP) debacle. The Venezuelan government under the late Hugo Chávez, and continued under Nicolás Maduro, expropriated ConocoPhillips' oil assets in 2007 during a wave of nationalizations of foreign oil investments. This led to ConocoPhillips receiving two major international arbitration awards totaling over $8 billion. Venezuela's attempts to annul the awards have failed, and ConocoPhillips is now pursuing legal avenues to enforce the rulings and collect the compensation from Venezuela's remaining overseas assets, such as those related to the Citgo refinery.

On the gas front, European natural gas prices have softened, with the front-month Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) contract for December delivery settling below EUR 30 per megawatt hour

(MWh) at EUR 29.5/MWh, its lowest settlement in 18 months. European natural gas inventories drew by 3.76 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 91.97bcm on 23 November, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. This marks the largest weekly fall in inventories since late February 2025. Recent cold weather has not supported prices, and there are now mild forecasts for the rest of December.

In contrast, U.S. gas prices have continued rallying, with gas futures hitting $4.6/MMBtu on falling inventories coupled with expectations of higher demand. Weather forecasts suggest temperatures will remain mostly below normal over the next two weeks, boosting demand. Further, U.S. LNG exports are rising, with flows averaging a record 18 bcfd in November, up from October’s 16.6 bcfd.

[TITLE]Europe's energy capital: How the Budget's going down in Aberdeen:
[TEXT]
Europe's energy capital: How the Budget's going down in Aberdeen

1 day ago Share Save Craig Williams and Rebecca Curran BBC Scotland Share Save

PA Media The city and port of Aberdeen are tied into the North Sea oil and gas industry

Aberdeen is an oil and gas city and has been for more than 50 years. The city's port is filled with the busy traffic which services the North Sea industry. The skies above buzz with the helicopters which dart back and forth between the city's airport and the near 300 platforms which sit in the UK's waters. The industry serving those is huge and covers all sectors from cutting edge technology through engineering and logistics to those firms which feed and water the workers offshore. An estimated 200,000 jobs rely on what happens in the waters of the North Sea. That includes those who work in Aberdeen's pubs and hotels and even those who drive its taxis. And that's why what was announced in Wednesday's Budget matters.

The news that there would be some relaxation of restrictions on new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea was something those in the sector could welcome. A UK government review will allow small "tiebacks" - subsea links permitting extraction to go ahead in fields where existing oil and gas fields stray into currently-unlicenced areas. That ought to help prolong the future of the sector, perhaps keeping people in skilled jobs while the UK economy moves its energy balance away from fossil fuels towards renewables. It also brings UK ministers closer to their counterparts in Edinburgh, where the Scottish government has moved away from its earlier "presumption against" new oil and gas extraction. But there was disappointment that the Chancellor made no move to scrap the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) - the so-called "windfall tax" - which was introduced by the Conservative government in 2022 following a boost in oil and gas profits caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's due to stay in place until 2030 and there have been constant and repeated calls for it to be scrapped amid claims it's damaging the North Sea industry.

Mark Milne has owned the Spider's Web bar in Dyce for 36 years

Mark Milne is one of those Aberdeen business owners who, at first glance, doesn't seem connected to the oil and gas industry. But he is. He's owned the Spider's Web pub for 36 years. It sits in the suburb of Dyce, on the north-west edge of the city. It's close to a heliport and is the first stop for many workers touching down after weeks offshore. That leaves him well qualified to notice what's happening. To his own living and to his customers' businesses and jobs. "We've seen a dip in the oil and gas customers and that's onshore and offshore. A lot of the oil offices that were here are not. There's a horrible example just along the road of a great office building torn down this week," he said. "Those were all my customers. We do still get plenty of oil and gas people coming in but maybe not as many and, are they as confident to spend?". Mark says this is a worry for him, his staff, his neighbours. "I speak to the hairdresser up the road. There's not the same people going through Dyce. It affects everybody." He says "100%" of his oil and gas customers believe the UK government is not doing enough for the industry, both through the windfall tax and "the green issues, not allowing redevelopments and what have you". "It's a great industry with a great future. It creates wealth, it creates jobs. Well-paid jobs. And it seems like the government is happy to see these things go," he said.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks MP was visiting Aberdeen after the Budget

On the day after the Budget, UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks was in Aberdeen, where his government has committed to basing the state-owned energy company Great British Energy. Visiting an offshore training centre, he defended the importance of the ELP, which he said had raised £11bn for investment in public services. He believes the oil and gas sector has to do its bit and contribute to the overall tax take. But speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live, he said the problems being experienced in the North Sea could not be blamed on the ELP. "This isn't a short-term transition that suddenly arrived in the North Sea. We hit peak oil and gas more than 20 years ago," he said. "We've been a net importer since 2003 and we have lost more than 70,000 jobs in the past decade. So the idea that somehow this isn't a transition that isn't already underway, I think is quite wrong. "Our plan as a government is to say: 'Look, oil and gas is hugely important and will be for decades to come. But in order to make sure that that this is genuinely a prosperous and just transition we also have to drive forward the investment in what comes next'. "That means investment in offshore wind, carbon capture, hydrogen. But it also means making it as easy as possible for people to find those jobs."

[TITLE]The EU’s grand new plan to replace fossil fuels with trees:
[TEXT]
At the center of the strategy is carbon, the fundamental building block of a wide range of manufactured products, not just energy. Almost all plastic, for example, is made from carbon, and currently most of that carbon comes from oil and natural gas.

But fossil fuels have two major drawbacks: they pollute the atmosphere with planet-warming CO2, and they are mostly imported from outside the EU, compromising the bloc's strategic autonomy.

The bioeconomy strategy aims to address both drawbacks by using locally produced or recycled carbon-rich biomass rather than imported fossil fuels. It proposes doing this by setting targets in relevant legislation, such as the EU's packaging waste laws, helping bioeconomy startups access finance, harmonizing the regulatory regime and encouraging new biomass supply.

The 23-page strategy is light on legislative or funding promises, mostly piggybacking on existing laws and funds. Still, it was hailed by industries that stand to gain from a bigger market for biological materials.

“The forest industry welcomes the Commission’s growth-oriented approach for bioeconomy,” said Viveka Beckeman, director general of the Swedish Forest Industries Federation, stressing the need to “boost the use of biomass as a strategic resource that benefits not only green transition and our joint climate goals but the overall economic security.”

How renewable is it?

But environmentalists worry Brussels may be getting too chainsaw-happy.

[TITLE]Electric container ships won’t work – but a fleet of auxiliary battery ships could clean up shipping:
[TEXT]
Shipping moves 90% of global trade and produces nearly 3% of global emissions. The sector has proved challenging to clean up, as cargo ships can travel for weeks between ports and typically rely on cheap, energy-dense and extremely polluting heavy fuel oil.

Earlier this year, international efforts to move shipping towards net zero by using cleaner fuels fell apart under pressure from the United States. But as battery prices fall year on year, there might be another way forward.

Electric ferries already shuttle passengers and cars on short routes, while harbour tugs and inland cargo vessels are also going electric. At present, electrification works best over modest distances where charging can happen at the dock.

Could it ever work for container ships crisscrossing oceans? These giants can travel from China to Europe without refuelling due to the energy density of oil. The weight and expense of battery packs means it would be hard to swap oil for batteries.

But electrification isn’t all or nothing. Batteries would need to begin by operating alongside liquid fuels. In recent research, I lay out two potential ways to do this: using onboard battery packs and charging at ports, or connecting container ships to dedicated battery vessels.

How can batteries best help move cargo?

Electrification is worthwhile as a way to cut emissions and potentially save money. The question is how to do it – and whether it stacks up economically.

Placing batteries permanently on the ship is intuitive, matching the main way battery packs are used in electric cars, buses and trucks. In this scenario, ships would recharge in ports and also ideally at sea to make the most of the expensive batteries.

The second approach is different. Here, container ships able to propel themselves using fuel or electricity would tap into a global fleet of smaller battery vessels.

A container ship would link to a battery vessel and use its stored power as the vessel moves alongside it. The battery vessel would then peel off and return to port to charge up again. Battery vessels already exist, but at smaller scale. One option would be tightly integrating battery vessels, like the submarine swallowed by the ship in the Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me.

My modelling shows a container ship going from China to Europe could be powered by battery vessels between Chinese ports and Singapore. It would then use fuel to go from Singapore to Sri Lanka and then to the Horn of Africa. A lack of nearby land means battery vessels would have to power the ship for more than four days, which would be economical only if marine-rated battery prices fell extremely low (under A$100 per kilowatt-hour).

Once at the Horn of Africa, the ship could switch back to battery vessels that charge using the region’s booming solar capacity to go through the Red and Mediterranean Seas to northern Europe. My modelling suggests it would take 33 battery vessels to go from China to northern Europe.

Is it economically viable?

My modelling suggests it doesn’t make economic sense to install large battery packs on ships. For each giant New Panamax container ship, it would cost almost A$150 million to install 600 megawatt-hours of storage at $232,000 per MWh. Batteries rated for ocean conditions are more expensive. Fully charged, this giant battery pack would propel a container ship for 24 hours –

[TITLE]The Green Swap: Recalibrating Sovereign Finance for Climate and Development Symbiosis:
[TEXT]
The contemporary global economy stands at a pivotal inflection point — one at which debt sustainability and climate resilience can no longer be regarded as orthogonal policy domains but as mutually constitutive imperatives within a single macro-financial system. For many emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), the convergence of mounting debt-servicing obligations and intensifying climate-induced losses has produced a structural impasse that systematically corrodes fiscal sovereignty and constrains developmental agency.

As International Monetary Fund (IMF) economists Kristalina Georgieva, Marcos Chamon and Vimal Thakoor underscore, nations most exposed to climate volatility paradoxically possess the least fiscal latitude to invest in adaptation, thus perpetuating a self-reinforcing cycle of fragility, underinvestment and vulnerability. In effect, climate exposure has ceased to be a derivative symptom of economic frailty and has instead become one of its primary causal mechanisms.

Despite the surge in global clean-energy investment — which is now approaching double that of fossil-fuel expenditures — the geographical asymmetry of this transition remains acute. Only

[TITLE]Why an ASEAN power grid is key to tapping Southeast Asia’s green potential:
[TEXT]
The International Energy Agency reports that energy demand across Southeast Asia rose at twice the global average rate in 2024 and finds that consumption is set to double by 2050. To maintain rising living standards, economies across the region are pushing into higher-value and more energy-intense industries, data centres being one obvious example.

That creates a problem.

The ASEAN nations enjoy vast but as yet largely untapped potential for renewable energy, especially PV solar, and onshore and offshore wind. The IEA puts potential supply at 20 terawatts, roughly 55 times the region’s present generation capacity. And this energy would be cheap. But the increase in overall demand is for now far outpacing new supply from renewables. Until that changes, ASEAN nations remain dependent on rising fossil fuel imports that expose them to price risk, potential supply disruptions, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Asian corporate executives have focused recently on coping with tariffs and trade restrictions, potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical insecurity—rather than energy and power. In the latest EY-Parthenon Global CEO Outlook survey, Asia-Pacific CEOs expressed greater unease than their peers in Europe and the Americas

Green Hydrogen: An Alternative That Reduces Emissions And Cares For Our Planet

The decarbonisation of the planet is among the objectives that countries around the world have set for 2050. The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels.

Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen.

Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market

This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points:

100 % sustainable: green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production.

green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production. Storable: hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production.

hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production. Versatile: green hydrogen can be transformed into electricity or synthetic gas and used for commercial, industrial or mobility purposes.

However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind:

High cost: energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain.

energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain. High energy consumption: the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels.

the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels. Safety issues: hydrogen is a highly volatile and flammable element and extensive safety measures are therefore required to prevent leakage and explosions.

Impact of green hydrogen

Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future:

Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner.

Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter.

Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

[TITLE]ET AI Awards 2025: Nominate now for the AI for Energy & Utility Optimisation category:
[TEXT]
India’s energy sector stands at a critical juncture, balancing surging demand with ambitious decarbonisation commitments. The nation’s energy demand is set to double by 2030, whilst renewable energy capacity is projected to cross 500 gigawatts before that milestone, requiring unprecedented grid sophistication, according to government projections. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the enabling technology for this transition, transforming how utilities forecast generation, balance loads, manage infrastructure, and prevent blackouts. In September 2025, Grid India, the national load dispatch centre operator, announced plans to embed AI deep into operations of the world’s largest unified power grid for real-time risk detection, fault prediction and market manipulation surveillance, marking a strategic shift from forecasting to deploying AI as a core reliability and security layer. The ET AI Awards 2025 recognise this transformation through a dedicated category honouring large enterprises using AI to redefine energy and utility operations.The Energy & Utility Optimisation award celebrates large-scale power companies, grid operators, renewable energy developers, and utilities that have operationalised AI across critical functions, including renewable energy forecasting for solar and wind variability management, smart grid optimisation for load balancing and voltage stability, predictive maintenance to reduce equipment failures and outages, demand-side management for peak load reduction and energy efficiency, transmission and distribution loss reduction, which currently stands at 20% to 30% in India, according to government data, energy storage optimisation for battery dispatch and lifecycle management, and cybersecurity and fraud detection for grid protection and revenue assurance. Excellence requires demonstrating measurable outcomes in reliability, cost efficiency, carbon reduction, or grid resilience, supported by operational data and independent validation.This category is designed for established power generation companies operating thermal, hydro, nuclear, or renewable assets, transmission and distribution utilities managing state or regional networks, grid operators responsible for load dispatch and system balancing, renewable energy developers with large-scale solar or wind portfolios, integrated energy companies spanning generation through retail supply, and smart metering and energy management technology providers serving utility clients. Eligible organisations typically manage gigawatt-scale generation or distribution capacity, serve millions of customers across multiple states, operate critical national or regional grid infrastructure, and face complex regulatory oversight from bodies such as the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. Nominations should demonstrate production-level AI deployments with sustained operational impact, not experimental pilots or laboratory prototypes.What distinguishes award-winning energy AI from incremental automation? First, operational validation through real-world performance under stress conditions, including peak demand periods, extreme weather events, or renewable variability. In Gujarat, AI-driven models reduced the gap between predicted and actual solar power generation by 30 per cent, helping grid operators optimise energy distribution according to government pilot data. Second, measurable impact on grid reliability and efficiency. Grid India’s new AI systems will detect weak points and abnormal patterns across geographically dispersed assets using real-time streaming data at 40-millisecond resolution, helping avert wide-area blackouts by shifting from reactive post-fault analysis to predictive, pre-fault intervention. Third, contribution to India’s renewable energy integration challenge. States such asKarnataka, where solar and wind contribute 29 per cent of annual electricity generation, Rajasthan at 20 per cent, Tamil Nadu at 18 per cent, and Gujarat at 14 per cent, require sophisticated AI to manage intermittency and maintain grid stability. Fourth, responsible deployment addressing data privacy, cybersecurity and equitable access. AI must protect critical infrastructure whilst ensuring benefits reach both urban and rural areas.AI transformation in Indian energy manifests across multiple domains. In renewable forecasting, machine learning (ML) analyses weather patterns, satellite imagery, and historical performance to predict solar and wind generation hours ahead, enabling grid operators to schedule backup capacity and maintain frequency stability. In grid management, Tata Power has operationalised AI through partnerships with BluWave-ai, deploying cloud-based real-time operations that enhance baseline systems, improve operational efficiency, and support the company’s ambitious renewable energy targets. In predictive maintenance, AI analyses Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data to identify equipment wear or inverter issues before outages occur, allowing maintenance teams to schedule preventive actions during low-demand periods. In demand-side management, AI enables real-time load balancing, optimising energy consumption patterns to reduce peak demand and integrate distributed resources like rooftop solar and electric vehicles. In fraud detection, AI-powered systems analyse consumption patterns to flag unusual activity indicating theft, which remains a significant revenue challenge for Indian utilities. In market operations, generative AI platforms summarise lengthy tender documents, identify risks and opportunities, and reduce review times from days to hours.India’s energy AI adoption faces both opportunities and constraints. Whilst the potential is immense, significant infrastructure gaps persist. According to government data, only 0.44 million distribution transformers, representing just 3 per cent of the total, currently have smart metres functioning in communicating mode, limiting the data foundation required for sophisticated AI applications. India’s existing energy infrastructure is largely outdated and incompatible withthe latest AI technologies, requiring approximately ₹2,442 billion in grid expansion and related infrastructure investment. Meanwhile, AI itself creates energy demand. According to the International Energy Agency, electricity demand from data centres for AI worldwide is set to more than double by 2030 to around 945 terawatt-hours, whilst in India specifically, AI-driven data centres are predicted to consume an additional 40 to 50 TWh annually by 2030. This paradox requires energy utilities to deploy AI strategically, ensuring that efficiency gains exceed the technology’s own consumption footprint.For large energy organisations, the ET AI Awards 2025 recognition offers strategic advantages. National validation from one of India’s most prestigious legacy business platforms strengthens institutional reputation, validates transformation efforts to boards, investors, and regulators, attracts top technical talent in a competitive market for AI and energy expertise, enhances stakeholder confidence through third-party endorsement, supports dialogue with policymakers on grid modernisation frameworks and incentive schemes, and provides benchmarking insights through exposure to peer achievements. Winners gain a dedicated profile on EconomicTimes.com, extensive media coverage, and invitations to energy policy forums where partnerships with technology providers, research institutions and international collaborators emerge.Recognising excellence in energy AI accelerates national climate and energy security goals. It sets operational and technical benchmarks that guide smaller utilities and renewable developers, informs policy on AI regulation, grid standards, and data governance, attracts investment into India’s clean energy infrastructure and smart grid technologies, demonstrates to global observers that Indian utilities compete at the innovation frontier, and inspires cross-sector learning as energy innovations find applications in transport electrification, industrial efficiency, and urban planning. By celebrating responsible, impactful AI deployment, the awards strengthen India’s vision of achieving energy self-sufficiency, climate leadership, and universal electricity access.Nominations close on 27 November 2025, with the awards ceremony scheduled for 26 February 2026 in Bengaluru. The evaluation process, overseen by an eminent jury with EY as Knowledge Partner, ensures technical rigour, operational credibility, and alignment with national energy priorities. Whether your strength lies in renewable forecasting, grid optimisation, predictive maintenance, or demand management, this category offers a platform to showcase your leadership in India's AI-powered energy transformation. Supporting documentation should include operational performance data, regulatory compliance certifications, independent technical audits, customer or stakeholder testimonials, and case studies demonstrating AI effectiveness during peak demand or grid stress events.Nominate Here for ET AI Awards 2025

[TITLE]UGI natural gas rate hike scheduled to go into effect:
[TEXT]
A 0.9% increase starts Monday for Lancaster County residents heating their homes with natural gas from UGI Utilities.

The hike will boost the total average monthly bill for a residential customer from $118.43 per month to $119.49 per month, the company reported. The increase is in the portion of the bill that represents the cost of the natural gas itself. By law, that cost is passed on to customers without any markup.
