[TITLE]Palmer Luckey’s Erebor hits $4.3B valuation as regulators advance bank charter:
[TEXT]
Erebor, the digital bank co-founded by tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey and backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, has secured a $4.35 billion post-money valuation after raising $350 million in a funding round led by Lux Capital, according to Axios sources.

The valuation milestone, which underscores growing institutional appetite for banking models tailored to crypto, AI and stablecoin-friendly customers, comes as US banking regulators advance steps toward chartering the company.

Erebor recently received preliminary conditional approval from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a key regulatory hurdle toward becoming a fully licensed bank.

Last week, Erebor’s deposit insurance application was approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is valid for 12 months and will expire if the bank is not formally established or the FDIC doesn’t grant an extension.

As Axios reported, investors in the latest funding round include new participants alongside earlier backers such as Founders Fund, Haun Ventures and 8VC. The company’s valuation reflects heightened enthusiasm for financial institutions that blend traditional banking services with digital asset infrastructure.

Luckey first rose to prominence as the founder of Oculus VR, the virtual reality headset company acquired by Facebook, and later as a co-founder of Anduril Industries, a defense contractor.

Erebor emerged from stealth in mid-2025 as a response to banking sector gaps, particularly for startups and crypto ventures, that widened after the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).

SVB, once the primary banking partner for many venture-backed technology companies, failed in March 2023 after rapid interest-rate hikes eroded the value of its long-term securities and sparked a depositor run, leading to one of the largest bank failures since the 2008 financial crisis.

Digital asset banking services emerge in the wake of regulatory clarity

Erebor is among a growing cohort of digital asset-focused companies pushing into the banking sector, alongside crypto exchange Coinbase, stablecoin issuer Circle and payment company Ripple Labs, which have sought national trust charters or similar approvals from the OCC.

Such applications are typically aimed at expanding digital-asset custody and settlement services and, in Coinbase’s case, bridging traditional financial infrastructure with onchain finance by operating under a federal banking framework.

The applications come amid a renewed push for regulatory clarity in the United States following the election of US President Donald Trump. The shift has included the approval of key stablecoin legislation and the emergence of a long-awaited crypto market structure bill, which, despite delays, has fueled optimism across the digital asset industry.

Meanwhile, David Sacks, Trump’s crypto and AI czar, wrote Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to issue “clear regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrencies.”

His comments followed developments at the CFTC, including leadership changes involving Mike Selig, underscoring expectations of a more defined regulatory framework for digital assets.

[TITLE]LanzaTech Reaches 53% Non-Controlling Ownership Milestone in LanzaJet:
[TEXT]
SKOKIE, Ill., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), a leader in carbon transformation technology, today announced an increase in its holdings of LanzaJet, Inc. (“LanzaJet”), a leading sustainable aviation fuel technology provider and fuels producer, to 53%. This announcement follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM-certified sustainable fuels including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Renewable Diesel (RD) at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale plant to produce jet fuel from ethanol.

On December 16, 2025, LanzaTech received its final tranches of LanzaJet common stock, which brings the Company’s ownership percentage and non-controlling interest in LanzaJet to 53%. These issuances of common stock were made pursuant to the Second Amended & Restated LanzaJet Investment Agreement and represent the final equity tranches under that agreement. The shares were issued in accordance with pre-agreed terms and do not reflect any new capital investment by LanzaTech.

This ownership increase is in accordance with a previously signed agreement which allowed LanzaJet to further sublicense the Alcohol-to-Jet (“ATJ”) technology in exchange for additional equity issued to LanzaTech.

LanzaTech’s platform, originally developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and the U.S. Department of Energy, enables the production of ethanol from a variety of carbon sources, including agricultural residues, which LanzaJet can use to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or “SAF”, using its industry-leading Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. By utilizing a diverse array of domestic and waste feedstocks, including those from the agricultural sector, this approach has the potential to both reduce aviation emissions by up to 85% and strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security. Through distributed production and flexible sourcing, LanzaTech and LanzaJet are striving to open new economic opportunities for rural communities and fortify the reliability and sustainability of fuel supply chains.

LanzaTech’s strategic decision to spin out LanzaJet in 2020 was driven by a vision to accelerate the development and deployment of ethanol-to-jet solutions. Today, with a 53% ownership stake, LanzaTech is reinforcing its commitment to LanzaJet’s success and to scaling this vital technology worldwide.

“LanzaTech’s increased stake in LanzaJet comes at an important time for the sustainable fuels sector,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech and Chair of LanzaJet. “The success of LanzaJet’s Freedom Pine’s facility shows that ethanol from diverse domestic and recycled feedstocks—such as waste gases, municipal solid waste, captured CO₂ with hydrogen, and agricultural residues—can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. We believe that this innovation not only expands supply options but also establishes ethanol as a vital connector between distributed carbon sources and global aviation markets.”

The sustainable aviation fuel industry remains capital-intensive and subject to evolving regulatory and market dynamics. LanzaJet, like many in the sector, is managing operational and financial pressures as it scales. LanzaTech’s increased equity interest does not imply a change in governance or control.

LanzaTech and LanzaJet continue to collaborate on new projects and licensing opportunities via their CirculAir™ offering, leveraging the strengths of both organizations to work towards delivering new energy solutions and driving lasting impact in the aviation industry.

Accounting Impact of Transaction

The Company’s interest in LanzaJet is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with income (loss) from equity method investments, net, including gain on dilution, recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and equity method investments recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

[TITLE]AI-linked IPOs in China are exploding. But it's not easy for foreigners to join the party:
[TEXT]
China's hottest artificial-intelligence listings are delivering eye-popping gains.

Shares of chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits skyrocketed almost 700% in their Shanghai market debut last week, while Moore Threads soared over 400% on its first day of trading earlier this month.

While domestic investors scramble for exposure to promising Chinese tech listings, overseas investors are largely left out from partaking in such blockbuster offerings.

Foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs: "It's not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker," said Chris Zhang, executive director at Chinese financial services firm China Fortune Securities Company.

Opening an onshore brokerage account with a Chinese securities firm requires a linked Chinese bank account, which generally requires a proof of residence in China, or a Chinese visa with sufficient validity. Foreigners also need to already hold other mainland-listed shares before being eligible to participate in an IPO lottery.

Most foreign banks do not have the necessary arrangements with Chinese brokers to support account openings, Zhang said, making the process unworkable for the vast majority of overseas retail investors.

Official guidance from Shanghai's city government states that only a narrow set of foreign individuals can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares — stocks listed in mainland China. For example, foreigners with permanent resident status, workers in China, or foreigners working abroad with equity incentive plans in A-share listed companies.

For many global investors, Stock Connect, a program that allows Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges mutual access to each other's stocks, is the most convenient way to gain exposure to Chinese equities.

It allows overseas investors to buy A-shares through their Hong Kong brokers without needing an onshore account, or special licenses— but the scheme offers little help when it comes to IPOs, or even freshly listed stocks. Access also depends on Hong Kong brokers' eligibility requirements, such as minimum account balances and risk disclosures.

"Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually it takes a few weeks to months should the stocks qualify," said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.

Inclusion of companies in the Stock Connect scheme depends on whether a stock meets the eligibility rules such as sufficient trading activity and market value, which often requires a period of trading and data history for qualifying.

[TITLE]Wall Street banked on a flurry of deals under Trump in 2025. It wasn't that simple:
[TEXT]

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025. Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull. "If volumes aren't growing, you can't sit still, you've got to think

[TITLE]How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business:
[TEXT]
How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business

toggle caption Pool/Getty Images North America

State capitalism. MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.

Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.

"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace," says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.

"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate," she adds. "It's just bad for the economy."

There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.

Sponsor Message

Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.

Lipton calls this capitalism by "schmoozing," and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.

"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products," she says. "If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody."

Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, "In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership."

China-style 'state capitalism'

Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or "rules-based" capitalism.

Sponsor Message

This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.

But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of "state capitalism," in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it "crony capitalism," meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.

"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that," says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.

In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried "

[TITLE]Stocks Rally as Strength in Tech Boosts Market Sentiment:
[TEXT]
The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Friday closed up by +0.88%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed up by +0.38%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up by +1.31%. March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) rose +0.87%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) rose +1.28%.

Stock indexes settled higher on Friday as a rally in cloud infrastructure stocks improved market sentiment and lifted the broader market. Oracle rose more than 7% after TikTok CEO Chew said his company has signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture owned by American investors, including Oracle. Also, strength in chipmakers on Friday helped lift the overall market.

Friday’s US economic news was mixed for stocks after Nov existing home sales rose to a 9-month high, but the University of Michigan US Dec consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower.

Seasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.

Higher bond yields limited gains in stocks on Friday, as the 10-year T-note yield rose +2 bp to 4.15%. Global bond yields rose on Friday, led by a surge in the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to a 26-year high of 2.025% after the BOJ raised interest rates and said it will keep raising rates if its economic and price outlook is realized.

US Nov existing home sales rose +0.5% m/m to a 9-month high of 4.13 million, though weaker than expectations of 4.15 million.

The University of Michigan US Dec consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised downward by -0.4 to 52.9, weaker than expectations of an upward revision to 53.5.

The University of Michigan US Dec 1-year inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised upward to 4.2% from the previously reported 4.1%.

Upbeat comments on Friday from New York Fed President John Williams were supportive for stocks but negative for bonds, as he said some of the data we're seeing is "pretty encouraging" and he sees no sign of a sharp deterioration in the jobs data. He added that he sees US GDP growth of 1.5% to 1.75% this year, with growth picking up next year, and that there's "no urgency to need to act further on monetary policy right now, because I think the cuts we've made have positioned us really well."

Stock market moves may have been exaggerated and more volatile than usual on Friday due to the expiration of options, futures, and derivatives during the quarterly event known as triple witching. According to Citigroup, a record $7.1 trillion of notional open interest will roll off the US options market on Friday.

The markets are discounting a 22% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on January 27-28.

Overseas stock markets settled higher on Friday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.32%. China’s Shanghai Composite climbed to a 1-week high and closed up +0.36%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +1.03%.

Interest Rates

March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) on Friday closed down by -8 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +2.7 bp to 4.149%. Friday's stock rally reduced safe-haven demand for government debt securities and weighed on T-notes. Also, hawkish comments from New York Fed President John Williams undercut T-note prices when he said some of the data we're seeing is "pretty encouraging" and that he sees no sign of sharp deterioration in the jobs data. In addition, T-notes had a negative carryover from Friday’s jump in the 10-year Japan government bond yield to a 26-year high of 2.025%.

The steepening yield curve is also bearish for T-note prices. Steepening trades occur when bond investors buy short-term government debt and sell long-term debt. The yield curve has steepened since last Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, when the Fed said it would begin purchasing up to $40 billion of short-term T-bills a month to boost liquidity in the financial system. Longer-term Treasury securities are also under pressure from concerns

[TITLE]Sierra AI's $10B Rise and the Age of Enterprise Agents:
[TEXT]
The Gist

Sierra moves from promise to proof. After a $175M raise in late 2024 and $350M more nearly a year later, Sierra reaches $100M ARR in just seven quarters, signaling real enterprise execution rather than speculative AI momentum.

After a $175M raise in late 2024 and $350M more nearly a year later, Sierra reaches $100M ARR in just seven quarters, signaling real enterprise execution rather than speculative AI momentum. Agents become enterprise infrastructure. With Agent OS 2.0, Workspaces, and the Agent Data Platform, Sierra shifts AI agents from one-off conversations to governed, memory-driven systems embedded across regulated workflows.

With Agent OS 2.0, Workspaces, and the Agent Data Platform, Sierra shifts AI agents from one-off conversations to governed, memory-driven systems embedded across regulated workflows. Growth raises the stakes. Sierra’s rapid valuation climb strengthens its category leadership narrative, but sustaining it will depend on continued ROI delivery, agent trust and differentiation as conversational AI becomes table stakes.

If you look at the evolution of conversational AI through the lens of one of the industry's providers, Sierra AI, last year ended with a bang. And so is 2025.

The company's $175 million funding round in December 2024, valuing the startup at $4.5 billion, and then $350M infusion in September 2025 at a $10 billion valuation highlighted then both the immense promise and the challenges of carving out a niche in the competitive conversational AI market.

In July, the momentum didn't slow down in 2025. CMSWire reported in July the projected $50 billion conversational AI market will not be won on technology alone. Agent buy-in remains a decisive factor, particularly in contact centers where frontline employees are asked to trust AI systems that shape workflows, customer outcomes and performance metrics.

Adoption hinges on whether agents see AI as an ally rather than a threat — one that reduces cognitive load, improves accuracy and supports better customer interactions instead of merely accelerating automation or cost-cutting. Without that trust and alignment, even the most advanced conversational platforms risk stalling at deployment rather than delivering real operational impact.

Now back to Sierra AI. It is a perfect company to walk down this particular corridor of the customer service and support market: conversational AI.

Co-founded by former Salesforce Co-CEO Bret Taylor and ex-Google Labs lead Clay Bavor three years ago, Sierra’s positioning highlights a combination of advanced technology and a focus on branding. By emphasizing AI reliability, brand-aligned customization and enterprise integration, the company signals its intent to address key limitations in existing chatbot technologies.

However, as Sierra scales amidst stiff competition and soaring valuations in the broader AI ecosystem, its ability to translate these advantages into long-term enterprise adoption will define its trajectory.

Table of Contents

What Changed Since Sierra’s $175M Raise

And the company's been busy this year. When Sierra AI closed its $175 million funding round in late 2024, the central question was whether its enterprise-first vision could translate into durable execution amid an increasingly crowded conversational AI market. One year later, that question is no longer theoretical.

Last month, Sierra announced it had crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue just seven quarters after launch — a pace that places it among the fastest-growing enterprise software companies on record.

That growth has been fueled by rapid adoption across both digital-native companies and legacy enterprises. Sierra reports customers ranging from fintech and media platforms to healthcare providers, insurers, retailers and home services brands — including organizations founded more than a century ago. The breadth of that adoption reinforces the company’s early thesis: conversational AI would move quickly from experimentation to mission-critical infrastructure, particularly in regulated and operationally complex environments.

Equally important, Sierra’s momentum reframes its valuation story. What initially looked like a bet on potential now reflects measurable enterprise demand, expanding use cases, and increasing operational dependence on AI agents that do more than answer questions. Sierra’s agents now authenticate patients, process financial workflows, originate mortgages, manage returns, and support complex customer journeys across industries — signaling a shift from novelty to necessity.

This comparison builds on the extensive research and benchmarking published by the team at Landbase, who analyzed growth velocity, ARR milestones and category impact across today’s fastest-growing enterprise SaaS companies.

Company Primary Category ARR Milestone Velocity Why It Ranks Here OpenAI AI platform & foundation models Unmatched, platform-scale Defines the AI application layer with massive consumer, developer, and enterprise gravity. Anthropic Enterprise AI & safety Very fast, capital-intensive Enterprise-first model provider setting the standard for safety, compliance, and regulated AI use.

Stripe Payments & financial infrastructure Proven, long-term scale Foundational infrastructure for the internet economy with durable platform lock-in. Databricks Data & AI platform Slower, deeper compounding; $100B worth after $1B Series K Core data backbone for enterprise AI, analytics and lakehouse architectures. Sierra Enterprise agent platform & CX infrastructure $100M ARR in 7 quarters Fastest proof point that agentic AI can operate mission-critical, regulated customer experiences at scale. Perplexity Conversational AI search Fast, consumer-led Reimagines search with cited, conversational answers but remains less operationally embedded. Glean Enterprise AI search & agents Strong, internal-facing Transforms enterprise knowledge access, primarily focused on internal workflows. Workato Automation & integration Steady, scaled growth Critical enterprise automation layer with broad connector ecosystem. ClickHouse Real-time analytics database Rapid infrastructure adoption Essential real-time analytics engine powering AI, security, and observability workloads.

From Capital to Execution: Sierra’s 2025 Proof Points

Sierra’s product roadmap in 2025 offers further evidence that the company is building for scale, not just speed. With the release of Sierra Agent OS 2.0, the platform moves decisively beyond basic conversational automation toward agents with memory, context and the ability to take action across systems. Central to that evolution is Sierra’s Agent Data Platform, which unifies unstructured conversation data with enterprise systems such as billing, inventory, policies and transactions — enabling agents to operate with continuity across time, channels and customer interactions.

The company has also addressed a quieter but equally critical challenge in enterprise AI adoption: governance and collaboration. Sierra’s Workspaces introduce a software-style development model for agents, allowing CX, operations, product and engineering teams to collaborate in parallel, review changes safely and promote updates through controlled release pipelines. By borrowing proven practices from software development — such as versioning, snapshots and staged releases — Sierra positions agents as long-lived products rather than disposable automations.

Together, these developments reinforce Sierra’s original differentiation thesis while extending it. Accuracy and brand alignment remain table stakes, but Sierra’s 2025 strategy emphasizes something more consequential: enabling organizations to treat AI agents as core customer experience infrastructure. In doing so, Sierra shifts the conversation away from cost savings alone and toward long-term customer relationships, operational resilience and measurable business outcomes — the very criteria enterprise buyers increasingly demand.

Strategic Implications of Sierra AI's Growth

Sierra AI's valuation jump from $1 billion to $4.5 billion within a year highlights the investor confidence in its potential to capture market share in the competitive AI marketplace. This growth reflects not only the perceived strength of Sierra’s product offerings but also its ability to position itself as a leader in generative AI solutions, particularly in verticals such as finance and healthcare, where its applications are reportedly gaining traction.

Investor Confidence Signals More Than Capital

Backing from heavyweight investors including Greenoaks Capital, ICONIQ and Thrive Capital signals significant growth expectations. These firms are known for their selective investments in high-growth companies with scalable technology and substantial market opportunities. Their involvement highlights a belief that Sierra AI could rival, or even complement, established giants like OpenAI, whose $500-plus billion valuation dwarfs many other players, and Perplexity AI, which recently hit a $20 billion valuation.

From Early Agent Bet to Category-Defining Scale

Sierra’s $350M capital raise a couple of months ago reinforces how quickly its early thesis has moved from explanation to execution. What began as a bet that AI agents could meaningfully reshape enterprise software has now translated into hundreds of customers across financial services, healthcare, telecommunications, retail and consumer services — including some of the largest and most heavily regulated organizations in the world. More than 20% of Sierra’s customers report annual revenue exceeding $10 billion, and over half surpass $1 billion, signaling adoption not at the edges of the enterprise, but at its core.

The scope of Sierra’s operational footprint further strengthens the strategic case behind its valuation. Sierra-powered agents now reach the majority of U.S. consumers across retail and healthcare, support complex financial workflows on both sides of the Atlantic, and handle high-stakes interactions ranging from mortgage refinancing and insurance inquiries to roadside assistance and network troubleshooting. This breadth of use highlights a shift from experimental AI deployments toward agents as embedded infrastructure — systems that enterprises rely on to resolve real-world problems at massive scale.

Importantly, Sierra is signaling that its growth strategy extends beyond customer acquisition. The company plans to deploy new capital toward deepening its Agent OS platform, expanding internationally, and pushing agents beyond service into revenue-driving use cases such as sales, engagement and lifetime value optimization. That focus reflects a longer-term ambition: to define not just how enterprises deploy AI agents today, but how customer experience platforms evolve as agents become foundational to enterprise operations.

AI Investment Shifts Toward Practical ROI

These funding rounds also reflect a broad surge in AI investment, driven by transformative advancements in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI capabilities. As businesses increasingly prioritize AI integration to drive efficiency and innovation, investors are betting on a few key players to dominate the emerging AI economy.

Valuation Momentum Raises Sustainability Questions

How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business

toggle caption Pool/Getty Images North America

State capitalism. MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.

Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.

"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace," says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.

"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate," she adds. "It's just bad for the economy."

There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.

Sponsor Message

Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.

Lipton calls this capitalism by "schmoozing," and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.

"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products," she says. "If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody."

Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, "In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership."

China-style 'state capitalism'

Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or "rules-based" capitalism.

Sponsor Message

This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.

But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of "state capitalism," in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it "crony capitalism," meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.

"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that," says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.

In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried "

[TITLE]Dismantling Defenses: Trump 2.0 Cyber Year in Review – Krebs on Security:
[TEXT]
The Trump administration has pursued a staggering range of policy pivots this past year that threaten to weaken the nation’s ability and willingness to address a broad spectrum of technology challenges, from cybersecurity and privacy to countering disinformation, fraud and corruption. These shifts, along with the president’s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren’t even aware of them all.

FREE SPEECH

President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a primary reason he lost the 2020 election was that social media and Big Tech companies had conspired to silence conservative voices and stifle free speech. Naturally, the president’s impulse in his second term has been to use the levers of the federal government in an effort to limit the speech of everyday Americans, as well as foreigners wishing to visit the United States.

In September, Donald Trump signed a national security directive known as NSPM-7, which directs federal law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts to target “anti-American” activity, including any “tax crimes” involving extremist groups who defrauded the IRS. According to extensive reporting by journalist Ken Klippenstein, the focus of the order is on those expressing “opposition to law and immigration enforcement; extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders; adherence to radical gender ideology,” as well as “anti-Americanism,” “anti-capitalism,” and “anti-Christianity.”

Earlier this month, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo advising the FBI to compile a list of Americans whose activities “may constitute domestic terrorism.” Bondi also ordered the FBI to establish a “cash reward system” to encourage the public to report suspected domestic terrorist activity. The memo states that domestic terrorism could include “opposition to law and immigration enforcement” or support for “radical gender ideology.”

The Trump administration also is planning to impose social media restrictions on tourists as the president continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors. According to a notice from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), tourists — including those from Britain, Australia, France, and Japan — will soon be required to provide five years of their social media history.

The CBP said it will also collect “several high value data fields,” including applicants’ email addresses from the past 10 years, their telephone numbers used in the past five years, and names and details of family members. Wired reported in October that the US CBP executed more device searches at the border in the first three months of the year than any other previous quarter.

The new requirements from CBP add meat to the bones of Executive Order 14161, which in the name of combating “foreign terrorist and public safety threats” granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics alleged the order’s vague language around “public safety threats,” creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion. At least 35 nations are now under some form of U.S. travel restrictions.

CRIME AND CORRUPTION

In February, Trump ordered executive branch agencies to stop enforcing the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which froze foreign bribery investigations, and even allows for “remedial actions” of past enforcement actions deemed “inappropriate.”

The White House also disbanded the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and KleptoCapture Task Force — units which proved their value in corruption cases and in seizing the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs — and diverted resources away from investigating white-collar crime.

Also in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi dissolved the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, an entity created during Trump’s first term designed to counter the influence of foreign governments on American politics.

In March 2025, Reuters reported that several U.S. national security agencies had halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks. Former President Joe Biden had ordered his national security team to establish working groups to monitor the issue amid warnings from U.S. intelligence that Russia was escalating a shadow war against Western nations.

In a test of prosecutorial independence, Trump’s Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. The fallout was immediate: Multiple senior officials resigned in protest, the case was reassigned, and chaos engulfed the Southern District of New York (SDNY) – historically one of the nation’s most aggressive offices for pursuing public corruption, white-collar crime, and cybercrime cases.

When it comes to cryptocurrency, the administration has shifted regulators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) away from enforcement to cheerleading an industry that has consistently been plagued by scams, fraud and rug-pulls. The SEC in 2025 systematically retreated from enforcement against cryptocurrency operators, dropping major cases against Coinbase, Binance, and others.

Perhaps the most troubling example involves Justin Sun, the Chinese-born founder of crypto currency company Tron. In 2023, the SEC charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. Sun subsequently invested $75 million in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) tokens, became the top holder of the $TRUMP memecoin, and secured a seat at an exclusive dinner with the president.

In late February 2025, the SEC dropped its lawsuit. Sun promptly took Tron public through a reverse merger arranged by Dominari Securities, a firm with Trump family ties. Democratic lawmakers have urged the SEC to investigate what they call “concerning ties to President Trump and his family” as potential conflicts of interest and foreign influence.

In October, President Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance. In 2023, Zhao and his company pled guilty to failing to prevent money laundering on the platform. Binance paid a $4 billion fine, and Zhao served a four-month sentence. As CBS News observed last month, shortly after Zhao’s pardon application, he was at the center of a blockbuster deal that put the Trump’s family’s WLF on the map.

“Zhao is a citizen of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and in May, an Emirati fund put $2 billion in Zhao’s Binance,” 60 Minutes reported. “Of all the currencies in the world, the deal was done in World Liberty crypto.”

SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has made the agency’s new posture towards crypto explicit, stating “most crypto tokens are not securities.” At the same time, President Trump has directed the Department of Labor and the SEC to expand 401(k) access to private equity and crypto — assets that regulators have historically restricted for retail investors due to high risk, fees, opacity, and illiquidity. The executive order explicitly prioritizes “curbing ERISA litigation,” and reducing accountability for fiduciaries while shifting risk onto ordinary workers’ retirement savings.

At the White House’s behest, the U.S. Treasury in March suspended the Corporate Transparency Act, a law that required companies to reveal their real owners. Finance experts warned the suspension would bring back shell companies and “open the flood gates of dirty money” through the US, such as funds from drug gangs, human traffickers, and fraud groups.

Trump’s clemency decisions have created a pattern of freed criminals committing new offenses, including Jonathan Braun, whose sentence for drug trafficking was commuted during Trump’s first term, was found guilty in 2025 of violating supervised release and faces new charges.

Eliyahu Weinstein, who received a commutation in January 2021 for running a Ponzi scheme, was sentenced in November 2025 to 37 years for running a new Ponzi scheme. The administration has also granted clemency to a growing list of white-collar criminals: David Gentile, a private equity executive sentenced to seven years for securities and wire fraud (functionally a ponzi-like scheme), and Trevor Milton, the Nikola founder sentenced to four years for defrauding investors over electric vehicle technology. The message: Financial crimes against ordinary investors are no big deal.

At least 10 of the January 6 insurrectionists pardoned by President Trump have already been rearrested, charged or sentenced for other crimes, including plotting the murder of FBI agents, child sexual assault, possession of child sexual abuse material and reckless homicide while driving drunk.

The administration also imposed sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC). On February 6, 2025, Executive Order 14203 authorized asset freezes and visa restrictions against ICC officials investigating U.S. citizens or allies, primarily in response to the ICC’s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Earlier this month the president launched the “Gold Card,” a visa scheme established by an executive order in September that offers wealthy individuals and corporations expedited paths to U.S. residency and citizenship in exchange for $1 million for individuals and $2 million for companies, plus ongoing fees. The administration says it is also planning to offer a “platinum” version of the card that offers special tax breaks — for a cool $5 million.

FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY

President Trump campaigned for a second term insisting that the previous election was riddled with fraud and had been stolen from him. Shortly after Mr. Trump took the oath of office for a second time, he fired the head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) — Chris Krebs (no relation) — for having the audacity to state publicly that the 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history.

Mr. Trump revoked Krebs’s security clearances, ordered a Justice Department investigation into his election security work, and suspended the security clearances of employees at SentinelOne, the cybersecurity firm where Krebs worked as chief intelligence and public policy officer. The executive order was the first direct presidential action against any US cybersecurity company. Krebs subsequently resigned from SentinelOne, telling The Wall Street Journal he was leaving to push back on Trump’s efforts “to go after corporate interests and corporate relationships.”

The president also dismissed all 15 members of the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events — likely because those advisors included Chris Krebs.

At the time, the CSRB was in the middle of compiling a much-anticipated report on the root causes of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions into at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers. Not to be outdone, the Federal Communication Commission quickly moved to roll back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures.

Meanwhile, CISA has lost roughly a third of its workforce this year amid mass layoffs and deferred resignations. When the government shutdown began in October, CISA laid off even more employees and furloughed 65 percent of the remaining staff, leaving only 900 employees working without pay.

Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has reassigned CISA cyber specialists to jobs supporting the president’s deportation agenda. As Bloomberg reported earlier this year, CISA employees were given a week to accept the new roles or resign, and some of the reassignments included relocations to new geographic areas.

The White House has signaled that it plans to cut an additional $491 million from CISA’s budget next year, cuts that primarily target CISA programs focused on international affairs and countering misinformation and foreign propaganda. The president’s budget proposal justified the cuts by repeating debunked claims
