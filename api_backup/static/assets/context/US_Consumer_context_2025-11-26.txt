[TITLE]O5 Group Buys Retail Building Across From Penn Station for $30M:
[TEXT]
O5 Group, a real estate investor and manager, has acquired a retail building across the street from Midtown’s Penn Station.

New York-based O5 Group, which rebranded from Oved Group in 2022 and specializes in apparel, real estate and finance, purchased the three-story building at 425 Seventh Avenue from United Pacific Development for $30 million, according to city records made public Wednesday.

Ralph Dweck, an attorney at Wachtel Missry, signed the deal for the buyer, which used the entity FO 425 Seventh Avenue, while Sze Chan signed for the seller, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. A spokesperson for O5 Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Chan could not be reached for comment.

United Pacific bought the property between West 33rd and West 34th streets — and across Seventh Avenue from Penn Station — in 2006 for $4.1 million, property records show. The low-rise building’s ground-floor retail space is currently home to Rose’s Pizza.

It’s unclear what O5 Group plans to do with its new property, but the company owns nearly 10 other retail properties throughout New York City in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, according to its website.

News of the deal also comes after a slew of big leasing news near Penn Station, an underground train and subway hub in New York City that is said to be the busiest transportation facility in the Western Hemisphere.

Earlier this month, fintech firm Robinhood signed a sublease for 125,392 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust’s Penn 2, which sits above the train hall, as Commercial Observer previously reported. At the same time, Dick’s Sporting Goods signed a lease for 125,284 square feet of office space at Penn 2, while fintech firm Current took more than 62,000 square feet at the property.

[TITLE]Palworld publisher picks up Vision Quench, a co-op dark fantasy looter shooter set in a consumer goods conglomerate mega dungeon:
[TEXT]
Set in the underbelly of a consumer goods conglomerate mega dungeon, Vision Quench is now being published by Palword's Pocketpair Publishing. From WizMUD, this is their first game on Steam and it's going to release sometime in 2026.

More about it: "The last remnant of a vanished bargain lies yet unclaimed atop the Green Tower, where the Sweepstakes Code endures as both a promise and a curse. To redeem it, you and your 3 companions, drawn together by the distant memory of a memory, must fight your way up the tower through a sprawling labyrinth of hidden designs, metaphysical phenomena, and all manner of foul creatures."

Check out the trailer:

Some Highlights:

Features 3D voice chat that’s reactive to the environment, allowing you to connect with your teammates on a spiritual level.

Fight enemies using an arsenal of medieval weapons and contemporary tech scattered throughout the dungeon, ranging from torches and morning stars to fireworks and GloweeZ© guns

One player can carry a backpack allowing everyone to stay mobile while they loot. Items can be easily tossed in and out of the bag. Protect the backpack carrier at all costs, or at least the backpack.

Be mindful of your party’s status, even in this altered state players can become ill and pass it on to others.

Easily throw bandaids and fizzy drinks to your friends in need, but be careful when throwing things like fireworks and cinderblocks

Upon death you’ll become a Freakopop, a plastic toy that can be picked up and thrown around. Assist the living with your newfound Freako Vision.

Your presence may become noted by the Entity: A shadowy creature that takes on different forms. It will try and disconnect you from your vision quest if you don't play by its rules.

A breadth of customization options will allow you to become the adventurer you always wanted to be. Wizard hats, chain gauntlets, Tru Religions – endless possibilities

It's not clear if it will have a Native Linux version or if you'll need Proton for it. There's Linux system requirements on Steam, but they don't make it clear right now as it's not fully filled.

[TITLE]Atmanirbharta in textiles:
[TEXT]
India’s textile industry employs over 45 million people, making it the country’s second-largest employer after agriculture. Yet India’s share in global exports has stagnated at 3.9%, while smaller economies such as Bangladesh and Vietnam have reached nearly 7 per cent, signalling trade disadvantages and regulatory bottlenecks.

The challenge has deepened with recent US tariffs, which industry estimates suggest could affect almost one-fourth of India’s textile exports over the next six months, with inevitable employment and consumption impacts.

Yet, the opportunity to expand India’s footprint in global textiles remains strong. Global sourcing continues to shift away from China. China, anticipating this “China+” trend, has responded by aggressively underpricing its exports and routing material through Vietnam and Bangladesh, where only marginal value addition occurs. The larger share of value capture remains within China, even as India’s domestic producers face mounting pressure.

To address these developments, India needs to urgently address predatory dumping across the textile value chain and persistent inverted duty and GST structures.

Dumping threat

Upstream manufacturers often get overshadowed by a much larger base of downstream users who prefer low-priced imports, even when these are dumped. In most cases, raw materials contribute 3 to 5 per cent to the final price of textile products. The apparent short-term benefit of cheaper imports therefore comes at the cost of long-term erosion of domestic capacity, which is far more difficult to restore once lost.

Beta Naphthol, a key dye intermediate, highlights this. India has the domestic capacity to meet around 70 per cent of national demand, yet dumped imports from China captured 83 per cent of the Indian market in 2024, according to C-DEP research. This places domestic producers at risk of shutting down, and once these capacities disappear, the value chain becomes permanently dependent on imports. India risks slowly resembling the Bangladesh model, where much of the value addition occurs offshore while domestic production is limited to stitching.

The same pattern is visible in intermediates linked to technical textiles and defence production. Until recently, domestic glass fibre manufacturers met most of India’s requirements. After the lapse of anti-dumping duties in 2020, imports surged and China’s share rose from 45 per cent to 65 per cent. Thailand’s share increased from 5 per cent to 26 per cent due to zero-duty access under the India–ASEAN FTA. Much of this supply is understood to be re-routed Chinese material.

Nylon Filament Yarn (NFY), widely used in sportswear and performance apparel, has experienced similar stresses. After anti-dumping duties were removed in 2018, China’s share of imports into India climbed from 8 per cent to more than 80 per cent. Domestic utilisation dropped from 85 per cent to

[TITLE]CARBIOS signs two new multi-year commercial agreements for recycled PET with major players in the beverage industry:
[TEXT]
Clermont-Ferrand (France), 24 November 2025 (18h30 CET). CARBIOS (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB), announces the signing of two new multi-year commercial agreements with major players in beverage industry, for the supply of recycled PET (r-PET).

The signing of these two new commercial agreements marks CARBIOS’s entry into a new strategic sector: beverages.

These new commercial agreements are part of the pre-commercialization process for CARBIOS’s future industrial site, bringing the current level of pre-sales to approximately 50% of the site’s maximum production capacity.

Negotiations are ongoing with other partners to reach a pre-commercialization level of 70% of the Longlaville site’s maximum capacity, a threshold constituting one of the conditions for obtaining additional non-dilutive funding necessary to resume construction of the Longlaville plant.

A regional grant of €12.5 million has also been signed, bringing the total amount of public funding already secured to €42.5 million.

Vincent Kamel, CEO of CARBIOS : “These new agreements confirm the robustness of our technology and the attractiveness of our offer for strategic sectors such as beverages. They also comfort our strategy of sector diversification.”

[TITLE]Holiday 2025: What Retailers and Prognosticators Expect:
[TEXT]
Retailers are heading into the heart of the holiday season with a heap of concerns, from consumers cutting back on non-essentials and anxious over the economy, to higher prices from tariffs, inflation and potential stockouts.

Yet many retailers expect to pull through the 2025 holiday season with satisfactory, if modest, gains. Walmart, Amazon, Gap, TJX and Ross Stores have raised guidance for the year, reflecting confidence in the fourth quarter. And other retailers that have been performing well this year — Aritzia, Vuori, Primark, Bloomingdale’s, Abercrombie & Fitch, Costco and Ann Taylor-parent Knitwell should emerge from the 2025 holiday season in decent shape.

Several factors will fuel holiday gains. The S&P 500 index is up 11 percent this year, adding to the nation’s wealth factor. Also, newer channels for shopping, i.e. agentic commerce, are gaining traction, and channels that have around for awhile — like mobile shopping, social media apps such as TikTok, livestreaming, and the resale market — continue to increase in popularity. AI is also making it easier to personalize the shopping experience. So whatever makes shopping faster, easier and more convenient will stimulate purchasing.

An Undercurrent of Uneasiness

America’s mood is a bit brighter since the government shutdown ended, yet there remains an undercurrent of uneasiness over rising health, home and food costs, and the possibility of the economy deteriorating next year.

“Economic uncertainty keeps the brain and nervous system in a constant state of anxiety and alertness. This makes it harder for people to manage holiday shopping and planning. Thus, we can’t simply enjoy the season,” said Dr. Hannah Nearney, clinical psychiatrist and U.K medical director at Flow Neuroscience, which develops brain stimulation solutions for mental well-being, in a statement.

Still, retailers say consumers and their shopping patterns have shown resilience.

“While we do study data that suggests there’s macro pressure, particularly on the low-income consumer, our customers are really responding to our price, value and style,” Richard Dickson, president and chief executive officer of Gap Inc., told WWD last week after the company reported robust third-quarter sales. “Our offerings are breaking through the competitive landscape so we’re feeling very confident and excited as we head into the holiday season.”

From Old Navy’s holiday campaign.

But there’s plenty to keep brands and retailers on their guard.

“Between tariffs, inflation, the shutdown and the situation at Saks Global, there’s been a lot to worry about,” one chief executive of a major brand told WWD, referencing Saks’ sales declines and late payments to vendors. “With the price changes, we were expecting a drop in unit sales, but we really haven’t seen that, so it seems any increase has been received better than expected. Our numbers have been pretty good, so that’s a positive for going forward.”

One senior level apparel executive said the consumer prices at his brand are up this holiday season by 7 to 10 percent, though others in the supply chain would have absorbed some of the costs created by new tariffs.

“I feel we have a very solid season in front of us,” said Michael Kliger, CEO of LuxExperience, operator of the Mytheresa, Net-a-porter and Mr Porter websites, last week, after the company reported its fiscal first-quarter results. “At Mytheresa, Q1 was plus 12 percent, and even though we are still negative at Net-a-porter and Mr Porter, we clearly see momentum in that business. We are just coming from a lower base, so not including any negative macro effects, we’re looking at a solid season. The U.S. continues to be quite strong. Europe continues to be very stable, with single-digit growth and Asia, we feel, has reached the bottom. It’s stable at a low level, but it’s stable.”

Off-price stores, as well as dollar stores, appear headed for a decent holiday season. “Ross posted a stronger quarter than expected, with results showing that its core value shopper remained resilient despite lapsed SNAP [food stamp] benefits and broader tariff uncertainty weighing on household budgets,” said Suzy Davidkhanian, vice president of Emarketer, in an email. “Opportunistic buys and department-store excess helped margins and Ross’s no-frills, warehouse-style stores delivered exactly what budget-conscious families needed this season — strong, compelling assortment mix at sharp price points. Holiday gifting may still skew toward essentials for this shopper, but the quarter underscores that the lower-income consumer is holding up better than many feared.”

Modest Holiday Sales Gains Seen

The National Retail Federation predicts that retail sales for the November and December period will grow between 3.7 percent and 4.2 percent, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time in 2025. The trade organization also expects 186.9 million people in the U.S. will shop at one point or another during the Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday period, which is 3.5 million more than last year.

But not all industry sources are as sanguine. Deloitte projects holiday sales growth of just 2.9 to 3.4 percent, and others are even more bearish.

Target, which is one of the largest retailers in the country, sees its sales declining by a low single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. The discounter is being impacted by both macro issues and its own internal merchandising issues.

Home Depot’s results, too, are not very encouraging. While the home improvement chain is believed to be gaining some market share, Home Depot’s third-quarter comparable sales in the U.S. rose just 0.1 percent, and net earnings were flat. “Our results missed our expectations primarily due to the lack of storms in the third quarter, which resulted in greater than expected pressure in certain categories. Additionally, while underlying demand in the business remained relatively stable sequentially, an expected increase in demand in the third quarter did not materialize,” said Ted Decker, chairman, president and CEO, in a statement. “We believe that consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand.” Bed, Bath & Beyond also experienced a tough third quarter. Its net revenue declined 17.4 percent due to lower customer demand, though the company did cite significant operational improvements, including an 85 percent improvement in both adjusted EBITDA and gross margin.

Digging further into NRF’s outlook, the percent gain for the holiday season the trade organization forecasts is lower than the 4.3 percent gain experienced last year. Also, the U.S. inflation rate is just over 3 percent and on the rise lately. That means that “real” holiday retail sales will grow around 1 percent, based on NRF’s projection for nominal sales which are not adjusted for inflation.

[TITLE]20 Best Black Friday Footwear Deals to Shop ASAP: From Celeb-Worn Nike Vomeros to High-Achieving On Sneakers:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

Babe, wake up: Black Friday deals are starting to crop up before November 28, which is when the official, post-Thanksgiving shopping holiday is actually taking place. What this means for sneakerheads and footwear aficionados everywhere? The shoes of your dreams are right around the corner — beckoning to be bought for some of their lowest prices to date. And the best part? We’re here to guide you to the most worth-it Black Friday footwear deals this year, cutting through the noise of inflated markdowns and getting right down to the good stuff, in the form of extra-25-percent-off sales on Nike sneakers (code BFRIDAY at checkout, you’re welcome), up to 60 percent off on top adidas styles until November 29, no shortage of Amazon-exclusive sales on cult-fave shoe brands like HeyDude, and so much more.

Other major retailers like Zappos, too, are hosting their very own Black Friday sales events. The shoe industry giant features savings of up to 40 percent off on all your most coveted brands (yes, this means Ecco, Steve Madden, Converse, Veja, and beyond). If you’re into On’s offerings, as our editors are, its site currently flaunts never-before-seen deals on silhouettes like the Cloudsurfer Next, a version of the Cloudsurfer Max shoe this writer right here can’t stop wearing. Allbirds is also blessing its card-carrying fan club members with up to half off on flats, Merino wool–powered sneakers, and other social media darlings. Additionally, the Nordstrom Black Friday sale section is bursting at the seams with Ugg clogs for close to 30 percent off; discounted and TikTok-viral boot styles from Frye that, gloriously, accommodate those with wider calves; and everything in between.
