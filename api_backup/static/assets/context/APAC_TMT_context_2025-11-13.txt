[TITLE]WeRide CEO pitches robotaxi safety as shares start trading in HK:
[TEXT]
Shares of WeRide start trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange today, just over a year after the robotaxi firm forayed into U.S. markets with a Nasdaq listing. For founder and CEO Tony Han, the offering is part of a global strategy to fund the expensive but necessary research behind the company’s autonomous-driving tech.

WeRide’s shares are now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. WeRide elected for a dual primary listing, which will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy the stock through the city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme.

“We want to make our stock more accessible to investors all over the world,” Han told Fortune in late October, on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum. “China is a very important market, both for consumers and also for investors. A Hong Kong dual listing actually helps some potential investors who can only invest in the Hong Kong stock market to buy our stock.”

Han says the funds raised through the Hong Kong listing will help the robotaxi firm continue to spend on R&D and deployment. “We will still need to raise more funds,” he said, “so this will put WeRide in a much better position to access more funds.”

Fellow robotaxi firm Pony AI also starts trading in Hong Kong today after its own IPO on that exchange. Like WeRide, Pony AI listed on the Nasdaq late last year.

Hong Kong’s IPO market is booming as Chinese firms hope to leverage the city’s access to both international and mainland Chinese capital. Firms listed in mainland China, including home appliance manufacturer Midea and battery-maker CATL, have launched secondary listings in Hong Kong in order to draw international investment.

Yet several U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also considering primary listings in Hong Kong in order to access mainland Chinese investors. There’s also a geopolitical dimension: U.S.-listed Chinese firms may see Hong Kong as a backup in the event the Trump administration decides to delist them from U.S. exchanges, as part of a yearslong dispute between Washington and Beijing over auditing standards.

The city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme allows certified investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Southbound flows hit a record $110 billion in the first seven months of the year, according to the South China Morning Post citing data from Wind, already greater than the entire total in 2024.

Investors are flocking to AI firms and “new consumption”—think Pop Mart and Labubu. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up around 32% for the year so far; by comparison, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is up 22%.

WeRide raised $308 million in its Hong Kong IPO, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Shares were priced at 27.10 Hong Kong dollars, a slight discount to the stock’s Nasdaq price at Monday’s close.

WeRide HK-listed shares fell almost 12% on their first day of Hong Kong trading; the firm’s shares have lost over 40% of their value since the U.S. IPO. Pony AI’s HK shares fell around 14%.

Self-driving cars: A social good?

Tony Han, formerly chief scientist at Baidu’s autonomous vehicle unit, founded WeRide in 2017. Based in Guangzhou, the self-driving vehicle company operates in several major Chinese cities, as well as markets outside China. The company has deployments in Singapore, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. WeRide is now testing or operating vehicles in 30 cities across 11 countries.

WeRide is a member of this year’s Future 50, Fortune’s annual ranking of companies with the greatest potential for growth. The firm is also a member of this year’s Change the World list, which highlights companies that are doing social good through their business models.

Han evangelizes the many ways that self-driving vehicles—and moving away from a car-centric culture—can improve society. He predicts that accident rates will be “drastically reduced” once cars are put in the hands of computers as opposed to humans.

“Most accidents, we find, are due to human factors,” Han explained, citing the effects of drinking, drowsiness, and distraction on human drivers. “Machines won’t be drunk, won’t overdose. Machines are very reliable. Fatal accident rates for robotaxis are much lower than human drivers.”

Less congestion could be another benefit of automated vehicles. “Robotaxis will never speed, will never just cut in line,” he said. “Traffic will just flow much more smoothly.”

There’s a broader economic argument for self-driving cars in countries whose populations are rapidly aging as birth rates decline—a particularly thorny problem in China and elsewhere in Asia. “With such huge markets, we will need lots of labor in transport and mobility,” Han said. “If we are shorthanded, then we have to use AI to replace the shortage, to fill the gap between demand and requirements.”

That extends to public transport and public services. WeRide runs robobuses, robosweepers, and other automated forms of public transit and city vehicles. “The cost of bus drivers in a developed economy is quite high,” Han explained. If these costs can be reduced through automation, he argued, then cities can expand their transit systems and “help build more eco-friendly transportation for the whole planet.”

The robotaxi business

WeRide reported $27.9 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, a 32% jump from the same period a year earlier. Still, the company reported a $110 million net loss for that same period, owing in large part to spending of $90 million on research and development, approaching the $107 million spent on R&D for all of 2024.

Robotaxis remain an expensive and unprofitable proposition. An HSBC report in July pointed out that self-driving cars have a lot of hidden costs, including remote supervisors, charging and parking infrastructure, and tech support. The bank suggested that robotaxis might not break even until about eight years after launch.

Yet HSBC also predicted that robotaxis will likely reach their commercial potential in China first, owing to greater adoption and acceptance of robotaxi technologies.

Chinese companies are leading the global push for robotaxis. In addition to WeRide and Pony AI, Baidu is also expanding its robotaxi offerings through its Apollo Go vehicles.

China also manufactures many of the components that go into self-driving cars. One key component producer is Hesai Technology, the world’s leading producer of automotive lidar sensors, which are used by robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to recognize their environment and avoid obstacles.

Global ride-share companies are taking notice. WeRide is offering its Middle Eastern robotaxis through a partnership with Uber. Singaporean ride-hailing firm Grab has also made a strategic equity investment in WeRide, and is working with the Chinese firm to offer its Robotaxi GXRs and robobuses in Singapore starting next year.

Singaporean transit company ComfortDelGro, meanwhile, is working with Pony AI to explore offering robotaxis, while Lyft is collaborating with Baidu to test its Apollo Go self-driving cars in Europe.

By comparison, U.S.-based robotaxi operations are proving to be a lot slower in global expansion. Waymo currently operates in Tokyo and London.

Han isn’t surprised that global firms are now embracing Chinese robotaxis. After all, if China offers the best product, why wouldn’t foreign firms want to cooperate with it?

“When I was a teenager, we bought electronics from Japan, tools from Germany, and computers from the U.S. It’s very normal. It’s very normal,” Han said.

“If WeRide can supply good robotaxi technology and services to Uber, and in turn, Uber and WeRide together bring a very efficient and comfortable taxi service to ordinary people; why shouldn’t we do that?”

Clarification, Nov. 6, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify that WeRide will offer both robotaxi and robobus services in Singapore, as well as to note the total number of markets the firm operates in.

SY Holdings Invited to Attend 2025 Hong Kong FinTech Week, Leveraging AI to Boost the Development

Hong Kong (ANTARA/PRNewswire)- From November 3 to 4, 2025, "Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025" (hereinafter referred to as "Hong Kong FinTech Week") was grandly held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The event is organized by the Hong Kong Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Hong Kong Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, and Invest Hong Kong, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission, and the Insurance Authority. The opening ceremony was attended by several officials, including John KC Lee, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, and Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.This year's event, under the theme "Curating the New Fintech Era," brought together more than 37,000 participants from over 100 economies, over 800 speakers, and more than 700 exhibiting institutions to explore cutting-edge technological trends. As a partner of the Hong Kong FinTech Week, SY Holdings Group Limited ("SY Holdings", stock code: 6069.HK) was once again invited to attend. The Company participated in the "Digital Finance" forum alongside companies such as HSBC, Porrima, and FundPark, engaging in in-depth discussions and sharing insights on the topic of "How AI is Unlocking Lending for SMEs."SY Holdings is a partner of the Hong Kong FinTech WeekHong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive John KC Lee emphasized in his opening speech that Hong Kong's unique positioning as an international financial center has gained widespread international recognition. Currently, Hong Kong is home to over 1,200 financial technology enterprises, representing a 10% increase compared to last year. It is projected that by 2032, the revenue of Hong Kong's financial technology industry will exceed $600 billion. Additionally, John KC Lee stated that Hong Kong will assist Chinese Mainland enterprises in using the city as a springboard to expand their overseas operations. Through collaboration among various government departments of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, pathways will be paved for Chinese Mainland companies to access foreign markets and global capital, which signifies substantial opportunities for all parties involved.During the sharing session of the "Digital Finance" forum, Darrell Lua, Director of International Business at SY Holdings, addressed the topic of "AI and Data Empowering the Development of SMEs." He pointed out that enterprises naturally generate supply chain data—such as order processing, logistics and transportation, payment settlements, and performance evaluations—in their daily operations. Therefore, the key to addressing the financing challenges faced by SMEs lies not in the absence of data, but in the ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to transform this data into credible evidence for the financial sector. By applying AI technology to deeply correlate, cross-verify, and dynamically analyze fragmented data, SY Holdings accurately maps the operational trajectories and transaction profiles of SMEs. This differentiated "transaction-focused, entity-light" model, which prioritizes transactions over corporate entities, effectively overcomes the reliance of traditional financial services on corporate creditworthiness and collateral. Through the deep integration of AI and data, SY Holdings enables finance to "understand" the actual operational needs of SMEs and provides them with more precise and suitable working capital solutions.Regarding the working capital needs of emerging scenarios such as live-streaming e-commerce, Darrell Lua further shared SY Holdings' practical applications of AI. He emphasized that the integration of AI and finance should go beyond mere "speed" and achieve a synergy between "velocity" and "understanding"—specifically, a deep comprehension of industrial ecosystems and data. Rather than simply developing new AI agents and risk control models, SY Holdings empowers AI with the ability to "understand" multidimensional real-world information, covering logistics trajectories, tax and invoice records, and even external variables like weather forecasts. This extends the risk assessment model to "dynamic scenarios," as risks may lurk not only in static reports but also in delayed port shipments, supply chains disrupted by heavy rain, or suddenly adjusted policies. By focusing on "the transaction itself" as the core assessment criterion and leveraging cross-verified data from multiple supply chain nodes for dynamic control, SY Holdings ultimately provides "end-to-end, minute-level" working capital services for live-streaming e-commerce merchants. To date, the company has helped over 21,000 SMEs secure over RMB 300 billion in order acquisition and working capital turnover. The value of integrating AI with finance lies not in replacing humans but in enabling trust to transcend boundaries and continuously amplify.When discussing linkages and collaboration with financial institutions, Darrell Lua emphasized that SY Holdings consistently adheres to a platform-based strategy, committed to building a bridge for the intelligent matching of high-quality assets and diverse funding sources. Currently, the platform has connected with over 190 funding partners. He expressed SY Holdings' expectation to strengthen collaboration with financial institutions in two key areas: First, enhancing the supply of scalable, low-cost inclusive funding by leveraging the SY Cloud Platform's ability to accurately identify genuine corporate financing needs, thereby helping more SMEs efficiently access working capital services. Second, promoting the deep integration of risk control models and ecosystem resources by combining the mature credit assessment systems of financial institutions with SY Holdings' "transaction-focused, entity-light" risk control logic to jointly serve SMEs segments that are traditionally underserved by conventional finance. Additionally, SY Holdings aims to leverage financial institutions' extensive service networks, cross-border business experience, and diverse customer resources to further expand into domestic underserved markets and international markets such as Southeast Asia, extending the platform's technology services to broader domains.It is worth noting that SY Holdings has initiated its global layout this year, increasing R&D investments in innovative technologies such as AI agents to build a new "AI + International Supply Chain Technology Platform." This platform will focus on serving SMEs across global supply chain ecosystems, providing one-stop solutions encompassing supply chain services, financing, FX management, and digital operation empowerment, with the goal of becoming an integral component of the global supply chain.SY Holdings' reappearance at the Hong Kong FinTech Week attracted attention from financial institutions and technology enterprises worldwide. It not only demonstrated the company's comprehensive capabilities in digital finance and technology output but also reflected its strategic determination to use Hong Kong as a bridgehead to connect global innovation resources and expand into international markets. This further advances its mission to "empowering Chinese SMEs to reshape the global supply chain."SY Holdings Group Limited ("SY Holdings" or the "Group", stock code: 6069.HK) is the first "AI+Industrial Supply Chain" digital intelligence technology company listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The major institutional shareholders of SY Holdings include Temasek Holdings of Singapore, Wuxi Communications Group, XtalPi and Be Friends. The Group has been included in the MSCI series indices, Hang Seng Composite Index, FTSE Index, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs. It was recognized in 2023 as one of "CNBC's Top 200 Global Fintech Companies" and in 2024 as a "Forbes China Top 50 Fintech Influential Enterprise," demonstrating international market recognition of its development.While deepening its presence in national pillar industries such as infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, and commodities, SY Holdings is actively expanding into strategic emerging sectors including e-commerce, robotics. SY Holdings adopts the differentiated "transaction-focused, entity-light" model, uses AI Agent to link industrial ecosystem and conduct data analysis, and helps the growth of small and medium enterprises ("SMEs") through Platform technology science. Up to now, SY Holdings has helped over 21,000 SMEs secure over RMB 300 billion in order acquisition and working capital turnover.In August 2025, while intensifying its global expansion, SY Holdings positioned its Singapore international headquarters as the strategic bridgehead and formally launched its global strategy. The Group will build a new "International Supply Chain Technology Platform" powered by AI, which focuses on serving SMEs in the upstream and downstream of the global supply chain and provides one-stop solutions encompassing flexible supply chain services, cross-border working capital, exchange rate management and digital empowerment. The Group is committed to supporting SMEs in efficiently expanding into global markets, while fulfilling its mission of "Empowering Chinese SMEs to reshape the global supply chain" and jointly opening a new era of growth in resonance with global development.Source: SY Holdings

[TITLE]U.S. labor market forecast 2026: Goldman Sachs and RSM warn of unemployment as key risk:
[TEXT]
Without official Bureau of Labor Statistics data to calm their nerves, analysts are wondering just how fast the U.S. employment market may have deteriorated.

While available data from private and alternative sources suggest that the jobs market hasn’t significantly weakened, economists are concerned that unemployment remains a key risk to the economy in 2026.

For now, ignorance is bliss for the markets. Investors, buoyed by the end of a government shutdown and a potential deal between the U.S. and India, again boosted markets and lowered their volatility expectations. The S&P 500 marked a respectable 1.54% increase on Monday, the Dow Jones was up 0.81% and the Nasdaq up a bullish 2.27%—the VIX volatility index was down by more than 6%.

This optimism has spread to both Europe and Asia: London’s FTSE 100 is up 0.94%, Germany’s DAX posted a minor gain of 0.23% and Paris’s CAC is up just shy of 0.7%. In Asia, India’s Nifty 50 is up 0.41% and the Hang Seng Index is up 0.18%. The Nikkei 225 and SSE are down slightly, by 0.14% and 0.39% apiece.

Investors’ confidence is yet to be marred by concerns
