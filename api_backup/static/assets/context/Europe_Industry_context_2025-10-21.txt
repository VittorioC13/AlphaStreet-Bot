[TITLE]Public sector emerges as Indian IT’s next growth engine amid global digital transformation push:
[TEXT]
As economic uncertainty clouds private sector spending across key markets, Indian IT majors are increasingly turning to the public sector, both at home and abroad, as a source of long-term, stable growth. Infosys’ recent multi-year deal with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), TCS’ long-standing digital transformation work with BSNL in India and LTIMindtree’s PAN 2.0 project win signal a broader pivot — public sector engagements are no longer side bets for Indian IT, but are fast becoming strategic pillars.

Gaurav Vasu, Founder & CEO, UnearthInsight, highlighted that typically, global counterparts like Capgemini and Accenture have separate dedicated units for the public sector. Apart from the usual sectors, including BFSI, retail, healthcare and manufacturing, the public sector is a large business mix for these firms, with anywhere between 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the revenues coming from the sector.

“Like TCS has a head of BFSI or healthcare, global IT services firms have someone heading the public sector business. It’s a fairly mature concept. Indian IT services firms started competing here in the last 7 to 8 years, focusing on the public sector across geographies. However, it is not a big component of their revenues yet,” he shared.

In the past, public sector deals were under 5 per cent of their revenues. In the last few years, especially post-Covid, with the US slowdown resulting in geographical and industrial vertical optimisation, IT services firms have realised they can’t depend on one or two verticals.

[TITLE]Can Pipavav shipyard anchor India’s maritime ambitions?:
[TEXT]
Gujarat’s Pipavav coast is gearing up to reclaim its place on the global shipbuilding map, as Swan Defence and Heavy Industries (SDHI) launches a multi-year investment programme to transform its shipyard into an integrated defence and commercial vessel manufacturing hub.

Rear Admiral (retd.) Vipin Kumar Saxena, chief executive officer of SDHI, said the project marks a new chapter in India’s maritime industrial growth story. “This is a golden period for the country," he said in an exclusive interview to Mint. “We now operate one of the world’s largest shipbuilding facilities, and with fresh investment, advanced automation, and strategic collaborations, we’re positioned to make Pipavav the nucleus of India’s shipbuilding ecosystem."

World-class infrastructure, renewed ambition

SDHI, formerly Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd, is a leading Indian company in shipbuilding and heavy fabrication. It operates one of the country’s largest dry docks (world's fourth largest) (662m x 65m) capable of handling vessels up to 400,000DWT (deadweight tonnage) and has a 300-acre fabrication site with an annual block construction capacity of 1,44,000 tonnes. The facility alone accounts for more than 30% of India’s shipbuilding capacity.

Deadweight tonnage refers to the total weight of a ship, including cargo and fuel, but excludes the ship's own weight.

“What sets us apart is not just the scale, but the level of automation and semi-automation integrated into our shipbuilding processes," Saxena explained. “These capabilities enable us to take on a wide range of vessel types—from complex defence platforms to large commercial ships."

[TITLE]Federal Workers Are Pinching Pennies During the Government Shutdown:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The federal government shutdown has become the Grinch who stole Halloween for Johnny Jones.

Halloween is typically a big deal for the Jones family — they love to decorate, hand out candy and hot dogs, and enjoy a neighborhood shindig. But Jones, who works for the Transportation Security Administration, isn't getting a paycheck during the shutdown. That means big Halloween plans are out of the budget; so is an outing for his daughter and her friends to the new Taylor Swift movie.

"We're probably another couple of weeks from having to prepare to start selling stuff. I've already started identifying things that I could liquidate easily to get cash," said Jones, who is the president of local 1040 of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union.

Across the country, government workers like Jones are cutting back on subscriptions, canceling vacations, skipping car repairs, pausing kids' dance classes, and delaying credit card payments.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay amid the shutdown, while the Trump administration pushes through new staff cuts. Most employees received one final prorated check this week for the days worked immediately before the shutdown; it could be their last until Congress reaches a funding deal. The same goes for government contractors, which include people working in cafeteria and janitorial roles at federal buildings, on Capitol Hill, and at national museums and historical sites.

Business Insider interviewed more than two dozen workers across agencies and the military. Some said they are dipping into savings, while others worry they won't be able to afford medicine and rent next month. The White House has hinted that furloughed workers and those still on the job may not receive back pay. Meanwhile, thousands of federal employees who received termination notices since the start of the shutdown are left in limbo after an October 15 court ruling temporarily paused their layoffs.

'I won't have enough savings to pay for the bills'

Federal workers told Business Insider that one check can be the difference between paying a bill or going into debt.

A Pew analysis showed that nearly half of government employees earned under $89,000 annually as of March 2024, with 8% earning less than $50,000 — money that goes fast if families are paying for housing, childcare, groceries, and medicine.

"A lot of us are living paycheck to paycheck, like most Americans, but even more so now we have to be cognizant of where every penny is going," Mark Cochran, a furloughed National Park Service employee in Pennsylvania and AFGE Local 3145 president, previously told Business Insider.

One civilian Department of Defense worker has been hitting the phones: They've reached out to their mortgage company and two major banks to see if they can get a loan or forbearance. So far, prospects have been grim.

"My pay covers me through October but if the shutdown continues past October into November I won't have enough savings to pay for the bills," the DoD worker said. It's been a stressful time, they said, as they scramble to get last-minute credit card and loan applications together. They've already applied for a bridge loan from the United States Senate Federal Credit Union. "I just wished that we could get more financial support from these public companies (even major ones) when it was not our fault."

A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employee said they are trying to secure a mortgage loan approval this month, but "that fell through because of the missing paycheck," and a National Aeronautics and Space Administration employee said that they're delaying repairs to their roof and car. One Internal Revenue Service worker said medical challenges would become "drastically more expensive" if they lost their job. Another IRS employee said they're anxious

[TITLE]Trump Stops Biden’s Euro-Style Solution to Flight Delays and Paves Way to Lower Fares:
[TEXT]
The Biden administration spent four years placing a record level of new regulatory impediments on the nation’s airlines. An analysis by the Office of Management and Budget estimates that former President Joe Biden’s transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, nearly tripled the number of transportation-related rules and regulations.

There’s no evidence that all this added red tape made airline travel safer or reduced flight delays.

Biden should have learned from the airline deregulations of the late 1970s, which liberated airlines from government controls on pricing and flight routes. A famous study by Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution found that those reforms ushered in the modern era of air travel with much lower prices and hundreds of billions of dollars of savings for consumers over the past four decades.

Buttigieg, by contrast, blundered on nearly every major issue he faced. He bungled the proposed JetBlue merger with Spirit Airlines, a disastrous decision that landed Spirit Airlines in bankruptcy and left JetBlue struggling. This has led to less competition, not more.

Buttigieg also tried to restrict popular award miles programs that save money on airfares and reward passengers with flight upgrades. He’s imposed new penalties on airlines for flight delays—even when it wasn’t the fault of the airline.

The Biden-Buttigieg philosophy was that airlines were ripping off passengers and gobbling up profits. The truth is the opposite: Airline fares have remained reasonably low compared to the rapid inflation in food, energy, and housing costs.

The average inflation-adjusted airfare is down nearly 20% from pre-pandemic 2019—when airfares were already the lowest on record. In fact, airfares are one of the only major categories of consumer spending that has fallen on an inflation-adjusted basis. That’s not the sign of an industry price-gouging consumers.

Here’s a financial reality about this industry that few of the politicians and regulators seem to understand: Airlines have huge fixed costs and operate on small margins—which, even in the best years for airlines, lag the average profit margin in other industries.

If United, American and Delta relied solely on ticket revenues, the airlines would either go bankrupt, restrict flights, or have to start charging much higher fares.

Thankfully, the Trump administration under Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is charting a different course. The Department of Transportation has announced it will not implement the Biden-era proposal requiring airlines to pay European-style compensation for delays and cancellations and is canceling attempts to restrict airline credit card reward points.

One unresolved issue is what to do about flight delays and cancellations.

As a frequent flyer myself, I hate flight delays—which are more common than ever. What should be done? Reasonable compensation to passengers—except in cases where the flight delays are beyond the airline’s control—should be standard policy. Some airlines offer better compensation than others.

Rather than impose government mandates, let the market work. Airlines should announce what their delay policy is. All but one of the U.S. airlines already provide complimentary hotel accommodations when flights are delayed overnight. Modest Federal Aviation Administration fines or payments to customers should be required for long flight delays or cancellations when the airline itself is to blame.

The 1970s deregulation of the skies was a success that virtually all economists and passenger groups applaud. President Donald Trump’s transportation agenda under Duffy is: Airline Deregulation, The Sequel. The results will be better service and lower costs for tens of millions of American passengers and a more profitable and stable future for our vital airline industry.

[TITLE]Decision due on bid to revive Waterford Airport with mystery US investor's €30m backing:
[TEXT]
A DEAL THAT is meant to get one of the country’s regional airports up and running for commercial flights for the first time in a decade is set to come before local politicians in Waterford tomorrow.

Councillors are to vote tomorrow afternoon on whether to hand over 207 acres at Waterford Airport and hand them over to the operator.

The lands are currently owned by Waterford City and County Council.

The approval of the land transfer looks increasingly likely, as local politicians are told that it will allow private sector investment worth up to €30 million.

But there has been unease over the proposal as politicians are not allowed to have confirmation of the mystery investor before they cast their vote.

In a briefing document circulated this week by council chief executive Seán McKeown, there were attempts to reassure councillors over the land deal.

According to an independent valuation, the lands are estimated to be worth €2.295 million but will handed over at a cost of just €50,000.

It’s hoped that this will allow a mystery US investor to enter the fray and pump the promised €30 million to make the airport viable, similar to Knock in Co Mayo or Shannon in Co Clare.

Private flights and aviation training are currently run from the airport but it has not had a commercial flight since a route to Luton closed in 2016.

McKeown confirmed that the investor has “significant business interests” in the US but will “remain confidential” for the upcoming period.

He also told councillors that the investor will undergo Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) screening by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as they are a non-EU investor.

When contacted, the department told The Journal that it does not comment on FDI screenings with specific individuals.

Accoridng to McKeown’s briefing document to councillors, seen by The Journal, the proposed works consist of a long-planned extension of the existing runway by 491 metres at its northern end and 363 metres at its southern end.

This will result in a total runway length of 2,287 metres – it’s hoped this will attract larger commercial airlines.

A widening of the existing and extended runway from 30 metres in width to 45 metres features in these works, which will cost the €30 million that councillors are told will be put up by the US investor.

Construction of a new 205 space car park will also take place under these proposals.

As a way to guard against the works not taking place and get the approval of councillors for tomorrow’s vote, McKeown stressed that the “majority of the lands” will be restricted to aviation-related uses for a period of 50 years.

There will also be an anti-embarrassment clause in the contract to help protect against losses for the council. Therefore, should Waterford Airport Ltd dispose of the lands within a period of seven years, 50% of any realised net profit on that potential sale would have to be paid to the council.

If the works go ahead, it will bring an end to major uncertainty around the future of the airport.

There was a glimmer of hope two years ago when the airport received a commitment of €12 million from the Comer Group, run by billionaire brothers Luke and Brian Comer, with the money going towards the runway extension.

Waterford City and County Council confirmed this month that the Comers were no longer interested in progressing their investment plans for the airport and that the plans had moved to the mystery US investor.

Inflation meant the cost of the expansion has doubled and now amounts to around €30 million. Half of that funding had been sought from the Government since 2016, but talks repeatedly fell through as the overall cost increased.

[TITLE]The next major film studios could be in Nevada if some unions have their way:
[TEXT]
Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Movies like “The Hangover” and “Ocean’s Eleven” piqued interest in the Las Vegas Strip long ago. But now Nevada labor unions hoping to boost jobs and tourism are pushing state officials to offer tax credits aimed at bringing more Hollywood filmmaking to the state.

The effort to offer up to $95 million in tax credits to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery for a new film production facility in the Vegas suburbs didn’t win enough legislative support earlier this year. But more than a dozen labor unions are pushing to revive the proposal during an expected special session next month.

“We believe if we can get the public behind us, we’ll be able to get the legislators to understand what a big change this can bring to Southern Nevada,” said Tommy White, business manager-secretary treasurer of Laborers’ International Union of North America, Local 872 in Las Vegas.

Trade unions formed a political action committee called Nevada Jobs Now, which has raised over $1 million to be used for digital advertisements, mailers and some TV commercials, White said. The production companies behind the project say it would create 19,000 construction jobs.

If the unions are successful, Las Vegas would be competing with cities like Atlanta, where the film industry has boomed for more than a decade thanks to a far more generous tax break. California, meanwhile, recently revamped its own tax incentive programs to combat a multiyear downward trend in Hollywood film production.

The production companies would not come to Las Vegas if they don’t receive the tax incentives, according to David O’Reilly, CEO of Howard Hughes Holdings, the developer of the proposal called Summerlin Studios. It would include 10 movie stages, hotels, a medical center and be part of a master-planned neighborhood in West Las Vegas.

“There would be no reason for Sony and Warner to film in Nevada when they can get tax credits in 20 other states or around the globe,” he said. “They need to bring their productions to where they have the best economic deal, and we’re just trying to make Nevada competitive with everybody else.”

To be eligible for the tax credits, $400 million needs to be spent building a studio and $1.8 billion spent building the mixed-use development of shops and restaurants, O’Reilly said. Sony and Warner Bros. would have to spend $4.5 billion over 15 years. They would be eligible for the tax credits after the studio is built and filming begins, he said.

Drawing the movie buff to Vegas

The proposal comes as Las Vegas continues to see a decline in tourism. Between June 2024 and June 2025, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported an 11.3% decline in visitors.

White and other supporters argue that not only will the film studios bring jobs and revenue, it will also attract tourists.

“With movie studios, you bring in a whole different type of tourist,” White said, likening it to how major sports teams draw visitors. “You don’t just bring the person that’s come in to go to a resort to gamble.”

Stephen Weizenecker, an Atlanta attorney who was involved in Georgia’s film tax credit program since its inception in 2008, said Georgia has seen more tourists wanting to visit the scenes where movies like “The Hunger Games” and “Forrest Gump” were filmed.

Dubbed the “Hollywood of the South,” metro Atlanta became a ubiquitous backdrop for huge projects, including Marvel films and Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Its program has supported thousands of jobs and the creation of several thriving studios. But it is expensive — the state in 2024 was projected to give out $1.35 billion in credits that year alone.

The state’s return is an average of 17 cents in tax revenue for every state dollar spent, according to Carlianne Patrick, an associate professor at Georgia State University who conducts audits of the state’s tax credit programs.

Georgia has seen a large increase in production activity and an increase in jobs, though not all of them are full-time, permanent positions, Patrick said.

State employee union argues against the proposal

Some don’t see the payoff in giving tax credits to the film studios.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a union representing thousands of state workers, joined other Nevada organizations this week in sending a letter to the governor urging him to not include the film tax credit proposal in the upcoming special session. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo says he will call lawmakers back to the capital before the years ends, but it’s not yet clear what issues lawmakers will tackle.

They argue the project is “fiscally irresponsible and politically indefensible” and would only generate $0.52 in tax revenue for every $1 in credit, citing a May 2025 report commissioned by the state.

“Every dollar we lock into a corporate handout is a dollar we can’t put toward our rainy-day readiness, public education, health care, wildfire mitigation, housing, and the basic services Nevadans rely on when times get tight,” the organizations wrote in the letter.

Jared Kluesner, a psychiatric nurse at the Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health campus in Las Vegas and member of AFSCME, said the state should prioritize public services for people with mental health issues.

Kluesner wants Sony and Warner Bros. to build a film studio facility and create more jobs for Nevadans, but “if they’re going to do it at the cost of public services and funds that should be allocated to state workers, then that’s not really solving any problems.”

ASELSAN shines as defense stocks ride global rally

ISTANBUL

Defense and aerospace companies have delivered strong returns to investors as countries increase defense budgets and continue major projects, with Türkiye's ASELSAN standing out for its remarkable performance.

Following the Russia-Ukraine war and heightened security threats, many European nations have decided to boost defense investments. This surge in spending has fueled rapid gains in the share prices of defense and aerospace firms. NATO leaders’ decision to raise defense expenditures to 5 percent of GDP by 2035 has further strengthened the sector’s momentum in global markets.

Against this backdrop, stock performance over the first nine months of the year shows significant gains for investors: South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace rose 239 percent, Germany’s Rheinmetall 221.9 percent, Türkiye’s ASELSAN 196.6 percent, Sweden’s Saab 145.8 percent, the U.K.’s Rolls-Royce 109.3 percent, Italy’s Leonardo 108.3 percent and the U.K.’s BAE Systems 79.3 percent.

ASELSAN continues to play a pioneering role in the development and transformation of Türkiye’s defense technologies while also impressing with its financial results. The company became the first listed firm on Borsa Istanbul to surpass a market capitalization of 1 trillion Turkish Liras.

ASELSAN is working toward its goal of ranking among the world’s top 30 defense companies by 2030. Currently, it holds the highest market value within the BIST 100 index.

Meanwhile, on Borsa Istanbul, shares of Onur Yüksek Teknoloji remained unchanged, while SDT Space and Defense fell 3.1 percent and Altınay Defense dropped 11.8 percent. Other Turkish defense companies also showed mixed performances over the nine-month period. Papilon Savunma gained 26.2 percent, Otokar advanced 5.8 percent, Onur Yüksek Teknoloji ended flat, SDT Uzay ve Savunma declined 3.1 percent and Altınay Savunma recorded a sharper loss of 11.8 percent.

[TITLE]Tesla, Netflix set to report earnings as US-China trade fight turns 'unsustainable': What to watch this week:
[TEXT]
The stock market enters the third week of the government shutdown after a five-day run of market volatility shaped by US-China trade relations.

At the closing bell on Friday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all managed to eke out wins to cap a volatile week that saw swings for the major indexes each day.

This week, investors will get some clarity on the economic picture, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics set to publish the Consumer Price Index (CPI), one of most watched measures of inflation, on Friday after a delay from its originally planned release date of Oct. 15.

Figures ranging from import prices to retail sales to jobless claims are likely to remain missing from the calendar amid the ongoing government shutdown.

With the shutdown still in effect, the Federal Open Market Committee will also enter its blackout period ahead of the committee's October meeting, which is set to take place Oct. 28-29.

In the corporate sector, earnings season for the third quarter is properly underway after bank earnings this past week, and a packed roster of companies is set to report in the week ahead. Some of the week's biggest names include Magnificent Seven stock Tesla (TSLA), chipmaker Intel (INTC), streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), and Coca-Cola (KO), always a marker for retail consumption patterns.

This week will also see reports from the defense contracting majors in Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), along with several of the major telephone network operators, including T-Mobile (TMUS) and AT&T (T).

'Not sustainable'

After Beijing unveiled a sweeping series of new export controls that curtailed shipments of products with even trace amounts of a group of rare metals, President Trump took to Truth Social to threaten 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods before rolling that threat back.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US and China will hold talks later this week in Malaysia.

Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs

Rare earth stocks, one of the biggest winners of the past two weeks, gave up some of their gains as moves from Washington and Beijing swung investments up and down throughout the week.

A few days later, Trump made another post to Truth Social, this one labeling Beijing's cessation of US soybean purchases — a move that has been crushing the US agricultural sector — an "economically hostile act" and threatening that the US may stop buying Chinese cooking oil.

Then, when asked about a potential trade war, Trump told a reporter in the Oval Office that the US is "in one now" with China. Last week, Trump said his threats of high tariffs on Beijing are "not sustainable."
