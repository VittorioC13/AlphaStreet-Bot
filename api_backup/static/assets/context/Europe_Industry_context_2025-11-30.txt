[TITLE]Demulsifier Industry Worth Over $3 Billion by 2030: Pronounced Shift Towards Bio-Based and Sustainable Demulsifier Solutions:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Demulsifier Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Demulsifier Market, valued at USD 2.49 Billion in 2024, is projected to experience a CAGR of 3.52% to reach USD 3.06 Billion by 2030. The market's expansion is fundamentally driven by increasing global crude oil production to fulfill energy demands, coupled with the imperative for efficient water removal to prevent equipment corrosion and reduce transportation costs. The growing adoption of enhanced oil recovery techniques further amplifies the need for these specialized chemicals.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing global crude oil production and ongoing exploration activities represent a primary driver for the demulsifier market. As upstream operations intensify to meet the escalating worldwide energy demand, the volume of crude oil extracted, often in the form of water-in-oil emulsions, also rises significantly.

Demulsifiers are essential in separating water from crude oil, a critical step to prevent pipeline corrosion, reduce transportation costs, and meet crude oil quality specifications for refining. Without efficient demulsification, the presence of water can lead to severe operational inefficiencies and damage to infrastructure throughout the value chain.

Key Market Challenges

Stringent environmental regulations governing the toxicity and biodegradability of demulsifier formulations represent a significant impediment to the growth of the Global Demulsifier Market. These regulations mandate extensive research and development to create compliant products, directly increasing operational costs for manufacturers. Such requirements necessitate investment in new formulations and testing protocols, driving up the cost of bringing new demulsifier technologies to market.

The escalating regulatory burden directly hampers market expansion by elevating expenditures for both producers and end-users. According to the American Chemistry Council, in the fourth quarter of 2023, 43% of chemical manufacturers indicated their regulatory burden had increased. This trend continued, with 38% of manufacturers reporting an increased regulatory burden in the second quarter of 2024, and over half expecting a further rise in the subsequent six months. This consistent upward pressure on compliance costs can constrain profitability, slow down the adoption of new demulsifier solutions, and limit overall investment within the demulsifier segment.

Key Market Trends

The global demulsifier market is significantly influenced by a pronounced shift towards bio-based and sustainable demulsifier solutions. This trend is driven by increasing environmental regulations and a broader industry commitment to reducing the ecological footprint of chemical processes. Manufacturers are investing in research and development to create products derived from renewable resources that offer improved biodegradability profiles.

For example, research published in April 2025 highlighted that natural demulsifiers, sourced from plant extracts, waste oils, and biopolymers, are emerging as sustainable alternatives for crude oil demulsification, with studies in 2023 specifically evaluating the effectiveness of green demulsifiers on Nigerian crude oils. This indicates a move away from conventional petroleum-derived chemicals to more environmentally benign options.

[TITLE]The Cherry era of keyboards might be at an end as the company pulls the plug on German manufacturing after a $23 million loss:
[TEXT]
Bad news for fans of Cherry keyboards. Although the company's actual keebs don't rank on our list of the best gaming keyboards, the switches are in a league of their own—or they used to be, at least.

However, Cherry seems to have fallen on hard times, with a net loss of $23 million (20.4 million euros) between January and the end of September 2025. This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity.

The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future.

According to Heise, Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division.

Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general "peripherals" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

(Image credit: Future)

Cherry has already gone through a round of restructuring in 2024 (via Finanzwire), and it was the Peripherals division that got the axe back then, too.

The company's CFO, Jurjen Jongma, said: "Due to the group's low market capitalization and the current share price of Cherry below one euro, it is currently neither possible nor advisable to strengthen the group's equity in any way other than through strategic mergers & acquisitions options."

Cherry switches are safe for now, though. They fall under the Components division, which doesn't appear to be in any danger of being sold—but it faces other challenges.

Udo Streller, COO at Cherry, announced that it's shuttering its switch production in Auerbach, Germany. It's now being outsourced to China and Slovakia, while the Auerbach location will serve as a "service hub" for Cherry.

(Image credit: Future)

Cherry had a patent on its iconic Cherry MX design, but it expired in 2014. This has put Cherry in a difficult position, as other companies have picked up the design and iterated on it, including factory grease or oil lubrication right from the factory.

Cherry was also late to the party with Hall effect switches. Too much competition and a fairly slow post-pandemic gaming peripheral market seem to have taken their toll on Cherry.

What does this mean for the future? It's all quite unclear. If Cherry does end up selling its Peripherals division, it's likely that whichever company buys it will still keep making keyboards. Whether they'll be the exact same thing or something new remains to be seen. Cherry's switch production remains as it was, although outsourced.

In brief A Bonk ETP has begun trading on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, issued by Bitcoin Capital.

The product lets retail and institutional investors access Solana-based meme coin BONK through standard brokerage platforms.

BONK is currently the seventh-largest meme coin by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Solana-based meme coin Bonk (BONK) has begun trading on Switzerland's third-largest stock exchange, through a newly launched exchange traded product, adding another regulated crypto offering to Europe's expanding digital asset market.

Swiss-based crypto ETP issuer Bitcoin Capital issued the BONK ETP on SIX Swiss Exchange, allowing investors to gain exposure to the token through traditional brokerage accounts, according to an announcement shared with Decrypt.

As a subsidiary of Swiss asset-management boutique FiCAS AG, Bitcoin Capital launched the world's first actively managed Bitcoin ETP in 2020.

Switzerland's regulatory framework and market infrastructure for admitting crypto ETPs made it the “preferred venue for the launching a BONK ETP,” Marcel Niederberger, Chief Executive Officer at Bitcoin Capital & FiCAS told Decrypt.

"Europe, and specifically the SIX Swiss Exchange offers a highly developed regulatory environment with consistent supervisory practices," he said.

“The product will reach both institutional and retail investors through established broker platforms,” Niederberger said, noting that regulated ETP access tends to boost investor confidence and liquidity, with most inflows across Bitcoin Capital’s existing products still coming from institutional desks.

He anticipates “continued expansion of regulated products referencing BONK” next year, as maturing European infrastructure and rising appetite for thematic digital assets open the door to “additional ETPs and structured notes.”

BONK sits near $0.0599, up 3.5% on the day, ranking as the seventh-largest meme coin by market value per CoinGecko data.

﻿

Dogecoin leads activity

The Bonk listing follows a surge of meme coin products entering regulated markets mainly in the United States, dominated by Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market cap.

In September, the Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF became the first U.S. fund to hold DOGE, while asset manager Grayscale launched its spot GDOG product last week, generating approximately $1.4 million in first-day trading volume.

REX Shares also filed for a BONK ETF in January, alongside other meme coin products.

Meanwhile, 21Shares unveiled a 2x leveraged Dogecoin ETF on the Nasdaq last week, while Bitwise's Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, received approval from NYSE Arca on Tuesday for listing and registration.

[TITLE]S&P Futures Halted Due to CME Outage:
[TEXT]
Wall street sign in New York with New York Stock Exchange background by Stuart Monk via Shutterstock

December S&P 500 E-Mini futures ( ESZ25 ) were indicated up +0.10% before a technical outage at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange disrupted trading.

Trading of futures and options on the CME was halted for hours on Friday, disrupting some of the world’s most liquid futures markets. The halt hit U.S. Treasuries and equity futures, along with commodities and other asset classes. “Due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers, our markets are currently halted,” according to CME Group’s website. “Support is working to resolve the issue in the near term and will advise clients of pre-open details as soon as they are available,” it said.

Investors turned to exchange-traded funds tied to Wall Street’s major indexes as a barometer of broader market sentiment. SPDR’s S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) was up +0.28% in pre-market trading.

Today, the U.S. stock markets will be open for half a session, with trading ending at 1 p.m. Eastern Time.

In Wednesday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks ended in the green. Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ) surged over +10% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after announcing it had acquired a majority stake in LedgerX, a U.S.-based derivatives exchange, giving it entry into the prediction markets. Also, chip stocks gained ground, with Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) climbing more than +5% and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) rising over +3%. In addition, Dell Technologies ( DELL ) advanced more than +5% after the IT and PC giant raised its full-year revenue guidance. On the bearish side, Workday ( WDAY ) slumped over -7% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 as the human resources software provider’s Q3 subscription revenue disappointed investors.

Economic data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. durable goods orders rose +0.5% m/m in September, in line with expectations, and core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation, rose +0.6% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m. Also, the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week unexpectedly fell by -6K to a 7-month low of 216K, compared with the 226K expected. At the same time, the U.S. Chicago PMI fell to 36.3 in November, weaker than expectations of 44.3.

“Overall, it was a stronger-than-expected round of [economic] data that has reinforced the notion that there are crosscurrents and mixed performance in the real economy. That being said, there is nothing within the reports that will derail the FOMC from cutting by 25 basis points on Dec. 10,” according to Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.

The Fed said Wednesday in its Beige Book survey of regional business contacts that U.S. economic activity was little changed in recent weeks. “Outlooks were largely unchanged overall. Some contacts noted an increased risk of slower activity in coming months, while some optimism was noted among manufacturers,” according to the Beige Book. The report noted that employment declined slightly and prices increased at a moderate pace. The report also said multiple districts, including New York, Atlanta, and Minneapolis, reported that spending by higher-income consumers remained resilient, while spending weakened among low- and middle-income households. Economists stated that nothing in the report challenged expectations for a December rate cut.

Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 84.7% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 15.3% chance of no rate change at the December FOMC meeting.

The U.S. economic data slate is empty on Friday.

In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was last indicated at 4.010%, up +0.35%.

The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.02% this morning, hovering around the flatline as investors refrain from making big bets ahead of the weekend and a holiday-shortened trading session in the U.S. Bank stocks underperformed on Friday. At the same time, energy and mining stocks gained ground. The benchmark index is on track to post its strongest weekly advance since early October, supported by growing expectations for a Fed rate cut next month and signs of progress in Ukraine peace talks. Preliminary data released on Friday showed that the annual inflation rate in France and Italy held steady in November, while Spain’s inflation eased slightly, keeping the European Central Bank on track to hold rates steady. Separately, data showed that the number of people out of work in Germany rose less than expected in November, highlighting a sluggish recovery in the labor market. Investors now await preliminary inflation data from Germany due later in the session. In other news, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday that he plans to send a letter to the EU Commission urging it to preserve technological flexibility for the automotive industry beyond the bloc’s planned 2035 ban on new combustion-engine vehicles. In corporate news, Delivery Hero SE ( DHER.D.DX ) climbed over +7% after Bloomberg reported that several major shareholders were pressuring management to explore a sale of the company or parts of its business.

Germany’s Retail Sales, Germany’s Unemployment Change, Germany’s Unemployment Rate, France’s CPI (preliminary), France’s GDP, Spain’s CPI (preliminary), Italy’s GDP, and Italy’s CPI (preliminary) data were released today.

The German October Retail Sales unexpectedly fell -0.3% m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.1% m/m.

The German November Unemployment Change stood at 1K, stronger than expectations of 4K.

The German November Unemployment Rate was 6.3%, in line with expectations.

The French November CPI fell -0.1% m/m and rose +0.9% y/y, weaker than expectations of no change m/m and +1.0% y/y.

The French GDP came in at +0.5% q/q and +0.9% y/y in the third quarter, in line with expectations.

The Spanish November CPI rose +3.0% y/y, in line with expectations.

The Italian GDP arrived at +0.1% q/q and +0.6% y/y in the third quarter, stronger than expectations of no change q/q and +0.4% y/y.

The Italian November CPI fell -0.2% m/m and rose +1.2% y/y, weaker than expectations of -0.1% m/m and +1.3% y/y.

Asian stock markets today settled in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.34%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.17%.

China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed higher today as investors continued to favor AI-related stocks. Semiconductor and non-ferrous metal stocks led the gains on Friday. At the same time, real estate stocks extended their declines, with China Vanke dropping more than -1% on mounting debt concerns. Ratings agency S&P Global on Friday downgraded China Vanke’s long-term issuer credit rating to CCC- from CCC and put the firm on CreditWatch with negative implications. The benchmark index posted gains for the week. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded its view on China’s stocks to “Overweight,” saying the potential for sizable gains next year now outweighs the risk of significant losses. “China has given back most of its outperformance this year — making for an attractive entry point. Next year will bring multiple support factors such as AI adoption, consumption measures, and governance reforms,” the bank’s strategists wrote in a note. In corporate news, Anta Sports Products and Li Ning both fell in Hong Kong after Reuters reported that the two firms are among those considering a possible takeover of troubled German sportswear maker Puma. Investor attention now shifts to China’s November factory activity data, set for release on Sunday, for further insight into the economy’s health. Market participants also look ahead to the Politburo meeting and the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) in December for signals on next year’s policy agenda. There is optimism that the CEWC could bring more fiscal support.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed slightly higher today. Machinery and steel stocks outperformed on Friday. The benchmark index notched a solid weekly gain but posted its weakest November performance since 2011. Government data released on Friday showed that core consumer inflation in Japan’s capital remained well above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target in November as companies continued to pass through higher costs, primarily for food. Separate data showed that Japan’s industrial output unexpectedly rose in October from the previous month, and retail sales also rose much more than expected, despite headwinds from tariffs and inflation. In addition, data showed that Japan’s unemployment rate held steady at 2.6% in October. Persistent inflation and a tight labor market indicate that “the Bank of Japan will resume its tightening cycle over the next couple of months,” according to Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics. Another factor supporting a rate hike is the yen’s rapid weakening in recent weeks, which has fueled concerns about rising import costs. There is only one remaining opportunity for the BOJ to act this year, at its December 18-19 meeting, with economists divided over whether it will make a move then or wait until the first month of 2026. Meanwhile, benchmark Japanese bonds fell on Friday amid expectations that the government will issue more of the securities to finance large new spending. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s government on Friday finalized a $117 billion supplementary budget for this fiscal year to fund a massive stimulus package. In other news, foreign investors offloaded a net 348.7 billion yen worth of Japanese stocks in the week ended November 22nd, likely locking in some profits, according to data from the Ministry of Finance. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -7.22% to 27.61.

The Japanese November Tokyo Core CPI rose +2.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.7% y/y.

The Japanese October Industrial Production (preliminary) unexpectedly rose +1.4% m/m, stronger than expectations of -0.5% m/m.

The Japanese October Retail Sales rose +1.7% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.8% y/y.

The Japanese October Unemployment Rate was 2.6%, weaker than expectations of 2.5%.

Pre-Market U.S. Stock Movers

The Magnificent Seven stocks are moving higher in pre-market trading, with Alphabet ( GOOGL ) rising over +1% and Amazon.com ( AMZN ) gaining about +0.9%.

Chip stocks advanced in pre-market trading, with Micron Technology ( MU ) climbing more than +3% and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) rising nearly +1%.

Canadian National Railway ( CNI ) rose about +0.5% in pre-market trading after CIBC upgraded the stock to Outperformer from Neutral.

CME Group ( CME ) fell -0.8% in pre-market trading after a data-center issue halted trading of futures and options on the CME.

[TITLE]8.2% GDP growth signals expanding economic momentum:
[TEXT]
Mohammad Hanief

India’s economy has recorded an impressive GDP growth rate of 8.2% in the second quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, reaffirming the country’s position as one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. This achievement comes at a time when global markets remain unsettled by geopolitical tensions, inflationary waves, and uneven recovery in advanced economies. India’s economic performance, driven by renewed domestic confidence and structural policy support, stands out as a marker of stability and resilience in a turbulent global environment.

The union government has welcomed the newly released figures, describing them as a reflection of the country’s expanding economic capacity and the effectiveness of ongoing reforms. The Prime Minister has noted that such growth underscores the contribution of India’s workforce, entrepreneurs, and industry, while also highlighting the positive trajectory created by sustained policy initiatives. He has reiterated that the government remains committed to advancing reforms and strengthening systems that improve the ease of living for citizens, ensuring that the benefits of growth extend across all sections of society.

India’s economic expansion is characterised by a broad revival across multiple sectors. Domestic demand remains one of the strongest drivers of growth. Urban consumption continues to rise steadily, buoyed by expanding employment opportunities, improved digital access, and enhanced spending capacity. Services associated with travel, communication, retail, and hospitality have seen a substantial revival after a period of prolonged disruption, while emerging service areas such as digital finance and healthcare continue to expand. This transition reflects a shift toward more technology-driven consumption patterns, which in turn support new business models and job creation.

Rural consumption, though influenced by seasonal variations and price fluctuations, has maintained overall resilience. Agricultural stability in several regions, supported by rural infrastructure improvements, has contributed to steady spending patterns. Smaller towns and semi-urban centres have also become important growth nodes, creating new consumption clusters that broaden the base of economic activity beyond traditional metros.

India’s industrial landscape has shown renewed dynamism. Manufacturing has strengthened, supported by higher production levels, sustained demand for domestic goods, and increased confidence among businesses. Policy incentives encouraging domestic manufacturing have attracted fresh investments into sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, renewable-energy components, and automotive products. The shift in global manufacturing preferences, with companies seeking diversified and stable supply chains, has increased India’s appeal as a potential industrial hub.

The construction sector continues to be one of the strongest pillars of the current growth phase. Nationwide infrastructure expansion-covering highways, express corridors, rail modernisation, port upgrades, airport development, and urban housing-has generated wide-ranging economic activity. These initiatives not only propel demand for construction materials but also play a crucial role in employment creation. The scale of public infrastructure spending has produced a ripple effect across allied industries, generating incentives for private participation and supporting thousands of small and medium enterprises connected to supply chains.

India’s investment climate has also strengthened. A sustained rise in capital formation indicates growing confidence among investors. Public-sector expenditure on infrastructure, digital connectivity, and energy systems has laid the foundation for long-term economic momentum. A series of reforms implemented over recent years-ranging from improvements in tax compliance to digitisation of administrative services-have contributed to a more transparent and predictable business environment. These measures have helped streamline processes, reduce barriers, and increase the ease with which businesses operate.

Financial institutions have shown improved health, with stronger balance sheets and rising credit flows to priority sectors. Lending to small and medium enterprises has expanded, supported by government-backed credit mechanisms. This has enabled smaller businesses to participate more effectively in the recovery process and further strengthened the interconnected structure of the economy. Digital payments continue to grow rapidly, deepening financial inclusion and enabling quicker business transactions across rural and urban areas alike.

Even as India’s domestic sectors show strong results, the global environment remains mixed. Export sectors face external pressures due to slower international demand and fluctuations in commodity markets. Despite these headwinds, India has managed to maintain a steady export performance by expanding its presence in sectors such as engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and electronics. Agricultural exports have also shown resilience in several categories. Traditional export industries, including textiles and gems and jewellery, continue to be affected by global market softness, but the diversification of export baskets has helped reduce overall impact.

The services export sector remains one of India’s most stable global strengths. Technology services, business process management, consulting, and financial services continue to attract international demand. India’s skilled workforce, growing digital capacity, and expanding knowledge sectors have played a key role in maintaining a strong services export position, even during periods of global uncertainty.

Employment trends, while still adjusting to pre-pandemic patterns, show gradual improvement. The expansion of construction and manufacturing has supported large-scale labour absorption, particularly in urban and semi-urban regions. The services sector has opened significant opportunities across varying skill levels, supported by the growth of logistics, retail, education, digital platforms, and healthcare. The rise of gig-based and platform-based employment has diversified income opportunities for young workers, particularly in urban centres. At the same time, government initiatives aimed at skill development and digital training continue to bridge gaps between labour supply and industry demand.

Inflation remains a concern, particularly in food categories influenced by seasonal and supply-chain disruptions. Although core inflation has moderated, food prices continue to fluctuate, affecting household budgets. Policymakers maintain a cautious approach to inflation management, balancing price stability with the need to sustain growth. The Reserve Bank of India’s approach has remained focused on ensuring stability in the financial system while providing monetary conditions that support economic expansion.

BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau -- Soldiers in Guinea-Bissau who seized power following disputed national elections earlier this week appointed a close ally of the deposed president as prime minister on Friday.

The country's new military leader, Gen. Horta Inta-a, announced the appointment of finance minister Ilídio Vieira Té as prime minister in a decree.

Vieira Té is a close ally of the deposed President Umaro Sissoco Embaló, having served as his campaign director during the presidential election that took place Sunday.

Soldiers in the Guinea-Bissau seized power in the country on Wednesday, three days after the closely contested presidential vote.

The opposition claimed that Embaló had “fabricated” the coup to avoid an election defeat in Sunday’s vote. The military takeover and the reported arrest of Embaló were manufactured to disrupt election results, according to his rival Fernando Dias, who, like Embaló, claimed to have won the vote.

Guinea-Bissau, one of the world’s poorest countries, has been dogged by coups and attempted coups since its independence from Portugal more than 50 years ago, including a coup attempt in October. The country of 2.2 million people is known as a hub for drug trafficking between Latin America and Europe, a trend that experts say has fueled its political crises.

The High Military Command on Friday lifted the curfew it imposed during its military takeover and authorized the movement of people and public transportation across all neighborhoods of the capital, Bissau.

Calm has returned to the capital, with people and vehicles circulating through the city’s streets after army checkpoints were lifted. The main stock exchange and markets in outlying districts, as well as commercial banks, have also reopened.

Embaló, meanwhile, arrived in neighboring Senegal Thursday with a flight chartered by the Senegalese government which has been “in direct communication with all concerned Guinea-Bissau actors,” Senegal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement, as the country promised to work with partners to restore democracy in Guinea-Bissau.

Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko on Friday described the military takeover in Guinea-Bissau as a “scheme,” echoing claims that the coup was manufactured to disrupt election results. He called for the release of arrested opposition members.

“The democratic process must be carried through to the end and the results announced," Sonko said during a parliamentary session.

Late Thursday, the West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS said it is suspending Guinea-Bissau from its decision-making bodies “until the restoration of full and effective constitutional order in the country.”

ECOWAS said it also “reserves the right to use all options” allowed under its rules, “including sanctions on all entities deemed culpable of disrupting the electoral and democratic process.”

The regional bloc said a mediation team, led by the body’s chair and including the presidents of Togo, Cabo Verde and Senegal, will travel to Bissau to “engage the leaders of the coup with a view to ensuring the full restoration of constitutional order.”

Widely seen as West Africa’s leading political and regional authority, the 15-nation ECOWAS was formed in 1975 to promote economic integration in member states. The bloc often collaborates with members’ governments to solve domestic challenges on various fronts from politics to economics and security.

It has struggled in recent years to reverse coups in the region where citizens have complained of not benefiting from rich natural resources.

Sanctions against junta-led Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso and threats of military intervention in Niger to reverse the coup eventually led to the three countries’ withdrawal from the bloc earlier this year.

Bakary Sambe, who heads the Senegal-based Timbuktu Institute for Peace Studies, said the situation in Guinea-Bissau is still unclear, and any immediate decision by ECOWAS regarding sanctions would seem rushed and counterproductive.

“We are in a state of total uncertainty, caught between an unfinished electoral process and a disruption of constitutional order caused by a coup, which has led to contradictory interpretations and various questions,” he said.

“The regional organization appears to have learned from the mistakes made in Niger and is trying as much as possible to temper its inclination to impose sanctions,” Sambe added.

Ferry company Stena Line and Associated British Ports (ABP) are set to begin construction on a new freight ferry terminal at the Port of Immingham on the east coast of England, marking a joint investment exceeding £200m ($264m).

The project aims to address rising demand in the unaccompanied freight market in the Humber region, with the new Immingham Eastern roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) terminal (IERRT) scheduled for development in Lincolnshire.

The terminal will offer access to the main Humber Estuary, which will enable faster sailing times and accommodate larger RoRo vessels.

ABP’s four ports on the Humber collectively represent the UK’s largest gateway for trade by volume.

Stena Line currently operates two daily ferry services between the Humber region and the Netherlands.

Stena Line CEO Niclas Mårtensson said: “Stena Line has 20 routes across Northern Europe and the Mediterranean and Immingham port is a key part of that network.

[TITLE]8.2% GDP growth signals expanding economic momentum:
[TEXT]
Mohammad Hanief

India’s economy has recorded an impressive GDP growth rate of 8.2% in the second quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, reaffirming the country’s position as one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. This achievement comes at a time when global markets remain unsettled by geopolitical tensions, inflationary waves, and uneven recovery in advanced economies. India’s economic performance, driven by renewed domestic confidence and structural policy support, stands out as a marker of stability and resilience in a turbulent global environment.

The union government has welcomed the newly released figures, describing them as a reflection of the country’s expanding economic capacity and the effectiveness of ongoing reforms. The Prime Minister has noted that such growth underscores the contribution of India’s workforce, entrepreneurs, and industry, while also highlighting the positive trajectory created by sustained policy initiatives. He has reiterated that the government remains committed to advancing reforms and strengthening systems that improve the ease of living for citizens, ensuring that the benefits of growth extend across all sections of society.

India’s economic expansion is characterised by a broad revival across multiple sectors. Domestic demand remains one of the strongest drivers of growth. Urban consumption continues to rise steadily, buoyed by expanding employment opportunities, improved digital access, and enhanced spending capacity. Services associated with travel, communication, retail, and hospitality have seen a substantial revival after a period of prolonged disruption, while emerging service areas such as digital finance and healthcare continue to expand. This transition reflects a shift toward more technology-driven consumption patterns, which in turn support new business models and job creation.

Rural consumption, though influenced by seasonal variations and price fluctuations, has maintained overall resilience. Agricultural stability in several regions, supported by rural infrastructure improvements, has contributed to steady spending patterns. Smaller towns and semi-urban centres have also become important growth nodes, creating new consumption clusters that broaden the base of economic activity beyond traditional metros.

India’s industrial landscape has shown renewed dynamism. Manufacturing has strengthened, supported by higher production levels, sustained demand for domestic goods, and increased confidence among businesses. Policy incentives encouraging domestic manufacturing have attracted fresh investments into sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, renewable-energy components, and automotive products. The shift in global manufacturing preferences, with companies seeking diversified and stable supply chains, has increased India’s appeal as a potential industrial hub.

The construction sector continues to be one of the strongest pillars of the current growth phase. Nationwide infrastructure expansion-covering highways, express corridors, rail modernisation, port upgrades, airport development, and urban housing-has generated wide-ranging economic activity. These initiatives not only propel demand for construction materials but also play a crucial role in employment creation. The scale of public infrastructure spending has produced a ripple effect across allied industries, generating incentives for private participation and supporting thousands of small and medium enterprises connected to supply chains.

India’s investment climate has also strengthened. A sustained rise in capital formation indicates growing confidence among investors. Public-sector expenditure on infrastructure, digital connectivity, and energy systems has laid the foundation for long-term economic momentum. A series of reforms implemented over recent years-ranging from improvements in tax compliance to digitisation of administrative services-have contributed to a more transparent and predictable business environment. These measures have helped streamline processes, reduce barriers, and increase the ease with which businesses operate.

Financial institutions have shown improved health, with stronger balance sheets and rising credit flows to priority sectors. Lending to small and medium enterprises has expanded, supported by government-backed credit mechanisms. This has enabled smaller businesses to participate more effectively in the recovery process and further strengthened the interconnected structure of the economy. Digital payments continue to grow rapidly, deepening financial inclusion and enabling quicker business transactions across rural and urban areas alike.

Even as India’s domestic sectors show strong results, the global environment remains mixed. Export sectors face external pressures due to slower international demand and fluctuations in commodity markets. Despite these headwinds, India has managed to maintain a steady export performance by expanding its presence in sectors such as engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and electronics. Agricultural exports have also shown resilience in several categories. Traditional export industries, including textiles and gems and jewellery, continue to be affected by global market softness, but the diversification of export baskets has helped reduce overall impact.

The services export sector remains one of India’s most stable global strengths. Technology services, business process management, consulting, and financial services continue to attract international demand. India’s skilled workforce, growing digital capacity, and expanding knowledge sectors have played a key role in maintaining a strong services export position, even during periods of global uncertainty.

Employment trends, while still adjusting to pre-pandemic patterns, show gradual improvement. The expansion of construction and manufacturing has supported large-scale labour absorption, particularly in urban and semi-urban regions. The services sector has opened significant opportunities across varying skill levels, supported by the growth of logistics, retail, education, digital platforms, and healthcare. The rise of gig-based and platform-based employment has diversified income opportunities for young workers, particularly in urban centres. At the same time, government initiatives aimed at skill development and digital training continue to bridge gaps between labour supply and industry demand.

Inflation remains a concern, particularly in food categories influenced by seasonal and supply-chain disruptions. Although core inflation has moderated, food prices continue to fluctuate, affecting household budgets. Policymakers maintain a cautious approach to inflation management, balancing price stability with the need to sustain growth. The Reserve Bank of India’s approach has remained focused on ensuring stability in the financial system while providing monetary conditions that support economic expansion.

The government has emphasised that the recent GDP performance reinforces the importance of continuing reforms and strengthening the ecosystem that enhances ease of living. Efforts are under way to improve digital access, expand affordable housing, enhance transportation infrastructure, and increase access to healthcare and social protection. A key focus moving forward will be ensuring that the benefits of economic growth translate into tangible improvements in quality of life and reduced disparities across regions and social categories.

Looking ahead, India’s economic prospects remain robust. The combination of strong domestic demand, renewed industrial activity, expanding services, and sustained investment forms a stable foundation for the coming quarters. The government’s approach-anchored in policy continuity, infrastructure expansion, and reform-driven governance-seeks to create conditions that support long-term growth. While global uncertainties will continue to influence external sectors, India’s structural strengths and diversified economic base position it favourably among emerging economies.

The 8.2% GDP growth rate is more than an indicator of short-term recovery; it signals a broader economic transformation under way. It reflects the growing strength of sectors that have adapted to new realities, the contribution of citizens and businesses across the country, and the policy environment that continues to push for greater transparency, efficiency, and inclusion. As India moves further into the fiscal year, the economic narrative is marked by confidence and a renewed sense of possibility, with a clear national focus on ensuring that growth translates into improved opportunities and living standards for all.

The Role of Advanced Materials in Aerospace

Aircraft and spacecraft are subject to extreme operational conditions, including high temperatures, intense pressures, and exposure to corrosive elements. While often lightweight and relatively strong, traditional materials such as aluminum often lack the durability required for high-performance aerospace applications. Advanced materials address these challenges by offering superior mechanical properties while maintaining low weight, improving overall efficiency and reliability.

For a material to be considered viable for aerospace applications, it usually must possess a high strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring aircraft remain lightweight while maintaining structural integrity. Thermal and corrosion resistance are other essential characteristics, as aerospace materials must endure extreme temperatures and exposure to oxidation and other environmental factors. Additionally, flight hardware experiences repeated stress cycles, necessitating materials with exceptional fatigue and fracture resistance to prevent catastrophic failures. Despite these demanding requirements, materials must also be manufacturable and cost-effective, allowing for large-scale production while maintaining affordability.

Three of the most prominent types of advanced materials—composites, superalloys, and titanium alloys—are revolutionizing aerospace engineering.
