[TITLE]Oil Stabilizes After Selloff Amid OPEC Reassessment and U.S. Funding Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices steadied on Wednesday after a sharp 4% slide the day before, with Brent trading near $63.08 and WTI around $58.80 at 11:01 a.m. ET, as traders reassessed the latest OPEC shift toward a more balanced 2026 market outlook. The passage of the U.S. funding deal that ended the government shutdown removed one macro problem, but crude remained focused on supply signals rather than broader risk sentiment.

The modest rebound contrasted with the equity rally highlighted by Bloomberg, where U.S. indices advanced on softer inflation readings, renewed risk appetite and relief following the shutdown resolution. The move in equities had limited pull on crude, which stayed driven by evolving supply projections and near-term balance concerns.

The recovery follows Tuesday’s selloff linked to OPEC’s updated projections, which show the cartel moving away from its earlier deficit view and toward a neutral supply-demand balance next year. Traders reacted to signals that rising non-OPEC output and incremental OPEC+ barrels could offset moderate consumption growth. Those factors, combined with a softer demand trajectory outlined in the IEA’s latest assessment, left the market focused on potential surplus risk.

Diesel margins firmed during the session, while crude futures recovered more slowly. Murban traded near 65.43 on steady Asian buying and stable demand for middle distillates. Natural gas edged toward 4.62, supported by early-season heating needs and lower storage levels.

The Bloomberg update showed equities rising as Treasury yields fell, but that shift offered little lift to crude. Traders said oil remains tied to OPEC+ supply decisions and demand expectations through early 2026, not the broader market mood.

A softer dollar and lower Treasury yields added some support to commodities, though they did not shift the outlook for crude supplies. Asia continued to take regular cargoes, and early-winter demand for diesel and jet fuel stayed firm. Traders said many positions were still small following Tuesday’s selloff as the market waits for guidance on upcoming OPEC+ output levels and demand expectations for early 2026.

[TITLE]Norway’s Oil Industry Raises 2026 Investment Forecast:
[TEXT]
Energy operators offshore Norway expect to invest $24.8 billion (249 billion Norwegian crowns) in oil and gas activities next year, Statistics Norway’s latest quarterly survey showed on Thursday.

The estimate is $1.9 billion higher compared to the previous quarter’s forecast, mainly driven by higher forecasts of investments in field development and operating fields, the Norwegian statistics office said.

The increased estimate of investment in field development is chiefly pushed up by higher costs being reported for some development projects.

Since the autumn of 2024, the total costs of the ongoing projects have increased by

[TITLE]Oil Prices Climb as Senate Passes Deal to Reopen Government:
[TEXT]
In early Asian trade on Monday, crude oil prices were climbing after the United States Senate passed a funding agreement that could end the federal government shutdown. At the time of writing, WTI had climbed to $60.20 while Brent was trading at $64.05, both up by roughly 0.7%.

Senate negotiators had struck a deal ahead of a Sunday evening session to begin advancing a House-passed continuing resolution. After nearly two hours, the funding measure passed with the support of eight Democrats.

The package combines the continuing resolution with a “minibus” appropriations bundle (three long-term spending bills) and guarantees the Democrats a vote on extending health-insurance tax credits.

From a market perspective, the expectation that roughly 800,000 unpaid federal workers will soon see their salaries returned, benefit programs will restart, and key government services will resume is boosting sentiment. Speaking to Reuters, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore argued that the reopening prospect “should also help improve risk sentiment across markets”.

The optimism surrounding a deal can be seen on platforms such as Polymarket, which now has the odds of the shutdown ending before the 16th of November at 95%. Despite the rising confidence, a deal still faces some hurdles. After the Senate vote, approval by the United States House of Representatives needs to be secured, and the President will have to sign off before the longest government shutdown in history is brought to an end.

For oil markets, a government reopening should lead to improved domestic U.S. demand for goods and services (including energy) and the return of halted government spending, which can bolster crude demand. Additionally, improved risk appetite tends to reduce safe-haven premiums and can shift funds into commodities like oil.

[TITLE]Condor Announces 2025 Third Quarter Results:
[TEXT]
CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Condor Energies Inc. (“Condor” or the “Company”) (TSX:CDR), a Canadian based, internationally focused energy transition company focused on Central Asia is pleased to announce the release of its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 (the “Financial Statements”), together with the related management’s discussion and analysis. These documents will be made available under Condor’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Condor website at www.condorenergies.ca. Readers are invited to review the latest corporate presentation available on the Condor website. All financial amounts in this news release are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.

HIGHLIGHTS

Production in Uzbekistan for the third quarter of 2025 averaged 9,978 boe/d comprised of 9,778 boe/d (58,668 Mcf/d) of natural gas and 200 bopd of condensate.

Uzbekistan natural gas and condensate sales for the third quarter of 2025 was $18.74 million.

Drilling of Uzbekistan’s first horizontal well continues and the planned 1000-meter lateral section is currently underway with numerous mud gas shows being encountered.

A field optimization study and engineering design for the first phase of field compression has been completed, and the procurement process has commenced. Installing compression will increase gas production rates and recoverable volumes by reducing well back pressure.

On August 12, 2025, the Company executed a USD $5.0 million-dollar bridge loan facility (the “Bridge Loan”) for the First LNG Facility which is scheduled to produce Kazakhstan’s first LNG in the third quarter of 2026.

MESSAGE FROM CONDOR’S CEO

Don Streu, President and CEO of Condor commented: “Condor is in an envious position given its diverse portfolio of energy-transition initiatives in Central Asia, a region that is drawing increased focus and foreign direct investment for its energy and critical minerals sectors. Our team has decades of experience operating in remote regions and has successfully introduced modern operating techniques and technologies, while maintaining a deep understanding of value realization in these environments.

The Company is currently drilling Uzbekistan’s longest horizontal well and is using Western tools and techniques never before deployed there. Our multi-well drilling campaign is intended to materially increase both gas production rates and associated cash flows, and Condor’s recently reprocessed 3-D seismic data set has generated an extensive inventory of undrilled structures, with numerous infill and undrained attic closure locations identified. Accordingly, we are actively pursuing a second drilling rig to accelerate our planned 12-well drilling program in 2026.

We continue to make strong progress in our efforts to deliver Central Asia’s first LNG production, and we are on track to commence production in the third quarter of 2026. The three LNG feedgas allocations awarded to Condor to-date total more than 625 million cubic meters of natural gas per year and the allocations are strategically located to supply LNG fuel to multiple consumers in various regions of the country. The Government of Kazakhstan supports Condor’s LNG initiative, since it will provide the country with greater energy security while assisting in achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets.

The Company is also conducting an aeromagnetic survey at one of our critical minerals licenses to help further define mineral deposits and structural trends which will allow us to better understand the potential for both copper and lithium development. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of mining licenses awarded in the areas adjacent to the Company’s license areas and active copper exploration activities are underway by major mining companies. Given the heavily faulted systems we’ve mapped in this geothermally active region, it appears that mineralized brines have migrated into the basin’s reservoirs, as is evident by the lithium concentrations on Condor’s blocks, as previously reported by the Ministry of Geology of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Condor remains committed to advancing its diverse portfolio of assets for the benefit of our shareholders, stakeholders and host governments while continuing to position the Company as a leading energy transition developer in Central Asia”.

Production in Uzbekistan

The Company operates under a production enhancement services contract with JSC Uzbekneftegaz (“UNG”) in Uzbekistan to increase the production, recovery, and overall system efficiency from an integrated cluster of eight conventional natural gas-condensate fields (the “PEC Project”). Production in the third quarter of 2025 averaged 9,978 boe/d comprised of 9,778 boe/d (58,668 Mcf/d) of natural gas and 200 bopd of condensate.

Total production in Uzbekistan for the third quarter of 2025 decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2025 due mainly to natural reservoir decline but offset by the increased production from the various workovers performed during the third quarter of 2025 consisting of recompletions, tubing changes, and artificial lift installations. One of the recompletions in the third quarter of 2025 involved perforating a new zone of interest and resulted in an incremental average daily production rate of 2.2 MMscf/d.

On September 8, 2025 the Company commenced drilling its first well in Uzbekistan (the “First Well”). A pilot vertical hole was drilled to a total depth of 2,805 meters that penetrated the currently producing carbonate reservoir sections as well as deeper, under-exploited stacked clastic reservoir sections. After coring and extensive wireline logging operations, petrophysical analysis indicates 37.6 meters of non-contiguous net gas pay was identified consisting of 28.5 meters in carbonate reservoirs and 9.1 meters in deeper clastic reservoirs. Following logging, the pilot hole was open-hole sidetracked to drill a horizontal leg into a known carbonate reservoir. Drilling of the 1000-meter lateral section is ongoing with numerous mud gas shows being recorded. Depending on drilling conditions, the lateral section may be extended. Once reaching total depth, the lateral section will be flow tested and shut in for build up pressure evaluation while the rig moves to the next drill location (the “Second Well”). The First Well is expected to be tied into the Company’s production system in December 2025.

The Second Well will be drilled from the same pad location and target a shallower carbonate reservoir identified in the recently drilled pilot hole of the First Well. The Second Well will utilize a simplified casing design to leverage drilling learnings from the previous two penetrations to reduce drilling time and costs and is planned to be a geo-steered, 1,000-meter open hole horizontal well and aims to further de-risk the stacked carbonate reservoirs present across the Company’s licenses.

The Company is also in the process of contracting a second drilling rig to concurrently drill at a nearby under-developed gas field located in the southern region of the Company’s licenses in Uzbekistan. This field is currently producing from a single downdip gas well where Condor recently perforated an eight-meter thick carbonate interval which increased the well’s average daily production from 1.1 MMscf/day to 7.5 MMscf/day for the first thirty days and has produced an average of 6.0 MMscf/day for the past six months. This recompletion has also de-risked the large undeveloped, up-dip structural closure that was identified on the Company’s recently reprocessed and interpreted 3-D seismic data. With the second drilling rig, Condor plans to drill an initial vertical well through the top of the structure to confirm current mapping, collect modern wireline and core data, and provide test rates. This will be followed by a pad-style horizontal development drilling program targeting three reservoirs with up to six horizontal wells. A second pad location is also envisioned to develop this structure as it represents material undeveloped volumes. Up to twelve wells in total are planned to be drilled in 2026 with the two rigs to accelerate gas production volumes.

Installation of field compression remains a top priority for the Company in 2026. Engineering design for the first phase of field compression (“Phase 1”) has been completed, and the procurement process has commenced. Phase 1 compression will increase gas production by reducing the well’s back pressure and mitigate the negative impact of fluctuating and increasing gas sales line pressure. Simulation work conducted by an independent third-party engineering company indicates compression will yield over 20 MMscf/day of incremental gas production with the reduction of well back pressure and lost production due to increasing gas sales line pressure. The field compression facility is scheduled to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2026. Actual results may differ as described below in the Business Risks and

[TITLE]TotalEnergies agrees renewable power deal with Google for Ohio data centres:
[TEXT]
Oil major TotalEnergies has agreed a 15-year power purchase deal to supply Alphabet's Google with 1.5 terawatt hours of renewable electricity from its Montpelier solar farm in Ohio, the French company said on Wednesday.

The solar facility, which is nearing completion, is connected to the PJM grid, the largest in the United States, and will help power Google’s data centre operations in the state, it said.

"This agreement illustrates TotalEnergies’s ability to meet the growing energy demands of major tech companies by leveraging its integrated portfolio of renewable and flexible assets," said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables and Power at TotalEnergies.

The company's growing investment in electricity is helping the company secure a steadier revenue stream and avoid the boom-and-bust cycles typical of oil and gas, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said earlier this month at the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi.

The Paris-listed firm is deploying a 10 gigawatt portfolio in the United States, with onshore solar, wind and battery storage projects.

[TITLE]Turbo Energy to pilot tokenized financing for renewable energy projects on Stellar:
[TEXT]
Turbo Energy (Nasdaq: TURB) is launching a pilot project to tokenize financing for hybrid renewable energy systems, starting with an on-site solar and battery installation at a supermarket in Spain. The initiative aims to demonstrate how blockchain-based debt instruments can fund distributed energy projects.

The project is being developed in collaboration with digital asset infrastructure firm Taurus and the Stellar Development Foundation. According to an announcement, the pilot will test how tokenized financing can support liquidity and improve capital access to renewable energy funding.

Energy-as-a-Service is a model that allows customers to pay for energy use or performance without owning any equipment. It allows businesses to access clean energy through subscription-style contracts while providers handle installation, maintenance and operation.

The pilot will tokenize debt financing for on-site Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) using Turbo Energy’s SUNBOX solar storage systems. The model aims to create a scalable framework for financing commercial and industrial solar projects worldwide.

Taurus will issue and manage Turbo Energy’s renewable-energy tokens using the Stellar blockchain, which will enable fractional, onchain financing, allowing more investors to participate in funding clean-energy projects.

According to data from Grand View Research cited by Turbo Energy, the global EaaS sector was valued at $74.43 billion in 2024 and is expected to more than double to $145.18 billion by 2030.

Clean energy in blockchain

In Bitcoin’s early years, critics often claimed that its heavy energy use made it harmful to the environment. While it is true that Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains consume significant amounts of electricity to secure their networks, innovation within the crypto ecosystem is also driving eco-friendly solutions.

In January, Italian renewable energy company Enel Group teamed up with crypto wallet company Conio to let investors buy tokenized shares of solar panels on the Algorand blockchain. The offering allowed Italian investors to purchase fractional ownership in Enel’s solar farms and apply the generated energy to offset power consumption in their homes.

In October, Thopen, a Brazilian solar power company, announced it was considering a pivot into Bitcoin mining to “absorb local generated energy” from the country’s renewable sector.

In August, the UK-based publicly traded company Union Jack Oil, announced plans to use natural gas from undeveloped wells to generate electricity for Bitcoin mining.
