[TITLE]SoftBank, Ark May Back Stablecoin Giant Tether in Massive Funding Round: Report:
[TEXT]
In brief Tether is reportedly seeking up to $15-20 billion for a 3% stake in its firm.

Ark Invest and Softbank are reportedly in discussions to participate in the raise.

The raise would value the firm at around $500 billion, making it one of the largest private companies in the world.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Tech investors SoftBank Group and Ark Investment are among the firms discussing participation in a major Tether fundraise that could value the stablecoin issuer at $500 billion, according to a Friday Bloomberg report.

The two groups’ interest follows three days after news that El Salvador-based Tether was looking to raise $15-20 billion for a 3% equity stake. Bloomberg first reported this story, citing two unnamed sources, although another source said the amount could be less.

The initiative could help push Tether deeper into mainstream finance, the report said.

At $500 billion, Tether would rank among the world’s largest private companies, putting it in the same conversation as artificial intelligence firm OpenAI and Elon Musk’s space exploration and transportation firm, SpaceX, which received similar valuations.

﻿

Tether, which issues the world’s largest stablecoin—USDT—plan’s to further expand its footprint, anticipating the debut of a new U.S. regulated stablecoin—USAT—by the end of the year.

Softbank is a Japan-based multinational investment company. Ark is a U.S.-based asset manager. Both have been active in the crypto space.

The firm has been creating more of a presence in the United States since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump last year, recently adding former White House crypto advisor Bo Hines as a strategic advisor. It also maintains a close relationship with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose previous firm Cantor Fitzgerald is advising Tether in its fundraising talks and also custodies all its assets, according to the Bloomberg report.

Tether and stablecoins have been at the forefront of crypto conversation for the bulk of this year, highlighted by the U.S.’s passage of the GENIUS Act, a regulatory framework for the trading and issuance of the fiat-backed tokens.

Its USDT stablecoin sits at a $173 billion market cap, making it the third largest crypto asset by market cap at the time of writing and more than double the market cap of Circle’s USDC stablecoin.

Stablecoins as a whole have added more than $122 billion in market cap since this time last year to reach a total of nearly $300 billion, according to data from DeFi Llama. Earlier this year, U.K. bank Standard Chartered predicted that the market could reach $750 billion by the end of 2026.

Decrypt reached out to Tether for comment.

A retired investment banker was arrested Friday at his Connecticut home on federal charges he trafficked women for sex acts in luxury hotels and at a Manhattan apartment converted into a sex dungeon with BDSM equipment, according to a federal indictment.

Howie Rubin, 70, and his former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, 45, are charged with sex trafficking and transportation for the purposes of prostitution, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.

At his arraignment in Brooklyn federal court, Rubin pleaded not guilty to all charges. A federal magistrate in Brooklyn rejected his proposed $25 million bond package and ordered him detained, finding he posed both a danger to the community and a flight risk.

Powers, who was accused of facilitating the alleged sex trafficking operation, was arrested in Texas.

Rubin, a former top manager at Soros Fund Management and Bear Stearns, has been under investigation for years after multiple women claimed in 2017 he subjected them to beatings and rape. Rubin has long denied the accusations but the women won a multimillion dollar civil judgment against him for violating the Trafficking Victim Protection Act.

"For many years, Howard Rubin and Jennifer Powers allegedly spent at least one million dollars to finance the commercial sexual torture of multiple women via a national trafficking network," FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia said in a statement. "The defendants allegedly exploited Rubin’s status to ensnare their prospective victims and forced them to endure unthinkable physical trauma before silencing any outcries with threats of legal recourse."

According to the criminal charges, from at least 2009 through 2019, Rubin recruited dozens of women to engage in commercial sex acts with him involving bondage, discipline, dominance, submission and sadomasochism.

"During many such encounters, Rubin engaged in conduct beyond the scope of the women's consent," the indictment said.

The indictment includes ten women, identified as Jane Does #1 through #10, who allege Rubin "brutalized" them, causing them to fear for their safety and resulting in significant pain or injuries, which at times required women to seek medical attention.

Some of the women were former Playboy models targeted through social media or modeling pages, according to the indictment.

At first, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said the commercial sex acts primarily occurred at luxury hotels in Manhattan. However, in 2011, Rubin leased a luxury penthouse apartment near Central Park.

According to the indictment, Rubin and Powers transformed one of the bedrooms in the penthouse into a sex "dungeon" that was painted red and soundproofed; had a lock on the door; was furnished with BDSM equipment to which women could be strapped and restrained; and contained devices to shock or electrocute them, among other items.

"Rubin and Powers, together with others, materially misrepresented to women the extent, manner and/or degree to which Rubin would engage in physical and sexual violence," the indictment said. "Rubin provided a 'safe word' the women could say to convey that they wanted the violent sexual conduct to cease, but then disregarded the safe word when women used it and continued the violent conduct without the women's consent."

The indictment continued, "In other instances, regardless of whether Rubin had provided a safe word, the women were unable to object to Rubin’s conduct because they were bound and/or gagged during the sexual encounter. In still other instances, women became unconscious during the sexual encounters, such that they were unable to consent."

Prosecutors said Rubin paid different women for commercial sex multiple times a week, sometimes on consecutive days and Powers would manage the fallout due to his alleged violence.

"If Rubin was satisfied with the way that the women had endured a sexual encounter, the women received $5,000 per encounter; if he was dissatisfied, he paid them several thousand dollars less," the indictment said.

[TITLE]KBR, Inc. (KBR) Faces Securities Class Action Amid TRANSCOM Contract Termination–Hagens Berman:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new class-action lawsuit is targeting KBR, Inc. (NYSE: KBR), alleging the company made misleading statements to investors in the weeks leading up to the abrupt cancellation of a major military contract. The suit, Norrman v. KBR, Inc., et al., No. 4:25-cv-04464 (S.D. Tex.), was filed after the company’s stock plunged following the termination of a multi-billion-dollar deal.

National shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman urges KBR investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.

Class Period: May 6, 2025 – June 19, 2025

KBR, Inc. (KBR) Securities Class Action:

The legal action seeks to represent shareholders who purchased KBR securities between May 6, 2025, and June 19, 2025. It claims that KBR executives provided a falsely optimistic outlook on a crucial partnership just as it was on the verge of collapse.

The litigation stems from the Department of Defense U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) canceling its global household goods contract with HomeSafe Alliance LLC, a joint venture led by KBR. The decision, announced on June 20, 2025, caused KBR shares to fall over 7% as investors reacted to the loss of a contract valued at up to $20 billion over a potential nine-year term.

The suit highlights a key discrepancy: on May 6, 2025, during its Q1 earnings call, KBR assured investors that the HomeSafe partnership was "strong" and "excellent" and that the company was "very confident in the future of this program."

However, just weeks later, on June 19, 2025, HomeSafe disclosed that TRANSCOM had terminated the contract for cause. The termination reportedly came after months of operational issues, including chronic delays, missed pickups, and a rise in complaints about damaged goods. The complaint alleges that KBR was aware of TRANSCOM’s material concerns but chose to conceal them from investors. The lawsuit argues that this misrepresentation led to the significant financial losses suffered by shareholders.

“We’re focused on whether KBR may have intentionally misled investors about the true status of the relationship with TRANSCOM and the contract,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.
