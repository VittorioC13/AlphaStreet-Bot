[TITLE]Insurance premiums to rise to fund hospital salary hikes:
[TEXT]

Residents will face a hike in health insurance premiums this spring to help to cover back pay increases to hospital staff to the tune of almost $40 million.

The salary uplift and cost-of-living allowance negotiated with unionised hospital staff will have a ripple effect on hospital budgeting and, in turn, the standard premium rate — a mandatory government-run feature of health insurance.

Retroactive payments to staff by Bermuda Hospitals Board, announced last month, total $38 million owed to staff with the Bermuda Public Services Union.

The payments cover the period April 2022 through October 2025. Although no figure was given at the time, the salary increase of 18.23 per cent was described as a significant one.

A government spokeswoman said that the funds will be issued in two equal instalments: one by January 30 and another by April 30.

She added: “Retroactive payments will be fully met by the required deadline of April 30, 2026.”

Although $11 million has already been set aside, she said the remainder would have to be met through an SPR increase along with a “government reprioritisation”.

“We have one acute care hospital, and we must ensure its stability in serving the needs of the people of Bermuda,” she said, adding that it was “vital” for dedicated frontline staff providing essential services to be fairly compensated to maintain a strong healthcare system.

There was no indication as to the extent of the impending increase envisaged for the rate. The Ministry of Health has been asked for detail.

The SPR was increased to $400.31 on November 1, 2021, with the figure made up of the $23.34 Standard Health Benefit premium, retained by insurers, and the $376.97 Mutual Reinsurance Fund fee, which is collected on behalf of the Health Insurance Department.

It has remained unchanged since then. The spokeswoman said that a “multiyear payment schedule was originally anticipated”, but added that retroactive payments would be “fully met by the required deadline” of April 30, 2026.

She added: “This SPR increase is part of the previously announced plan to provide adequate and stable funding for the hospital amid rising global medical costs.

“Medical inflation, forecast to exceed 10 per cent this year, has significantly increased the cost of care, equipment and pharmaceuticals.

“Through the tough economic aftermath of the pandemic, the Government dictated that there would be no traditional increases to the SPR.

“The rate has been frozen for four years, since November 2021, during which the Government used allocated funds from the Excess Borrowing Fund to shield residents from increases.

“With costs continuing to rise, and with the new union agreement now requiring permanent funding, maintaining the SPR freeze is no longer sustainable.”

It comes on the heels of an enhanced coverage package for Health Insurance Plan and FutureCare policyholders, announced in the House of Assembly on December 5 by Kim Wilson, the Minister of Health.

The reforms include one free annual health exam, expanded prescription drug coverage and the removal of the 12-month waiting period for the personal home care benefit.

The extra benefits were aimed at covering preventive care and addressing the island’s rising costs of medication.

The One Bermuda Alliance said that Government had failed to tackle rising healthcare costs and said revenue from the Corporate Income Tax should be used to provide healthcare for those without insurance.

Saying he welcomed increased funding for the hospital, shadow finance minister Douglas De Couto added: “However, we note that this increased funding will come from increased healthcare premiums, and that Government has not made progress in reducing the underlying healthcare costs.

“In addition, while we welcome the recently announce benefit increases for those who already have insurance, there is still no progress on healthcare for those who are not insured.”

He said one of the uses for CIT funds could be to provide healthcare for the uninsured.

“In addition we would work on improving the underlying issues that drive up healthcare costs in Bermuda for a more sustainable future,” he said.

• UPDATE: this article has been updated to clarify that payments to hospital staff will be issued in two instalments and fully covered by April 30

[TITLE]Cancer care cannot fall off the EU agenda:

POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT

This is sponsored content from AstraZeneca.

The advertisement is linked to public policy debates on the future of cancer care in the EU.

More information here.

Europe has made huge strides in the fight against cancer.[1] Survival rates have climbed, detection has improved and the continent has become home to some of the world’s most respected research hubs.[2],[3] None of that progress came easy — it was built on years of political attention and cooperation across borders.

However, as we look to 2026 and beyond, that progress stands at a crossroads. Budget pressures and tougher global competition threaten to push cancer and health care down the EU agenda. Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan — a flagship initiative aimed at expanding screening, improving early detection and boosting collaboration — is set to expire in 2027, with no clear plan to secure or extend its gains.[4],[5]

“My [hope is that we can continue] the work started with Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan and make it sustainable… [and] build on the lessons learned, [for other disease areas] ” says Antonella Cardone, CEO of Cancer Patients Europe.

[TITLE]Abivax Announces Acceptance of 22 Abstracts Evaluating Obefazimod in Inflammatory Bowel Disease at ECCO 2026, Featuring an Oral Presentation on Preclinical Anti-Fibrotic Findings:
[TEXT]
Abivax Announces Acceptance of 22 Abstracts Evaluating Obefazimod in Inflammatory Bowel Disease at ECCO 2026, Featuring an Oral Presentation on Preclinical Anti-Fibrotic Findings

Breadth of Scientific Evidence: The acceptance of 1 oral presentation, 5 digital oral presentations and 16 posters reflect an expanding dataset for obefazimod, including additional efficacy, safety, and cytokine data from the Phase 3 ABTECT Induction Trials in moderate-to-severely active ulcerative colitis (UC)

Novel Anti-Fibrotic Preclinical Findings: Oral presentation on Saturday, February 21, 2026, “Obefazimod shows first evidence of anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease," will disclose new preclinical data addressing a critical complication in Crohn's disease (CD)

PARIS, France – December 17, 2025 – 10:05 pm CET – Abivax SA (Euronext Paris: FR0012333284 – ABVX / Nasdaq: ABVX) (“Abivax” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, today announced that 22 scientific abstracts detailing advancements in the understanding of obefazimod for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will be presented at The European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization’s (ECCO) 21st Annual Congress taking place February 18-21, 2026 in Stockholm, Sweden.

Subgroup Analyses from Phase 3 ABTECT Induction Trials

The accepted abstracts, based on subgroup analyses from ABTECT Induction Trials, illustrate obefazimod’s clinical activity across a wide range of patient subpopulations, demonstrate downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-6), and highlight early symptomatic improvement along with other clinically meaningful benefits. The data also reinforces obefazimod’s favorable tolerability profile.

Obefazimod Shows First Evidence of Activity in Preclinical Fibrotic Models

The upcoming oral presentation on anti-fibrotic activity addresses a significant unmet medical need in IBD. Fibrosis, or the excessive formation of scar tissue, is a serious complication, particularly in patients with CD. This scarring can lead to strictures (narrowing of the intestine) that often necessitate surgery. To date, no efficacious anti-fibrotic treatment is available for IBD patients.

The objective of the preclinical study was to assess the anti-fibrotic effects of obefazimod in an in vitro fibrosis model using human small-intestinal fibroblasts and in an in vivo TNBS-colitis mouse model. The data from this study, titled “Obefazimod shows first evidence of anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease,” will be presented during the oral presentation session on Saturday, February 21, 2026.

Marc de Garidel, Chief Executive Officer of Abivax, said “We are highly enthusiastic
