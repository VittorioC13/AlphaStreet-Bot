Daxia ROJAS

Flashy AI, robotics and self-driving cars will be on show at the annual Web Summit in Lisbon from Monday, but global tensions over high-tech trade, competition and sovereignty will be weighing on the minds of entrepreneurs, investors and policymakers.

Known as the “Davos for geeks,” the four-day event in the Portuguese capital is set to welcome over 70,000 visitors, including 2,500 startups and 1,000 investors.

– AI and chips –

With major global players racing to control the supply chains behind generative artificial intelligence, an appearance by chief executive of American chip developer Qualcomm Cristiano Amon will be a hot ticket.

His company recently announced a new range of AI chips designed to compete with sector heavyweight Nvidia and challenger AMD.

Both firms’ high-end processors are subject to restrictions from Washington on their export to China on national security grounds.

Several leaders of other top AI players will also appear in Lisbon, including Microsoft President Brad Smith and Joleen Liang, co-founder of Chinese startup Squirrel AI, which is bringing the technology into classrooms.

One of Europe’s hottest tickets, Swedish startup Lovable, is sending boss Anton Osika to vaunt its technology that allows users to create apps and websites via a chatbot without coding experience.

British dictionary publisher Collins dubbed this “vibe coding” approach its word of the year for 2025.

– Health and sports –

Almost 30 percent of investment in new sports technology went into AI firms in the first half of this year, investment bank Drake Star found in a study.

In Lisbon, Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova and France’s Caroline Garcia will be on stage talking

[TITLE]ET in the Valley: Our mission is to empower the 99% who can’t code: Lovable cofounder:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI) startup Lovable is positioning itself differently in the crowded coding-assist segment, instead of targeting software engineers, it is focusing on people with little or no technical background. Founded in 2023, the startup allows users to describe what they want in simple language, like a landing page, dashboard or prototype, and lets the platform generate code in real time.“Most of the current players assume you are already a developer,” Fabian Hedin, Lovable’s cofounder and chief technology officer, told ET in an interview on the sidelines of an AI event at tech firm Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. “Our product is designed for people who have ideas but not coding skills. You can just describe your vision, and within minutes, something tangible is built for you,” he said.Lovable’s approach differs from the growing pack of AI-powered coding assistants , from Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and Cursor to Replit. While these products are built to help programmers work faster, Lovable aims at a much wider base—people with no technical background.“It’s a very obvious thing to apply AI to empower developers,” Hedin said. “Our mission has always been to let the 99% who cannot code build the same things as software developers. We want to make software creation as accessible as writing a document or recording a video.”Lovable launched its current version in November 2024, after experimenting with several early prototypes. In July 2025, it raised $200 million in its first round of funding, led by Silicon Valley venture capital fund Accel , valuing the company at $1.8 billion. The Financial Times reported in August that the Swedish startup was in talks to raise another round of financing at a $4billion valuation. In August, via a company blog post, Lovable's cofounder and CEO Anton Osika said it had passed $100 million in annual recurring revenue in just eight months since hitting $1 million. “This makes us the fastest-growing startup, not just in Europe, but in the world. People have built more than 10 million projects on Lovable, and are currently building 100,000 per day. And we’re just getting started," Osika added.The company’s users are spread across the US, South America, Asia and Europe, though its engineering and product teams remain based in Stockholm, Sweden. “We don’t separate growth strategies by region,” Hedin said. “People build something and share it with others—that’s what drives adoption. When someone creates a project and sends it to a friend or posts it online, that network effect becomes our marketing.”Hedin said the user base is diverse. “We’ve seen teenagers using Lovable to build games for fun, employees in companies building dashboards for their teams, and solo founders launching small businesses,” he said. “That’s what excites us, seeing creativity being unlocked in unexpected places. We help people outside engineering, marketing teams, for instance, bring ideas to life without waiting on developers."The market for AI-assisted coding, popularly called “vibe coding”, is becoming one of the most active corners of the startup ecosystem. Larger technology firms such as OpenAI and Google are also moving closer to the application layer, potentially overlapping with smaller startups that depend on their models. Hedin said Lovable was comfortable operating at the application layer rather than trying to build foundation models. “We’re in a good position because there’s healthy competition between open and closed-source model providers, and they’re focused on the infrastructure layer. We sit comfortably on the application layer, and that competition benefits us," he said.He added that Lovable’s current focus is on refining its product experience rather than entering new markets or categories. “When people describe what they want and Lovable gets it right the first time, that’s when they realise the power of AI in creation,” he said. “Expanding too fast before that experience is perfect would be premature.”While Silicon Valley remains the hub for AI development, Europe’s ecosystem is strengthening quickly, he said. The quality of local talent has improved markedly over the past two years. You don’t necessarily need to move to San Francisco to build, Hedin said, adding, “The depth of AI talent in Europe has improved dramatically, especially in cities like Stockholm, Berlin and Paris.”Lovable currently has no immediate plans to open offices in Asia, though users there form a growing share of its base, he said.Anthropic CEO recently said that AI will write 90% of the code in a few months and in a year, AI will write essentially all of the code. But is the same adoption expected from non-technical users? Hedin acknowledged that awareness is still limited among the larger set of people. “The non-technical market is actually much larger, 99% of the world, as I said... It’s not as clearly defined yet, but the demand is strong, and people are willing to pay once they see what they can do. Everything from kids making games to enterprise teams building internal tools, prototypes, or even full-fledged products. Some users are building entire startups and earning a living from it," he said.

Berlin, Germany (SPX) Nov 10, 2025

Facing a new era of satellite surveillance and jamming, European governments are moving rapidly to strengthen their defenses in orbit. The twin challenges posed by Russian and Chinese activities have forced the continent to confront longstanding vulnerabilities in both military and civilian space infrastructure. While much of the public discourse addresses threats, a parallel focus has emerged: what is Europe actually doing

Sentinel-1D extends global radar imaging as new Copernicus satellite enters orbit

by Robert Schreiber

Berlin, Germany (SPX) Nov 10, 2025

The European Space Agency's Sentinel-1D satellite, equipped with Airbus's Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), has successfully launched, joining Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1C in orbit. This addition ensures uninterrupted radar data acquisition for monitoring worldwide land and ocean environments with an operational lifetime planned for over seven years.

Sentinel-1D supports a range of missions as part of the Copernicus programme, encompassing the surveillance of land masses, sea- and land-ice, and ocean conditions along with emergency response scenarios.

SAR's technical capabilities allow for continuous imaging regardless of weather, time of day, or visibility conditions. Unlike optical satellites, SAR actively transmits and receives radio waves, enabling penetration through clouds, fog, and rain to deliver comprehensive and timely data. These instruments distinguish surface characteristics, monitor geohazards such as volcanic activity and earthquake-related deformation, and penetrate vegetation layers to analyze environmental changes.

The Airbus design process produced a 12-metre antenna integrating signal distribution, radiation, and mechanical strength, using advanced waveguide radiator technology developed in Friedrichshafen. This construction, combined with a complex synchronization system across 280 transmit and receive modules, achieves high-resolution data necessary for precise scientific analysis, particularly interferometric measurements.

Engineers faced significant challenges folding the 12-metre antenna to fit within the rocket and deploying it with millimetre precision in orbit. Specialized test rigs and patented joints were implemented to ensure accurate deployment and later facilitate rapid and total disintegration during atmospheric re-entry, minimizing space debris.

Sentinel-1 radar features four operational modes for different observational needs: Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) for land coverage, Extra-Wide Swath (EW) for oceans and coasts, Wave Mode (WV) for measuring ocean wave dynamics, and StripMap (SM) for detailed imaging of localized targets.

Applications range from agricultural monitoring, geological risk assessment, disaster response, and maritime surveillance to oil slick detection and analysis of earthquake consequences. Sentinel-1 data supports operational agencies such as the Copernicus Emergency Management Service and scientific researchers mapping event-driven surface changes.

With Sentinel-1D now operational, Europe maintains a robust monitoring capacity essential for environmental protection and safety.

New Delhi [India], November 9 (ANI): Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman visited the upcoming Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) centre being developed by Tata Electronics at Jagiroad, Morigaon district, earlier this week.The visit of Sitharaman, who was accompanied by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, marks a significant step forward in Assam's journey to become a hub for advanced electronics and semiconductor manufacturing in Northeast India.TATA OSAT Centre at Jagiroad is envisioned as a cornerstone project in India's semiconductor manufacturing mission, reinforcing Assam's position as a rising industrial destination in the Northeast India region.Randhir Thakur, CEO, TATA Electronics, who is also responsible for the Jagiroad OSAT Centre presented an overview of the project's progress and outlined how the establishment of the OSAT facility will transform the industrial landscape of Assam.Thakur also emphasised the vast employment opportunities that the project will generate, benefiting both the state and the entire Northeastern region.Chief Minister Sarma expressed his gratitude to Sitharaman for her support in bringing this transformative project to the state of Assam. He stated that the OSAT Centre will play a pivotal role in reshaping the state's industrial ecosystem and fostering large-scale employment and skill development.During her visit to Jagiroad, Sitharaman also interacted with local entrepreneurs and students, sharing valuable insights on the growing business and investment potential of Assam and the Northeast India. She encouraged the youth to actively participate in the state's emerging industrial and technological opportunities.Minister Sitharaman emphasised that Assam has taken the lead by bringing a semiconductor manufacturing unit to the State, demonstrating foresight and dynamism in industrial policy."Just ten days ago, Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched a Rs 1 lakh crore fund for research and development. This fund is accessible not only to government institutions but also to private sector entities across the country to promote innovation and research," she added.The Union Minister and the Chief Minister also paid tributes to JN Tata and planted red sandal saplings at the OSAT Centre premises, symbolising growth and sustainability.The TATA semiconductor project in Assam is being developed with an investment of Rs 27,000 crore and is expected to produce 48 million semiconductor chips per day upon completion. The first phase of the plant is expected to be commissioned by April 2026.It will employ advanced packaging technologies and is set to become one of the country's premier high-technology manufacturing facilities.The project is expected to generate around 15,000 direct and 11,000-13,000 indirect jobs.Semiconductors are at the heart of modern technology. They power essential systems in healthcare, transport, communication, defence, and space. As the world moves toward greater digitalisation and automation, semiconductors have become integral to economic security and strategic independence.In just four years, since the launch of the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) in 2021, India has transformed its semiconductor journey from vision to reality.To support this vision, the government had announced a Rs 76,000 crore Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, of which a majority of the corpus has already been committed into various projects.On August 28, a major milestone in India's semiconductor journey was achieved with the launch of one of the country's first end-to-end Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) Pilot Line Facilities in Sanand, Gujarat. Semiconductor company CG-Semi rolled out the first 'Made in India' chip from this pilot facility.In June 2023, the government approved the first proposal for establishing a semiconductor unit in Sanand.As of the date, the government has approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects with a cumulative investment of more than Rs 1.60 lakh crore in six states: Gujarat, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has already begun work on the next phase of India's semiconductor programme, Semicon 2.0, and is currently holding internal discussions and with various line ministries to finalise its contours.

Nvidia shares fall as CEO dashes hopes for China chip sales

by AFP Staff Writers

Washington (AFP) Nov 7, 2025

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Friday said there were no plans to sell its chips, crucial components in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), in China due to restrictions imposed by both Beijing and Washington, causing a sharp sell-off in its shares.

The California-based AI chip juggernaut is caught up in the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, and the CEO's comments dashed expectations that the two superpowers could come to some sort of arrangement on the issue.

Huang has lobbied hard, so far without success, in both Washington and Beijing to break the logjam, arguing that allowing the chips to be sold in China would be good for both countries.

"There are no discussions underway. Currently, we have no plans to ship anything to China," Huang told Taiwanese media, according to Bloomberg, before a visit to TSMC, the company that manufactures Nvidia's hardware.

These statements did not sit well with investors, with Nvidia's stock losing as much as four percent on Friday.

Since its record high of more than $5 trillion on October 29, the company's market value has melted away by more than $600 billion.

China, the world's largest consumer of semiconductors, represents a huge market for Nvidia.

But earlier this week, the White House said it was still unwilling to allow Nvidia to sell its advanced Blackwell chip model in China.

Beijing is meanwhile banning large Chinese companies from buying another less performant model, even though it was designed specifically by Nvidia for the country.

Instead, China has ramped up its chip industry to beat the restrictions imposed by Washington.

The United States cites national security concerns, such as the risk of giving China a military advantage, for the block, with the geopolitical bind showing no sign of easing.

Even if certain members of the Trump administration favor a more nuanced approach on selling AI chips to China, there is deep opposition in Washington from China hawks who favor tougher bans on AI technology.

EU says China confirms Nexperia chip export resumptions

Brussels, Belgium (AFP) Nov 8, 2025 - The European Commission said Saturday that Chinese authorities had confirmed a partial resumption of Nexperia chips, easing a blockage that has alarmed carmakers.

The dispute erupted in September when the Dutch government effectively took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but whose parent company is China's Wingtech.

China responded by banning re-exports of the firm's chips, triggering warnings from automakers of production stoppages as the components are critical to onboard electronics.

But Beijing announced at the weekend it would exempt some chips from the export ban, reportedly part of a trade deal agreed by President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump.

EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic posted on X that he welcomed "the confirmation provided today... regarding the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips destined for EU and global clients".

The exports will be allowed as long as the chips are only for "civilian use", Sefcovic added, saying the measure would take effect "immediately".

Talks are continuing with China on finding a "lasting, stable, predictable framework that ensure the full restoration of semiconductor flows", he added.

Germany's Aumovio, a major automotive supplier, had already said Friday it had received permission from Chinese authorities to resume the Nexperia chip exports.

The chips are made in Europe but then sent to China for finishing, before being re-exported to clients in Europe and other markets.

Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, had warned of production stoppages if the crisis dragged on, while smaller firms were reported to be preparing to cut working hours.

The Netherlands cited national security concerns when it moved to take control of Nexperia, accusing the firm's CEO of mismanagement.

Nexperia chip exports resuming: German auto supplier

Frankfurt, Germany (AFP) Nov 7, 2025 - A leading German auto supplier said Friday that it had received permission to export Nexperia chips from China again as Chancellor Friedrich Merz hailed "positive signals" of de-escalation in a dispute that has alarmed carmakers.

Dutch officials in September effectively took control of the Netherlands-based chipmaker Nexperia, whose Chinese parent company Wingtech is backed by Beijing.

China responded by banning re-exports of the firm's chips, triggering warnings from automakers of production stoppages as the components are critical to onboard electronics.

But Beijing announced at the weekend it would exempt some chips from the export ban, reportedly part of a trade deal agreed by President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump.

Aumovio, which supplies components like sensors and displays to top automakers, said it had "received an export license from the Chinese government to export Nexperia chips".

"We received the written confirmation yesterday," a spokeswoman for the group, until recently part of Continental, told AFP.

Speaking to reporters at climate talks in Brazil, Merz said that Germany and the Netherlands had held talks with China on the issue.

"There are positive signals that the deliveries can start again," Merz said, adding that "This could happen in the coming hours."

"I am confident after speaking to the Dutch prime minister that this will work," he added.

While relatively simple technology, Nexperia's semiconductors are vital for the electronics in modern, technology-packed vehicles.

The chips are made in Europe but then sent to China for finishing, before being re-exported to clients in Europe and other markets.

Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, had warned of production stoppages if the crisis dragged on, while smaller firms were reported to be preparing to cut working hours.

The Netherlands cited national security concerns when it moved to take control of Nexperia and accused the firm's CEO of mismanagement.

China had also accused the United States of getting involved in the case -- Washington last year put Wingtech on a list of corporations viewed as acting contrary to US national security.

The Netherlands seized control of Nexperia amid escalating global trade tensions

The Dutch government could hand back control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia after Beijing resumed critical semiconductor supplies, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing sources.

The Netherlands seized the Dutch-based chipmaker last month, citing risks to the EU’s economic and technological security. The Hague invoked a never-before-used emergency law to take control of the manufacturer, which is owned by China’s Wingtech Technology. Wingtech reportedly condemned the intervention as “an act of excessive interference driven by geopolitical bias.”

[TITLE]Before spectrum goes under the hammer, telcos make an urgent plea:
[TEXT]
Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have called for sharply lowering the base price for the next spectrum auctions and extending the spectrum usage period to as long as 40 years. In submissions made to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the telecom operators said this is needed to ensure robust network expansion and accelerate 5G deployment.

The request, which comes ahead of the next spectrum auction likely early next year, reflects persistent concerns among operators that steep reserve prices are stifling investment, leaving valuable airwaves unsold, and ultimately undermining the government’s Digital India vision. Having cheaper airwaves is necessary to free up capital for network infrastructure, the telecom companies said.

“Excessively high reserve prices keep valuable spectrum idle and result in operators facing capacity and capital constraints," Rahul Vatts, chief regulatory officer of Bharti Airtel, stated in a submission to Trai. He said spectrum that remains unsold or underutilized due to inflated pricing is a "direct loss to the country," delaying network expansion and degrading service quality. By reducing costs, operators could redirect capital toward “network densification, faster 5G rollout, and wider rural coverage."

Spectrum represents a critical revenue stream for the government, which sets a base price and expects companies to bid higher. A premium over the reserve price translates into higher government revenue. However, aggressive bidding has eased since 2021, with most of the airwaves sold near reserve prices—a shift driven by industry consolidation, high base prices, and the financial burden of recent 5G rollouts.

Reliance Jio, India's largest telco by market share, urged Trai to recommend a reserve price set at 50% of the spectrum valuation, arguing that the current valuation of 70% is "too steep and not conducive of wider participation." Jio contended that this aggressive pricing prevents genuine price discovery and competition, leading instead to sales at or near the reserve floor.

Validity

Beyond pricing, operators have also called for extending the duration of using spectrum to 30 or 40 years from the current 20 years. They argue that a longer term provides greater policy stability, enhances business viability, and enables the sustained investments required for next-generation network technologies. The Union cabinet had previously approved increasing the tenure to 30 years in 2021 to infuse liquidity, but this was never implemented, with Jio noting that Trai's valuation had simply multiplied the 20-year price by 1.5, negating the intended financial benefit.

The industry's request runs contrary to the public stance of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal recently pushed back on the necessity of lower prices.

“I have not seen any TSP come to me saying that they are not using a respective spectrum because its pricing is high," Mittal told reporters last month, questioning how data prices remain low if spectrum acquisition costs are supposedly prohibitive. Mittal maintained that the timing of the next auction would be determined by the "appetite and the demand" among stakeholders. If the reserve prices are so high, how could data prices be so low, Mittal questioned.

Bharti Airtel also said that in future auctions, telcos should be allowed a payment moratorium of six years, followed by 14 equal annual installments. This is because any new network takes a time period of at least 4-5 years to monetize and huge upfront payments combined with short moratorium periods could cause significant financial strain on operators, according to Airtel.

Currently, operators can make full or part upfront payment for the spectrum within 10 days from issuing spectrum. They can also make an upfront payment equal to the installments of at least two years, with the balance payable in equal installments with applicable interest, within the 20-year spectrum holding period. Operators are also allowed to make payment for spectrum in 20 equal annual instalments.

Unsold spectrum

Trai is also looking into concerns raised by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), which flagged a lack of effective competition in previous auctions due to industry consolidation and the oversupply of unsold airwaves. The DoT data shows over 12,000 MHz of traditional band spectrum remains unsold. In an effort to mitigate this issue, Trai has sought comments on potentially allowing other entities—such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or large connected device network operators—to bid for spectrum alongside wireless carriers.

The telecom carriers uniformly opposed this proposal. Vodafone Idea stated that allowing non-traditional bidders would "impact the robustness of the licensing framework" and create "huge complications related to valuation," arguing it runs counter to the structure of the new Telecommunications Act 2023.

Operators also said that referring to the currently available spectrum inventory as an “over-supply" may not accurately reflect market realities. “Rather, this spectrum should be viewed as strategic reserve capacity intended to address future growth requirements and regional variations in demand," Bharti Airtel said.

A recent analysis by V.J. Christopher, wireless advisor at DoT, flagged that nearly 36% of the spectrum on auction since 2010 was cleared at the base price, and only 15.5% was sold at a premium.

Another grouse relates to the duration of using the spectrum.

Currently, spectrum is issued for a period of 20 years. The Union cabinet in 2021 recommended increasing it to 30 to ensure long-term policy stability, improve business viability, and facilitate sustained investment in advanced technologies. However, the move did not take off. Jio said this should have been implemented in 2022 itself but wasn't, due to what it called Trai’s "aggressive valuation".

While the three carriers agree on the need for cheaper spectrum, they are divided on auctioning some new bands.

Reliance Jio is advocating for a comprehensive release strategy, urging that all nationally and globally identified International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) bands be auctioned immediately to ensure policy predictability and accelerate 6G readiness. Specifically, Jio wants the entire 6 GHz band to be auctioned now, with payment obligations kicking in only when the full band becomes available in 2030.

Bharti Airtel, is opposed to the plan. The company wants the auction of new bands like 600 MHz and parts of 6 GHz to be deferred for approximately two years. Airtel cited unresolved technical conflicts and the current "early stage" of the device and network ecosystem for both bands, suggesting that a premature auction would lead to underutilization.

The operators also requested the government to relax minimum rollout obligations, designed to ensure the swift deployment of purchased spectrum. Airtel highlighted the difficulty in meeting these commitments for the 26 GHz band, citing limited device compatibility and chipset constraints, and requested an extension to avoid financial penalties. The debate underscores a critical tension between the government’s desire for revenue maximization and the industry’s need for capital efficiency to fund the massive investment required for a true, nationwide 5G transformation.

Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables. These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world. The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850. The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it. "

[TITLE]EchoStar crafting a game plan for the billions it has generated in spectrum sales:
[TEXT]
EchoStar Corp. announced Thursday that it has created a new division called EchoStar Capital to invest the $45 billion the company has generated from the sale of its wireless spectrum.

EchoStar founder and chairman Charlie Ergen will take over as president and CEO of EchoStar Corp., putting him in charge of the operations of the pay television and wireless business units. Former EchoStar CEO Hamid Akhavan will head up the new investment arm.

“This is an opportune moment in time for our business to go on the offense as we build upon our 45-year institutional heritage and forge a new path forward for creating and developing opportunities in our strategic expertise domains that will provide attractive value creation for EchoStar and its shareholders,” Akhavan said in a news release.

The third quarter was a huge one in terms of redefining the company and its future. AT&T agreed to pay $22.65 billion in cash and SpaceX agreed to pay $19 billion for wireless spectrum that the Douglas County company had acquired over the years.

EchoStar had intended to deploy the spectrum to build out its Boost Mobile wireless network and private 5G networks for commercial customers. But the company wasn’t moving fast enough for the Federal Communications Commission, which had put pressure on it to use its spectrum or sell it. EchoStar agreed to sell the bulk of its spectrum and to rely on AT&T’s network to carry most of its wireless traffic going forward.

Although the choicest slices of spectrum have been claimed, the company announced on Thursday that it had reached an agreement to sell additional AWS-3 wireless spectrum to SpaceX for $2.6 billion worth of its shares.

A portion of the spectrum sale proceeds will go to pay down debt, but increasingly it is looking like the company will invest most of it to create future earnings for shareholders, who have seen a more than doubling in the company’s share price this year. EchoStar is one of the top-performing stocks this year, not including AI-related companies.

EchoStar reported $38.2 billion in liabilities at the end of the third quarter, down from $40.7 billion at the end of last year. Analysts said the company is now in a “net cash” position, meaning it has more cash and other liquid assets than it has debt.

That said, the company continues to struggle with declining subscriptions in DISH TV, its core satellite television business, which has lost 12.2% of its customer base over the past year. Sling TV, the over-the-internet alternative, fared better, gaining 159,900 subscribers, bringing the total number of pay television subscribers to 7.17 million.

The wireless side, consisting mostly of Boost Mobile, continued to grow, adding 223,000 new customers in the third quarter and generating $939 million in revenues. Boost Mobile is now larger than the pay-TV side with 7.52 million subscribers, although the monthly bill each subscriber is paying is smaller.

EchoStar took a $16.5 billion one-time charge to account for the impaired value on the portions of its 5G network that it won’t be using as a result of the agreement reached with AT&T. That noncash write-off contributed to a $12.8 billion loss in the third quarter, which compares to a $141.8 million loss in the third quarter of 2024.

[TITLE]CNBC Daily Open: Too early to fret about tech pullback?:
[TEXT]
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 07, 2025 in New York City.

November is historically the best month for the S&P 500, which gains an average of 1.8% during the period, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.

But the first full trading week of the month saw stocks caught in November rains.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each lost more than 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed around 3% — that's its largest weekly loss since the tech-heavy index slumped 10% in the week ended April 4.

A few months ago, tariffs were the shadows that stalked stocks. Now, it's fears that artificial intelligence-related stocks are trading at prices disconnected from what the firms are actually worth.

"You've got trillions of dollars tied up in seven stocks, for example. So, it's inevitable, with that kind of concentration, that there will be a worry about, 'You know, when will this bubble burst?'" CEO of DBS , Southeast Asia's largest bank, Tan Su Shan told CNBC.

Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon also thinks choppy waters might be ahead.

"It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months," Solomon said Tuesday at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong.

That said, a pullback isn't necessarily bad for stocks. It could even present "buying opportunities" for investors, according to Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management.

After all, earnings have been "reassuring" despite worries about tech stocks' high valuations, Kiran Ganesh, multi-asset strategist at UBS, told CNBC. That means the rain might not last and the rally could find a way to run a little longer.

[TITLE]Global tech tensions overshadow Web Summit’s AI and robots:

AI will be taking centre stage at this year's Web Summit as major global players are racing to control the supply chain for chips needed to drive generative artificial intelligence - Copyright AFP ANTHONY WALLACE

Daxia ROJAS

Flashy AI, robotics and self-driving cars will be on show at the annual Web Summit in Lisbon from Monday, but global tensions over high-tech trade, competition and sovereignty will be weighing on the minds of entrepreneurs, investors and policymakers.

Known as the “Davos for geeks,” the four-day event in the Portuguese capital is set to welcome over 70,000 visitors, including 2,500 startups and 1,000 investors.

– AI and chips –

With major global players racing to control the supply chains behind generative artificial intelligence, an appearance by chief executive of American chip developer Qualcomm Cristiano Amon will be a hot ticket.

His company recently announced a new range of AI chips designed to compete with sector heavyweight Nvidia and challenger AMD.

Both firms’ high-end processors are subject to restrictions from Washington on their export to China on national security grounds.

Several leaders of other top AI players will also appear in Lisbon, including Microsoft President Brad Smith and Joleen Liang, co-founder of Chinese startup Squirrel AI, which is bringing the technology into classrooms.

One of Europe’s hottest tickets, Swedish startup Lovable, is sending boss Anton Osika to vaunt its technology that allows users to create apps and websites via a chatbot without coding experience.

British dictionary publisher Collins dubbed this “vibe coding” approach its word of the year for 2025.

– Health and sports –

Almost 30 percent of investment in new sports technology went into AI firms in the first half of this year, investment bank Drake Star found in a study.

[TITLE]ET in the Valley: Our mission is to empower the 99% who can’t code: Lovable cofounder:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI) startup Lovable is positioning itself differently in the crowded coding-assist segment, instead of targeting software engineers, it is focusing on people with little or no technical background. Founded in 2023, the startup allows users to describe what they want in simple language, like a landing page, dashboard or prototype, and lets the platform generate code in real time.“Most of the current players assume you are already a developer,” Fabian Hedin, Lovable’s cofounder and chief technology officer, told ET in an interview on the sidelines of an AI event at tech firm Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. “Our product is designed for people who have ideas but not coding skills. You can just describe your vision, and within minutes, something tangible is built for you,” he said.Lovable’s approach differs from the growing pack of AI-powered coding assistants , from Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and Cursor to Replit. While these products are built to help programmers work faster, Lovable aims at a much wider base—people with no technical background.“It’s a very obvious thing to apply AI to empower developers,” Hedin said. “Our mission has always been to let the 99% who cannot code build the same things as software developers. We want to make software creation as accessible as writing a document or recording a video.”Lovable launched its current version in November 2024, after experimenting with several early prototypes. In July 2025, it raised $200 million in its first round of funding, led by Silicon Valley venture capital fund Accel , valuing the company at $1.8 billion. The Financial Times reported in August that the Swedish startup was in talks to raise another round of financing at a $4billion valuation. In August, via a company blog post, Lovable's cofounder and CEO Anton Osika said it had passed $100 million in annual recurring revenue in just eight months since hitting $1 million. “This makes us the fastest-growing startup, not just in Europe, but in the world. People have built more than 10 million projects on Lovable, and are currently building 100,000 per day. And we’re just getting started," Osika added.The company’s users are spread across the US, South America, Asia and Europe, though its engineering and product teams remain based in Stockholm, Sweden. “We don’t separate growth strategies by region,” Hedin said. “People build something and share it with others—that’s what drives adoption. When someone creates a project and sends it to a friend or posts it online, that network effect becomes our marketing.”Hedin said the user base is diverse. “We’ve seen teenagers using Lovable to build games for fun, employees in companies building dashboards for their teams, and solo founders launching small businesses,” he said. “That’s what excites us, seeing creativity being unlocked in unexpected places. We help people outside engineering, marketing teams, for instance, bring ideas to life without waiting on developers."The market for AI-assisted coding, popularly called “vibe coding”, is becoming one of the most active corners of the startup ecosystem. Larger technology firms such as OpenAI and Google are also moving closer to the application layer, potentially overlapping with smaller startups that depend on their models. Hedin said Lovable was comfortable operating at the application layer rather than trying to build foundation models. “We’re in a good position because there’s healthy competition between open and closed-source model providers, and they’re focused on the infrastructure layer. We sit comfortably on the application layer, and that competition benefits us," he said.He added that Lovable’s current focus is on refining its product experience rather than entering new markets or categories. “When people describe what they want and Lovable gets it right the first time, that’s when they realise the power of AI in creation,” he said. “Expanding too fast before that experience is perfect would be premature.”While Silicon Valley remains the hub for AI development, Europe’s ecosystem is strengthening quickly, he said. The quality of local talent has improved markedly over the past two years. You don’t necessarily need to move to San Francisco to build, Hedin said, adding, “The depth of AI talent in Europe has improved dramatically, especially in cities like Stockholm, Berlin and Paris.”Lovable currently has no immediate plans to open offices in Asia, though users there form a growing share of its base, he said.Anthropic CEO recently said that AI will write 90% of the code in a few months and in a year, AI will write essentially all of the code. But is the same adoption expected from non-technical users? Hedin acknowledged that awareness is still limited among the larger set of people. “The non-technical market is actually much larger, 99% of the world, as I said... It’s not as clearly defined yet, but the demand is strong, and people are willing to pay once they see what they can do. Everything from kids making games to enterprise teams building internal tools, prototypes, or even full-fledged products. Some users are building entire startups and earning a living from it," he said.

[TITLE]Waymo self-driving cars are ‘learning’ Denver’s streets. But Colorado has no regulatory oversight of autonomous vehicles.:
[TEXT]
Big Tech’s self-driving vehicles — a fleet of white Jaguars and powder-blue Zeekrs topped with rotating black cameras and radar — have been rolling around Denver for two months, ingesting data into their artificial-intelligence computers ahead of public activation next year.

The Waymo expansion here, part of a push into as many as a dozen cities, for which the California-based company secured $5.6 billion from investors, accelerates the spread of machine-learning technology and may help robotaxis overcome a technical problem: navigating thick, sensor-obscuring snow.

But no government agency in Colorado provides independent regulatory oversight, despite hundreds of collisions in other cities. State lawmakers in 2017 gave tech companies the green light to deploy autonomous vehicles, as long as they obey traffic rules — looser than the regulatory requirements in Arizona and California, the first states where Waymo launched self-driving vehicles. Colorado lawmakers also blocked local governments from banning autonomous vehicles.

Behind the scenes, ethicists and engineers are questioning what they see as a precedent for whether humans keep control.

“I want to see autonomous vehicles be used to help people be more liberated,” Colorado School of Mines robotics engineer Frankie Zhu said last month in a lab where she’s honing vehicle navigation systems for NASA. “I agree with the humans who feel they’re being left behind. It’s a governmental and societal problem.”

State leaders have embraced the rollout in Denver, which will push the number of Waymo driverless taxis in U.S. cities to more than 2,000. Waymo officials say their fleet of a dozen vehicles collecting data in Denver — still with human handlers riding along — will “grow with the number of riders” when paid service begins late next year.

“We welcome Waymo to Colorado,” Gov. Jared Polis said in an emailed response to questions from The Denver Post.

This deployment jibes with state priorities “to help Coloradans get where we want to go faster, safer, with transportation options,” Polis said. “We’re excited that companies are looking to bring promising new technologies like autonomous driving to Colorado that, done right, will improve safety on our streets. Our state is driven by innovation, and the arrival of Waymo’s autonomous vehicle technology in Denver is a step forward.”.

Polis has delayed implementation of a state AI policy, calling for a sharper focus on high-risk systems that make “consequential decisions,” and said any policy to protect people against AI discriminatory bias also must support innovation.

He recently vetoed a bill that would have banned driverless trucks.

‘You feel trust’

Waymo first deployed its robotaxis, which can be summoned through smartphone apps, in 2020, starting in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, then Atlanta and Austin, Texas. The company now provides more than 1 million paid rides a month.

Beyond Denver, company officials said the expansion in 2026 will include Dallas, Miami, Las Vegas, Washington, D.C., and Nashville, Tennessee, and that they are preparing to launch in Seattle, Detroit, Philadelphia and San Diego — as well as London and Tokyo.

A Waymo algorithm based on data drawn from navigating 100 million miles of city streets makes determinations and directly operates the vehicles’ steering, acceleration and braking. Waymo officials say their electric-powered, self-driving cars are much safer than vehicles driven by humans prone to road rage, intoxication and distraction as they look at phones. Waymo’s artificial intelligence system evolves on its own as the rotating sensors extract more and more information.

“You feel trust when you see it. It is being driven by Waymo’s technology,” company spokeswoman Sandy Karp said.

The rollout across metro Denver has been stealthy. Denver transportation officials said they didn’t know the location of Waymo’s depot for charging and storage. (Waymo is using “temporary facilities downtown” before opening “a larger, permanent depot to support our scaled-up operations,” according to the company.)

City and state authorities also were unable to address data privacy — whether the vehicles will gather and share information
