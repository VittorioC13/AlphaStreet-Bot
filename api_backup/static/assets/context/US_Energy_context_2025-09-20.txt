[TITLE]Helios Charging Launches New Platform for Clean Energy Tax Equity:
[TEXT]
Helios Charging announced today the launch of a new website aimed at connecting accredited investors with tax equity opportunities in the clean energy sector. The platform is designed to provide a streamlined way for investors to finance the development of EV charging and solar projects across the United States.

The move comes as the clean energy sector continues to grow, driven by a surge in demand for renewable energy and EV infrastructure. The capital-intensive nature of these projects has created a need for specialized financing mechanisms like tax equity investments. This type of financing allows investors with significant tax liabilities, such as corporations and wealthy individuals, to receive tax credits and other benefits in exchange for funding a project. For developers, this provides a vital source of upfront capital. The new Helios Charging platform aims to bridge this financing gap by simplifying the investment process for a wider audience of accredited investors.

According to Helios Charging, the platform offers a "vertically integrated" approach by managing the entire project lifecycle, from initial site assessment and engineering to installation and maintenance. This model is intended to ensure the quality and long-term viability of the assets being funded. The website details the company's core services in EV charging, solar solutions, and tax equity investments, providing a resource for potential partners and investors.

"We are at a pivotal moment in the clean energy transition," said Daniel Benhammou, founder and CEO of Helios Charging. He added that the new platform is designed to make tax equity investing more accessible, allowing investors to directly fund sustainable infrastructure.

The broader market for EV charging and solar development is facing significant challenges, including high installation costs, grid capacity limitations, and regulatory hurdles. The tax equity market itself has seen a shortage of traditional investors in recent years, creating an opportunity for new entrants like Helios Charging. By targeting accredited private investors, the company is seeking to expand the pool of available capital for these projects, which could help accelerate the deployment of clean energy infrastructure nationwide.

[TITLE]IEA Reverses Course on Oil and Gas Investment:
[TEXT]
The world needs to develop new oil and gas resources just to keep output flat amid faster declining rates at existing fields, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday in a major shift in its narrative from 2021 that ‘no new investment’ is needed in a net-zero by 2050 scenario.

The rates of decline at operating oil and gas fields have accelerated in recent years, largely due to higher reliance on shale and deep offshore resources, said the IEA.

The agency is under pressure from the Trump Administration to return to its core mission to help protect global security of supply, instead of pushing the net-zero agenda it has been doing so far this decade.

A new IEA report, The Implications of Oil and Gas Field Decline Rates, said on Tuesday that if the industry has to maintain current levels of production, more than 45 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and around 2,000 bcm of natural gas would be needed in 2050 from new conventional fields.

Even with projects ramping up and others approved for development and not yet in production, a large gap still exists “that would need to be filled by new conventional oil and gas projects to maintain production at current levels, although the amounts needed could be reduced if oil and gas demand were to come down,” the IEA said.

“Only a small portion of upstream oil and gas investment is used to meet increases in demand while nearly 90% of upstream investment annually is dedicated to offsetting losses of supply at existing fields,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.

“Decline rates are the elephant in the room for any discussion of investment needs in oil and gas, and our new analysis shows that they have accelerated in recent years,” Birol added, finally acknowledging what the industry has been saying for years—underinvestment threatens global energy supply.

“In the case of oil, an absence of upstream investment would remove the equivalent of Brazil and Norway’s combined production each year from the global market balance, Birol added. “The situation means that the industry has to run much faster just to stand still.”

New oil and gas projects may be necessary to maintain current production levels, the IEA said Tuesday, as it is in a public feud with the Trump administration over its forecasts for lower demand.

The International Energy Agency said in a report that its analysis of 15,000 oil and gas fields showed that output was declining more rapidly than in the past, which has “implications for markets and energy security”.

[TITLE]Future Made in Australia: Albanese government announces billion-dollar investment in renewable fuels:
[TEXT]
The Albanese Government has announced a $1.1 billion investment in the production of low-carbon liquid fuels, with private businesses and farmers the big winners.

The investment was announced by Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen in Brisbane on Wednesday as part of an expansion of Labor’s Future Made in Australia policy.

Low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) can be produced sustainably from waste, biomass such as agricultural feedstocks, or renewable hydrogen.

“More Australian jobs, more profitable Australian farms and lower emissions — that’s the win, win, win the Albanese government is announcing today,” Bowen said.

The energy minister said liquid fuels make up a third of emissions in Australia and, while renewable electricity is important, “it’s not the answer for everything”.

“There are plenty of parts of Australian industry that will always rely on liquid forms of energy,” he said.

“Things like aviation and shipping, and to some degree heavy transport, are hard to decarbonise — a big part of the answer is low-carbon fuels, cleaner fuels.”

Earlier in the year, Bowen said an Australian domestic LCLF industry would “focus on supplying sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel in liquid fuel-reliant sectors”, these include transport — such as aviation, heavy vehicle, rail and maritime — mining, agriculture and construction.

“The development of low carbon fuels will drive economic growth and jobs in regional areas, including supporting diversification in agriculture, making good use of excess feedstock from crops, sugarcane and waste products such as tallow,” Bowen said at the time.

Wednesday’s announcement is part of a 10-year grants program to encourage private sector investment into local LCLF production.

Energy Minister Chris Bowen is expected to make the joint announcement with Treasurer Jim Chalmers on Wednesday morning. Credit: AAP

Bioenergy Australia called the announcement a “ground-breaking investment” that will drive decarbonisation across the nation’s key industries, as well as help position Australia at the forefront of the global clean-energy transition.

Bioenergy Australia CEO Shahana McKenzie said the announcement was a “pivotal role” in achieving Net Zero.

“It sends a clear signal to global investors that Australia is open for business in the development and deployment of low-carbon fuels,” McKenzie said.

“For industry, this is more than a funding announcement — it is a turning point.

“It gives companies the confidence to invest, innovate and build here in Australia, using our enormous feedstock potential to build a clean energy future.

“With demand for low-carbon liquid fuels rising both at home and abroad, this investment positions Australia to play a leading role in meeting that need.”

Australia’s national science agency, CSIRO, projected that a LCLF industry could contribute between $6 billion to $12 billion annually in direct economic benefits.

However, the science agency said key questions remain around affordability and sustainability, as well as competition for feedstocks and economically efficient scales of production.

LCLF can be made into renewable diesel as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAFs are already used in airports in Europe, the US, UK and some parts of Asia.

In May, Sydney Airport announced a partnership with Qantas and Ampol to import nearly two million litres of SAFs which would be mixed with conventional aviation fuel.

“The fuel could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas and Jetstar’s 737 aircraft, reducing the resulting carbon emissions from those flights by a total estimated 3,400 tonnes,” the airport said.
