[TITLE]'Non-promoters offered fair value': NCLAT sets aside plea against Reliance Retail capital share reduction:
[TEXT]
In a relief to the Reliance Industries arm Reliance Retail, appellate tribunal NCLAT has set aside a petition against the leading retailer, which in 2023 reduced the equity share capital of the company, saying non-promoters were offered a "fair value" of their shares.

Reliance Retail had in 2023 decided to reduce and cancel 78,65,423 equity shares of the company, held by the minority shareholders, other than the promoters/holding company.

Observing that non-promoter shareholders were offered a "fair value" of their shares during the exercise and an overwhelming majority voted in favour of the resolution, the appellate tribunal upheld the earlier order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and said it found "no reason to upset a reasoned order passed" by it.

The NCLAT, while referring to previous judgements, said "selective reduction is permissible if objecting shareholders are paid a fair value of their shares".

On July 4, 2023, the board of Reliance Retail Ltd (RRL), through a special resolution, approved the proposal to reduce and cancel 78,65,423 equity shares of the company, held by minority shareholders, other than promoters/holding company.

The company had then offered ₹1,380 per share to shareholders other than its promoter and holding company, which constituted only 0.09 per cent of the total shareholding.

This was challenged by one N G Joshi, a shareholder of RRL having 129 shares, constituting 0.0000014 per cent of the authorised and issued paid-up capital of the company before the Mumbai bench of the NCLT, which had on January 5, 2024 dismissed the petition.

As an intervenor, he had objected to the reduction of share capital, alleging that such a reduction is against the minority interest and is not permitted under Section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013, since RRL is forcefully removing its shareholders, and promoters are increasing their stakes by using this process.

Subsequently, an appeal to the NCLT order was also filed before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which also dismissed it last week.

Passing its order, a two-member NCLAT bench observed that the special resolution for reduction of the share capital was passed with 99.99 per cent approval and ₹1,380 per share, consideration paid by RRL was at a premium of 56 per cent to its fair value determined by two independent valuers.

The six-page-long NCLAT noted that Article 56 of the Articles of Association of RRL permits the company to reduce its capital in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules.

Moreover, the Regional Director and ROC (Registrar of Companies) have not objected to the reduction of share capital, though it was remarked by the Regional Director that the proposed reduction is a selective reduction.

NCLAT also observed the appellant held mere 129 shares and no other shareholder of RRL has filed any appeal against the NCLT order.

Moreover, it is settled law the question of reduction of share capital is treated as a matter of domestic concern, it is the decision of the majority which prevails, the appellate tribunal said.

"Thus once it is established that non-promoter shareholders are being paid a fair value of their shares and at no point of time it was suggested the amount paid was less and where an overwhelming majority voted in favour of resolution, we find no reason to upset a reasoned order passed by the NCLT," said NCLT bench comprising Member (Judicial) Justice Yogesh Khanna and Member (Technical) Ajai Das Mehrotra.

[TITLE]Shoe Prices Are Up, And Footwear Could Be Off Some Holiday Gift Lists:
[TEXT]
Consumers are spending, but not necessarily on shoes.

U.S. consumer spending intentions on softgoods, such as apparel and shoes, over the next 90 days are up 5.9 percent versus year-ago levels, according to a UBS survey earlier this month. High-income consumer spending intentions jumped 10.4 percent.

“We think this is very important since high-income consumers account for a disproportionate amount of total softgoods spending,” wrote UBS softlines retail analyst Jay Sole in a report.

Sole said spending intentions also appear to bode well for holiday, noting that the market could be underestimating how U.S. consumers prioritize and plan for holiday shopping. He also expects “moderate price increases because of tariffs,” adding that conversations with softline firms suggest low- to mid-single digit price increases in the fourth quarter so as not to “spook consumers or risk losing market share to rivals who raise prices less.”

The UBS survey also took a look at spending by political affiliation. The spending outlook on apparel and footwear is higher among Republican respondents, while the opposite was true for those indicating affiliation with the Democratic party, a possible reflection on differing views on where the economy is headed. Republican respondents said the current state of the U.S. economy isn’t impacting their spending. In contrast, spending less overall was higher for Democratic respondents, which coincided with their plans to spend less on apparel.

The UBS data, citing to Haver Analytics and Euromonitor, siad that U.S. apparel sales were $341 billion in 2024, while the tally for U.S. footwear sales were $91 billion. UBS also noted that apparel and shoes — which account for roughly 2 percent of U.S. GDP — are considered slow-growing categories, according to Haver Analytics.

Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein on Friday said that while inflation continues to be a challenge, higher prices may be curtailing some consumer purchases but it is not halting spending. They also pointed to a backdrop where the jobs market may have softened, but because of the still-low employment rate and small number of people filing for first-time unemployment benefits, most of those looking for work are likely still employed and continue to receive a paycheck. With the savings rate at 4.6 percent in August, indications are that households have some financial cushion, the economists concluded.

Deloitte is forecasting holiday retail sales to rise between 2.9 percent and 3.4 percent this year, totaling between $1.61 trillion and $1.62 trillion during the November to January timeframe. That compares with a holiday sales growth of 4.2 percent in the same 2024 period. The consultancy is also projecting that e-commerce sales will grow between 7 percent to 9 percent, or between $305 billion and $310.7 billion this season.

“We expect this holiday season to demonstrate the resiliency of consumers as they continue to face economic uncertainty,” said Natalie Martini, Deloitte’s vice chair and U.S. retail and consumer products leader.

But while consumers may be spending on some items — a classic holiday gift item is apparel — footwear sales could be on the decline. Other data points also indicate higher prices and slower spending on footwear.

Data from intelligence platform Competitoor show that for the year ending Sept. 5, women’s sneaker prices rose 12 percent, while women’s boot prices are up 9 percent. Men’s sneakers on average rose 16 percent, while footwear in general is up 15 percent year-over-year. Over the same period, the average price increase for girls’ footwear is up 10 percent and for boys it is up 12 percent.

“These price increases reflect new products that entered the U.S. subject to tariffs,” said Competitoor CEO Maurizio Catellani. Competitoor’s platform tracks luxury retailers such as Bergdorf, Bloomingdale’s, Farfetch, Levelshoes, MyTheresa, Neiman Marcus and Net-a-porter, which cater more to high-income consumers.

“For the holiday period, even at increased prices, footwear remains a priority for shoppers, especially trending styles such as performance sneakers, soccer inspired sneaker silhouettes, ballet flats, boat shoes and heels,” Catellani said.

But there’s one consumer demographic that hasn’t been spending as much as before on footwear. Data from direct marketing firm Belardi Wong found that older consumers tend to be more conservative during times of uncertainty.

According to the firm’s president Polly Wong: “We continue to see some softness in the demand for comfort footwear brands targeting 50-plus consumers. Over the last few months, revenue is trending down low-single digits.” She said the brands that are beating the trend are those accelerating their direct-to consumer marketing, while also expanding on their wholesale presence.

Wong also said the pullback in spending among older consumers in the spring was likely due to tariff uncertainty. Some spending among this consumer cohort has rebounded in late summer, although it wasn’t immediately clear what their spending was more recently for comfort shoes. In general, Wong expects the footwear options that will see the most growth are running shoes, outdoor/hiking boots and work boots. She also noted that 35 percent of footwear sales are online, with 65 percent sold in physical stores.

PwC’s 2025 holiday survey results, disclosed earlier this month, projects a 7 percent to 10 percent decline in year-over-year footwear spending this holiday season. While sticker shock is driving the estimated decline, fewer new customers and smaller orders by large merchants are also fueling the sales pullback.

While the PwC study was conducted in June, there are indications that a potential pullback on footwear spend could be in the works.

Nike Inc. in May disclosed that U.S. retail prices on higher-priced sneakers would increase on June 1, although the Swoosh did maintain current price points for the Jordan brand and Nike kids apparel and footwear. Overall, footwear brands such as Steven Madden Ltd. and On Holding AG, were good

[TITLE]Small Businesses Find It ‘Hard to Breathe’ as Tariffs Persist:

Many of these companies did not have the money or storage space to stockpile merchandise before new levies were put into place, The New York Times reported Monday (Sept. 29). These merchants have also hesitated to raise prices for fear of repelling customers, leaving them vulnerable to price increases and putting profit margins at risk.

“It’s hard to breathe,” said Brandon Mills, CEO of Total Promotion Company, a Las Vegas maker of promotional products, custom apparel and merchandise that sources most of its apparel and printing materials from China, per the report.

Mills said the increasing cost of tariffs has eaten into the margins of some orders, and he now wonders if he would have been better off not filling them, according to the report. To compensate, he has laid off one of his seven workers and asked his bank to extend a line of credit to cover his bills.

After the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates, Chair Jerome Powell said that “companies that sit between the exporter and the consumer” are absorbing the brunt of the tariffs, per the report.

Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta showed that 86% of companies that import products by sea, the most common means of international trade, have less than 50 employees, the report said. These small businesses tend to import goods from one supplier and one country, making them susceptible to steep increases in tariffs.

New tariffs have helped kick off a revolution in digital procurement among small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), accelerating the adoption of automation, data analytics and embedded finance.

“Innovative, next-generation supply chain management platforms, once out of reach for SMBs, are now increasingly affordable and scalable,” PYMNTS reported April 28. “These systems can help them map their supplier networks, forecast tariff impacts and quickly model what-if scenarios.”

Priority CEO Tom Priore told PYMNTS in April that, regardless of the economic environment, SMBs are constantly forced to make their way through an ocean of complexity. Bundled financial services can help them speed cash flow and optimize working capital.

[TITLE]Elizabeth Berkley Proves Livestreams Are Beauty’s New Frontier as She Reveals Her ‘Showgirl’ Makeup Favorites:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

It’s undoubtedly the year of the showgirl, with Taylor Swift‘s wave-making album announcement that’s making us see orange, the continued buzz surrounding Pamela Anderson’s latest role in “The Last Showgirl,” and the 30th anniversary of the alluringly controversial film “Showgirls,” in which Elizabeth Berkley plays the leading role of Nomi, who navigates the seedy yet captivating world of Las Vegas strip clubs.

Want to tap into the grandiosity of it all through your makeup looks, in a way that pays homage to the elegance and glam of a showgirl’s life while staying true to today’s top beauty trends? Berkley herself has come to the rescue, with a recent beauty livestream on TalkShopLive (in partnership with Walmart Live), where she walked fans through the premium makeup products she uses regularly and responded to professional, personal, and glam-related questions in real time. Berkley’s TalkShopLive stream comes on the heels of similarly buzzy programming done by the company in partnership with stars like Kate Hudson, Cynthia Erivo, and Dolly Parton.

The whole production (which you can watch in the video player above) felt accessible and inspirational in equal measure. As Berkley was chatting to host Kathy Buccio, she revealed tidbits like the fact that she still wears glitter on her eyelids daily. “You can take the girl out of Vegas, but you can’t take the showgirl out of the girl,” Berkley said at one point. “If you want a little glamour, even while going to the grocery store, what’s wrong with that?”

Footage of Berkley reminiscing on her career was interspersed with clips of makeup artist Aniya Nandy, who showcased key aspects of the dream “showgirl” look (think bold eye, iconic red lip, slightly flushed cheeks, and glitter, of course). These were modeled on Reagan Baylee, an influencer and host of a popular podcast fittingly focused on none other than T-Swift. Powered by TalkShopLive’s interactive platform, the event merged insightful, behind-the-scenes celebrity storytelling with step-by-step tutorials that could be replicated in an instant — simply by adding to cart the products mentioned by Nandy, with relevant anecdotes doled out by Berkley.

Feeling inspired to take your daily makeup rituals to new heights? As it turns out, acing elongated eyeliner wings, a paparazzi-ready pout, and oh-so-perfect nails doesn’t require more than a few dollars to make you look put-together as can be. Here are some of the products Berkley and company talked up on the livestream, deserving prime real estate on your bathroom counter and inside your makeup bag. The best part? All of these luxe beauty buys can be found at Walmart. Cheers to your own showgirl era!
