The blockchain-based prediction market environment is going through a significant transformation as clearer guidelines and developing consumer interest converge to change digital trading. Leading this wave of modification is Polymarket , a platform that has long run under regulatory uncertainty and is currently gearing up a complete compliant comeback to the United States.After getting QCX, a CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, for $112 million, Polymarket has achieved a legitimate gateway for U.S. joining. This strategically places the industry to tap into the $8.52 billion American football betting segment estimated for 2025, as per the American Football Betting Report. With its eyes on a $15 billion valuation, Polymarket’s resurgence shows more than a business development—it shows a turning point where prediction markets starts to intersect with mainstream finance and sports wagering For years, U.S. prediction markets existed in a regulatory “gray zone,” compelling platforms such as Polymarket to serve users offshore. The acquisition of QCX—a industry holding both CFTC-registered exchange and clearinghouse licenses fundamentally modifies that narrative. With this acquisition, Polymarket can currently provide American traders a legally compliant scenario to speculate on results ranging from sports matches to macroeconomic information.This progress suits neatly into a larger global trend where blockchain transparency and decentralization are being integrated into traditional regulatory frameworks. Such hybridization confirms both innovation and investor protection—two factors often seen as mutually exclusive in the crypto sector.The U.S. sports betting market, estimated to expand at an 11.6% CAGR in 2025, exemplifies the balance between innovation and compliance. With states such as New York and Nevada heightening rules on unlicensed operators—a shift highlighted by the ongoing Kalshi lawsuit, regulated entrants like Polymarket are well-placed to spot market share.The company’s limited U.S. rollout, set for late November 2025, will focus on sports betting, an intentional strategy to gain early adopters and build trust with regulators before wider market development.While some analysts state a $19.76 billion total valuation for the U.S. sports betting sector in 2025, others emphasize the $8.52 billion American football segment mainly. Regardless of which proves more right, momentum is undeniable. By 2029, the American football betting market alone could estimate upto$13.06 billion, driven by mobile technology, interactive wagering, and interactive fan engagement.Unlike traditional sportsbooks that depend on opaque odds models, Polymarket’s decentralized infrastructure enables transparent, crowd-driven price findings. This model has already showcased scalability blended trading volumes in Polymarket and Kalshi crossed $4.63 billion within 23 days in October 2025, as per the reports across the DraftKings partnership, with Polymarket maintaining 35–37% of total market share.Such liquidity is reinforced by significant partnerships, especially with DraftKings, which extends Polymarket’s availability to retail bettors while keeping regulatory oversight.Though sports betting is Polymarket’s rapid priority, its ambitions goes far further. The platform recently launched Binance Coin (BNB) deposits and withdrawals, “a strategic move to tap into the broader DeFi ecosystem, enhancing multi-chain accessibility and attracting crypto-native users.”This integration does more than broaden availability—it intensifies Polymarket’s link to decentralized finance. By elevating BNB’s utility, the industry strengthens both its own liquidity and the blockchain’s ecosystem.Polymarket’s fundraising attempts, with a $15 billion valuation target, emphasizes its aim to become a next-generation financial infrastructure provider. Partnerships with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) showcases the company’s capability to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) , a blend that could appeal to institutional investors looking for both innovation and compliance.While Polymarket’s advancement is impressive, competition continues to be intense. Kalshi, its initial rival, remains to grapple with regulatory issues, that includes its dispute with New York’s gaming commission. Meanwhile, fresh entrants like Trump Media’s Truth Predict are leveraging CFTC collaborations to gain entry, after the Trump Media Challenge.However, Polymarket’s initial -mover benefit, robust liquidity, and institutional alliances offers a strong competitive edge.Regulatory uncertainty continues to be the chief challenge. Although CFTC authorization offers federal legitimacy, state-level intervention could still cause operational friction. The New York cease-and-desist order against Kalshi emphasizes how fragmented U.S. regulatory oversight might be. Polymarket’s acquisition of QCX mitigates some of this exposure by embedding compliance into its structure.Polymarket is a blockchain-based prediction platform that enables users to trade on real-world events.The company’s come back follows its acquisition of QCX, a CFTC-licensed exchange

[TITLE]GBank Financial Holdings Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
LAS VEGAS, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GBank Financial Holdings Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: GBFH ), the parent company of GBank (the “Bank”), today reported net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 of $4.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. The results for the third quarter of 2025 include unusual expenses totaling $2.0 million after-tax, or $0.14 per diluted share, primarily associated with executive severance expenses and costs incurred related to the discontinuation of a third-party credit card marketing campaign. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net income was $13.5 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared to $13.4 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the comparable nine-month period of 2024.

Form S-1 and uplist costs of $23 thousand after-tax for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and $834 thousand after-tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 consist of the non-recurring legal, professional, and audit fees associated with the preparation of filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the registration of the Company's shares of common stock and listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

All the transactions associated with this program were non-gaming transactions.

Financial Results

Income Statement

Net interest income totaled $13.0 million for the third quarter of 2025, reflecting an increase of $610 thousand, or 4.9%, compared to $12.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, and an increase of $739 thousand, or 6.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2024.

The increase in net interest income when compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by higher average balances of interest earning assets partially offset by volume-driven increases in deposit interest expense, as the growth in earning assets was primarily funded by interest bearing demand and certificates of deposit growth. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities continued to trend downward from 4.07% during the second quarter of 2025 to 4.02% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

The increase in net interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily volume driven, as higher interest income from growth in average loan and interest-bearing cash balances more than offset increases in interest expense resulting from higher average balances of interest-bearing deposits.

The yield on investment securities was 4.62% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 4.73% for the second quarter of 2025 and 5.06% for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in the yield when compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter of 2024 was the result of a reduction in yield on certain variable rate securities due to lower long-term interest rates.

The Company’s net interest margin for the third quarter of 2025 was 4.35%, compared to 4.31% for the second quarter of 2025 and 5.00% for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in net interest margin during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the previous quarter was attributable to both (i) slightly higher loan yields, and (ii) a favorable decrease in the cost of funds. The decrease in net interest margin when compared to the third quarter of 2024 is reflective of the 100 basis point decrease in the target federal funds rate during the second half of 2024 by the Federal Reserve.

The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $1.1 million compared to $1.1 million during the second quarter of 2025, and an increase of $1.6 million when compared to the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses on loans recorded in the third quarter of 2025 reflects quarterly organic growth in non-guaranteed loans of $58.7 million, $707 thousand of specific reserves assigned to credit card balances, and the replenishment of reserves to offset $836 thousand of net charge-offs during the period.

Non-interest income was $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $5.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. The $1.8 million increase in non-interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in gain on loan sale revenue and an $871 thousand increase in net interchange fees. The $3.3 million increase in non-interest income during the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the third quarter of 2024 was driven by favorable increases across all categories of other income, including (i) an increase in credit card net interchange fees of $2.1 million as credit card transaction volume increased from $22 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to $321 million for the same period in 2025, (ii) an increase in gain on sale of loans of $754 thousand , and (iii) a $196 thousand increase in loan servicing income.

Net revenue totaled $20.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of $2.4 million, or 13.5%, compared to $17.8 million for the second quarter of 2025. Net revenue for the third quarter of 2025 increased $4.0 million, or 24.8%, when compared to $16.2 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Non-interest expense was $12.3 million during the third quarter of 2025, compared to $10.4 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $9.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. The quarter-over-quarter increase in non-interest expense was due to the previously mentioned unusual expenses incurred during the quarter of salaries and employee benefits expense and other expenses. The Company’s efficiency ratio was 61.1% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 58.5% for the second quarter of 2025 and 56.0% for the third quarter of 2024.

Income tax expense was $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate was 22.7% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to 19.1% for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and 23.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The fluctuations in the effective tax rate are largely driven by the timing and volume of certain stock-based compensation transactions resulting in tax benefits to the Company, as well as the timing and volume of state tax adjustments.

Net income was $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $447 thousand from $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2025, and a decrease of $707 thousand from $5.0 million during the third quarter of 2024. Diluted earnings per share were $0.30 for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.33 for the second quarter of 2025 and $0.38 for the third quarter of 2024. Earnings per share and other share-based metrics have been impacted by the shares issued in the previously disclosed private placement of shares of common stock completed in October 2024.

The Company had 187 full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 2025, compared to 188 full-time equivalent employees as of June 30, 2025, and 159 full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 2024.

Balance Sheet

Total assets increased 5.6% to $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2025, from $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2025, and increased 24.2% from $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. The increase in total assets from June 30, 2025 was primarily driven by higher loan balances as well as an increase in other assets primarily due to a bank owned life insurance investment of $15 million during the third quarter of 2025. The increase in total assets from September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by increases in loans, interest bearing deposits with banks, investment securities, and all other assets. Total assets, including $970 million of sold loans for which servicing is retained, totaled $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2025.

Total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, were $940.6 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $871.6 million as of June 30, 2025, and $781.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Loans, net of deferred fees and costs increased $69.0 million during the third quarter of 2025 primarily due to increases in commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and consumer loans, primarily due to credit cards, and partially offset by decreases in construction, multifamily and residential loans. The increase in loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of $159.6 million from September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by increases of $145.8 million in commercial real estate loans. Total guaranteed loans as a percentage of loans(1) were 20.6% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 22.1% as of June 30, 2025, and 26.0% as of September 30, 2024.

The Company’s allowance for credit losses totaled $10.6 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $9.2 million as of June 30, 2025, and $7.9 million as of September 30, 2024.

The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding guaranteed portions(1), was 1.42% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 1.36% as of June 30, 2025, and 1.37% as of September 30, 2024.

Deposits totaled $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $59.7 million from $1.032 billion as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of $208.7 million from $883.5 million as of September 30, 2024. By deposit type, the increase from the prior quarter was driven by an increase of $82.3 million in certificates of deposit and a $6.5 million increase in interest bearing demand deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $227.9 million as of September 30, 2025, a decrease of $992 thousand from $228.9 million as of June 30, 2025, and a decrease of $2.0 million from $229.9 million as of September 30, 2024.

The Company’s ratio of loans to deposits was 86.1% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 84.4% as of June 30, 2025, and 88.4% as of September 30, 2024.

The Company held no short-term borrowings as of September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025, or September 30, 2024.

Stockholders’ equity was $158.2 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $151.7 million as of June 30, 2025, and $116.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The increase in stockholders’ equity from June 30, 2025 is attributable to increases in retained earnings resulting from net income earned during the quarter. The increase in stockholders’ equity since September 30, 2024 was the result of the previously disclosed private placement of shares of common stock completed in October 2024 and net income earned over the previous twelve months.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total assets was 12.2% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 12.3% as of June 30, 2025, and 11.1% as of September 30, 2024. The Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 13.7% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 13.8% as of June 30, 2025, and 13.1% as of September 30, 2024.

The Company’s book value per share was $11.07 as of September 30, 2025, an increase of 4.1% from $10.63 as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of 24.3% from $8.91 as of September 30, 2024.

Asset Quality

The provision for credit losses for loans totaled $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2025 and $570 thousand for the third quarter of 2024. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2025 totaled $836 thousand, or 0.35% of average net loans (annualized), compared to net loan charge-offs of $870 thousand, or 0.38% of average net loans (annualized) in the second quarter of 2025 and $22 thousand of net loan recoveries, or 0.01% of average net loans (annualized) during the third quarter of 2024. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2025 were attributable to certain commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and credit card relationships.

Nonaccrual loans increased $16.4 million during the quarter to $34.6 million as of September 30, 2025, and increased $29.2 million from $5.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The guaranteed portion of nonaccrual loans totaled $27.1 million as of June 30, 2025. Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest totaled $184 thousand as of September 30, 2025, compared to $146 thousand as of June 30, 2025, and $27 thousand as of September 30, 2024. The balance of loans past due 90 days and accruing of $184 thousand at September 30, 2025 was comprised entirely of credit card balances which are non-guaranteed.

The Company held $2.7 million of other real estate owned as of September 30, 2025. The Company held no other real estate owned as of June 30, 2025 or September 30, 2024.

Non-performing assets totaled $37.5 million as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $19.1 million from $18.4 million as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of $32.1 million from $5.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Non-performing assets, excluding guaranteed portions, totaled $10.4 million as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $5.8 million from $4.6 million as of June 30, 2025 and an increase of $8.8 million from $1.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The increase in non-performing assets during the third quarter of 2025 was the result of both (i) the transfer of $16.6 million of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans from accrual to nonaccrual status during the quarter, and (ii) $2.7 million of other real estate properties assumed during the quarter.

While the quarter over quarter percentage increase in non-performing assets seems significant when viewed alone, the financial risk is seen to be well contained with a reasonable non-performing asset risk ratio to total assets of 0.80% when removing the guaranteed portion of each non-performing asset. Further, it is important to consider the process we undertake when a collateralized SBA non-performing asset requires collection efforts. We repurchase the sold portion of the guaranteed loan to affect the foreclosure and resale of the property. This process immediately increases the non-performing asset balance on our balance sheet to include the guaranteed portion – thus the importance of always adjusting for the guaranteed portion of the non-performing assets as well as considering our “off balance sheet” assets consisting of the sold portion of SBA guaranteed loans of $970 million that increase our total assets under management to $2.3 billion.

Loans past due between 30 and 89 days and accruing interest totaled $3.6 million as of September 30, 2025, a decrease of $4.6 million from $8.2 million as of June 30, 2025, and a decrease of $8.8 million from $12.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The guaranteed portion of loans past due between 30 and 89 days and accruing interest was $2.4 million as of September 30, 2025.

The ratio of total non-performing assets to total assets was 2.88% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 1.49% as of June 30, 2025, and 0.52% as of September 30, 2024. The ratio of non-performing assets, excluding guaranteed portions, to total assets(1) was 0.80% as of September 30, 2025, compared to 0.37% as of June 30, 2025, and 0.15% as of September 30, 2024.

The Company continues to closely monitor credit quality in light of the ongoing economic uncertainty caused by, among other factors, continued uncertainty regarding U.S. trade and tariff policy and the lingering inflationary pressures, and the risk of the resurgence of elevated levels of inflation, in the United States and our market areas. Accordingly, additional provisions for credit losses may be necessary in future periods.

Loan sale volume increased to $110.8 million during the third quarter of 2025, compared to $82.1 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $71.4 million for the third quarter of 2024. Gain on sale of loans increased 38.5% to $3.6 million, compared to $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased 26.6% from $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The average pretax gain on sale of loans margin was 3.24% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.16% for the second quarter of 2025 and 3.98% for the third quarter of 2024.

Gaming FinTech

Our Gaming Payments Operations in the third quarter of 2025 focused upon redirecting all credit card marketing to our gaming consumers; concluding and subsequently terminating a third party non-gaming direct mail market agreement; onboarding BoltBetz with Distill and Terrible Gaming slots; enhancing our influencer marketing with the engagement of Champ Mike Tyson; and, concluding the development and launch of our digital credit card application platform with the most advanced KYC and fraud protections. This new application platform will enable our influencers to support the growth of GBank's credit card gaming customers.

Our initial efforts to “patch” the existing application platform were not successful and required that we halt applications when we were faced with identification fraud. This pause stopped the fraud applications but also resulted in limiting the growth in the number of gaming cardholders. Despite this, credit card transaction volumes increased almost 60% sequentially to more than $131 million during the third quarter of 2025.

The Prepaid Access/Slot program involving BoltBetz is continuing to make significant progress with Distill Taverns and Terribles Gaming onboarding over 2,500 slot machines. BoltBetz is in the final process of Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) testing by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. This is the final process required to launch which is now anticipated in November 2025.

The Pooled Player (“PPA™”) pipeline continues to develop new payments agreements with both the Prepaid Access accounts and virtual ATM providers which are expected to launch in the coming quarters following the receipt of final regulatory approvals.

Including BoltBetz, BankCard Services LLC (“BCS”) and GBank now have sixteen active payment and PPA™ and Pooled Consumer (“PCA™”) Program clients. Currently, BCS and GBank are conducting due diligence for five new clients, with anticipated onboarding in future quarters. Gaming FinTech deposits averaged $37.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $39.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. We anticipate deposit growth from BoltBetz Casino clients to commence in the second quarter of 2026.

[TITLE]Quadrant in Chelmsford and Braintree closes department stores:
[TEXT]
Department stores close after 144 years of trading

4 days ago Share Save Lewis Adams Essex Share Save

Peter Walker/BBC Quadrant's shop in Chelmsford city centre first opened in 1881

A pair of department stores have shut for the final time after 144 years in business, affecting the jobs of 51 people. Quadrant said its shops in Chelmsford and Braintree had been making "substantial and sustained losses" for years. Shoppers enjoyed weeks of heavily discounted goods, including furniture, clothing and electronics, before doors shut for the final time on Saturday. "Though this chapter has come to an end, the memories we've shared will always remain," the company said in a statement.

It thanked staff for their dedication during a "difficult few months", adding: "You've been the heart of our stores, and your teamwork and spirit made both branches so much more than just a place to shop. "To our loyal customers — thank you for your support over the years. Your smiles, stories, and friendship have meant the world to us." The closure came after the Chelmsford Star Co-op, a 158-year-old group that owned Quadrant, merged with the Central Co-Op. Its shop in Moulsham Street, Chelmsford, first opened under a different name in 1881, and successful trading then led to a second store opening in Braintree in 1991. However, local Co-op members voted to close the venues in May.

Reuters Quadrant spent weeks selling off its goods at heavily discounted prices

"The department store business has been making substantial and sustained losses for many years," a spokesman for Chelmsford Star Co-op said, in June. "These challenges have been made worse in recent years by shifts in consumer behaviour - particularly the move to online shopping which was further accelerated by the pandemic." The brand has been working with the retail union USDAW to support the 51 employees affected by the closures. Despite merging with Central Co-op, the Chelmsford Star trading name will continue to be used locally. The transfer to Central Co-op - which trades across the East Midlands and East Anglia - completed on 15 September.

Moscow: The latest package of European Union's sanctions on Russia has opened new opportunities for Indian business in boosting bilateral trade, Moscow-based Indian Business Alliance said on Monday.The Council of the European Union on October 23 adopted the 19th package of further individual listings and numerous economic restrictive measures, including energy, finance and the military industrial complex, targeting key sectors which fuel what it termed as "Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine."The Indian Business Alliance (IBA), in a statement, said: "The EU sanctions against Russia have had an unexpected effect - instead of weakening the Russian economy, they have spurred local production and innovation. Russian industries have responded dynamically, filling the gaps left by the withdrawal of Western companies.""At the same time, these measures have strengthened Russia's partnerships with friendly nations, particularly India," the IBA said and added that as many Western firms departed from Russia under the sanctions, new opportunities emerged - and Indian businesses stepped forward to meet the demand."Bilateral trade between India and Russia has now reached a record US USD 68.7 billion, reflecting the growing momentum in bilateral relationship," the statement, signed by IBA president Sammy Manoj Kotwani, said.The 19th package of EU sanctions bans export of many items, including sanitaryware, toys with electric motors and tricycles to Russia."Indian generic drug manufacturers, who were in the past have been targets of western rivals' smear campaigns, are today ensuring stable supplies for Russian hospitals and pharmacies," the IBA said.Indian exporters of engineering goods and machinery have significantly expanded shipments of equipment, components, and spare parts, while Indian consumer goods are back on shelves of Russian stores, it said, adding, Indian tea, rice, spices, and garments are increasingly replacing European brands."This cooperation benefits both nations - Russian consumers enjoy stable access to quality products, while Indian exporters gain new and growing markets," Kotwani underscored.He noted that in this environment, the IBA is actively supporting the new wave of bilateral trade."We connect Indian and Russian companies, facilitate logistics and partnerships, and provide business guidance to strengthen mutual trust. Together, Russia and India are transforming global challenges into new opportunities - and emerging more resilient, united, and forward-looking than ever," he concluded.A day before EU's sanctions, the US, on October 22, imposed sanctions on Russia's two largest crude oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, barring all American entities and individuals from conducting business with them.On the other hand, the US has imposed 25 per cent tariffs on India as a penalty for purchasing oil from Russia. It is over and above the 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods entering American markets. Overall, Indian goods are attracting a steep 50 per cent additional import duties in the US.New Delhi has described these duties as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable."On Monday, India reviewed the progress of the ongoing negotiations for the proposed free trade agreement (FTA) with the 27-nation bloc EU.The discussion on the pact was held between Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and EU Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic in Brussels.

[TITLE]Penneys owner Primark marks Middle East entry with Kuwait store:
[TEXT]
Irish ambassador to Kuwait Alison Milton (centre left) attended the opening of Primark's store in Kuwait City, a first for the Penneys owner in the Middle East.

Penneys owner Primark has cut the ribbon on its first store in the Middle East after opening a franchise outlet in Kuwait City on Thursday.

The fashion retailer has partnered with Kuwaiti international retail franchise operator Alshaya Group to open the store at Grand Plaza at the Avenues, the largest shopping centre in the Gulf state.

The opening was attended by interim Primark chief executive, Irishman Eoin Tonge, and Ireland’s ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar, Alison Milton.

Mr Tonge said the opening of Primark’s 60,000 sq ft store in Kuwait City also marks the Associated British Foods-owned brand’s 18th international market entry.

“Combined with Alshaya’s deep market expertise and close partnership, we believe today represents an important and exciting new growth chapter,” Mr Tonge said.

With Alshaya, Primark is set to open three stores in Dubai in the first half of next year. It is also planning to open its first store in Manhattan next year, 10 years after its initial arrival in the US.

In a trading update that disappointed analysts, ABF reported annual sales growth at Primark of 1 per cent in the third quarter and forecast the same for the typically busy fourth quarter of the year.

While it said trading in the UK and Ireland had improved steadily, ABF warned of a softer consumer demand environment in Europe.

Group chief executive George Weston said the trading environment remains “challenging”, with consumers worried about inflation and “political turmoil” on the Continent.

“We shouldn’t be surprised at all in Europe that with the political turmoil in parts of it and a consumer squeeze, particularly among the less affluent, that we should see sales [being] hard to win,” Mr Weston said in an interview at the time.

“It’s a difficult time to be selling consumer goods to less affluent people across Europe.”

[TITLE]United States Vegetable Oil Market Forecast and Company Analysis Report 2025-2033 Featuring ADM, Wilmar, AAK, Unilever, Bunge, Cargill, Sime Darby, Associated British Foods:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "United States Vegetable Oil Market Report by Oil Type, Application, Distribution Channel, States and Company Analysis, 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

United States Vegetable Oil Market is expected to reach US$ 139.48 billion by 2033 from US$ 96.07 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 4.23% from 2025 to 2033

The growing food processing industries, growing consumer demand, and the growing use of plant-based oils in a variety of applications are expected to propel the US vegetable oil market's steady growth. The market for vegetable oil in the US is steadily developing due to factors like shifting dietary tastes, the growing popularity of plant-based diets, and rising demand from the food processing sector.

The U.S. millets market shows strong regional adoption, with California, Texas, New York, and Florida leading demand, driven by health-conscious populations, diverse food industries, and increasing promotion of sustainable, gluten-free, and nutrient-dense diets The U.S. vegetable oil market shows strong demand across states, with consumption driven by food industries in California, Texas, New York, and Florida, supported by industrial diversification, renewable energy use, and growing plant-based dietary preferences.

The increasing demand for vegetable oils is a result of their widespread use in industry and cookery, including soybean, canola, sunflower, and corn oil. Healthy oil types with less trans-fat are becoming more and more popular with consumers, but the foodservice industry still uses a lot of vegetable oils for baking, frying, and packaging. Further supporting this steady demand are robust supply chains and the use of cutting-edge processing and refining technology.

Beyond food consumption, vegetable oils are finding growing applications in non-food industries. Their role in the production of biofuels, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products is expanding the scope of the market. As environmental sustainability becomes a key focus, vegetable oils are gaining traction as renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. Government policies and private investments supporting renewable energy adoption are strengthening this trend, making the market increasingly diverse in its applications. The flexibility of vegetable oil in serving both nutritional and industrial needs has contributed significantly to its growing relevance in the U.S. economy.

The sector still confronts several obstacles in spite of these developments, such as the erratic supply of raw materials, reliance on agricultural output, and environmental issues related to large-scale farming. Price volatility brought on by shifting trade regulations and crop output also affects market stability. But the focus on healthy oil substitutes, environmental farming methods, and technological advancements in refining and processing techniques are opening up new growth prospects. It is anticipated that the vegetable oil market in the United States will continue to grow steadily in the years to come due to changing customer preferences and continuous industry diversification.

Key Factors Driving the United States Vegetable Oil Market Growth

Resilient Domestic Production and Competitiveness in International Exports

Due to improved seed genetics, precision agronomy, and centralized farm operations, the US continues to be the world's leading producer of soybean oil. The United States produced around 4.2 billion bushels of soybeans in 2023, up from roughly 3.5 billion bushels in 2019. With Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota as the top-producing states, the Midwest continued to be the region with the highest soybean production.

The local production infrastructure has improved extraction efficiency and yield consistency despite the volatility of the global market. With the help of trade agreements and improved logistics, US vegetable oils are positioned attractively in foreign markets through export routes via Gulf and West Coast ports. In Europe and Asia, buyer confidence is maintained through quality certification and GMO-tracing initiatives.

Additionally, manufacturers are able to handle supply chain interruptions and seasonal strain thanks to responsive crushing capacity and backup storage capacity. Improved risk management through crop insurance, futures, and hedging supports processing margins and stabilizes grower revenue. The United States continues to strengthen its position in the global agricultural trade and is well-positioned to supply the world's markets with consistent, high-volume oil production as the demand for plant oils for food, feed, and fuel rises.

Expanding Culinary and Practical Applications

Vegetable oils, especially canola, soybean, and sunflower, are seeing increased use in industrial applications, retail cooking, and food manufacture in addition to fuel.

However, it should be noted that the Company may receive an aggregate of up to $181.4 million (€168.2 million) in gross proceeds if all warrants in connection with the 2025 PIPE are exercised, subject to satisfaction of specified conditions. The VITESSE Phase 3 study hitting its primary endpoint will trigger an acceleration of the exercise period of the warrants (topline results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2025). DBV expects that the proceeds of this funding will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, to finance the continued development of the Viaskin Peanut program in 4-7 years old, to finance the preparation and submission of a potential BLA, and to finance the readiness of a launch of Viaskin peanut in the U.S., if approved.

In addition, in September 2025, the Company established an equity offering program (the “ATM Program”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell American Depositary Shares ("ADSs"), from time to time through its sale agent, having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million (subject to French regulatory limits). Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Company received a total gross amount of approximately $30 million from the issuance of 11,538,460 Ordinary Shares (underlying 2,307,692 ADSs) on October 6, 2025 pursuant to the ATM Program.

As of the date of the filing, with the receipt of the aforementioned proceeds, and based on its current operations, plans, and assumptions examined by the Board on October 28, 2025, the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund its operations into the third quarter of 2026.

As such, cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund operations for the next 12 months, and these conditions and events raise substantial doubt

[TITLE]VF’s Q2 Was Solid, but Investors Have a Vans Concern:
[TEXT]
Does VF Corp. have a third-quarter problem?

Investors think so. VF’s second quarter bested Wall Street’s consensus estimates, but investors sent shares of VF down 12.2 percent to $14.58 at market close on Tuesday.

For the three months ended Sept. 27, VF posted net income of $189.8 million, or 48 cents a diluted share, up from net income of $52.2 million, or 13 cents, in the same year-ago period. Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $2.80 billion from $2.76 billion. Wall Street was expecting adjusted diluted earnings per share, or EPS, of 42 cents on revenue of $2.73 billion.

By brand, revenue for The North Face rose 6 percent to $1.16 billion, Vans was down 9 percent to $606.9 million, Timberland was up 7 percent to $506.4 million, and for VF’s other brands — Altra, Icebreaker, Napapijri, Packs and Smartwool — it was up 2 percent to $532.3 million.

Investors reacted to VF’s third-quarter guidance, where revenues were forecasted down 1 to down 3 percent. Wall Street’s consensus for the third quarter calls for adjusted diluted EPS of 55 cents on revenue of $2.87 billion. In comparison, VF for the three months ended Dec. 28, 2024, posted adjusted diluted EPS of 62 cents on revenue of $2.8 billion.

According to BTIG analyst Janine Stichter, the problem was the “relatively unchanged underlying trend for Vans.” Management noted some encouraging signs, including a better-than-expected back-to-school performance, but questions remain over how much longer the turnaround strategy would need to take hold. Stichter noted that third-quarter profit was guided below consensus due to tariff headwinds of $60 million to $70 million in the second half.

“Even in light of recent challenges at Vans, we believe VFC’s stable of brands is solid, and we like the diversification efforts afforded by a portfolio strategy,” Stichter said. “While we view Vans more as a brand in need of reinvigoration than a complete overhaul, we expect this to be a lengthy process, especially in light of the lead times to impact product, a challenged macro, tariff headwinds, and the need to clean up distribution.”

Dana Telsey, chief investment officer at Telsey Advisory Group, described VF’s second-quarter report as “solid.” The outdoor segment saw 4 percent growth, while the active business is still under pressure as the “Vans turnaround remains a work-in-progress,” she said.

VF president and CEO Bracken P. Darrell told investors in a conference call that the company made progress on its turnaround in a difficult climate.

He said that for The North Face brand, all three regions — Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia-Pacific) — grew compared with year-ago levels, as well as wholesale and direct-to-consumer. Performance apparel drove momentum in core styles, while transitional outerwear was strong and footwear continued to gain traction, growing by double digits in every region.

Timberland also saw growth across both wholesale and DTC. The CEO said demand for the 6-inch premium boot represents only about “20 percent of our global revenue,” indicating that there’s opportunity for growth, whether “through colors, materials, innovations, collaborations and more,” while VF grows the brand “across other footwear and apparel categories.”

He said the recently launched Timberland 25, a lightweight version of the boot, “has been resonating well in its early weeks in our stores.” And Darrell added that the brand’s growing business around boat shoes also saw sales growth in all regions, noting plans to “diversify the product lineup and give the brand more versatility of fire power during the warmer seasons.”

As for Vans, Darrell said: “I told you that Sun’s impact on product could be visible in the back-to-school period, and it is. Product newness across footwear is drawing in new consumers, particularly women, but also youth and kids.” Michelle “Sun” Choe joined Vans as global brand president in July 2024.

The brand made waves this fall with the Valentino Garavani x Vans collaboration, which took the latter’s Authentic silhouette and reimagined it under the direction of Valentino‘s current creative director, Alessandro Michele. Darrell said newness in the Old Skool franchise drove higher sales of women’s styles. The CEO said more newness is on the way heading into holiday and spring 2026.

The company also said in September that it was selling Dickies to Blue Star Alliance for $600 million. VF will use the proceeds to pay down debt.

Lululemon has teamed up with the NFL for its first-ever officially licensed NFL merch collection.

The collection, which officially launches Oct. 28, spans all 32 NFL teams and includes men’s and women’s apparel and accessories featuring signature team marks. Fans can shop the assortment on NFLShop.com, Fanatics.com, team retail locations and at stadium stores. It will be available internationally through local NFL Shop sites.

Developed in partnership with Fanatics, the drop reimagines signature Lululemon styles like the men’s Steady State franchise and women’s Define, Scuba and Align collections through the lens of team pride. The result is a hybrid of fan gear and lifestyle fashion in an era when game-day apparel doubles as everyday wear.

“Together with Fanatics, we are introducing an elevated collection that redefines modern fan apparel and is uniquely designed for everyday comfort,” Renie Anderson, executive vice president and chief revenue officer at the NFL, said in a statement. Celeste Burgoyne, president of the Americas and global guest innovation at Lululemon, added, “True NFL fans wear their pride. For them, fan gear is more than apparel — it’s a badge of loyalty and a way to instantly connect with a community that is like a family.”

To celebrate the launch, the brands rolled out a “Welcome to the Fam Club” campaign featuring NFL legends Joe Montana, Nick Foles, Ryan Clark and Emmanuel Acho alongside their families.

The deal arrives as the company seeks to diversify its consumer base and tap into the lucrative fan-merch market. For the NFL, it’s a chance to elevate its merchandise offerings and connect with younger, style-conscious audiences. Lululemon, long known for its yoga roots and premium athleisure, last patnered with the NHL on its first-ever licensed merch collection.

[TITLE]3 Consumer Stocks with Open Questions:

Investors should tread carefully as many companies in this space can be value traps. On that note, here are three consumer stocks that may face trouble.

What are Frozen Fruits?

Frozen fruit refers to fruits that have been picked at peak ripeness and preserved by freezing to lock in their nutrients and flavor. This method extends their shelf life by several months, making them a convenient and nutritious alternative that can be enjoyed year-round. Frozen fruit is usually as nutritious as fresh fruit, and sometimes more so, because freezing locks in minerals and vitamins at the time of peak ripeness, before they can degrade over time. Thus, freezing slows the growth of microorganisms and prevents chemical changes that cause spoilage, while preserving the fruit's nutritional value.

Impact of AI in the Frozen Fruits Market

AI is increasingly transforming the frozen-fruit value chain in several meaningful ways. First, at the farm and harvest stages, machine-learning and computer-vision systems support fruit detection, variety classification, and quality assessment before freezing. For example, a recent review found that deep-learning models improved the accuracy of fruit variety recognition and helped optimize harvesting logistics. By improving sorting and selecting only the best fruit, producers reduce waste and ensure better input quality for freezing operations.

Once fruits are harvested, AI also plays a key role in cold-chain storage, freezing, and logistics for frozen fruits. Predictive analytics, digital twins, and IoT-enabled sensors integrated with AI can monitor temperature deviations, predict spoilage risk, optimize warehouse placement, and trucking routes. This is especially critical for frozen fruits, where any temperature fluctuations or delays can degrade quality, texture, or nutritional value. This can be observed in the cold-chain industry now uses AI to decide which pallets to place where in a freezer warehouse to minimize worker time and spoilage.

What are the Latest Trends in the Frozen Fruits Market?

Health-conscious consumers and plant-based diets

Due to a desire for convenient, natural food and nutrient-rich options. Advanced flash-freezing techniques preserve vitamins and antioxidants, making frozen fruits a convenient and nutritionally stable option to fresh produce. In addition, the growth of plant-based lifestyles has increased the need for natural ingredients, and even frozen fruits are a staple for those on vegetarian, vegan, or flexitarian diets.

Growth of pre-portioned smoothie packs

Due to increased user need for convenient, healthy, and customizable food alternatives. Busy lifestyles, a focus on wellness, plant-based diets, and the promotion of these products on social media have boosted demand for ready-to-blend, ready-to-eat, goal-oriented smoothie packs that cater to specific needs, such as immunity or energy.

[TITLE]Primark seizes US opportunity as Trump hits online rivals:
[TEXT]
Primark is accelerating its US store openings and ramping up marketing, betting that President Donald Trump's move to scrap a duty exemption on e-commerce parcels will drive budget-conscious shoppers away from online rivals and back to stores.

Primark trades as Penneys here.

The US administration in May ended "de minimis" duty-free treatment of goods under $800 ordered online from China, hurting online fast-fashion platforms like Shein and Temu that ship directly from Chinese factories to shoppers' doorsteps.

The move forced Shein and Temu to raise US prices and tilted the playing field in favour of retailers like Primark that sell in stores and import in bulk to US warehouses.

While Primark's own prices have also risen due to Trump's broader tariff hikes, it is now more competitive versus online rivals that face duties on their products for the first time.

Primark, the flagship of the London-listed Associated British Foods conglomerate, sells trendy, low-priced clothing through 475 stores in 18 countries, generating nearly £10 billion in annual sales and more than £1 billion in profit - all without offering home delivery.

Primark says shipping to homes does not make financial sense given its low prices and the high fulfilment costs, though shoppers can view its ranges online and Click & Collect is available in some of its markets.

Having built a loyal following in Europe, Primark sees an opportunity to crack the US market, and believes its budget focus can help it succeed where less-differentiated UK retailers like Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Topshop failed. The US currently accounts for
