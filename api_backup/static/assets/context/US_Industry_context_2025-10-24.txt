[TITLE]Lyten Completes Acquisition of Northvolt BESS Manufacturing Facility in Poland:
[TEXT]
Lyten announces it has completed the acquisition of Northvolt Dwa in Gdańsk, Poland, the largest Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) manufacturing facility in Europe.

Lyten is immediately restarting production and product development from Northvolt Dwa and targets sales before year end.

Lyten is on track to complete the acquisition of the remaining Northvolt assets in Sweden and German in the 4Q 2025.

SAN JOSE, Calif. & GDAŃSK, Poland — Lyten, the global leader in lithium-sulfur batteries and energy storage, announced this week that it has completed its acquisition of Northvolt Dwa in Gdańsk, Poland. Northvolt Dwa is a 25,000-square meter (270,000-square foot) battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturing and R&D facility that was opened in 2023. The facility includes equipment to ramp up to 6 GWh of energy storage manufacturing capacity and the ability to expand to up to 12 GWh in the future.

The Northvolt Dwa acquisition accelerates Lyten’s entry in the rapidly growing BESS market. The Gdańsk location will serve as a major EU hub for Lyten’s BESS manufacturing and will export products to countries throughout the EU and across the world. Lyten intends to initiate the restart process immediately and to produce first commercial units off the line prior to year-end 2025.

“The Northvolt Dwa facility in Gdańsk is a world-class asset servicing the rapidly growing and strategically important BESS market. As demand for electricity continues its rise throughout the world to support AI and economic development, distributed energy storage will become increasingly critical,” said Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and Co-Founder. “We are seeing demand from across the world and are restarting production immediately to begin fulfilling orders before the end of the year.”

Lyten acquired Northvolt’s BESS product portfolio and intellectual property in the third quarter 2025. The first product to be produced at Northvolt Dwa is the Voltpack Mobile System (VMS). The 3rd generation family of modular BESS products is optimized for the rapidly growing commercial, industrial, and evolving data center markets.

Robert Chryc-Gawrychowski was recently announced as CEO of Lyten Poland and will lead operations at Northvolt Dwa. Robert was previously CEO of Northvolt Poland and led Northvolt’s efforts in Poland through the planning, construction, and startup of Northvolt Dwa.

Robert stated, “BESS is now a critical technology for energy security and economic development, and it is increasingly important that Europe is able to manufacture batteries locally. We are appreciative of the support of this acquisition by the Polish government at the city, provincial and national level and for their shared enthusiasm for Gdańsk as an important BESS hub for Europe.”

Andrzej Domański, Poland Minister of Finance and Economy, stated, “Lyten’s operations in Gdańsk are part of a broader process of developing advanced energy technologies in Poland and across Europe. International cooperation in this field supports knowledge transfer, innovation, and the growth of local industrial expertise. We support projects that contribute to building a sustainable and competitive economy.”

Aleksandra Dulkiewicz, President of Gdańsk, added, “For Gdańsk, Lyten’s activities represent an opportunity to collaborate on the creation of energy innovation centers. We see many opportunities for cooperation – from research and development partnerships with universities, through pilot projects, to other activities aligned with Gdańsk’s development strategy and national and regional economic specializations.

On August 7th, Lyten announced binding agreements to acquire all remaining Northvolt operations in Sweden, Poland, and Germany, with manufacturing assets totaling approximately $5 billion in book value. Close of the remaining Sweden and Germany acquisitions are expected to continue through the 4Q 2025.

[TITLE]Lianhe Sowell International Group Enters into a Non-binding Term Sheet Regarding $105 Million International Funding to Establish the First AI Robot Manufacturing and R&D Base in UAE:
[TEXT]
Global Strategy Enters New Phase via Setting Up Middle East Headquarters​​

Dubai, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lianhe Sowell International Group Ltd. (the “Company”, NASDAQ: LHSW) today announced that it has signed a $105 million financing non-binding frame agreement (the “Term Sheet”) with Excellent Capital Investments (ECI), a European infrastructure investment fund. The potential proceeds will be used exclusively to establish the Company’s first artificial intelligence-powered robot manufacturing and research and development base in the United Arab Emirates (the “Project”), marking a significant step in Lianhe Sowell’s global intelligent manufacturing strategy.

Pursuant to the Term Sheet, total investment in the Project is estimated to be approximately $132.5 million. Lianhe Sowell will contribute 20% of the Project investment as cornerstone investment, while ECI will provide the remaining 80%, or $105 million in the form of structured senior secured credit support. The partnership underscores strong recognition from international capital markets of Lianhe Sowell’s technical expertise and global operational capabilities. The Term Sheet remains subject to due diligence, documentation, and final approval.

A New Chapter for Chinese High-End Manufacturing Expansion in UAE​

As a Nasdaq-listed provider of advanced manufacturing and AI solutions, Lianhe Sowell is committed to driving innovation in intelligent manufacturing, robotic automation, and AI-enabled industrial applications.

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
