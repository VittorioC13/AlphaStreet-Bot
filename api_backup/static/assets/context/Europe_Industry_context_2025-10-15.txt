AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -The Dutch government has taken control of Chinese-owned computer chipmaker Nexperia, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing as a global fight brews over technology intellectual property, especially around semiconductors.

The government said late on Sunday that it has intervened in Nijmegen-headquartered Nexperia, which manufactures chips for cars and consumer electronics. It cited worries

The Netherlands has nationalized chipmaker Nexperia amid growing global trade tensions

The Dutch government has taken control of a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, citing risk to the EU’s economic and technological security. The firm called the move “excessive,” saying it complied with all relevant laws and regulations.

The Netherlands Economy Ministry revealed late on Sunday that it had invoked a never-before-used emergency law to take control of manufacturer Nexperia, owned by China’s Wingtech Technology.

Once part of Dutch electronics group Philips, Nexperia specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in the automotive, consumer electronics, and other industries.

Amsterdam said it wanted to prevent a situation in which Nexperia’s chips could “become unavailable in an emergency” which “could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”

The Dutch government called the move “highly exceptional,” citing “recent and acute signals of serious governance shortcomings and actions” within the company.

Wingtech shares tumbled 10% in Shanghai on Monday, forcing a halt in trading after hitting the daily limit.

The tech firm decried the Dutch government’s move as “excessive intervention driven by geopolitical bias, rather than a fact-based risk assessment,” according to a now-deleted WeChat post, which was archived by the Chinese policy blog Pekingnology. Wingtech said it would take actions to protect its rights and would seek government support.

The company later said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange that its control over Nexperia would be temporarily restricted due to the Dutch order and court rulings affecting decision-making and operational efficiency.

The Dutch takeover of Nexperia comes at a time of escalating global trade tensions. Over the past year, China and the EU have clashed over what the bloc claims is Beijing’s dumping of certain key goods and its industrial overproduction. China has accused the EU of protectionism.

Last week, China tightened its restrictions on the export of rare earth elements and magnets, a step that could further hurt the EU’s struggling auto industry.

[TITLE]Blink Charging UK Selected by Bradford Council to Support Expansion of Public EV Charging Infrastructure:
[TEXT]
Bowie, MD, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ: BLNK) (“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading global owner operator, and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, today announced its wholly owned subsidiary, Blink Charging UK Ltd., has been selected by Bradford Council to deliver 104 EV charging ports as part of the first phase of the Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) program across the district.

Financed in part by £282,000 in government funding secured by the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA) through the LEVI program, the initiative will see up to 1,000 new EV chargers installed at more than 230 sites throughout Bradford over the next two years. The rollout will prioritize locations where access to charging is currently limited, including on-street and off-street chargers and ensure improved provision for drivers with accessibility needs. The chargers will be installed, owned, and operated by Blink, and managed through the Blink Charging app.

Bradford’s EV charging expansion is part of a wider West Yorkshire initiative to develop the region’s charging network and support the transition to cleaner transport. By widening access to reliable, affordable charging close to home, work and leisure destinations, the Council aims to accelerate EV adoption while improving air quality and delivering a more sustainable transport system for its residents.

“Bradford is making impactful changes by helping to make it easier for people to charge their EVs close to home, work, and on the road,” said Alex Calnan, Managing Director of Europe for Blink Charging. “Blink is proud to be working with the Council to be part of this significant investment in the city’s future. Expanding Bradford’s charging network will give drivers the confidence to make the switch to EVs, helping to accelerate the adoption of electric transport.”

“Bradford Council is committed to ensuring residents and visitors have access to affordable, reliable charging options,” said Councillor Sarah Ferriby, Bradford Council’s Executive Member for Healthy People and Places. “This first phase of the LEVI program will provide new charge points across the district with no financial impact on the Council’s budget, as the scheme is fully funded through national grants. Expanding this network will help meet growing demand and make EV ownership a more practical choice for people across the district.”

The LEVI fund was introduced to help drive the expansion of EV charging networks throughout the UK by supporting local authorities in installing public charging stations. By bridging the gap between national net-zero goals and practical EV adoption, LEVI is designed to make sustainable transport more accessible and convenient for communities across the country. The Bradford deployment builds on the LEVI fund’s mission to ensure that drivers without off-street parking are never far from a charging point.

“It’s fantastic to have Blink on board as we make it easier for people to switch to electric vehicles,” said Tracy Brabin, Mayor of West Yorkshire. “These new charge points closer to home will bring huge benefits to people without off-street parking and contribute to improving air quality in our communities. Investing in safe, reliable and easy-to-use chargers is vital in helping us build a greener, better-connected West Yorkshire that works for everyone.”

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:

Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defense, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world's cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world's lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60%–70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union—long-term trading partners with African nations—have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa's resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa's position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasize local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa's critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another "resource curse."

The emerging 'New World Order'

A Chinese-led "New World Order" is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organizations. The initiative has expanded China's access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent
