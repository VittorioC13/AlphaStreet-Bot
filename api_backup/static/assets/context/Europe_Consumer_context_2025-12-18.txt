She currently stars on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills which debuted on Bravo on December 4.

Zoe’s keen style eye and commercial appeal spawned a series of strategic brand collaborations including The Rachel Zoe Collection, which launched in 2011 with its first ready-to-wear line, and has since grown into a lifestyle brand including apparel, home, fragrance, eyewear, and children’s and baby products.

Gordon Brothers will drive further growth of the successful enterprise by strategically developing the licensing business to expand product categories, experiences and distribution points.

“The Rachel Zoe brand has a great foundation and we look forward to leveraging our expertise to expand categories to bring new products and experiences to the end consumer,” said Carolyn D’Angelo, Senior Managing Director, Head of Brand Operations at Gordon Brothers.

[TITLE]Worthington Enterprises Agrees to Acquire Leading Metal Roof Components Manufacturer LSI Group:
[TEXT]
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Worthington Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: WOR), a designer and manufacturer of market-leading brands that improve everyday life by elevating spaces and experiences, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire LSI Group, LLC (LSI) of Logansport, Indiana. LSI, which includes market-leading brands BPD, Logan Stampings, LSI Metal Fabrication and Roof Hugger®, is one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of standing seam metal roof clips and retrofit components in the commercial metal roof market.

Worthington Enterprises plans to purchase LSI Group for approximately $205 million with cash on hand and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility. The transaction is expected to close in January 2026, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

Joe Hayek, president and chief executive officer, Worthington Enterprises, said, “The addition of LSI will further strengthen our Building Products portfolio and deepen engagement with customers across the entire building envelope. A leading U.S. manufacturer in a niche market, LSI has built an exceptional reputation for superior quality, industry-leading lead times and outstanding service backed by long-term customer relationships. Those relationships—and LSI’s people-first culture—align with our own values and commitment to supporting our customers and employees. We’re very much looking forward to welcoming them to our team.”

Demand for resilient, energy-efficient and durable roofing systems is expected to continue growing as building owners prioritize stronger, code-compliant structures in response to evolving weather patterns and manage rising energy costs and aging commercial building infrastructure, especially as roofs built during the early 2000s construction boom are now reaching the end of their service life. Common applications are industrial and manufacturing facilities, retail buildings, academic and municipal structures, hospitality, data centers, and recreation and mixed-use spaces. Standing seam metal roof clips, which act as concealed anchors, secure each metal roof panel to the underlying roof substrate. A new 10,000-square-foot roof requires approximately 8,000 – 10,000 metal roof clips.

LSI serves the retrofit market with the Roof Hugger brand of metal sub-purlins used to attach a new roof on top of an existing roof. Compared to full replacements, retrofitting with a metal roof lowers installation costs, improves energy efficiency, enhances code compliance, minimizes disruption during installation and increases sustainability.

Jimmy Bowes, president, Building Products, Worthington Enterprises, said, “LSI has earned its leadership position in the commercial metal roofing market through precision manufacturing, advanced automation and deep engineering expertise. Their U.S.-based production delivers consistent quality and the industry’s fastest lead times, while their customer-first mindset ensures responsive service and dependable support. We believe the business is well positioned with new construction and retrofit solutions to help OEMs and installers build stronger, longer-lasting structures that protect people and property for generations to come.”

LSI has two manufacturing locations in Logansport where it was founded in 1968 as Logan Stampings. Robert Baker, owner and president, LSI Group, LLC, purchased Logan Stampings in 2004 and grew the business through innovation, acquisition and prioritizing relationships. He will continue as a leader of the LSI business as part of Worthington Enterprises.

Baker said, “Joining Worthington Enterprises marks an exciting new era for LSI Group. Together, we’ll accelerate innovation, expand our reach and deliver even greater value to customers across the building envelope. This partnership opens doors to new opportunities for our employees and strengthens our ability to invest in Logansport, which has been our home for more than 50 years. We’re not just preserving what we’ve built—we’re amplifying it. With Worthington’s scale and shared vision, LSI is positioned to magnify value for all stakeholders and continue leading in commercial metal roofing solutions.”

Bowes concluded, “Robert has built an outstanding business throughout the last 20-plus years with phenomenal people who share our values, prioritize people, champion innovation and achieve ambitious goals. We are excited to welcome them to our team.”

Other products from Worthington Enterprises supporting critical infrastructure for the building envelope include building systems such as HVAC components, architectural and acoustical grid ceilings and metal framing and accessories, along with cylinders and tanks for heating and cooling, construction and water applications.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor and Vorys is serving as legal counsel to Worthington Enterprises. Bellmark Partners LLC and Calfee are advising LSI Group.

[TITLE]The Children’s Place Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
SECAUCUS, N.J., Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Children’s Place, Inc. (Nasdaq: PLCE), one of the only pure-play children’s specialty retailers in North America with an omni-channel portfolio of brands and an industry-leading digital-first model, today announced financial results for the Company’s third fiscal quarter ended November 1, 2025.

Muhammad Umair, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “Our third quarter results reflect the challenges we are experiencing in our ecommerce business, with periods of high volatility as we implement our strategic transformation. Separately, our marketing efficiency was also impeded during the quarter in our transition to a new marketing agency and a heightened promotional strategy. Our new operating model envisions an increased physical store presence, and a merchandising reset that adds a more balanced mix of fashion and basics to our product assortment. Our brick-and-mortar business capitalized on its momentum from our second quarter and generated a 2% growth in comparable sales, and as we continue to invest in our real estate portfolio with operational and financial discipline, our new stores are generating results that are outperforming the rest of the fleet. We believe our increased store base will strengthen our omni-channel proposition to our customers that love to experience our beloved brands, both in-store or online.”

Mr. Umair continued, “We opened five new stores during the third quarter, with another 11 store openings slated for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we plan to open an additional 15 to 20 new stores in the first half of fiscal year 2026, ahead of our critical back-to-school season to drive revenue growth and profitability, with more store openings in the back-half of fiscal year 2026 and beyond. We also plan to refresh our store layouts, and in conjunction with our revamped My Place Rewards loyalty program, we are excited for the enhanced experience this will create for our new and existing customer file.”

Financing Update

John Szczepanski, Chief Financial Officer said, “We’re also pleased to announce that we have successfully completed the refinancing of a $350 million asset-based lending credit facility with Wells Fargo, supplemented by a $100 million FILO term loan with SLR Credit Solutions. The five-year financing transactions increase our maximum borrowing capacity by up to $17 million and improve our liquidity position by $35 million to $40 million on a proforma basis as of the end of the third quarter. The new financing arrangement will provide us with additional capital to implement our growth strategies, thus strengthening our financial position and balance sheet, and helping to generate long-term shareholder value with the support of our financing partners.”

[TITLE]What’s up with… Private networks, 6G-XR, UK altnet M&A:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: The UK’s Port of Tyne is very happy with the private 5G network dished up by BT and Ericsson; a quarter of 6G-XR consortium partners have made headway with some next-gen communications services; UK altnet Lit Fibre sells its retail customer base to Zen; and much more!

Howay the lads! The Port of Tyne, a 24/7 deep-sea gateway on England’s north-east coast, has reported that very significant operational benefits have accrued from a year of using Ericsson Private 5G. The port is big and busy and the private 5G network underpins real-time video analytics, sensor-driven processes and connected machinery. The port authorities say the network is very reliable and robust and has transformed a range of complex industrial operations and has boosted digital innovation whilst improving safety in what is always a potentially dangerous environment. The port covers both the northern and southern banks of the River Tyne and now depends on connected vehicles, machinery and video-driven processes. Traditional wireless technologies were simply not up to the job of providing the scale and reliability necessary, especially in situations so dynamic that operational layouts change several times a year. The private 5G network runs over BT Group spectrum and Ericsson’s on-site core and radio infrastructure. Over the course of 2025, it has supported many uses including live container scanning (once a tedious and labour-intensive process), the monitoring of personal protective equipment for staff safety, restricted-area incursion detection, road-condition analysis, emissions monitoring and high-security access control via video and sensors. Vehicle-mounted cameras, connected to an “AI engine”, help identify small road defects before they grow into big potholes. Meanwhile, drones are used for stock control and infrastructure inspection. Impressively, and probably quite scarily, when seen in action, the port is working with the heavy equipment corporation Caterpillar, to connect it to the CatCommand system that manages remote-controlled shovels in ships’ holds (which are extremely dangerous locations for humans). Tamsin Warren, the head of technology and transformation at Port of Tyne, in a glowing testimonial for private 5G, commented: “After a full year of operating on private 5G, we’ve seen firsthand how reliable wireless connectivity strengthens our day-to-day operations. From safety-critical activities to logistical environments, the network has given us consistent, real-time visibility across our whole site. It’s helping our teams to work more safely and make better decisions with the live data to move us forward to becoming one of the UK’s smartest and greenest ports.” (By the way, for those of you not familiar with the Geordie dialect, “Howay the lads” means “Come on chaps, let’s get going!”) Private 5G networks are increasingly popular, as we have reported elsewhere this week – see Private 4G/5G sector set for 22% growth – report.

Some of the consortium partners involved in the European project 6G-XR (6G eXperimental Research infrastructure to enable next-generation extended reality, XR, services) have shared some recent progress. “Researchers from four key partners – the i2CAT Research Centre, Ericsson, Vicomtech and Capgemini – have successfully validated two challenging use cases on the project’s infrastructure,” stated Capgemini in this announcement. The first use case, developed specifically by Ericsson and the i2CAT Research Centre, focused on ‘real-time holographic communications’, “a technology that promises to transform remote interaction,” noted the partners. “Ericsson and i2CAT delivered a live holographic communication session using i2CAT’s HoloMIT system [between] Barcelona and Madrid. The demo emphasised two key innovations designed to maintain holographic call quality, ensuring the conversation is never cut short, even under challenging network conditions”, namely “Proactive Congestion Detection” and “Intelligent Traffic Prioritisation”, which make use of the Camara Quality on Demand (QoD) network API. The second use case, developed by all four partners, focused on ‘optimising XR services: Automated edge selection for the best experience’, which “highlighted how XR services can automatically select the optimal edge node across the Barcelona–Madrid edge continuum.” The partners concluded: “Together, the two demonstrations show how network intelligence, edge discovery, and application-level adaptability will truly shape the future of XR and holography. Holographic calls remain stable even under congestion, thanks to proactive detection and QoD prioritsation. Furthermore, XR services will transparently select the best edge node, using standardised APIs and advanced rendering technology. These outcomes mark an important step toward making XR and holography deployable at scale in future 6G networks.” The 6G-XR project has received funding from the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) under the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme.

The latest consolidation move in the UK’s still over-crowded fibre broadband altnet sector once again involves Lit Fibre, which sold its network infrastructure (for an undisclosed sum) to the UK’s biggest alternative wholesale fibre access network operator, CityFibre, in March 2024. The Lit Fibre team had retained its retail broadband service operations and customer base after selling its underlying network, but now that customer base has been sold to one of the UK’s most established ISPs, Zen Internet (again for an undisclosed sum). Lit Fibre notes on its website FAQ section that its board took a “strategic decision” to “exit the UK broadband market” and that it opted to sell the customer relationships to Zen because the two companies “are highly aligned on values: Transparency, premium service and customer-first operations”. Lit Fibre customers will be transferred to Zen by early February next year. It has not been disclosed how many customers Lit Fibre is transferring to Zen.

Liberty Networks, a unit of regional operator Liberty Latin America, has been selected by El Salvador’s telecom regulator SIGET (General Superintendence of Electricity and Telecommunications) to construct and deploy the country’s first submarine cable. The 1,800km subsea network will connect El Salvador to “major international hubs” via Panama and is expected to be operational by the second half of 2028. A technology partner for the deployment will be announced soon. “This landmark project will strengthen El Salvador’s digital infrastructure, expand bandwidth capacity, and enhance the country’s connectivity resiliency,” stated Liberty Networks in this announcement. “Today, the country relies exclusively on land-based links with neighbouring nations and has no direct international subsea connections. The new system represents a critical leap forward, delivering improved reliability, greater capacity and enhanced access for El Salvador’s 6.3 million citizens,” it added.

Neobank Revolut has expanded its European mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) operations to Poland, integrating eSIM capabilities from Dutch firm 1Global into its multiservice app, the partners have announced. Revolut has also launched pilot MVNO services in the UK and Germany. Hadi Nasrallah, Revolut’s general manager for telco, stated: “Revolut Mobile is more than just another mobile service, it’s a truly differentiated alternative designed to change the industry. Our goal is simple: Offer the best service, at the best price, leveraging the best user experience. We’re bringing true innovation with features, such as multiple numbers and global messaging, while removing any hassle or hidden fees from the process.”

A new cross-industry survey from Bloomberg Intelligence reveals that of 604 C-suite executives from the nine industrial sectors surveyed in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific (excluding China), 34% are very worried that pressure to introduce AI to their organisations might result in massive disruption, while 40% admit their concerns are ”high”. The Bloomberg Intelligence C-Suite AI Survey 2025 found that all nine sectors – software & IT services, financial services, consumer goods & retail, pharmaceuticals, hospitals, industrials, media & cable, automotive, and telecommunications – rate AI disruption as a significant risk to their industry, with 34% regarding it as “very high” and 40% as “high”. That said, most believe the threat is greater to their industry overall (80%) than it is to their own organisation (69%). Interestingly, protecting market position rather than relying on promised but elusive growth is the primary motivation behind current AI investments, with 36% of respondents to the survey citing AI as their top priority and another 47% listing it as one of their top-three priorities. Notably, software and media companies are in the vanguard of these, introducing and dealing with the realities of AI. The respondents also ranked the importance of various objectives of their AI strategy, including improving operational efficiency (47%), boosting revenue generation (21%) and reducing headcount (13%). Most executives also expect AI to boost sales growth by 7% over the next three years, as well as contributing to cutting costs. The survey also reports that “as AI infrastructure availability ranks among the top-three concerns across industries” it runs “contrary to narratives of datacentre overbuilding” and “challenges fears of an AI infrastructure bubble”. That one sounds like wishful thinking. We’ll all find out over the course of 2026 whether AI will pop or not.

[TITLE]Bulgaria joins the Euro: Changes coming to northern Greece in property, tourism, business, and consumerism:
[TEXT]
Newsroom December 16 10:40

The move is expected to bring significant changes to Northern Greece, affecting real estate markets, tourism, cross-border business activity, and the popular practice of weekend shopping trips. Despite the resignation of Rosen Zhelyazkov’s government last Thursday, January 1, 2026, it remains a historic milestone for Bulgaria and its citizens. In less than 20 days, the neighboring country will adopt the euro at a fixed exchange rate of 1 euro to 1.95583 leva. This development is not expected to be affected by Bulgaria’s prolonged political instability, which has seen seven elections over the past four years.

A year earlier, Bulgaria—along with Romania—joined the Schengen Area amid nationwide celebrations. That move significantly facilitated travel to and from Greece, making the Bulgarian market even more attractive to Greek consumers due to lower fuel prices and cheaper basic goods. It also boosted tourism flows in both directions and triggered a strong wave of Bulgarian investment in Greek real estate, particularly in Central and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.

Key questions

The adoption of the euro—whose banknotes will now also bear the word “Евро” in Cyrillic—signals several positive developments: a strengthening of the Bulgarian economy (still the weakest in the EU), easier access to international capital, lower borrowing costs, compliance with European fiscal rules, and the elimination of currency risk, creating a safer investment environment.

At the same time, it raises crucial questions, especially for Greece. How will bilateral economic and trade relations be affected? Will they strengthen or weaken, and at what cost to each side?

There are also everyday concerns. Will Greeks continue their weekend trips across the border to fill car trunks with cheap goods and fuel tanks with significantly cheaper petrol, draining the Greek market? Will Bulgarian winter resorts such as Bansko remain popular with Greek tourists? And conversely, will Bulgarians continue to invest heavily in homes along the beaches and islands of Northern Greece, creating small “Bulgarian Rivieras” in some areas?

Market outlook

Clear answers are hard to come by. Political instability and weak governance in Bulgaria remain major risks, as they encourage speculation, lax oversight and market distortions. Stability will be crucial—but it is unclear when it will materialize.

Still, markets often operate independently of politics. As long as the adoption of the euro does not lead to sudden price hikes in Bulgaria, major changes to the current situation are not expected. Border cities are likely to remain crowded with Greek shoppers, especially on weekends. Over time, however, price convergence may gradually reduce this flow.

Cheap fuel remains a major draw

Travel to Bulgaria remains inexpensive, largely due to fuel prices. As of December 1, 2025, the price of unleaded petrol (95 octane) stood at €1.21 per liter in Bulgaria, compared with an average of €1.765 per liter in Greece—a difference of €0.55 per liter. Filling a 50-liter tank costs

(1) Refer to the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions” section of this release for additional information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.

Consolidated Quarterly Results

Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 increased $53.4 million, or 19.5%, over the prior year quarter to $327.5 million, driven by higher volumes within Building Products, including contributions from Elgen Manufacturing (“Elgen”), which was acquired on June 18, 2025.

Operating income increased $8.7 million to $12.3 million, driven by higher volumes within Building Products, compared to $3.5 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring and other expense, operating income increased $7.8 million in the quarter to $13.9 million.

Miscellaneous (income) expense was unfavorable by $4.2 million, primarily due to the divestment of the company’s 49% interest in the Sustainable Energy Solutions (“SES”) joint venture’s composite business on October 16, 2025, and the related mark-to-market loss on the securities received as consideration.

Equity income decreased $5.4 million over the prior year quarter to $29.1 million, on lower contributions from ClarkDietrich, which were down $5.6 million, partially offset by higher contributions from WAVE, which were up $1.7 million.

Income tax expense was $8.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to $9.1 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by lower pre-tax earnings. Tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 reflects an estimated annual effective rate of 24.1% in both the current and prior year quarter.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

The company ended the quarter with cash of $180.3 million, a decrease of $69.8 million from May 31, 2025, primarily driven by the purchase of Elgen. During the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company generated operating cash flow of $51.5 million, of which $12.4 million was invested in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $39.1 million, up from $33.9 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures in the current year quarter included approximately $5.8 million related to ongoing facility modernization projects.

Total debt at quarter end was $305.3 million, consisting entirely of long-term debt, an increase of $2.4 million from May 31, 2025, primarily due to the remeasurement of the company’s euro denominated notes. The company had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility as of November 30, 2025, leaving $500.0 million available for future use.

Quarterly Segment Results

Consumer Products generated net sales of $119.9 million in the current year quarter, an increase of $3.2 million, or 2.7%, over the prior year quarter, driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat at $15.3 million, as the impact of favorable product mix was offset by higher conversion costs and slightly lower volumes.

Building Products generated net sales of $207.5 million in the current year quarter, an increase of $50.2 million, or 31.9%, over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher overall volume, including contributions from Elgen. Adjusted EBITDA increased $5.8 million to $53.0 million, primarily due to volume growth in the wholly owned businesses, partially offset by lower overall contributions of equity income.

Outlook

“Across the company, we remain focused on delivering for our customers, investing in opportunities that fit our strategy and advancing the long-term value of Worthington Enterprises,” Hayek said. “As we enter the back half of our fiscal year, which is typically a seasonally stronger period, we are excited

That move significantly facilitated travel to and from Greece, making the Bulgarian market even more attractive to Greek consumers due to lower fuel prices and cheaper basic goods. It also boosted tourism flows in both directions and triggered a strong wave of Bulgarian investment in Greek real estate, particularly in Central and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.

Key questions

The adoption of the euro—whose banknotes will now also bear the word “Евро” in Cyrillic—signals several positive developments: a strengthening of the Bulgarian economy (still the weakest in the EU), easier access to international capital, lower borrowing costs, compliance with European fiscal rules, and the elimination of currency risk, creating a safer investment environment.

At the same time, it raises crucial questions, especially for Greece. How will bilateral economic and trade relations be affected? Will they strengthen or weaken, and at what cost to each side?

There are also everyday concerns. Will Greeks continue their weekend trips across the border to fill car trunks with cheap goods and fuel tanks with significantly cheaper petrol, draining the Greek market? Will Bulgarian winter resorts such as Bansko remain popular with Greek tourists? And conversely, will Bulgarians continue to invest heavily in homes along the beaches and islands of Northern Greece, creating small “Bulgarian Rivieras” in some areas?

Market outlook

Clear answers are hard to come by. Political instability and weak governance in Bulgaria remain major risks, as they encourage speculation, lax oversight and market distortions. Stability will be crucial—but it is unclear when it will materialize.

Still, markets often operate independently of politics. As long as the adoption of the euro does not lead to sudden price hikes in Bulgaria, major changes to the current situation are not expected. Border cities are likely to remain crowded with Greek shoppers, especially on weekends. Over time, however, price convergence may gradually reduce this flow.

Cheap fuel remains a major draw

Travel to Bulgaria remains inexpensive, largely due to fuel prices. As of December 1, 2025, the price of unleaded petrol (95 octane) stood at €1.21 per liter in Bulgaria, compared with an average of €1.765 per liter in Greece—a difference of €0.55 per liter. Filling a 50-liter tank costs

[TITLE]The Irish Times view on the cost of living: transparency for consumers is vital:
[TEXT]
The old saying that “light is the best disinfectant” is useful in many areas, not least when it comes to safeguarding consumers. Ireland is one of the most expensive countries in the euro zone and while this reflects in part the strength of the economy and a relatively small and dispersed population, there are many areas where questions remain.

One is electricity where even experts in the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) say it is difficult to understand why prices here have not fallen as fast as elsewhere in the EU and why the gap between wholesale and retail prices seems abnormally high. Ireland has been consistently among the highest cost countries for electricity for consumers in recent years and the most expensive for businesses, according to Eurostat figures.

There are reasons why prices here are relatively high, including our reliance on imported gas to produce electricity and the mechanism through which prices are set. But as consumers are told that prices are going to increase again to fund major – and essential – investment in the network, they need clarity on what is contributing to high prices and, crucially, on the outlook for the years ahead and the promise that renewable energy will reduce prices .

While the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities may not see this as a central part of its role, it would seem the appropriate body to provide this kind of information, perhaps alongside the Department of Energy where Minister Darragh O’Brien has asked civil servants to look at the issue.

The same principles apply in other areas, too. The Government has decided to give more powers to the agri-food regulator to oblige firms across the supply chain to give it information to inform its work. Previous attempts to study the supply chain for eggs and horticultural products fell apart as some companies would not provide the relevant data. This is important not only to protect consumers but also to ensure that big retailers or distributors are not using market power to unfairly squeeze primary producers.

Meanwhile, in the insurance sector the latest Central Bank report on liability claims contains information which allows an informed debate on claims, costs and premiums and provides clear guidance to consumers that they are generally better to seek redress for a claim through the Injuries Redress Board (IRB) rather than going to court. While the latter leads on average to a higher award, the impact of legal costs means that the IRB route generally leaves the claimants better off.

This kind of information is powerful for consumers , whose interests all too often take second place in policymaking. The Government would do well to look at other areas of notably high prices which ensure that Ireland is such a high cost economy. Transparency can achieve a lot.

[TITLE]Supermarket price gouging will be banned from July. Will consumers actually end up better off?:
[TEXT]
This week, the federal government announced a ban on supermarket price gouging, aiming to get “a fairer go for families in their weekly shop”.

From July 1 2026, the new supermarket regulations will ban very large retailers (those with revenue of more than A$30 billion per year) from charging prices that are:

excessive when compared to the cost of the supply plus a reasonable margin.

Coles and Woolworths are currently the only two supermarkets big enough to meet this definition of “very large” and therefore face these new regulations.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) final report after its major inquiry into the supermarket sector was released in March. It found they were among the most profitable supermarkets in the world.

However, it did not directly accuse them of price gouging. So, what’s actually changing under the new regulations? And could it lead to lower prices for Australians at the checkout?

What’s changing?

Price gouging – setting prices at a level far higher than people think is reasonable – isn’t currently illegal for businesses in Australia.

The ACCC will enforce the new rules, which form part of the now-mandatory Food and Grocery Code of Conduct. The penalty per contravention for breaching the new laws will be the highest of:

$10 million

three times the benefit derived

10% of turnover during the preceding 12 months.

But both Coles and Woolworths were quick to voice their opposition to the new regulations, arguing they could drive up costs and cause consumers to miss out on deals.

Who decides prices?

To price their products, supermarkets consider a wide range of costs for supply, manufacturing, transportation and distribution, warehousing and storage.

They also have to factor in labour, rent and inventory costs that are involved at every step of the supply chain.

Under the new regulations, pricing will have to reflect supply costs and a “reasonable” margin. This will require supermarkets and the regulator to accurately track and determine supply chain costs.

Why tracking costs is tricky

This could prove a challenging task. Supermarkets deal with thousands of products. They have hundreds of different local and international suppliers, manufacturers and logistics service providers.

The supermarket supply chain has several stages. This includes the first tier of direct suppliers, second tier (which supplies the first) and the third tier (which supplies the second).

On many occasions, suppliers beyond the first tier remain invisible and potentially responsible for contributing to supply chain costs. It is a challenging task to factor them accurately into the product costings.

Supermarket supply chains are also dynamic. Operational costs vary significantly across time and different locations.

Other challenges

Many other factors in the supply chain influence pricing. These include logistics, disruptions, waste, operational inefficiencies, high labour costs, marketing strategies, insurance and adoption of technologies.

The main challenge is these factors are always changing, which can make it hard to determine their accurate contributions to the pricing.

The ACCC may need extra resources, including a sophisticated price reporting and monitoring system, to make it work. Supermarkets, manufacturers, suppliers and logistics providers will need to report supply chain cost data regularly.

A significant effort will also be required to ensure data integrity and accuracy in the reporting system.

A shifting approach

The supermarket price gouging ban is more than just a new enforcement issue for the ACCC. It also represents a broader shift in how Australia approaches competition and consumer protection.

Under Australia’s existing legal framework, high prices alone are not unlawful. Australian competition law focuses on protecting the competitive process rather than regulating price levels directly.

For example, cartel rules prohibit price fixing and other forms of collusion between competitors. And resale price maintenance rules prevent suppliers from controlling resale prices charged by downstream businesses.

In both cases, the law targets anti-competitive coordination, not the level of prices themselves.

Consumer law similarly protects consumers through consumer guarantees and rules against misleading or deceptive conduct, unconscionable conduct and unfair contract terms, rather than regulating profit margins themselves.

Comparison with overseas

The current policy in Australia broadly reflects international practice. In the United States, federal anti-trust law does not prohibit firms from charging high prices, even where they have substantial market power, if there isn’t anti-competitive conduct such as collusion. Enforcement focuses on conduct rather than price levels themselves.

The European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom take a more interventionist, but still cautious, approach. EU competition law allows action against excessive pricing by firms with a dominant market position, but such cases are rare.

How might the ban affect competition?

On one hand, closer scrutiny of pricing may limit the ability of large supermarkets to sustain margins that are persistently disconnected from costs.

Greater transparency may also help address public concern in a highly concentrated grocery sector, as highlighted in ACCC market studies.

At the same time, competition authorities and economists have long warned direct price regulation carries risks. High prices do not necessarily indicate market failure. Poorly targeted interventions can weaken incentives to compete, discount or innovate.

Will consumers actually end up better off?

In the short term, stronger oversight may place downward pressure on prices where margins are clearly out of step with costs. However, price regulation alone does not guarantee sustained lower prices.

If retailers adopt more cautious or uniform pricing strategies to manage regulatory risk, price competition could weaken rather than intensify.

Competition law does not promise low prices at all times. It aims to deliver competitive prices over time through rivalry and market entry. Consumers are therefore most likely to benefit if the price gouging ban operates alongside broader competition and supply-side reforms, rather than as a standalone mechanism.

Indian garment manufacturer CTA Apparels has applauded the Government of India's encouraging progress on the India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA), with the blueprint now in advanced stages.Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal confirmed that negotiations have been "very positive," with both sides showing readiness to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement soon.The European Union is India's second-largest apparel export destination, accounting for nearly 27 per cent of India's garment exports, valued at over USD 7.5 billion annually.Currently, Indian apparel products face import duties ranging from 8 per cent to 12 per cent in the EU--tariffs that key competitors such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Turkey do not face due to preferential trade arrangements.A well-structured India-EU FTA could significantly narrow this competitive gap by reducing or eliminating tariffs, thereby enabling Indian exporters to offer more price-competitive, value-added products in Europe, CTA Apparels said in a statement."This move is expected to boost India's apparel exports by an estimated 20-25% over the next three years, according to industry trade projections," the statement added.Additionally, the agreement's focus on rules of origin, market access, sustainability, and technical standards will help in creating a predictable and stable environment for long-term investments in the textile value chain.For responsible and sustainability-driven manufacturers, the FTA presents an opportunity to scale global partnerships and strengthen India's presence in premium European markets. Mukesh Kansal , Chairman, CTA Apparels, said, "The progress on the India-EU FTA is a welcome development for India's apparel sector. The European Union is one of our most important partners, and a fair, forward-looking trade agreement will unlock new opportunities for growth, technology adoption, and sustainable value creation. CTA Apparels stands fully aligned with India's vision of strengthening global trade partnerships rooted in quality, transparency, and innovation."A 40-member European Union negotiating team was in New Delhi earlier this month, marking the most intensive phase of the India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) discussions, aimed initially at concluding it by the end of this year.India-EU FTA talks were relaunched in 2022.
