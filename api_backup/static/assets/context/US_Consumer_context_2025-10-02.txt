[TITLE]Expect to pay more for furniture, home remodels with new tariffs set to kick in:
[TEXT]
U.S. to impose new tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, some furniture, trucks

Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.

Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and "associated products," plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.

Preventing what he called the "flooding" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. "It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process," Mr. Trump wrote.

Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture — much of which is imported — rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025, the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists. Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.

If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.

"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs," Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. "People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits."

Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.

Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fernández. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.

"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place," she told CBS News. "They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase."

The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.

Uncertainty persists

From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.

"Retailers' only certainty is that uncertainty is here to stay. What's true today very well may not be true tomorrow and that makes life incredibly challenging," he said.

Naturepedic, an Ohio-based maker of organic mattresses and bedroom furniture, said it had been planning to launch an upholstered product line in late 2025 or early 2026, including headboards. However, as of Thursday, it is reconsidering that expansion.

"We are having to go back to the drawing board a little bit," Naturepedic Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told CBS News. "We might drop it if it doesn't make sense, even though we're pretty far along in the process."

Of the tariffs announced on Thursday, he said, "If they could turn around and not do it, that would be great."

Cost to consumers

John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight Research, a provider of retail industry insights, doesn't expect all manufacturers to pass on all tariff-related costs to the consumer, and says some will likely take steps to mitigate the impact.

Firms with larger inventories will be able to sell through what they have in stock before implementing any price hikes, while on-demand furniture makers may have to raise prices sooner, rather than later, he said.

Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.

Mercer, however, doesn't expect the levies to compel makers of upholstered furniture and cabinetry to quickly move production to the U.S.

"Generally, that's not easy, and it's more expensive," he said. "There is a reason why companies have offshored production, and that's because because it's traditionally much cheaper."

[TITLE]Nike stock rises 5% as earnings, sales top forecasts, company continues progress with turnaround:
[TEXT]
Nike (NKE) reported its fiscal first quarter results on Tuesday after market close. Its results beat expectations as the sneaker giant navigates a major turnaround strategy under CEO Elliott Hill, who took the helm last fall, and President Trump's tariffs.

Nike stock rose around 5% in Wednesday's trading session.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 compared to Wall Street analyst estimates for $0.28, according to data from Bloomberg. Revenue increased 1% year over year to $11.7. billion, higher than $11.02 billion that was expected. Revenue fell 1% over the prior year when adjusted for currency impacts.

Revenue for its direct-to-consumer business, Nike Direct, decreased 4% to $4.5 billion, compared to an expected drop of 8.3% from a year ago to $4.3 billion. It does not expect to see growth in the segment this fiscal year.

Wholesale revenue was up 7% to $6.8 billion; Wall Street analysts forecast a drop of roughly 8% to $6.3 billion. These marked improvements from the 14% and 9% declines reported in the prior quarters, and the company now expects modest growth this fiscal year.

[TITLE]From PepsiCo to Taco Bell, dirty soda is taking over:
[TEXT]
In this article PEP Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Utah-based drink chain Swig coined "dirty soda" back in 2010. Fifteen years later, the trend is fueling innovation everywhere from PepsiCo to McDonald's , infusing the sluggish beverage category with new life. "Dirty soda" drinks use pop as a base, followed by flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients. While Swig claims credit — and the trademark — for dirty soda, TikTok videos and the reality TV show "The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives" have helped the trend spread far and wide, outpacing even the soda chain's speedy expansion. Now, consumers can find it nearly everywhere, from grocery store aisles to fast-food chains. In a few weeks, Pepsi plans to unveil two ready-to-drink dirty soda-inspired beverages at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show in Chicago. The new drinks, the Dirty Dew and the Mug Floats Vanilla Howler, follow on the heels of the Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream flavor, which hit shelves earlier this year. "I think it's a great opportunity for people like us, like PepsiCo, and for consumers to experience soda in a new way — and in some ways, an old way," Pepsi Beverages North America Chief Marketing Officer Mark Kirkham told CNBC, comparing the rise of dirty soda to root beer floats and the soda shops of yore.

Dirty soda has also drawn new interest beyond beverage players. According to Datassential, 2.7% of U.S. eateries offer a carbonated soft drink that includes cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago. Newcomers to the trend include TGI Fridays, which launched dirty soda as a limited-time menu item this summer that could be spiked with alcohol. McDonald's is testing flavored sodas, like a "Sprite Lunar Splash," at more than 500 locations after winding down its drinks-focused spinoff CosMc's in June. Yum Brands' Taco Bell has also been offering limited-time menu items, like a dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast.

Swig sets a trend

These days, Swig has grown to more than 140 locations across 16 states. So far this year, its same-store sales have risen 8.2%, according to the privately held company. The Larry H. Miller Company, an investment firm founded by the former Utah Jazz owner, bought a majority stake in Swig in 2022 for an undisclosed sum. "I think we're doing for soda what Starbucks did for coffee," Swig CEO Alex Dunn said. As Swig has grown, so have the number of chains looking to emulate its success. Rival soda shops like Sodalicious, Fiiz and Cool Sips are also benefiting from the trend. Coffee shops, like Dutch Bros. , have also added it to their menus. And now fast-food chains are hopping on the bandwagon. "It validates that this is a category, and McDonald's and Taco Bell wouldn't be getting into it if it wasn't something that had broad appeal that they could sell everywhere, in thousands of locations," Dunn said. "It's kind of flattering that we created a category that now everybody is copying." For restaurants, adding dirty soda to the menu is easier than it might sound. "It's a custom drink offering that, one, allows the brands to leverage something that they already have right there: their soda machine," said Erica Holland-Toll, culinary director at The Culinary Edge, which advises restaurants on food and beverage innovation. "Two, it incorporates either a one-touch ingredient, or if they're already open for breakfast, it's quite likely that they've got a creamer in house." On the other hand, offering customizable coffee drinks is usually much more difficult — which has contributed to the struggles at Starbucks. "The espresso world — that's so much more complicated," Holland-Toll said. Dirty soda also has wide appeal. With less caffeine than coffee, consumers can drink it all day long. Plus, it's "much more accessible" than some coffee house trends, like an espresso tonic, according to Holland-Toll. The bright colors of many dirty sodas also make them more attractive to consumers, who were likely introduced to the trend via a TikTok video. But perhaps above all, dirty soda can help restaurants draw in customers who are otherwise feeling thrifty. "It's an affordable fun treat. You're not going out and spending $30 or $50, right?" said Sally Lyons Watt, chief advisor of consumer goods and foodservice insights for Circana. "It's something that people can walk away saying, 'Wow, that was yummy' or 'I feel better because I just had that.'"

A pop for beverage companies

A "fun treat" for consumers is adding up for beverage companies, helping reverse the decades-long trend of declining soda consumption in the U.S. As health concerns mount and the array of beverage options expands, Americans have been drinking less soda for roughly two decades. In 2004, soda consumption peaked at 15.3 billion gallons, according to Beverage Marketing; by 2024, that figure had slid to 11.87 billion gallons. But consumption of carbonated soft drinks has been ticking up in the last two years, with 2025 estimated to reach 11.88 billion gallons. The rise of dirty soda, plus the growing popularity of prebiotic sodas, has likely helped the segment halt its downward trajectory.

[TITLE]On’s New COO Could Expand Use of Robots in Shoe Production:
[TEXT]
On said Tuesday that Sam Wenger is stepping down as chief operating officer after eight years at the company.

The Roger Federer-backed sneaker brand has named chief innovation officer Scott Maguire to take on the new dual role of chief innovation and operating officer, starting Jan. 1, 2026. He joined On in April. Previously, he was CEO of Specialized Bicycle Components and before that was chief operating officer at Dyson, according to his LinkedIn page.

“Sam has been a true builder at On. He played an outsized role in shaping the company’s global footprint and culture, always with an entrepreneurial spirit and long-term perspective,” On’s CEO and CFO Martin Hoffman said. “We are deeply grateful for his contributions and will miss him both as a friend and colleague. We wish him time to rest, reflect, and all the success in his next endeavor.”

Wenger will remain with the company through the end of the first quarter 2026 to facilitate a smooth transition. Over his eight-year tenure, Wenger took on leadership responsibilities across multiple functions that include building On’s sourcing office in Vietnam to scaling the brand’s North America business, steering the finance operations after the firm’s initial public offering in 2021 and more recently strengthening On’s operations so it can grow at scale globally.

A Bloomberg story said Maguire will likely look to scale up the brand’s Lightspray robots, which he is already overseeing. The robots are being used to make high-end marathon sneakers.

In an interview with Footwear News in July, On’s three co-founders Caspar Coppetti, David Allemann and Olivier Bernhard discussed the brand’s new LightSpray factory for footwear production in Zurich. The technology uses a robot arm and 1.5 kilometers of filament to produce ultra-light one-piece running shoe uppers in three minutes. The highly-efficient process saves both space and time, minimizes waste and produces an upper with 75 percent fewer carbon emissions than On’s other racing shoes.

On has over 1,100 people employed in Zurich, with more than 300 focused on research and development to drive innovation in product and materials development and design. The brand is planning other similar production facilities worldwide.

Hoffman said in August on a conference call after posting second quarter earnings results that the brand had implemented selective price increases in the U.S. in early July to counter some tariff increases. While the company posted a net loss of 40.9 million Swiss francs, it also saw net sales increase 38 percent to 749.2 million Swiss francs.

That increase gave the company confidence to raise its 2025 net sales guidance to up 31 percent year-over-year, versus its prior estimate of up 28 percent, even with the impact of a 20 percent incremental tariff on imports to the U.S. from Vietnam. Despite now paying a total of 40 percent duty for imports to the U.S. from Vietnam — a stacked rate consisting of an existing 20 percent duty plus the 20 percent incremental tariff — and 39 percent for imports from Indonesia, Hoffman said he wasn’t worried.

“As a premium brand and as a fast-growing brand, we have multiple opportunities to compensate for these impacts of our cost sold,” the CEO told investors at the time, noting that investments into innovative products come at higher price points that also drive more gross profit margin. He also said the company last month still hadn’t even spoken to its retail and factory partners yet

[TITLE]The Crisis for the Women Who Make Your Clothes:

“I’m the main provider in the family. I support my mother, my sister, and her kids as well as mine. I pay rent, buy groceries, school supplies for the kids,” she said. “I spent a week looking for another job, but because there are so many people looking at the moment, I didn’t get one. There aren’t any other options—we just have to take what work we can get.”

When Maleshoane Rakojoana was furloughed from her job at a Lesotho clothing factory nearly three months ago, it turned her whole family’s life upside down. No longer able to afford the rent, they had to leave the capital, Maseru, and move in with relatives, miles away from where her children go to school. Because Rakojoana is the main breadwinner for her extended family, her loss of income has created a wave of impoverishment that ripples through the generations.

There aren’t any other options—we just have to take what work we can get.”

It is a story repeated thousands of times over in Lesotho, a small, landlocked state in southern Africa that has become caught up in U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff wars. The country that Trump famously said no one’s ever heard of has certainly heard of him: Before any tariff increases had even come into effect, Lesotho had declared a national state of disaster as it faced up to the twin crises of massive U.S. aid cuts and what the think tank ODI Global has described as a “gendered supply chain shock” in the garment industry.

At the end of June, Rakojoana’s employer, which manufactures tops and leggings for Walmart and JCPenney, suspended all 900 employees—the vast majority of them women—as orders fell off a cliff in the face of threatened U.S. tariffs of 50 percent. The company put her on a monthly stipend of 800 loti (

We also went hands-on with the new products to share our first impressions.

What products did Amazon launch?

Nina Raemont/ZDNET

New Kindle Scribe lineup (including Colorsoft): Amazon has announced a new Kindle Scribe lineup, which includes a Colorsoft model -- the first Scribe model with a color e-paper display. Panay explained that the new Scribe has perfected the feel of writing on paper, rather than a display. It's also 40% faster than older models and has a unique color processing technology.

"This brings the real-world colors and doesn't blast your eyes. Same front light design but with a color filter. It feels right -- it just feels right. Same friction, same speed," Panay said of the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. "You want to make sure the ink coming out is the color you chose."

The Kindle Scribe costs $430, a Kindle Scribe with a Front Light costs $500, and the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft costs $630. Amazon launched the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition in October 2024, followed by a 16GB Kindle Colorsoft and a Kids version.

Echo Studio, Echo Dot Max, Echo Show 11, and Echo Show 8: Amazon introduced its new Echo devices as built for Alexa+. The new devices are powered by the AZ3 and AZ3 Pro processors, which are faster and more powerful, capable of processing AI requests for Alexa+. Their built-in AI features enable them to process contextual awareness from real-world information gathered by sensors throughout your home. For example, it can learn patterns in your home and alert you when something happens out of the ordinary, such as if your front door is left unlocked after midnight.

The new Echo Studio is priced at $220, the Echo Dot Max is $100, the Echo Show 11 is $220, and the Echo Show 8 is $180.

While Amazon launched new Echo Show 15 and 21 smart displays last year, the company hadn't released a new Echo Dot, its most popular smart speaker, since 2022. As for more recent smart speakers, Amazon launched the Echo Spot in July 2024, following the Echo Pop's launch in May 2023.

Ring cameras: Ring founder Jamie Siminoff announced a new Retinal Vision technology for the Ring Video Doorbell. The long-awaited upgrade will improve the image quality and increase the resolution to 2K. "Retinal Vision is a multi-step process that starts with sensors that use BSI pixels for superior low-light performance," Siminoff said.

The new 2K cameras include a Wired Doorbell Plus 2K for $180 and an Indoor Cam Plus 2K for $60.

Additionally, Ring is finally bringing 4K to its security cameras, announcing the Outdoor Cam Pro 4K for $200, the Spotlight Cam Pro 4K for $250, the Wired Doorbell Pro 4K for $250, and the Floodlight Cam Pro 4K for $280. All products are available for preorder.

Also: My favorite backyard spotlight camera just hit its lowest price ever on Amazon

The Elite doorbell is also getting an upgrade with the launch of the new Wired Doorbell Elite 4K. Amazon also announced new POE cameras: the Outdoor Cam POE 4K and Spotlight Cam Pro POE 4K.

As far as Ring software updates, here's what we heard:

Retinal Tuning: Amazon also introduced Retinal Tuning, which enables consumers to customize their picture quality to match the scene they are viewing.

Familiar Faces and Alexa+ Greetings will be rolled out to new Ring devices in December. Search Party: Siminoff wrapped up the Ring updates with a Search Party feature, which helps pet owners be reunited with their lost pets. The feature initiates a search party on nearby Ring cameras whenever a pet owner reports a lost pet through the Ring app. The app will then notify nearby neighbors if the pet has been spotted on any of their cameras, allowing them to share the information with the pet owner.

Blink security cameras: The new Blink products include the Blink Mini 2K+ for $50, the Blink Outdoor 2K+ for $90, and the Blink Arc for $100, which features two Outdoor cameras that create a wide panoramic view of its coverage area.

Fire TVs and Fire TV Stick 4K Select: Amazon refreshed the Fire TV 4 Series, starting at $330, the Fire TV 2 Series, starting at $160, and the Fire TV Omni QLED Series. A new Fire TV Stick 4K Select will also be available for $40.

The new Fire TVs feature the new Amazon operating system called Vega OS, which moves the company away from relying on Android-based OS in favor of this Linux-based proprietary alternative. They also feature faster processing times and images that can automatically adjust to the room's lighting. The TVs will also feature Dialog Boost to adjust the volumes in channels when the voices are too quiet, but the background noise is too loud.

Also: Amazon's Vega OS is being updated to Fire TVs this year - here's why that's a big deal

Aside from maintaining hands-free Alexa, Amazon is also introducing presence sensors to its new Omni Series TVs, featuring a feature the company is calling Omnisense. This allows you to set up your TV so that it turns on when you enter the room, although it remains unclear whether this presence sensor can be used for routines and automations with other smart home products.

Additionally, Ring is finally bringing 4K to its security cameras, announcing the Outdoor Cam Pro 4K for $200, the Spotlight Cam Pro 4K for $250, the Wired Doorbell Pro 4K for $250, and the Floodlight Cam Pro 4K for $280. All products are available for preorder.

The Elite doorbell is also getting an upgrade with the launch of the new Wired Doorbell Elite 4K. Amazon also announced new POE cameras: the Outdoor Cam POE 4K and Spotlight Cam Pro POE 4K.

As far as Ring software updates, here's what we heard:

Retinal Tuning: Amazon also introduced Retinal Tuning, which enables consumers to customize their picture quality to match the scene they are viewing.

Familiar Faces and Alexa+ Greetings will be rolled out to new Ring devices in December. Search Party: Siminoff wrapped up the Ring updates with a Search Party feature, which helps pet owners be reunited with their lost pets. The feature initiates a search party on nearby Ring cameras whenever a pet owner reports a lost pet through the Ring app. The app will then notify nearby neighbors if the pet has been spotted on any of their cameras, allowing them to share the information with the pet owner.

Blink security cameras: The new Blink products include the Blink Mini 2K+ for $50, the Blink Outdoor 2K+ for $90, and the Blink Arc for $100, which features two Outdoor cameras that create a wide panoramic view of its coverage area.

Fire TVs and Fire TV Stick 4K Select: Amazon refreshed the Fire TV 4 Series, starting at $330, the Fire TV 2 Series, starting at $160, and the Fire TV Omni QLED Series. A new Fire TV Stick 4K Select will also be available for $40.

The new Fire TVs feature the new Amazon operating system called Vega OS, which moves the company away from relying on Android-based OS in favor of this Linux-based proprietary alternative. They also feature faster processing times and images that can automatically adjust to the room's lighting. The TVs will also feature Dialog Boost to adjust the volumes in channels when the voices are too quiet, but the background noise is too loud.

Also: Amazon's Vega OS is being updated to Fire TVs this year - here's why that's a big deal

Aside from maintaining hands-free Alexa, Amazon is also introducing presence sensors to its new Omni Series TVs, featuring a feature the company is calling Omnisense. This allows you to set up your TV so that it turns on when you enter the room, although it remains unclear whether this presence sensor can be used for routines and automations with other smart home products.

[TITLE]From Bella Hadid to Chris Briney, These Stars Were Just Pictured Wearing Pieces You Can Get on Amazon:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

ICYMI: Amazon‘s fall Prime Day is coming up quick, as the Prime Big Deal Days are happening from October 7 to 8 this year. If 2024 is any indication, coveted clothing and accessories from TikTok-popular brands will be majorly slashed in price (sometimes by as much as over 50 percent off).

But if you’re on the market for something a bit more high-brow, like the fall must-haves to be found in Amazon’s Luxury Stores section, chances are you won’t find it on sale in the coming week. Still, seeing as how a wave of celebrities recently endorsed Amazon finds via their street-style and special-event getups, we have a good feeling their preferred picks — from designer handbags to quiet-luxury cardigans perfect for the season at hand — won’t be on e-shelves for much longer, so now couldn’t be a better time to shop.

In case you need tangible evidence that stars are actively buying and wearing Amazon fashions, look no further than heartthrob and “The Summer I Turned Pretty” sensation Chris Briney, who just a few weeks ago attended a NYFW after-party hosted by Amazon Fashion, wearing the Brent Spread Collar Cardigan and Hugo Wool Italian Fresco Pants from Paris-based brand Officine Générale. The internet’s favorite “black cat boyfriend” looked especially sharp in this combination, choosing to don the cardi in question with the top button undone. We couldn’t help but notice the high-quality look of his pants’ tailoring and just how soft the top looked — pairing wearability with a modern, go-with-everything colorway that somehow seemed to make Briney’s eyes even harder to turn away from (but maybe we’re just obsessed?).

While the cardigan goes for $330 at Amazon and the Portuguese-made wool pants for $450, the investment purchases come with all the bells and whistles that accompany an Amazon Prime membership (read: next-day shipping, free delivery, and free returns). This means you’ll likely have a more convenient and seamless shopping experience at Amazon’s Luxury storefront than if you were frequenting a brick-and-mortar establishment.

More interested in practical travel essentials that go easy on your wallet? Know that they’re not only easily accessible at Amazon but are also vetted by the A-listers currently flooding your FYP. Case in point is Kylie Jenner, who recently posted a photo of her sweatpants-clad legs in an Instagram carousel, the location clearly being a private jet.

We peeped a Birkin bag, and although it’s safe to say you won’t be finding that at amazon.com, Jenner also had on her lap a HydroJug Traveler tumbler, which is an under-$40 way to haul your daily ounces of water in style. Joining Jenner in her hydration journey is easy, and it’s an added benefit that the HydroJug — a leading Stanley Quencher and HydroFlask alternative — has more than 4,000 five-star reviews to its name on the retailer’s site, highlighting just how leak-proof, portable, and cupholder-friendly the bottle really is.

If you were just now tempted by the unattainable allure of a Hermès Birkin, know that there is, indeed, a way to Jane Birkin-ify a purse on Amazon — by scoring the exact Coach Tabby Shoulder Bag 26 that Bella Hadid flaunted for Milan Fashion Week on September 24.

Dolled up with the “Loved Leather” finish for some vintage flair, the carryall that’s also loved by our editors has two strap options allowing for on-the-shoulder or crossbody wear, a glovetanned leather material that feels both smooth and supple, as well as enough room inside to house your new iPhone 17, wallet, AirPods, lipstick, and other daily tchotchkes.

Be like Bella and match the suave bag to a Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy–coded headband, of which there are many on… you guessed it: Amazon. All that will be missing from your elevated look? A pair of sandals that Ashley Graham sported at the Daytime Beauty Awards on September 21. The Audrinette 105 shoe from celebrity-adored brand Giuseppe Zanotti is strappy, buckle-bedecked, and glossy — all attributes that make it a no-brainer choice of footwear for nailing today’s top trends.

Go ahead, add it to your Amazon cart, and, upon the pair’s arrival to your doorstep in what will feel like the blink of an eye, use it to fuel an upcoming night out’s unforgettable memories. Shoes this glamorous and comfortable, after all, were made for the dance floor.

Finally, rounding out celebrities’ September appearances in easy-to-grab Amazon styles is none other than Oprah Winfrey, who wore the Regina Pro Boots from the brand Vivaia (whose iconic sneakerina also presented itself on the feet of Lola Tung quite recently). A longtime fan of this silhouette, Winfrey took advantage of its sturdy heel, roomy toe box, water-repellent finish, and slip-on design — ideal for everything from TV-hosting duties in her case to lunches with colleagues, during which you won’t be left searching for a Band-Aid. And though the below colorway for the bestselling selection, a timeless Espresso Metallic, wasn’t the same one Winfrey chose for herself (Navy called her name more convincingly), you’ll savor its fusion of the trendy and the classic all the same.

Get to shopping these star-approved Amazon favorites before the shoes sell out in your size, that all-black water bottle hue is depleted in inventory, and Chris Briney devotees snatch his outfit in an instant.

Then, mark your calendars for October 7… because Prime Day this time of year is going to be nothing short of incredible.

[TITLE]Dynamic Discounting: How to Do Dynamic Pricing Right:
[TEXT]
The following article was written by Wharton marketing professor Z. John Zhang.

Dynamic pricing isn’t new. Airlines, hotels, and ride-hailing companies have long relied on it to balance demand and supply, maximize profitability, and serve different types of customers. But in 2025, dynamic pricing is spreading rapidly across industries — from grocery retail to fast food to fashion e-commerce to tickets for the upcoming FIFA World Cup — powered by artificial intelligence, digital price tags, and real-time demand data. The current tariff uncertainties and inflation concerns are further impetus for firms to flirt with, and even embrace, dynamic pricing.

Done right, dynamic pricing can benefit both firms and consumers. Done poorly, it can trigger backlash and erode trust.

Why Dynamic Pricing Works

The economic logic is straightforward: Customer willingness to pay varies. It varies across customers, and for the same customer, across occasions and over time. A family booking a vacation months in advance has a very different willingness to pay than an executive booking a same-day flight, and almost everyone is willing to pay more for roses on Valentine’s Day than on any other day. Dynamic pricing helps companies capitalize on this variation, charging a high-willingness-to-pay customer a high price and a low-willingness-to-pay customer a low price at the right time. In the airline industry, leisure travelers secure affordable tickets by booking early, while business travelers can still find seats at the last minute, albeit at a higher price. Uber’s surge pricing — which is a specific type of dynamic pricing — not only helps match riders to drivers but also attracts more drivers into busy zones, increasing supply when it’s most needed.

The principle holds across industries. When prices reflect demand and capacity in real time, resources are allocated more efficiently, and customers often have more choice. Firms, of course, stand to reap more short-term profits by charging more to those who are willing to pay more, while accommodating those who can afford to pay only a low price, thus getting both high margins and high volumes for their products or services.

What Is Dynamic vs. Surge Pricing? Although consumers often conflate them, dynamic pricing and surge pricing are not the same. Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the price of a good or service up or down over time, with some business objectives in mind. Surge pricing is a specific type of dynamic pricing in which a company raises the price of a product or service, unexpectedly for consumers, when demand exceeds supply.

The Expanding Frontier

It is not surprising to see that several industries are experimenting with new forms of dynamic pricing:

Retail: Walmart is rolling out electronic shelf labels (ESLs) across 2,300 stores in the U.S., enabling real-time pricing based on demand, inventory, and competition. Competitors including Kroger, Whole Foods, and Lidl are following suit.
