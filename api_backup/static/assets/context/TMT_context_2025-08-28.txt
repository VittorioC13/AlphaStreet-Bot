[TITLE]Vaxxas secures ~A$90 million in funding to:
[TEXT]
Total equity and debt raising of ~$90 million provides runway to 2H 2027

Strong support from existing and new investors including SPRIM Global Investments

Funds will be used to scale-up production of needle-free vaccination delivery technology

Founding CEO David Hoey will transition to Strategic Advisor

Company well-advanced in search for new CEO to accelerate commercialisation.

BRISBANE, Australia, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxxas Pty Ltd, the biotechnology company pioneering the high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) for needle-free vaccine delivery, today announced that it has secured ~$90 million in its latest financing round.

The financing is one of the largest financings for a private biotech company in Australia this year and includes $49.22 million in new Series D equity and $40 million in debt facilities, with additional commitments under discussion as the Company continues to attract investor interest.

The equity financing was led by SPRIM Global Investments, the venture arm of global life sciences firm SPRIM, with strong participation from new investor LGT Crestone as well as existing investors OneVentures and Brandon Capital-Hostplus.

The funding will enable Vaxxas to accelerate the development and scale-up of its HD-MAP technology towards market readiness, including installation of semi-automated manufacturing lines and later-stage clinical trial programs.

Vaxxas’ HD-MAP technology represents a major advance in vaccine delivery, enabling needle-free administration that reduces temperature control requirements for vaccine storage and creates opportunities for self-administration in the home. This could dramatically improve vaccine access and uptake worldwide.

Chair of Vaxxas, Sarah Meibusch, said the capital raising represented an excellent achievement in a very difficult market for biotech. “This result underscores the confidence that leading investors have in Vaxxas’ disruptive technology and the progress the team has made toward scaling-up and commercialisation. Coupled with our sharp focus on commercialisation, this funding provides Vaxxas with a runway into the second half of 2027 as we focus on bringing our technology to market.”

Michael Shleifer, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of SPRIM Global Investments, said: “SPRIM is proud to lead this financing and support Vaxxas at this exciting juncture. We believe the HD-MAP platform has the potential to fundamentally transform vaccine delivery globally – expanding access, reducing costs, and improving uptake. The commercial opportunity is enormous, and we look forward to partnering with the team as they advance toward market.”

In addition to the Series D equity, Vaxxas has entered into a US$25.2 million (A$40 million) debt facility with SPRIM Global Investments, which the company can draw down based on eligible R&D activity under the Australian Government’s R&D tax rebate scheme and in line with the Company’s R&D needs.

Leadership and Board transition

After 14 years as CEO, David Hoey will transition to a new role as Strategic Advisor. Having led Vaxxas since 2012, Mr Hoey and the Board believe that this transition provides a strategic opportunity to put leadership in place for the coming years, as the Company accelerates its commercialisation efforts to bring the HD-MAP to market.

Mr Hoey said: “I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved to bring the company and its technology to this point in its growth. We have successfully validated the revolutionary potential of this vaccination delivery platform for a spectrum of diseases in global markets and have strong traction in product and market development. I look forward to continuing to be a part of the Vaxxas journey, supporting the executive team and Board as they drive forward.”

Under Mr Hoey’s leadership, Vaxxas has established a world-class team, strategic relationships with global leaders in vaccination, and raised more than $300 million to support the programs, of which almost $160 million has been injected into the Australian economy, including more than $140 million in Queensland.

Sarah Meibusch said: “We are deeply grateful to David for his tireless work to get Vaxxas to this stage. David and the Vaxxas team have grown the company from a spinout from The University of Queensland into a company with strong technical and operational capabilities and established a world-class development and manufacturing facility. This transition reflects the Company’s evolution from a high-potential startup to a commercially focused biotech scaling for global impact. David’s continued involvement as advisor and committed shareholder will help ensure a smooth transition and continuity.”

A global search for a new CEO is well advanced.

Vaxxas Chair Paul Kelly, who has been on the Board since Vaxxas was founded in 2011, has retired from the Board. Fellow OneVentures representative Sarah Meibusch has been appointed Chair. Ms Meibusch, OneVentures Healthcare Partner, has been closely involved with Vaxxas for a number of years and has been an alternate director since 2020.

[TITLE]Thoma Bravo to buy Verint in $2 billion deal as software acquisitions ramp up:
[TEXT]
Thoma Bravo will acquire Verint Systems in a $2 billion deal, including debt, the customer engagement platform said on Monday, marking the latest software buyout as private equity firms increasingly bet on AI to navigate an uncertain economy.

Software companies have emerged as prime acquisition targets as adoption of artificial intelligence and recurring revenue prove to be resilient markers in an economy pressured by tariffs and volatile customer spending.

Under the agreement, Verint shareholders will receive $20.50 per share in cash. The offer represents a premium of 4.2 per cent to the stock's closing price on June 30, before the talks were first reported, and implies an equity deal value of $1.23 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Shares of Verint — which provides an AI-powered platform to help enterprises organize, manage and improve customer interactions across various channels and digital operations — were down 1.2 per cent at $20.23.

The stock has lost 25 per cent of its value so far this year, pressured by strong competition and declining revenue in the past two quarters.

Still, some analysts expect Verint's focus on AI bots to result in higher demand as enterprise customers invest in automation and efficiency.

"We believe this was a strategic move for both entities as these organizations are closely aligned in terms of customer experience automation that leverages data and AI, with Thoma Bravo already heavily invested in this market," Wedbush analysts said in a note.

Thoma Bravo, which had about $184 billion in assets under management as of March 31, is among the largest software-focused investors globally. The private equity firm has acquired or invested in more than 530 software and technology companies.

Earlier this month, it had signed a $12 billion deal to acquire human resources software provider Dayforce.

The latest deal is expected to close before the end of Verint's current fiscal year.

Trump's brand of US capitalism faces 'socialist' backlash from conservatives

While Trump says the US paid "zero" for the roughly $9bn in non-voting Intel shares, the transaction was far from a gift. The US converted unpaid construction grants designated in the 2023 Chips Act – legislation intended to promote domestic semiconductor manufacturing - into Intel stock.

"You're looking at investment decisions now having to be made on the basis of politics, not economics," said Tad DeHaven, an economic policy analyst with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "This is injecting the government directly into the lifeblood of a major corporation's decision making."

Trump's move is generating criticism such as this because it breaks with American tradition and small-government conservative orthodoxy. And some economists warn that his promise to help companies that make deals with the US government raises the potential for corruption and market inefficiencies.

"You can't just be against socialism when the left does it," said conservative radio host Erick Erickson. "So if you support socialism, apparently Donald Trump is your guy."

Trump's post was pushing back against criticism that has continued for days. He took aim at what he said were "stupid people" – a group that includes some on the political right.

"I will make deals like that for our country all day long," he wrote on his social media website, Truth Social. "I will also help those companies that make such lucrative deals with the United States."

He announced on Friday that the federal government is acquiring a 10% stake in Intel, the Fortune 500 company that is one of the largest American manufacturers of semiconductors. And he hinted that the US might not be done adding to its stock portfolio.

Donald Trump is getting the US government into the computer chip business.

Trump's actions are not entirely without precedent. During the 2009 financial crisis, the US acquired partial ownership of General Motors, Citigroup and AIG to prevent those companies from collapse. Those interventions were justified by Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama as emergency actions taken on a temporary basis to prevent a nationwide economic meltdown.

While the Trump administration explains the Intel move as one taken to protect an industry that is vital to national security – as with the president's decision to impose tariffs, deploy the National Guard to US cities and replace theoretically independent public officials – the legality of the move rests on his assurances with little outside oversight.

"This is not really

[TITLE]Why the US government is not the savior Intel needs:
[TEXT]
The Trump administration made an unprecedented, and confusing, move last week when it announced plans to convert money Intel was supposed to receive through Joe Biden-era government grant programs into a 10% equity stake.

While it remains unclear if converting those government grants into equity is even possible — that’s up for debate — it’s even less obvious how this move will solve Intel’s biggest problem, its waffling foundry business. Even Intel is unconvinced.

Intel Foundry, which manufactures custom semiconductors for outside customers, has not been fruitful for the company. The business division lost out on potential big contracts, like one with Sony, according to Reuters, and has cost the company significantly more than it has brought in.

Intel Foundry reported an operating income loss of $3.1 billion in the second quarter. The company has also laid off thousands of people since the beginning of the year, with the foundry business unit being hit especially hard.

Differences over how Intel would turn around its struggling foundry business was partially responsible for Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation from the company board in August 2024. Tan was appointed CEO in spring 2025.

Kevin Cassidy, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, told TechCrunch he doesn’t see how this deal will solve Intel’s problems. Intel Foundry doesn’t need money to solve its issues, he said, instead it needs to change its approach to its customers.

“They didn’t understand customer service,” Cassidy said of Intel Foundry’s struggles to sign customers. “They have always manufactured internally, the manufacturing group was king. It’s hard to be a customer service-focused group when you think you know better.”

Intel did not respond to a request for comment.

Ripple effect

Intel recently acknowledged the potential downsides of this deal in an SEC filing posted Monday. The company highlighted the risks it carries for its investors and customers — two groups of people Intel naturally relies on.

This deal dilutes existing shareholders and reduces their governance rights. The Trump administration said it would vote alongside Intel’s interests, which could help the company move its ideas forward; but business decisions that actively sour an existing investor base conflicts with efforts to drum up investor interest.

“I would be disappointed if I was a stockholder,” Cassidy said. “Intel gave up another 430 million shares, and diluted my shares, and [they] were able to buy it at a 20% discount.”

Intel also mentioned the potential impact this could have on its international business. The vast majority of the company’s revenue in its last fiscal year, 76%, came from outside the U.S., the company reported.

Amid the current U.S.-led international trade turmoil, companies outside the United States will now have to grapple with whether or not to work with a company partially owned by the U.S. government.

[TITLE]Another artificial intelligence deal collapses — as Colorado lawmakers’ budget fixes near finish line:
[TEXT]
Colorado’s first-in-the-nation regulations on artificial intelligence may have to wait longer if the legislature approves a proposal advanced by the state Senate on Monday.

In a dramatic shift from Sunday night, when a deal on revamped regulations appeared within reach, Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez gutted the bill. The measure, proposed during a mostly budget-focused special session, had been aimed at regulating AI and increasing transparency around its use to make decisions affecting Coloradans.

Instead, the bill as amended would simply delay, by several months, the implementation of a law passed 2024 that is supposed to go into effect next February.

Under Rodriguez’s proposal, which still needs to pass the state House, those regulations would take effect at the end of June — giving the tech industry, lawmakers, and public-interest and consumer-protection groups another chance during the next regular session to nail down how to regulate the growing, affluent industry. The regular session convenes in mid-January.

“Overnight, the tech industry decided that they were so unhappy with the compromise that had been achieved by consumer-protection organizations, educators, labor and business that they would rather return to the (existing rules),” said Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and driving figure on AI regulations in the state.

The legislature met for its latest special session chiefly to address a $783 million budget deficit brought on by tax cuts and spending changes made by the federal government in July. But the AI regulations, which drew the ire of an industry that argues they are unworkable, was also specifically designated for new consideration in Gov. Jared Polis’ recall of the legislature this month.

Most budget-related bills finished

By the end of the fifth day of the session on Monday, the Democratic majority had sent to Polis the bulk of the bills they hoped would bite into the deficit. The single biggest revenue-raising measure, however, still needed at least two more votes.

The bills that have passed the legislature are:

House Bill 1001, which makes permanent a limit on certain business income deductions for people making more than $500,000 per year.

House Bill 1002, which cracks down on the use of foreign tax havens and adds several countries to that label.

House Bill 1003, which ends a tax incentive for insurance companies that keep offices in the state.

House Bill 1005, which ends a state subsidy to businesses for collecting sales taxes.

In total, those measures are expected to raise about $150 million. The fifth measure, House Bill 1004, would allow certain entities to sell tax credits that can be reclaimed at a discount in future tax years. Lawmakers expect that to bring in another $100 million, for a total of just over $250 million.

"Right now, we need to ensure that the families and the small businesses that truly need our help are getting it," said Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Jefferson County Democrat.

The revenue-raisers amount to nearly a third of the total $783 million budget gap. Polis' staff is preparing to address as much as a third of the gap through spending cuts. His office is expected to reveal its planned reductions later this week, after the revenue part has been adopted.

The rest of the hole will be filled from the legislature's piggy bank. That'll happen last: Whatever's not raised or cut will be pulled from the state's reserves. The governor's office has suggested roughly $320 million, which would reduce the current reserve level -- about 15% of the general fund budget -- by 2 percentage points.

That would mean his office was planning to propose about $200 million in spending reductions.

Liability at issue on AI

On the AI front, Rodriguez’s bill was sent Monday over to the House, where members have already debated a competing AI measure -- one that had also been watered down to simply delaying the 2024 regulations, in that case until October 2026. The House planned to take up Rodriguez's bill in committee and potentially for an initial floor vote Monday night, which would make a final vote possible Tuesday.

How to assign liability for bias apparent in the use of AI to make decisions -- between entities that use AI for things like screening job and rental applications and the entities that developed the AI tools -- was a key part of Rodriguez's measure before its gutting.

But that has been a key sticking point between the dueling bills.

“A delay is the prudent thing to do,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat and sponsor of the House bill, said. “We need to figure out a way where school districts, hospitals and other deployers aren’t left holding the bag for these regulations. We need to ensure that all stakeholders involved in this legislation are held equally accountable when bad things happen.”
