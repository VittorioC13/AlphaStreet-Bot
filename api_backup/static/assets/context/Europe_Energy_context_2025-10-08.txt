[TITLE]Solar and wind power has grown faster than electricity demand this year, report says:
[TEXT]
So first half of 2025, solar and wind exceeding growth in the electricity demand. This is important because this indicates that fossil fuels no longer needs to, needs to grow, to meet our appetite for electricity. The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant because now we see that solar and wind can keep up with the pace of the demand growth. For the first half of the year, we see *** fall in fossil generation in China and India. China generates absolute terms more than any other country and leads in addition, in solar, in wind, and in EV, they are very strategic. India also demonstrated that they can meet the growing demand with, with clean sources. They saw record growth in solar and wind, and I think that they will continue uh going uh this path. In contrast, in USA clean electricity didn't keep up with the demand growth, so we saw increase in, in fossil and emissions. We all want clean, healthy environment for us and generations to come. The sooner we transition, the greatest benefits economic, job creation, uh, health benefits, and etc.

[TITLE]Adnoc Offers EU Remedies in $14B Covestro Deal Probe:
[TEXT]
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has offered a slate of concessions to address European Union concerns over its €12 billion ($14 billion) takeover of Covestro AG.

The European Commission confirmed it received remedies on Oct. 2, declining to elaborate on details of the offer. It added that despite the concessions being filed, the regulator hasn’t set a new deadline for a decision after it stopped the clock to request further details.

The package of commitments includes a pledge to maintain Covestro’s intellectual property in Europe as well as concessions on the company’s unlimited state guarantee from the UAE, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.

A takeover of Covestro would give Adnoc — the biggest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates — control over a German company that supplies materials for some of the world’s most prominent phone and carmakers. Adnoc would own Covestro through its investment unit XRG, set up in November as the company’s international platform for natural gas, chemicals and energy solutions.

“Following thorough engagement with the European Commission, we have submitted a robust and proportionate package of proposed commitments,” an XRG spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “They represent our disciplined approach as a long-term investor and underscore the strength of this transaction, and we are confident this will lead to timely clearance.”

In July, the commission, the EU’s antitrust arm, opened a full-scale investigation into the Covestro deal under tough new foreign subsidies rules. These are aimed at preventing sovereign states from using their financial muscle to crush competition in the 27-nation bloc.

Commission officials warned at the time that Adnoc’s state funding may give it an unfair advantage over rivals with less-deep pockets.

[TITLE]Electricity and gas provider Energia sold to French private investment firm:
[TEXT]
No financial details of the purchase from America’s I-Squared Capital have been released, but it has been speculated the asking price was over €2bn.

Energia has approximately 250,000 residential electricity and gas customers in the Republic, plus another 58,100 non-residential customers. Its Power NI division is the biggest domestic electricity supplier in Northern Ireland, with almost 517,00 customers, three time more than its nearest rival.

The company says the transaction will have no impact on customers, employees or suppliers and that it remains committed to delivering its strategy in Ireland.

In recently announced results, Energia reported that operating profits slid by 44pc to €32.8m in the first quarter of its 2026 financial year. It still paid a €40m dividend to I Squared Capital at the end of April.

During that first quarter, the group reported an operating loss of €6.1m before exceptional items and “certain remeasurements”, which compared with a €53.8m operating profit in the same quarter last year.

Energia's power station at Huntstown in Dublin

Today's News in 90 Seconds - October 6th

The company owns the Huntstown power station in Dublin and a number of other electricity-generating assets, including 358MW of onshore wind operational capacity with another 50MW under construction. Energia is building a data centre beside the Huntstown power station for use by Microsoft.

The industry magazine PeakLoad reported in June that the shortlist to buy Energia included a joint venture between the UK’s Octopus Energy and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and the US private equity giant KKR. Second-round bids were due to be submitted in July.

Ian Thom, CEO of Energia Group, said: “Energia’s focus remains on transforming Ireland’s energy system by deploying renewables and other low-carbon solutions at scale, while continuing to deliver secure and affordable energy to our domestic and commercial customers. We are grateful for I Squared’s support over the past nine years and the strong, future-ready platform we have built together.”

Juan Angoitia, a senior managing director of Ardian, said it marks the company’s first investment in Ireland, and it has ambitious plans to grow further, driven by secured capital projects and increasing energy demand.

“Ardian is a highly experienced investor in essential infrastructure and European utilities,” he said. “We have been impressed by Energia’s strong growth and resilience in the context of a volatile energy market, and look forward to sharing our expertise to further develop its renewable generation portfolio, flexible capacity and enhance the efficiency of the whole company.”

I Squared was set up in 2012 by former executives of Morgan Stanley, and at the end of last year had more than $40bn in assets under management. It bought Energia, then known as Viridian, in 2016 from Arcapita in an all-cash deal believed to be worth €1bn.

It made two unsuccessful attempts to sell it, in 2018 and 2020.

Mohamed El Gazzar, a senior partner with I Squared Capital, said the sale represents one of its largest exits, but that the company remains committed to Ireland. “Since our initial investment in Energia in 2016, I Squared has deployed over $3bn in portfolio companies with Irish operations, underscoring our deep confidence in Ireland’s economy and supportive investment environment,” he said.

Scope: This TWTW begins with comments on how Solar activity changes high energy cosmic rays hitting Earth’s atmosphere and how these rays change cloudiness on Earth. TWTW briefly discusses the importance of the water cycle, then discusses the difficult balancing act in maintaining grid stability. TWTW presents a video by Kathryn Porter on how the UK government is covering up the enormous expense of going Net Zero. TWTW concludes with the vague plans of New York State to provide electricity in the future and the false health claims supporting this expensive transition.

*********************

The Sun and Cosmic Rays: Hannes Sarv of Freedom Research.org. produced an understandable interview of Danish astrophysicist Henrick Svensmark, the primary advocated of the hypothesis that solar activity such as changing solar wind influence the intensity of high energy cosmic rays hitting Earth’s atmosphere. The changing intensity of cosmic rays in turn change the cloudiness of Earth. The changing cloudiness in Earth’s atmosphere has a far greater influence on climate fluctuations than changing carbon dioxide. The hypothesis has stood experimental testing by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research which has the world’s largest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Ron Clutz provides a lightly edited transcript of the interview. Below are some of the key parts. Clutz’s emphasis and illustrations are removed here.
