[TEXT]
London, Mumbai, 29 September, 2025: Global Healthcare Opportunities, or GHO Capital Partners LLP (“GHO”), the European specialist investor in global healthcare, is delighted to announce the sale of VISUfarma, a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on ophthalmology, to global pharma major Lupin Limited (Lupin).

VISUfarma was created by GHO Capital in 2016 by combining the founder-owned Italian VISUfarma with the European commercial operations of Nicox S.A. Since its initial investment as part of Fund I, GHO has grown the business substantially into a pan-European leader of ophthalmology pharmaceuticals.

Lupin’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nanomi B.V. has signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition, which is projected to close by the end of 2025, subject to certain closing conditions. The acquisition of VISUfarma, with its broad portfolio of innovative eye health products and established commercial infrastructure, aligns with Lupin’s strategy to expand its European business and footprint and to advance the company’s global specialty franchise.

VISUfarma's established European operations will provide market expansion opportunities, direct presence and further business diversification across major European countries, including Italy, the UK, Spain, Germany and France. In addition, VISUfarma’s broad portfolio of 60+ branded ophthalmology products will present growth opportunities to accelerate Lupin's expansion into the specialty segment across regions, and is projected to drive growth in Europe as well as in other markets.

Andrea Ponti, Managing Partner and Mike Turner, Partner at GHO Capital, said: “Working closely with the VISUfarma management team, GHO Capital have transformed the company from a domestic Italian ophthalmic player into a unique pan-European business with established operations across key markets, a robust product portfolio covering the main disease areas impacting both the front- and back-of-the-eye, and the infrastructure to continue its growth trajectory. We are pleased to have found a partner that can help grow VISUfarma further and leverage its strengths to build a global ophthalmology franchise.”

Vinita Gupta, CEO of Lupin, added: “We are delighted to welcome VISUfarma into the Lupin family. This acquisition strengthens our commitment to delivering innovative medicines to the patients and communities we serve. Beyond being immediately accretive, it also broadens our presence in Europe and further builds our specialty franchise in Ophthalmology.”

With the integration of VISUfarma, Lupin will offer a complete portfolio of products in the areas of dry eye, glaucoma, eyelid hygiene, blepharitis, retinal health and highly focused nutraceuticals prescribed by ophthalmologists.

Paolo Cioccetti, CEO Italy, VISUfarma, commented: “Combining with Lupin represents an exciting new chapter for VISUfarma. As part of Lupin’s ophthalmology operations, we will build towards a global ophthalmology franchise with a commitment to advancing eye care and improving patient outcomes. We want to express our sincere gratitude to GHO Capital for their unwavering support and strategic guidance. Their investment and expertise have been instrumental in transforming VISUfarma into a pan-European leader of ophthalmology pharmaceuticals.”

Lupin will finance the acquisition with existing cash on balance sheet. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Lupin’s growth and margin profile.

Stifel acted as exclusive financial advisor to GHO Capital. Slaughter and May, Giliberti, Triscornia e Associati and Norton Rose Fulbright acted as legal counsel and Deloitte served as financial and tax advisor to GHO Capital.

Centerview Partners UK LLP served as exclusive financial advisor to Lupin and Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer LLP served as legal counsel to Lupin.

[TITLE]Dogwood Therapeutics Secures Exclusive Worldwide, Royalty Free License to Develop and Commercialize SP16 as a Treatment for Cancer Related Pain in an All-Stock Transaction Underscoring the Company’s D:
[TEXT]
-A first-in-class LRP1 agonist, SP16 phase 1b Chemotherapy Induced Neuropathy (CIPN) Study fully funded by the National Cancer Institute, with projected patient enrollment beginning in the first half of 2026-

-SP16 has demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and neural repair activity that has the potential to treat CIPN, synergistically complementing Halneuron®, the Company’s late stage Na V 1.7 inhibitor, which has demonstrated significant pain reduction in previous Phase 2 studies-

-Webcast today, September 29, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time-

ATLANTA, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dogwood Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: DWTX) (“Dogwood” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing new medicines to treat pain and neuropathy, today announced that in an all-stock transaction, it has secured a royalty free, global license to develop Serpin Pharma’s intravenous (IV) formulation of SP16 to manage cancer related pain (CRP) including a broad range of chemotherapy induced neuropathy symptoms.

Serpin Pharma has discovered the active portion of A1AT responsible for both the anti-inflammatory (analgesic) activity as well as tissue repair, and this active portion is represented by SP16. SP16 is a first-in-class LRP1 agonist which has demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and neural repair activity that has the potential to treat chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). SP16 IV is the focus of a forthcoming Phase 1b CIPN study that is fully funded by the National Cancer Institute, reflecting the uniqueness of this approach, as well as the extraordinary unmet medical need associated with this debilitating cancer-related condition.

“The SP16 in-license aligns with our strategic objective of expanding our research pipeline in an area where Dogwood’s pain and neuropathy management research expertise can add value to both the asset increasing our equity value for shareholders,” said Greg Duncan, Dogwood Therapeutics Chief Executive Officer. “The National Cancer Institute’s funding of the SP16 IV Phase 1b program obviates the need to use our existing capital in the near-term to advance SP16 into clinical development.”

SP16 IV mimics the activity of alpha-1-antitrypsin’s (A1AT) anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions. In preclinical research, SP16 has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and analgesic benefits, as well as neural restorative and repair activity, both of which hold promise for addressing the multitude of symptoms and damage and functional complication of CIPN.

“After reviewing potential partners for this program, we believe Greg Duncan and the Dogwood team is best poised to take SP16 IV for cancer related pain through the clinic to address this major unmet need,” said Dr. Cohava Gelber, CEO of Serpin Pharma.

“SP16 IV may have intrinsic potential to deliver adjunctive improvement of non-pain symptoms if utilized with Halneuron®, the Company’s lead development candidate,” said Lawrence Steinman, MD, Professor of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Pediatrics, and Genetics at Stanford University and Scientific Advisory Board Member of Serpin Pharma.

Halneuron® is a Na V 1.7 specific sodium channel inhibitor that has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful pain reductions in general cancer pain, as well as chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain (CINP), respectively. Halneuron® is currently in Phase 2b development to treat CINP, a condition for which the medicine has been granted fast-track review designation by the FDA. Over eighty patients have been recruited to date in this landmark Phase 2b CINP study, with interim data from 90-100 patients projected in December 2025.

“Expanding a biotech company’s quality shots on goal is always valued, but doing so with two development candidates that stand on their own merit, with additional potential to be mechanistically synergistic, adds additional value to this exciting worldwide SP16 license,” said Mike Gendreau, M.D., Ph.D., Dogwood Therapeutics Chief Medical Officer. “We intend to explore the potential of SP16, both as a treatment for a multitude of CIPN symptoms, as well as its potential to help with repair and/or restoration of nerve function damaged by chemotherapy.”

[TITLE]Larimar Therapeutics Announces Positive Data from Ongoing Long-term Open Label Study and Updates to Nomlabofusp Program for Friedreich’s Ataxia:
[TEXT]
In 4 completed studies and the ongoing OL study, 65 participants received at least 1 dose of nomlabofusp, including 39 in the OL study, with 14 on treatment for at least 6 months and 8 for over 1 year in the OL study

Increases in skin FXN levels with short- and long-term daily nomlabofusp; 10/10 participants with data at 6 months achieved skin FXN levels over 50% of median levels in healthy volunteers (which is similar to levels in asymptomatic carriers)

Consistent directional improvement across 4 key clinical outcomes (mFARS, FARS-ADL, 9-HPT, MFIS) observed after 1 year of nomlabofusp treatment could suggest potential for clinical benefit relative to a worsening in a FACOMS natural history study reference population

Anaphylaxis has been reported in 7 participants in the OL study, with most events occurring on the initial day of administration and all occurring within the first 6 weeks of dosing; excluding these events, long term dosing of nomlabofusp was generally well tolerated

Following the 2 most recent cases of anaphylaxis, Larimar consulted its experts and decided to modify its starting dose regimen; Larimar provided the FDA a full update on the clinical development program including the safety, FXN, and clinical data in this

[TITLE]Tonix Pharmaceuticals Plans to Initiate Prader-Willi Syndrome Phase 2 Trial of TNX-2900 (Intranasal Potentiated Oxytocin) in 2026:
[TEXT]
Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial planned to evaluate TNX-2900 in children and adolescents (ages 8 to 17.5 years) with Prader-Willi Syndrome under a cleared IND

TNX-2900 granted Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations by the FDA, providing the potential for a Priority Review Voucher upon approval

Magnesium-potentiated intranasal oxytocin formulation designed to reduce dose-related inconsistencies in receptor activity

CHATHAM, N.J., Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: TNXP), a fully-integrated commercial-stage biotechnology company with innovative marketed products and a pipeline of development candidates, today announced plans to progress its TNX-2900 program for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) into a Phase 2 clinical trial. TNX-2900 is a proprietary magnesium-potentiated intranasal oxytocin formulation designed to improve receptor binding and decrease dose-related inconsistencies in receptor activity. The program has received both Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which would make Tonix eligible for a transferable Priority Review Voucher, upon approval. The FDA has cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for TNX-2900 to progress into Phase 2 development.

“We are pleased to advance TNX-2900 into a Phase 2 trial for PWS, a condition with unmet needs for new medicines with activity and tolerability,” said Seth Lederman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Tonix Pharmaceuticals. “Families caring for children with PWS face significant challenges and burdens. Among them is hyperphagia which drives persistent food-seeking behaviors that require constant supervision and often result in obesity and serious medical complications. With an average life expectancy of less than 30 years, treatment of PWS remains an urgent and unmet need. By addressing limitations of traditional oxytocin delivery, we believe TNX-2900 has the potential to become an FDA-approved therapy targeting the oxytocin receptor in PWS and provide meaningful benefit for patients and families living with this rare disorder.”

Tonix plans to conduct a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TNX-2900 in male and female participants with PWS, ages 8 to 17.5 years. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive 12-weeks of treatment with TNX-2900 at one of three dose levels, or placebo, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from baseline in the validated Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT), a widely used measure of hyperphagia severity in PWS. Secondary objectives will include assessments of behavior, caregiver burden, and quality of life measures, as well as safety and tolerability outcomes.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder and the leading cause of life-threatening childhood obesity, affecting
