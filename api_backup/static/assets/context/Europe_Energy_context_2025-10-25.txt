[TITLE]EU moves to choke off Russia’s energy cash flow with sanctions on ‘shadow fleet’ and LNG sanctions:
[TEXT]
The European Union has agreed on a new raft of sanctions against Russia targeting its shadow fleet of oil tankers and banning its imports of liquefied natural gas, the Danish EU presidency announced Thursday.

“Today is a good day for Europe and Ukraine,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a statement, as EU leaders were gathering for a summit in Brussels.

He said that the new sanctions “will introduce new and comprehensive measures on oil and gas, the shadow fleet and Russia’s financial sector.” A new system for limiting the movement of Russian diplomats within the 27-nation EU will also be introduced.

The move comes a day after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration announced new sanctions against Russia’s oil industry that are aimed at moving Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and ending Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

Energy revenue is the linchpin of Russia’s economy, allowing Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.

The new EU measures took almost a month to decide. The 27-nation bloc has already slapped 18 packages of sanctions against Russia over the war, but getting final agreement on who and what to target can take weeks.

The sanctions agreement was sealed at a Thursday morning meeting of EU ambassadors, just a few hours before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joins his European counterparts for the one-day summit, as they press for a ceasefire to halt almost four years of fighting.

The summit comes after Trump said that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.” It was yet another twist in Trump’s stop-and-go effort to end the war.

The leaders are also eager for any progress on Trump’s Gaza peace plan, and will debate ways to keep the 27-nation bloc involved in proceedings.

The EU is the world’s biggest provider of aid to Palestinians but has little leverage over Israel – in part because European nations are divided over how to handle the conflict – and it has struggled to play a role of consequence.

It’s role in the war in Ukraine is clearer, and the summit takes place as Russian armed forces strike at the conflict-torn country’s power grid just as the weather starts to turn colder.

Earlier this week, Ukraine’s strongest European backers who form part of the “coalition of the willing” said they opposed any push to make Ukraine surrender land captured by Russian forces in return for peace, as Trump most recently has suggested.

The U.K. will host a meeting of the members of that coalition of more than 30 countries on Friday.

On the EU side, leaders intend to push forward with plans to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine’s war efforts, despite some misgivings about the consequences of such a step.

The biggest tranche of frozen assets – some $225 billion worth – are held in Belgium, and the Belgian government has been reluctant to take any risks on using the money without firm guarantees from its European partners.

Ukraine’s budget and military needs for 2026 and 2027 are estimated to total around $153 billion.

The EU leaders are also likely to sign off on a new “road map” to prepare Europe to defend itself against a Russian attack by the end of the decade. Top officials believe that Russian could be ready to take aim at another European country within 3-5 years.

[TITLE]Full ban on Russian gas imports on the table at EU Energy Ministers’ meeting:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 20 08:26

The European Union’s initiative to fully ban the import of gas and oil from Russia, as part of its sanctions over the war in Ukraine, is expected to move to the next stage today, as the bloc’s 27 Energy Ministers are set to adopt the measure.

Meeting in Luxembourg, the ministers aim to forge a common position on the total ban before the decision is finalized in negotiations with the European Parliament.

Members of the European Parliament already voted in favor of the proposal last week, paving the way for talks with the member state capitals.

According to the plan, imports of oil, pipeline natural gas, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be entirely and permanently prohibited by 2028 at the latest.

The ban, once agreed upon in talks with the European Parliament, will be adopted by simple majority vote — meaning countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, which still import Russian gas through pipelines, will not be able to veto it.

It is not ruled out that the measure could be implemented sooner, as efforts are underway to impose a ban on Russian gas imports under the upcoming package of sanctions against Moscow.

As of 2024, Russia still accounted for roughly one-fifth of all gas imports into the EU, with an even higher share in natural gas specifically. In the first half of 2025, EU member states imported Russian gas worth nearly €4.5 billion.

The sanctions can be formally adopted once all 27 member states agree — without the involvement of the European Parliament — allowing the process to move faster.

The punitive measures are described as temporary and can be lifted once the war in Ukraine ends and Brussels no longer sees any justification for maintaining them.

At the same time, the EU’s Foreign Ministers, also meeting today in Luxembourg, will discuss developments in the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is expected to join part of their session.

The Council will also discuss a proposal to use frozen Russian assets to finance a loan aimed at providing war reparations to Ukraine, as well as the EU’s 19th package of sanctions against Russia.

The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip will also be on the agenda. Although the EU has so far been sidelined in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, European officials emphasize that the Union intends to play an active role in efforts to restore stability in the Middle East.

[TITLE]India Bristles as Trump Tightens Sanctions on Russian Oil:
[TEXT]
Indian oil refiners were reportedly unhappy with Wednesday’s news that President Donald Trump imposed heavy sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.

Indian importers are reportedly saying the new sanctions are tough enough to make them cut their purchases of Russian oil, a move long desired by the Trump administration.

Trump authorized the sanctions after calling off his planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest.

“We cancelled the meeting with President Putin – it just didn’t feel right to me. It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I cancelled it, but we’ll do it in the future,” Trump told reporters Wednesday.

WATCH — Navarro: India Can’t Keep Siding with China and Russia Against the U.S.:

The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil were announced by the Treasury Department on Wednesday night, causing worldwide oil prices to spike by five percent on Thursday morning.

“Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy,” the Treasury Department said.

“Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” declared Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

“Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions,” Bessent said.

The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated a long list of subsidiaries of both giant Russian oil companies for additional sanctions and warned that doing business with any of them could trigger secondary sanctions.

[TITLE]Trump’s sanctions on Russian energy are a massive step toward peace:
[TEXT]
Bravo to Team Trump for bringing the hammer down on Russia with its most significant sanctions yet — the only way to convince Vladimir Putin that refusing to make peace is a dead end.

The sanctions, levied against Russia’s top two energy companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, show the White House is ready to start dealing out hefty punishments for Moscow’s obstinance after a call between Trump and Putin last week.

The Kremlin’s insistence, after that call, that Russia won’t drop impossible demands, left the prez no reason to go face-to-face with Mad Vlad in Budapest.

Crippling the energy sector is a strike at the heart of Putin’s war economy.

Upping the ante, the European Union immediately followed Trump’s lead with its own sanctions, including a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports — another whack at Putin’s pockets, since Europe is the No. 1 buyer of the stuff.

This is what’s needed to get peace: a coordinated, US-led pressure campaign that hits Moscow where it hurts.

Yes, Trump has cooled on sending Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv (arguing that they’re too complex to use without months of training), a decision that Kyiv thinks led Russia to back off on making concessions.

But the president’s reasoning is fair enough: He doesn’t want unintended deaths on his hands if Ukrainian soldiers misfire a weapon the US gave them.

And it’s not clear how much they’re needed; Ukraine pulled off a successful strike on a Russian chemical plant with UK-made Storm Shadow missiles on Tuesday, proving that it can hit hard without Tomahawks.

Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report Wednesday that Washington lifted restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western-provided long-range missiles within Russia before the attack, but it hardly matters; an already paranoid Putin is left to fear how far the White House might still go.

All good, and Trump can next twist some more screws.

He can go after Putin’s other cash cow: his lapdog oligarchs, who prosper thanks to their Kremlin ties while funding Moscow’s war machine.

Many of these toadies have made money off the deaths of Ukrainians, raking in cash from ramped-up weapons manufacturing.

Wednesday’s EU sanctions package hit oligarchs hard, blocking them from accessing funding or economic resources and traveling to Europe.

The Trump team should tighten the noose on Putin’s puppets even further, broadening the US list of sanctioned individuals, seizing and freezing assets and closing loopholes so that intermediaries can’t do business on the oligarchs’ behalf.

A good start: Yelena Baturina and Vladimir Yevtushenkov, two Hunter Biden-linked Russian billionaires conspicuously left off President Joe Biden’s sanction lists.

Send a message to Putin: He and his cronies will get no quarter from the civilized world.

Make him see he has no path forward unless he gives up his grotesque fantasies of wiping Ukraine off the map.

America and its allies have to keep bringing the pain until Moscow cries “uncle.”

[TITLE]New sanctions on Russia drive up oil:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON — Oil prices spiked Thursday after the U.S. announced massive new sanctions on Russia’s oil industry in an attempt to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and end Moscow’s brutal war on Ukraine.

U.S. benchmark crude jumped 5.6% to $61.79 per barrel and analysts say if the situation remains static, U.S. consumers will soon be paying more at the pump.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said while it was difficult to predict with certainty because of the number of moving parts, consumers will likely see a bump in prices as early as next week, if not sooner.

“We’ll probably start to see motorists be impacted by the sanctions at the pump in the next couple days and it might take five days for that to be fully passed along,” De Haan said, adding that the full impact also depends on whether the Russian or U.S. positions change.

“Russia will feel pressure to come to the table in light of the new developments or President Trump may react when he sees oil prices rising to levels that become uncomfortable, so I don’t think this is going to be very long lasting,” De Haan said.

Oil prices have been relatively low for the past few years and last week the cost for barrel of U.S. benchmark crude fell below $57, its lowest level since early 2021. The price for a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude did rise near $79 a barrel early this year, just before President Donald Trump took office, a price not necessarily considered outrageously elevated by most analysts.

The broad, extended decline in oil prices pushed the average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. last week under $3 for the first time since December of last year, according to GasBuddy.

In Massachusetts, the price at the pump was average $3.01 a gallon, down 3 cents from a week ago, according to a survey from AAA Northeast released Monday. That average hit $3 even on Thursday, according to the motor club.

For much of 2025, inflation has been held mostly in check, partly due to cheaper prices at the pump. However, that could change quickly as higher energy costs have a downstream effect on prices for virtually all products and services across industries.

“The impact to a lot of Americans is that products derived from crude, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel are all likely to see price increases,” De Haan said.

The main reason oil and gas have stabilized at lower levels this year is that the group of countries that are part of the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries have continued to boost production. Earlier this month, OPEC+ leaders announced they would raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day in November, the same amount announced for October. The group has been raising output slightly in a series of boosts all year after announcing cuts in 2023 and 2024.

Russia is the leading non-OPEC member in the 22-country alliance. The group’s next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 2.

The sanctions against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil follows calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as bipartisan pressure on Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry, the economic engine that has allowed Russia to continue to execute the grinding conflict even as it finds itself largely internationally isolated.

The European Union on Thursday announced its own measures targeting Russian oil and gas.

The new EU measures ban imports of Russian liquefied natural gas into the bloc, and add port bans on more than 100 new ships in the Russian shadow fleet of hundreds of aging tankers that are dodging sanctions. The latest sanctions bring the total number of such ships to be banned to 557.

The price for Brent crude, the international standard, rose 5.4% on Thursday to $65.99 per barrel.

[TITLE]Canada's first 'nation-building' nuclear project relies on US suppliers:
[TEXT]
During a joint announcement with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Bowmanville, Carney described the project as a generational investment aimed at extending Canada’s leadership in clean energy while ensuring long-term prosperity for Ontario workers and communities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the federal government will invest $2 billion in Ontario’s Darlington New Nuclear Project — a plan that has stirred controversy since the eruption of a trade war with the US.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

The $3-billion partnership includes $1 billion from Ontario’s Building Ontario Fund . Ontario Power Generation will remain the majority owner and operator, with the federal and provincial governments holding minority stakes.

In the weeks after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and critical minerals, demand grew for Ontario to cancel its contract with US-based GE Hitachi, the company supplying the small modular reactors (SMRs) and enriched uranium for the $21-billion project. Both Carney and Ford have promoted “buy Canadian” policies to shield domestic industry from US tariff threats. Yet, despite the project’s reliance on American suppliers, both leaders defended the investment as essential to meeting Ontario’s soaring energy needs.

“This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach,” Carney said. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity, and opportunities.”

Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Ottawa had earlier committed $970 million to the project.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

Carney said the project marks the start of a broader plan to fast-track large infrastructure and clean energy projects through Ottawa’s new major projects office as proof that “Canada can build big things again.”

Construction on the first reactor began in May, with completion expected in 2030. Once online, the four reactors will supply

[TITLE]Spain’s Clean Energy Dilemma:
[TEXT]
Spain has rapidly transformed its energy industry to be a global leader in renewable deployment and to ease its reliance on foreign oil and gas imports. The sun-baked country now sources more than 40 percent of its electricity supply, with more to come. But while this transition has been a boon for the nation’s energy independence, climate goals, and cheap and abundant clean energy, the costs of clean energy production in Spain have become too cheap for their own good. Instead of serving as a green energy inspiration for the rest of the world, Spain’s energy transition has become a cautionary tale

[TITLE]Clean energy jobs boom to see 15,000 new jobs in communities across Wales:
[TEXT]
UK Government publishes first ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy mission, with over 15,000 extra clean energy jobs in Wales alone by 2030.

31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and welders are particularly in demand.

Skills pilots in Pembrokeshire, Cheshire and Lincolnshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

Energy Secretary to set out measures ensuring companies receiving public grants and contracts need to deliver good jobs across the clean energy sector.

A generation of young people in Wales will benefit from clean energy jobs, under plans announced by the UK government today as part of its clean energy superpower mission.

Backed by record UK government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK – with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, the UK government will publish a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

Wales will benefit from up to 20,000 clean energy jobs by 2030, an increase of up to 15,000 from 2023.

Key skills needed in the region include trades such as electricians, bricklayers and plumbers as well as engineers and metal workers, with the largest clean energy employer expected to be in carbon capture as well as offshore wind.

As part of today’s plan, Pembrokeshire, alongside Cheshire and Lincolnshire, will benefit directly from a skills pilot scheme, backed by £2.5 million in total of UK Government funding, to support local communities with new training centres, courses or career advisers to get jobs in clean energy.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90’s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering. Communities across Wales have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders. This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future. Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.

Welsh Government Minister for Skills, Jack Sargeant, said:

Our ambition is to ensure today’s young people will have the skills needed to work the jobs of tomorrow, helping us embed the industries and services of the future in our communities.

With decades of industrial expertise Wales is primed to capitalise on the generational opportunity that is the UK’s clean energy revolution. The plan announced today will complement our Net Zero Skills Action Plan and support our journey to a cleaner, more prosperous Wales.

The UK government’s clean energy mission is already leading to a jobs boom in the UK, with the certainty and stability of the government’s mission having galvanised over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

The Hynet CCUS project will support jobs in North Wales, Cheshire and Flintshire, and is projected to create 2,800 direct jobs. The Mona Offshore Wind Farm off the coast of North Wales is also set to provide 3,500 jobs over its lifetime.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New skills initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers - Five new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Pembrokeshire, Cheshire and Lincolnshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans - Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades.

Upskill existing workers - Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid.

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights.

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and the newly formed Great British Energy.

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50% today.

With at least one in six ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

[TITLE]Canada's first 'nation-building' nuclear project relies on US suppliers:
[TEXT]
During a joint announcement with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Bowmanville, Carney described the project as a generational investment aimed at extending Canada’s leadership in clean energy while ensuring long-term prosperity for Ontario workers and communities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the federal government will invest $2 billion in Ontario’s Darlington New Nuclear Project — a plan that has stirred controversy since the eruption of a trade war with the US.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

The $3-billion partnership includes $1 billion from Ontario’s Building Ontario Fund . Ontario Power Generation will remain the majority owner and operator, with the federal and provincial governments holding minority stakes.

In the weeks after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and critical minerals, demand grew for Ontario to cancel its contract with US-based GE Hitachi, the company supplying the small modular reactors (SMRs) and enriched uranium for the $21-billion project. Both Carney and Ford have promoted “buy Canadian” policies to shield domestic industry from US tariff threats. Yet, despite the project’s reliance on American suppliers, both leaders defended the investment as essential to meeting Ontario’s soaring energy needs.

“This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach,” Carney said. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity, and opportunities.”

Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Ottawa had earlier committed $970 million to the project.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

Carney said the project marks the start of a broader plan to fast-track large infrastructure and clean energy projects through Ottawa’s new major projects office as proof that “Canada can build big things again.”

Construction on the first reactor began in May, with completion expected in 2030. Once online, the four reactors will supply
