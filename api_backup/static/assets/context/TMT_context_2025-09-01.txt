[TITLE]Thoma Bravo to buy Verint in $2 billion deal as software acquisitions ramp up:
[TEXT]
Thoma Bravo will acquire Verint Systems in a $2 billion deal, including debt, the customer engagement platform said on Monday, marking the latest software buyout as private equity firms increasingly bet on AI to navigate an uncertain economy.

Software companies have emerged as prime acquisition targets as adoption of artificial intelligence and recurring revenue prove to be resilient markers in an economy pressured by tariffs and volatile customer spending.

Under the agreement, Verint shareholders will receive $20.50 per share in cash. The offer represents a premium of 4.2 per cent to the stock's closing price on June 30, before the talks were first reported, and implies an equity deal value of $1.23 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Shares of Verint — which provides an AI-powered platform to help enterprises organize, manage and improve customer interactions across various channels and digital operations — were down 1.2 per cent at $20.23.

The stock has lost 25 per cent of its value so far this year, pressured by strong competition and declining revenue in the past two quarters.

Still, some analysts expect Verint's focus on AI bots to result in higher demand as enterprise customers invest in automation and efficiency.

"We believe this was a strategic move for both entities as these organizations are closely aligned in terms of customer experience automation that leverages data and AI, with Thoma Bravo already heavily invested in this market," Wedbush analysts said in a note.

Thoma Bravo, which had about $184 billion in assets under management as of March 31, is among the largest software-focused investors globally. The private equity firm has acquired or invested in more than 530 software and technology companies.

Earlier this month, it had signed a $12 billion deal to acquire human resources software provider Dayforce.

The latest deal is expected to close before the end of Verint's current fiscal year.

Intel amended its deal with the U.S. Department of Commerce "to remove earlier project milestones," reports Reuters , "and received about $5.7 billion in cash sooner than planned.""The move will give Intel more flexibility over the funds."The move makes the Wall Street Journal wonder what, beyond equity, the U.S. now gets in return, calling government's position " a stake without a strategy ."But that only goes so far, the article seems to conclude, offering this quote from an analyst Bernstein investment research. "If Intel can prove they can make these leading-edge products in high volume that meets specifications at a good cost structure, they'll have customers lined up around the block. If they can't prove they can do it, what customer will put meaningful volume to them regardless of what pressure the U.S. government brings to bear?"CBS News also notes the U.S. government stake "is being criticized by conservatives and some economic policy experts alike , who worry such extensive government intervention undermines free enterprise."Thanks to Slashdot reader joshuark for sharing the news.

Japan pledges $68bn investment in India

TOKYO: Japan pledged Friday to invest $68 billion in India during a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Tokyo, as the two countries agreed to deepen security ties. “India’s massive market is so full of potential that incorporating its vibrancy will help drive the growth of Japan’s economy,” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters.

Bilateral trade is currently worth over $20 billion annually, heavily favoring Japan. Speaking during Modi’s two-day stopover before he visits China, Ishiba said Japan would boost investment in India to 10 trillion yen ($68 billion) and would establish a cooperation initiative focusing on semiconductors and AI.

The two sides also pledged to bolster security cooperation, with Kyodo news agency reporting that the two had agreed to expand drills between Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and the Indian Armed Forces. The nations also expressed “serious concern” over the situation in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, in a separate joint statement, according to Kyodo.

“As the international situation grows more and more uncertain, Japan and India must join hands for the sake of peace and stability of the region,” Ishiba told reporters. Modi said that “India and Japan are fully committed to a free, open, peaceful, prosperous and rules-based Indo-Pacific”.

Earlier Modi told a business forum in Tokyo that India and Japan will “shape the Asian Century”, with India “the springboard for Japanese businesses to the Global South”. Both countries have been hit by tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, with levies of 50 percent on many Indian imports into the United States taking effect this week.

Japan’s vital auto sector still faces 25 percent tariffs as a July trade deal cutting them—as well as additional “reciprocal” levies—is yet to come into force. Modi and Ishiba are set to tour a chip facility on Saturday. They will also visit a factory making “shinkansen” bullet trains, with a view to Japan assisting in a planned 7,000-kilometre (4,350-mile) high-speed rail network by the centenary of Indian independence in 2047.

A joint project aimed at building a first high-speed link between the western Indian cities of Mumbai and Ahmedabad has been plagued for years with delays and cost overruns. Modi is due at a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China on Sunday and Monday, hosted by President Xi Jinping and also attended by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

The visit will be Modi’s first to China since 2018. The two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia and fought a deadly border clash in 2020. But relations began to thaw last October when Modi met with Xi for the first time in five years at a summit in Russia. — AFP

[TITLE]Truist Upgrades Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to Buy, Lifts Price Target to $213:
[TEXT]
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the AI Stocks Hit with New Analyst Ratings. On August 26, Truist Securities analyst William Stein upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy with a price target of $213.00 (from $173.00).

The rating upgrade reflects the booming demand from data centers and the accelerated momentum in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. According to Stein, hyperscalers are increasingly considering AMD as a genuine partner instead of considering it as merely a “price check” against rival Nvidia.

The company is no longer a secondary player in the AI hardware race, noted Stein, anticipating that it will secure close to 10% of GPU market share overtime.

Stein has also increased his earnings per share (EPS) estimates, now anticipating a calendar year 2027 EPS of $7.89. Moreover, the company’s newly launched MI355 chip is likely to be a key driver of growth in the coming quarters.

“Constructive view from the field. For the last several years, our industry contacts (component buyers/sellers) have told us that hyperscale customers deploying AI were experimenting with AMD’s technology as a “price check” to NVDA (Buy), nothing more. Over the last month or so, contacts have increasingly noted that hyperscalers are working with AMD in a partnership manner, expressing true interest in deploying AMD at scale. We fine tune our model, establish CY27 EPS at $7.89, set our PT to $213 (up fr. $173), and upgrade to Buy.”

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) develops and sells semiconductors, processors, and GPUs for data centers, gaming, AI, and embedded applications.

While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]New faculty to tackle digitisation challenges:
[TEXT]
THE new Faculty of Artificial Intelligence and Engineering (FAIE) at Multimedia University (MMU) is among the key faculties capable of addressing new challenges in digitalisation, digital transformation, and AI in the country, says Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

“Exposing our people to AI and ensuring they master it is critical to meeting future needs.

“And our young people must see this as a shared responsibility,” he said when launching the faculty – the first at a private higher education institution to focus on AI and applied AI – at MMU on Aug 18.

MMU president Prof Datuk Dr Mazliham Mohd Su’ud said the FAIE, which is strengthened by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission’s (MCMC) flagship AI Transformation Centre (AIX), will see the varsity reshaping its programmes to equip students for an AI-driven economy.

Underpinned by a joint investment of RM37mil – RM32mil by MCMC and RM5mil by MMU – AIX will feature 13 advanced laboratories, serving as a hub for innovation, government-industry-academia collaboration, SME development as well as rural empowerment.

During the event, which was also attended by Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil and Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo, MMU and the MCMC formalised their collaboration with the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to strengthen FAIE’s teaching and research capabilities.

The varsity also inked an MoU with telecommunications and information technology solutions provider ZTE Corporation to collaborate on talent development initiatives in the fields of 5G, AI and digital transformation.

The partnership marks a significant step in bridging academia and industry, equipping students and professionals with globally recognised ICT certifications and skills to thrive in the fast-evolving digital economy.

Under the MoU, MMU will be an authorised training and examination centre for ZTE Certification, a professional and comprehensive technical certification system that covers multiple ICT domains, including 5G, AI, wireless, core networks, and transmission.

The programme offers three certification levels: Associate (ZCIA), Professional (ZCIP), and Expert (ZCIE), enabling participants to progress from foundational knowledge to expert-level proficiency.

[TITLE]Another artificial intelligence deal collapses — as Colorado lawmakers’ budget fixes near finish line:
[TEXT]
Colorado’s first-in-the-nation regulations on artificial intelligence may have to wait longer if the legislature approves a proposal advanced by the state Senate on Monday.

In a dramatic shift from Sunday night, when a deal on revamped regulations appeared within reach, Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez gutted the bill. The measure, proposed during a mostly budget-focused special session, had been aimed at regulating AI and increasing transparency around its use to make decisions affecting Coloradans.

Instead, the bill as amended would simply delay, by several months, the implementation of a law passed 2024 that is supposed to go into effect next February.

Under Rodriguez’s proposal, which still needs to pass the state House, those regulations would take effect at the end of June — giving the tech industry, lawmakers, and public-interest and consumer-protection groups another chance during the next regular session to nail down how to regulate the growing, affluent industry. The regular session convenes in mid-January.

“Overnight, the tech industry decided that they were so unhappy with the compromise that had been achieved by consumer-protection organizations, educators, labor and business that they would rather return to the (existing rules),” said Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and driving figure on AI regulations in the state.

The legislature met for its latest special session chiefly to address a $783 million budget deficit brought on by tax cuts and spending changes made by the federal government in July. But the AI regulations, which drew the ire of an industry that argues they are unworkable, was also specifically designated for new consideration in Gov. Jared Polis’ recall of the legislature this month.

Most budget-related bills finished

By the end of the fifth day of the session on Monday, the Democratic majority had sent to Polis the bulk of the bills they hoped would bite into the deficit. The single biggest revenue-raising measure, however, still needed at least two more votes.

The bills that have passed the legislature are:

House Bill 1001, which makes permanent a limit on certain business income deductions for people making more than $500,000 per year.

House Bill 1002, which cracks down on the use of foreign tax havens and adds several countries to that label.

House Bill 1003, which ends a tax incentive for insurance companies that keep offices in the state.

House Bill 1005, which ends a state subsidy to businesses for collecting sales taxes.

In total, those measures are expected to raise about $150 million. The fifth measure, House Bill 1004, would allow certain entities to sell tax credits that can be reclaimed at a discount in future tax years. Lawmakers expect that to bring in another $100 million, for a total of just over $250 million.

"Right now, we need to ensure that the families and the small businesses that truly need our help are getting it," said Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Jefferson County Democrat.

The revenue-raisers amount to nearly a third of the total $783 million budget gap. Polis' staff is preparing to address as much as a third of the gap through spending cuts. His office is expected to reveal its planned reductions later this week, after the revenue part has been adopted.

The rest of the hole will be filled from the legislature's piggy bank. That'll happen last: Whatever's not raised or cut will be pulled from the state's reserves. The governor's office has suggested roughly $320 million, which would reduce the current reserve level -- about 15% of the general fund budget -- by 2 percentage points.

That would mean his office was planning to propose about $200 million in spending reductions.

Liability at issue on AI

On the AI front, Rodriguez’s bill was sent Monday over to the House, where members have already debated a competing AI measure -- one that had also been watered down to simply delaying the 2024 regulations, in that case until October 2026. The House planned to take up Rodriguez's bill in committee and potentially for an initial floor vote Monday night, which would make a final vote possible Tuesday.

How to assign liability for bias apparent in the use of AI to make decisions -- between entities that use AI for things like screening job and rental applications and the entities that developed the AI tools -- was a key part of Rodriguez's measure before its gutting.

But that has been a key sticking point between the dueling bills.

“A delay is the prudent thing to do,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat and sponsor of the House bill, said. “We need to figure out a way where school districts, hospitals and other deployers aren’t left holding the bag for these regulations.
