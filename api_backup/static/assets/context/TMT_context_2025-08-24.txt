[TITLE]US Government Makes $8.9B Investment to Take 10% Stake in Intel:

[TITLE]Trump, Intel announce deal giving US a 10% stake in chipmaker:
[TEXT]

Chipmaker Intel has agreed to give the US government a 10-percent stake in its business, the company and President Donald Trump announced Friday.

The deal came after Trump’s administration said Intel should give Washington an equity stake in exchange for large grants committed when Joe Biden was president.

Under the agreement, the US government will receive 433.3 million shares of common stock, representing a 9.9 percent stake in the company, Intel said in a statement.

This amounts to an $8.9 billion investment, funded partially by $5.7 billion in grants awarded but not yet paid under the CHIPS and Science Act — a major law passed during Biden’s term that Trump has criticized.

The other $3.2 billion comes from an award to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program, Intel said.

The $8.9 billion investment would be in addition to $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants Intel has already received, taking the full amount to $11.1 billion, the company added.

“The United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

He claimed that the country “paid nothing for these shares” after negotiations with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

Intel noted in its statement: “The government’s investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no board representation or other governance or information rights.”

Referring to a meeting with Intel last week, Trump told reporters Friday: “I said, I think you should pay us 10 percent of your company.”

“I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner… they’ve agreed to do it, and I think it’s a great deal for them.”

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Friday on X: “This historic agreement strengthens US leadership in semiconductors.”

– ‘Slippery slope’ –

Intel is one of Silicon Valley’s most iconic companies, but its fortunes have been dwarfed by Asian powerhouses TSMC and Samsung, which dominate the made-to-order semiconductor business.

The CHIPS and Science Act was aimed at strengthening the US semiconductor industry, and the Biden administration had unveiled billions in grants through it.

It finalized a $7.9 billion award in direct funding to Intel in November 2024, according to a US Department of Commerce statement.

“This is a slippery slope,” independent tech analyst Rob Enderle said of the United States taking a stake in Intel.

“This is one of those things that kind of brings chills because it’s a step toward nationalizing private business.”

Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute, a Washington think tank that promotes limited government, said on X Friday that the government having a stake in Intel would be “a terrible decision, bad for almost everyone.”

He said it would be “bad for Intel’s long-term viability, as politics, not commercial considerations, increasingly drive its decisions” and that “foreign governments might also target it.”

In a statement, Tan of Intel said it is “deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made.”

The company said it is investing more than $100 billion to expand its US sites.

Earlier this month, Trump had demanded Tan resign after a Republican senator raised national security concerns over his links to firms in China.

Japan-based tech investor SoftBank Group also recently said it would invest $2 billion in Intel.

[TITLE]U.S. government considers taking equity stakes in semiconductor firms under CHIPS Act:
[TEXT]
The U.S. government is considering taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies in exchange for cash grants provided under the CHIPS Act. The move aims to boost domestic chip production and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers. Craig Lutnick, a senior government official, supports this approach as it would ensure taxpayer money is effectively invested in the semiconductor industry.

Sam Bessent, an influential industry strategist, also backs the initiative, particularly investments in Intel Corporation to stabilize U.S. chip production. The proposal involves taking non-voting equity stakes, meaning the government would not control company operations but would benefit from financial returns if the companies perform well. Intel is at the forefront of discussions.

An illustration from August 19, 2025, shows an Intel processor alongside the U.S. flag, symbolizing the importance of domestic chip manufacturing. This potential strategy is part of broader efforts by U.S. policymakers to strengthen the nation’s technological infrastructure and secure supply chains amid global semiconductor shortages. The CHIPS Act, which stands for Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors, was established to provide significant federal investments in the semiconductor industry.

Discussions on equity stakes are ongoing, with no final decisions made. However, industry experts believe such a move could provide necessary funding to boost the semiconductor sector while offering a return on investment to taxpayers. The idea of federal government investments in public corporation stock still lingers, but history suggests there are significant pitfalls for the United States.

Steven Feldstein and Jodi Vittori of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace highlighted potential risks, stating, “Considering the Trump administration’s self-dealing and erosion of accountability, there is an acute risk that the U.S. sovereign wealth fund could become a source of graft to reward Trump’s friends, coerce political support for his priorities and bring personal enrichment.”

The concept of federal investment in public companies has never found lasting favor on Capitol Hill due to numerous economic, political, and philosophical issues. A fund with the authority to purchase corporate stock would become one of the largest and most potent market investors. This raises conflicts of interest, such as the government being a major shareholder in a company it might prosecute for criminal activity, or its financial interests conflicting with its social goals.

Government stakes in semiconductor firms

The federal government taking an equity stake in a public company isn’t unprecedented. In 2009, the Obama administration acquired a 60.8% ownership of General Motors in exchange for nearly $50 billion in bailout funds.

They also acquired a smaller stake in Chrysler, subsequently sold to Fiat. These bailouts were emergency measures to prevent the auto industry’s collapse and were intended to be temporary. The government subsequently sold the last of its GM holdings in 2013, reporting a direct loss of

[TITLE]Intel and Trump Administration Reach Historic Agreement to Accelerate American Technology and Manufacturing Leadership:
[TEXT]
"As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the U.S., Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world's most advanced technologies are American made," said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. "President Trump's focus on U.S. chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country's economic and national security. We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership."

"Intel is excited to welcome the United States of America as a shareholder, helping to create the most advanced chips in the world," said Howard Lutnick, United States Secretary of Commerce. "As more companies look to invest in America, this administration remains committed to reinforcing our country's dominance in artificial intelligence while strengthening our national security."

Intel Corporation today announced an agreement with the Trump Administration to support the continued expansion of American technology and manufacturing leadership. Under terms of the agreement, the United States government will make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.The government's equity stake will be funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program. Intel will continue to deliver on its Secure Enclave obligations and reaffirmed its commitment to delivering trusted and secure semiconductors to the U.S. Department of Defense. The $8.9 billion investment is in addition to the $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants Intel has received to date, making for a total investment of $11.1 billion.Under the terms of today's announcement, the government agrees to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel common stock at a price of $20.47 per share, equivalent to a 9.9 percent stake in the company. This investment provides American taxpayers with a discount to the current market price while enabling the U.S. and existing shareholders to benefit from Intel's long-term business success.The government's investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights. The government also agrees to vote with the Company's Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.The government will receive a five-year warrant, at $20 per share for an additional five percent of Intel common shares, exercisable only if Intel ceases to own at least 51% of the foundry business.The existing claw-back and profit-sharing provisions associated with the government's previously dispersed $2.2 billion grant to Intel under the CHIPS Act will be eliminated to create permanency of capital as the company advances its U.S. investment plans.Intel has continued to strategically invest in research, development and manufacturing in the United States since the company's founding in 1968. Over the last five years, Intel has invested $108 billion in capital and $79 billion in R&D, the majority of which were dedicated to expanding U.S.-based manufacturing capacity and process technology.Intel is currently undertaking a significant expansion of its domestic chip making capacity, investing more than $100 billion to expand its U.S. sites. The company's newest chip fabrication site in Arizona is expected to begin high-volume production later this year, featuring the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing process technology on U.S. soil.Since joining the company as CEO in March, Tan has taken swift actions to strengthen Intel's financial position, drive disciplined execution and revitalize an engineering-first culture. Today's agreement supports the company's broader strategy to position Intel for the future.Intel's U.S. investments come as many leading technology companies support President Trump's agenda to achieve U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.Intel is deeply engaged with current and potential customers and partners who share its commitment to building a strong and resilient U.S. semiconductor supply chain.Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft: "The decades-long partnership between Microsoft and Intel has pioneered new frontiers of technology and showcased the very best of American ingenuity and innovation. Intel's continued investment in strengthening the U.S. semiconductor supply chain, supported by President Trump's bold strategy to rebuild this critical industry on American soil, will benefit the country and broader technology ecosystem for years to come."Michael Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dell Technologies: "The industry needs a strong and resilient U.S. semiconductor industry, and no company is more important to this mission than Intel. It's great to see Intel and the Trump Administration working together to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. Dell fully supports these shared priorities, and we look forward to bringing a new generation of products to market powered by American-designed and manufactured Intel chips."Enrique Lores, President and CEO, HP: "We share Intel's and the Trump Administration's deep commitment to building a strong, resilient and secure U.S. semiconductor industry.

[TITLE]AI boom in Australia: Amazon investment sparks debate on artificial intelligence and housing shortage – Jason Murphy:
[TEXT]
But what do we actually get for the money? Just data centres.

If I was making a list of things Australia should be doing with concrete and air-conditioning, it would not include making data centres. What we need desperately, what we are horribly short of, is homes.

House prices are zooming up, and not just from speculation.

We’ve had huge inflation in the cost of building. Building a house from scratch costs around A$500,000, depending on its size and location. Maybe as much as a million bucks. And the inflation data tell us that price is up 39% compared with 2020.

Even renovation costs a bomb. Chucking a renovation on a small old home is now an A$500,000+ activity.

Jeff Bezos' Amazon wants to build data centres in Australia. Photo / Getty Images

Why is building houses expensive? For a lot of reasons.

One is the tradie shortage. Prices for getting the plumbing and wiring and framework of a house all put in are up sharply. Concrete slabs cost a fortune now.

Australia needs new homes. Photo / Getty Images

When it comes to these data centres, Amazon is supplying the capital, the money, which is nice. But money is not something Australia is super short of.

We have trillions in the national superannuation fund that’s just plonked in the sharemarket. (In fact, we have more super funds than the whole sharemarket is worth, so we now have to invest in other countries’ sharemarkets too.)

What we are short of is skilled people. Unemployment is at a historically low 4.3% right now. Unemployment among trades workers (people whose last job was in the trades) is
