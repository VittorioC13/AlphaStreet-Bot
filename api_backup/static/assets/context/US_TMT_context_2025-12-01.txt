[TITLE]The new battlefield: where capital, regulation and technology collide:
[TEXT]
Over the past decade, private capital inflows into the defense sector have risen more than eighteen-fold—reflecting a shift driven by geopolitical instability, digitization of the battlefield, and the recognition that public procurement systems alone cannot deliver capability at the speed required.

General Sir Richard Barrons KCB CBE, former Commander of the UK’s Joint Forces Command, who spoke at a recent defense industry seminar hosted by Goodwin, describes the current landscape as one where speed of innovation and adaptability count as much as might. The character of conflict is changing: autonomy, cyber operations, commercial satellites, AI-enabled decision support, and low-cost precision systems now shape both deterrence and combat. The advantage belongs not only to the strong, but to the fast.

A Procurement System Outpaced by Reality

NATO governments are increasing defense spending, but industrial mobilization has not kept pace with operational needs. Legacy procurement cycles—built for platforms measured in decades—struggle to accommodate technologies that evolve in months. Military conflicts in recent years underscore the challenge: the demand for drones, counter-UAS systems, digital intelligence platforms, and rapid munitions production has exceeded traditional supply pipelines.

This gap has opened space for venture-backed and private-equity-backed companies that move faster than legacy primes, drawing on commercial innovation models, modular hardware architectures, and software iteration loops. These firms are reshaping segments from space-based ISR to battlefield networking to electronic warfare.

But speed alone is not enough.

The Real Due Diligence Challenge

Defense technology companies operate in markets where technical merit is only one dimension. Evaluating them requires fluency in:

Mission fit: Does the solution address an operational need, not just a technical possibility?

Integration pathways: Can it plug into existing platforms or command architectures?

Security and classification readiness: Can the company operate within clearance or proxy regimes?

Procurement literacy: Does leadership understand acquisition cycles and end-user engagement?

In early-stage commercial tech, product-market fit often answers the core investment question. In defense, mission-solution fit is the gating factor.

Regulation as Strategy

The regulatory environment surrounding defense investment has sharpened. CFIUS review, ITAR and EAR export controls, beneficial ownership transparency, and foreign LP considerations now shape both deal structure and deal timing.

Sponsors increasingly begin regulatory strategy at the term-sheet stage. Ownership structures, governance rights, data access, and technology control plans are modeled alongside capital structure. In transactions with foreign capital participation, these questions can become dispositive.

In today’s market, a company’s defensibility is not only

[TITLE]Deal emerges from antitrust lawsuit that alleged landlords used pricing software for ‘algorithmic collusion’ to drive up rent:
[TEXT]
Landlords could no longer rely on rent-pricing software to quietly track each other’s moves and push rents higher using confidential data, under a settlement between RealPage Inc. and federal prosecutors to end what critics said was illegal “algorithmic collusion.”

The deal announced Monday by the Department of Justice follows a yearlong federal antitrust lawsuit, launched during the Biden administration, against the Texas-based software company. RealPage would not have to pay any damages or admit any wrongdoing. The settlement must still be approved by a judge.

RealPage software provides daily recommendations to help landlords and their employees nationwide price their available apartments. The landlords do not have to follow the suggestions, but critics argue that because the software has access to a vast trove of confidential data, it helps RealPage’s clients charge the highest possible rent.

“RealPage was replacing competition with coordination, and renters paid the price,” said DOJ antitrust chief Gail Slater, who emphasized that the settlement avoided a costly, time-consuming trial.

Under the terms of the proposed settlement, RealPage can no longer use that real-time data to determine price recommendations. Instead, the only nonpublic data that can be used to train the software’s algorithm must be at least one year old.

“What does this mean for you and your family?” Slater said in a video statement. “It means more real competition in local housing markets. It means rents set by the market, not by a secret algorithm.”

RealPage attorney Stephen Weissman said the company is pleased the DOJ worked with them to settle the matter.

“There has been a great deal of misinformation

[TITLE]Baidu is emerging as a major AI chip player in China to fill the Nvidia gap:
[TEXT]
A general view of the Baidu logo is seen at the Shanghai New Expo Center during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 28, 2025.

Tech giant Baidu is emerging as one of China's key artificial intelligence chip players, positioning itself as a challenger to Huawei as both look to fill the void left by industry leader Nvidia being kept out of the country.

Best-known as China's biggest search business, Baidu has in recent years refocused its business around driverless cars and AI, including a majority-owned subsidiary, Kunlunxin, which designs chips.

Several analysts have upgraded their outlook on Baidu's stock over the past few weeks, citing the semiconductor business and forecasting the unit will gain more domestic orders.

This month, Baidu laid out a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, beginning with the M100 in 2026 and the M300 in 2027. The company already uses a mix of its self-developed chips in its data centers to run its ERNIE AI models, as well as Nvidia products.

Baidu makes money by selling its chips to third parties building data centers as well as renting out computing capacity via its cloud. It has sought to position itself as a so-called "full stack" AI offering with infrastructure made up of chips, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.

And the chip business appears to be gaining traction. Earlier this year, Kunlunxin won orders from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.

"Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high- performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note this month.

While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely regarded as the most advanced chips for training and running AI, the company has been blocked by the U.S. government from selling its top-end product to China. Beijing has also reportedly been persuading local tech companies not to buy the H20, a less powerful Nvidia chip designed for the Chinese market and greenlit for export.

With Huawei — the leading player through its massive clusters of chips — out of the picture, analysts are suggesting Baidu will fill the void and its chip business is set for explosive growth.

"We believe domestic demand for AI compute in China remains intense, and hyperscalers are increasingly sourcing from local solution providers," JPMorgan said in a note on Sunday. "We view Kunlun AI chip as one of the best positioned."

The investment bank analysts forecast Baidu chips sales to increase six-fold to reach 8 billion Chinese yuan ($1.1 billion) in 2026.

Analysts at Macquarie estimate that Baidu's Kunlun chip unit could be valued at about $28 billion.

Baidu is not alone among China's tech giants when it comes to self-developed semiconductors. CNBC reported in August that Alibaba is also developing its next-generation AI chip.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is likely to slash backhaul spectrum pricing by as much as 50%, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would ease the financial burden of telecom operators and allow them to save a few hundred crores annually. Telcos currently pay 0.15-3.95% of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as charges for utilising backhaul airwaves. The rate varies depending on the number of backhaul carriers used.Backhaul spectrum, or the radio frequency used by telecom firms to connect cell towers, is given administratively by the government. Under the current methodology, the charge for the airwaves escalates based on the number of carriers a telco has and is calculated as a percentage of AGR by applying a weighted average formula. The telecom industry currently pays about Rs 4,000 crore annually for utilising backhaul spectrum, according to industry executives.“Trai’s recommendations are expected in the coming days,” an official told ET on condition of anonymity. “The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will take a final call on the issue after analysing the proposals.” During consultations, the telcos sought a flat and low rate for using backhaul spectrum. They stressed that the pricing of the airwaves was fixed when access or mobile spectrum was provided administratively. However, currently, carriers acquire access spectrum through competitive auctions and, therefore, backhaul spectrum pricing requires substantial rationalisation.Backhaul spectrum consists of microwave access (MWA) and microwave backbone (MWB) frequencies. Officials told ET that Trai is considering reducing prices for MWA carriers by around 50%, while fixing a low flat rate for MWB carriers. Cheaper backhaul spectrum would benefit not only telcos but also end users, the industry feels.Telcos feel it allows for equitable access to telecom services. Frequencies in the 7/13/15/18/21 GHz bands are among those used as backhaul spectrum. Further, the E band (71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz) is primarily used for 5G backhaul. The usage of V band spectrum (57-64 GHz and 64-71 GHz) has not become prevalent so far.After the 5G spectrum auction in 2022, airwaves in the E band were given provisionally to telecom firms on an administrative basis for 5G backhaul. While both the regulator and the DoT were open to auctioning backhaul spectrum earlier, the notification of the new Telecommunications Act changed the scenario. According to the Act, backhaul spectrum has to be given administratively. Therefore, the regulator will now deliberate pricing accordingly.

[TITLE]Europe backs secure satellite communications with multibillion euro package:
[TEXT]
Europe backs secure satellite communications with multibillion euro package

by Erica Marchand

Paris, France (SPX) Nov 28, 2025

European governments have backed a 2.1 billion euro funding package to expand secure satellite communications services, confirming support for space-based connectivity at the European Space Agency Council meeting at Ministerial Level in Bremen, Germany. The subscription will finance new and extended programmes intended to strengthen resilience, security and capacity in the satellite telecommunications sector for Europe and Canada.

ESA will direct the funding through its connectivity and secure communications portfolio, including the ARTES 4.0 (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems) programme. ARTES is designed to move technologies and services from concept to operational use, giving companies a framework to test and mature satellite communications hardware, software and applications before they enter the commercial market.

Activities under ARTES cover geostationary satellites, non-geostationary constellations and ground segment infrastructure, and have supported developments ranging from optical and quantum links to satellite-enabled 5G systems. The latest subscription will continue support for projects such as HummingSat and Novacom, which aim to keep European industry active in the geostationary communications satellite segment.

The funding will also advance optical and quantum communications capabilities intended to reduce dependence on non-European providers and improve protection against interception or disruption. The HydRON initiative focuses on an optical communications network in space, including an expanding set of optical ground stations, to enable high-capacity data transfer described as an internet in space.

Quantum key distribution will receive dedicated support through missions including SAGA, which contributes to the European Union's EuroQCI infrastructure, as well as Eagle-1, Eagle neXt and QKDSat. These missions are planned to test and demonstrate secure distribution of cryptographic keys via satellites, which can then connect into governmental and commercial networks on the ground.

ESA's connectivity programmes will also work toward closer integration of terrestrial and satellite 5G and future networks to provide continuous coverage across urban, rural and remote regions. The agency expects this work to support emerging direct-to-device services, in which standard user handsets connect directly to satellites for messaging, voice or data when out of reach of ground networks.

Aviation, maritime and cybersecurity applications form another pillar of the investment plan, with a focus on safety-related and operational communications. ESA highlighted the Iris Global system for air traffic management, which uses satellite links to support more efficient and lower-emission flight routes, and announced further work to safeguard radio-frequency spectrum against interference.

Part of the new subscription is linked to Europe's Secure Connectivity initiative IRIS2, for which ESA will qualify and validate a multi-orbit satellite constellation led by the SpaceRISE industrial consortium. IRIS2 is intended to provide government and commercial users with secure communications capacity and to serve as a basis for future space-based connectivity services.

The evolution of IRIS2 is set to underpin ESA's European Resilience from Space concept, which combines communications, Earth observation and navigation data to support emergency response and other time-critical operations. By linking these capabilities, authorities could receive near-real-time situational information along with robust links for coordination and decision-making.

ESA's Moonlight programme is another beneficiary of the decisions taken in Bremen, with ministers agreeing to continue development of lunar communications and navigation infrastructure. Moonlight aims to deploy dedicated satellites and surface equipment to provide communications and positioning services for the many missions expected to operate around and on the Moon in the coming decade.

ESA's Director of Connectivity and Secure Communications, Laurent Jaffart, said decisions at the ministerial conference will shape how ESA responds to Europe's growing demand for reliable, resilient and secure connectivity. He noted that with a subscription exceeding 2 billion euros, ESA plans to work with Member States, the European Commission and partners to reinforce Europe's leadership, autonomy and competitiveness in satellite communications.

[TITLE]Europe chooses resilient and secure space-enabled connectivity with €2.1 billion investment:
[TEXT]
In a time of profound technological and geopolitical challenges, Europe will continue to support the need for secure satellite communications. This was the clear message given at the European Space Agency's (ESA) Council meeting at Ministerial Level, in Bremen, Germany.

Over the past decades, ESA has elevated satellite connectivity by investing in pioneering ideas and technologies. Building upon this success, the continuation and growth of the programmes will further Europe’s and Canada’s competitiveness and strengthen our Members States’ leadership. By working in partnership with industry and academia, ESA will accelerate the delivery of advanced technology, products and services.

This landmark decision will see ESA contributing to Europe’s innovation, resilience and connectivity within the satellite telecommunications sector. The subscriptions will enable small and large companies across Europe and Canada to advance their competitiveness and respond to global challenges and opportunities.

About our programmes

ARTES 4.0

Our Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES) programme turns ideas into fully-fledged products, systems and services. The programme provides European and Canadian industry with the capacity to respond rapidly to global market and security challenges.

ARTES has enabled technologies to develop and companies to mitigate the inherent risk of innovation before entering the satellite communications market. From optical and quantum communications to space-based 5G connectivity, ESA has supported ground-breaking technology and talent.

With the current subscription for ARTES, we will continue to support European leadership in the GEO market through the HummingSat and Novacom projects. We will be able to deliver on optical and quantum communications, key technologies to further our autonomy and resilience. Our project HydRON will establish a true “internet of space” and further expand our network of optical ground stations. We will also advance secure communications through Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with our projects SAGA (supporting the European Union’s EuroQCI initiative), Eagle-1 and its follow-on Eagle neXt, and QKDSat.

In addition, we will continue developing 5G connectivity, investing in solutions that provide seamless connectivity by integrating ground and satellite networks. This will reinforce Europe’s position and offer an opportunity to step up our involvement in the direct-to-device revolution.

Our work on secure connectivity will extend to the fields of aviation, maritime operations, and cybersecurity. Significantly improving European air traffic management through Iris Global will deliver greener, safer, and more efficient air traffic management. Additionally, we will implement space capabilities to safeguard the radio-frequency spectrum from harmful interference.

ESA programme related to EU Secure Connectivity - IRIS2

Among uncertainties and global challenges, faster and more reliable connectivity is becoming imperative. The European Union’s third flagship space programme, IRIS2, aims to strengthen Europe’s essential communications services. It will also support a wide range of essential services, from government-authorised secure connectivity to commercial solutions. ESA will qualify and validate the development of this new multi-orbital satellite constellation, led by the SpaceRISE industrial consortium.

The evolution of IRIS2 will become the communication backbone for ESA’s European Resilience from Space initiative, a component of a multi-domain system of systems bringing together Earth Observation and Navigation. This will improve our ability to mitigate and manage emergencies and use the most advanced space assets for near real-time critical operations to better serve the needs of European citizens and governments.

[TITLE]AlphaTON Capital Secures $82.5 Million Strategic GPU Infrastructure to Power Privacy-First Decentralized Artificial Intelligence Cluster after Successful Pilot Launch of Telegram’s Cocoon AI:
[TEXT]
Dover, DE, Nov. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AlphaTON Capital Corp. (Nasdaq: ATON) ("AlphaTON" or the "Company"), a digital asset technology company focused on the Telegram and TON ecosystem, today announced it has entered into agreements to acquire and deploy a 1,000+ Nvidia B200 GPU high-performance compute cluster valued at approximately $68 million. This strategic infrastructure investment positions AlphaTON as a critical compute provider for Telegram’s Cocoon AI - the world’s largest decentralized, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence network, while creating a diversified revenue stream through high-performance compute and GPU rental services.

TRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND FINANCING

The transaction will be financed through a strategic capital structure consisting of:

$30 million in equity capital from AlphaTON Capital Corp.

$52.5 million in debt financing to be facilitated by Vertical Data’s GPU Financing division

Total project capitalization of approximately $82.5 million (includes additional working capital and deployment costs)

Total of $70M of high-value Nvidia hardware assets added to the balance sheet

The debt facility facilitated by Vertical Data to be fully amortized over 36 months, with the project maintaining debt service coverage ratios above 1.0x throughout the amortization schedule. The compute cluster will be held as a revenue-generating hard asset on AlphaTON's balance sheet.

STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERSHIP

AlphaTON has assembled a consortium of best-in-class infrastructure partners to deploy and operate the GPU cluster:

CUDO Compute – A leading European NVIDIA Cloud Partner (NCP), will serve as the primary deployment and operations partner for the GPU infrastructure. CUDO will lead cluster installation, orchestration, workload management and lifecycle operations, while also providing the commercialization engine through its GPU marketplace and AI services platform. CUDO’s operational stack ensures production-grade uptime, enterprise-grade telemetry and scalable multi-tenant governance across the full cluster.

SNET Energy UK Ltd – Providing expertise in sustainable-power data center development and AI infrastructure optimization, SNET Energy's involvement ensures technical excellence and alignment with decentralized AI principles.

Vertical Data – Beyond debt financing, Vertical Data will provide the GPU cluster and deployment services, and hardware sourcing.

HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS AND CAPABILITIES

The compute cluster will feature 1,000+ Nvidia B200-class GPUs, representing cutting-edge AI inference and training capabilities. The infrastructure is designed with a modular, upgradable architecture to accommodate rapid evolution in AI hardware and model architectures. The cluster will operate at 90% target utilization, serving dual revenue streams:

Dedicated Workloads for Cocoon AI – Priority allocation for Telegram/Cocoon AI's proprietary, privacy-preserving AI network External GPU Rentals – Monetization through CUDO Compute's marketplace, initially for bare metal compute and progressively for AI services

COMPELLING PROJECTED PROJECT ECONOMICS

The investment presents institutional-grade returns with strong downside protection:

Projected IRR: 59.7%

Projected NPV: $59.6 million

Projected Equity Multiply: 5x

Projected ROI: 615%

Projected Total Cash returned (5-year projection): $150 million

Revenue projections incorporate conservative assumptions, including 20% annual price compression in the first year and 10% in the following years, 90% utilisation rates, and comprehensive operating cost inflation. The financial Model demonstrates consistent EBITDA margin ranging from 64-73% over five year forecast horizon, with Year 1 gross profit margins of 32%

SUCCESSFUL PILOT LAUNCHED ON NOVEMBER 25, 2025

AlphaTON Capital announced the successful completion of a landmark pilot program utilizing Telegram’s innovative Cocoon AI infrastructure, a milestone made possible through a strategic collaboration that granted the firm early access. "Our strategic partnership with Telegram and Cocoon provided early access to the technology, and we successfully launched a Cocoon pilot on November 25, 2025," said Logan Golema, CTO of AlphaTON Capital. "Following this validation, we are now going to deploy the technology into our secure and decentralized AI hosting infrastructure to further enhance our network's scalability and performance."

STRATEGIC RATIONALE

Democratizing AI with “AI For Good”

As Artificial Intelligence becomes increasingly centralized among a few global technology giants, AlphaTON is committed to an “AI For Good” mandate. This initiative prioritizes ethical access, user data sovereignty, and environmental responsibility. By supporting Cocoon, AlphaTON is helping to build a sovereign compute layer where user data remains encrypted and private, and where content rights are respected—a direct alternative to the surveillance-capitalism models prevalent in the industry today.

“We believe the future of AI must be decentralized, private, and accessible to all, not hoarded within the walled gardens of Big Tech,” said Brittany Kaiser, Chief Executive Officer of AlphaTON Capital. “This investment is not just

[TITLE]Open Letter Pushing an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Halt : Why Its a Big Deal:
[TEXT]
What if the greatest minds in science and technology just told us to stop? Imagine a world where the relentless march of innovation is suddenly paused, not by lack of progress, but by a collective decision to safeguard humanity’s future. That’s exactly what happened when an open letter, signed by some of the most influential leaders in AI, ethics, and politics, called for a global halt on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Their message is clear: the race toward superintelligent AI, if left unchecked, could lead to irreversible consequences. This isn’t just a debate
