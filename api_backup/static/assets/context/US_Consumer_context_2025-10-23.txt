The bankruptcy court in Mumbai approved Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd ’s (RRVL) resolution plan for Kishore Biyani-promoted Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd (FSCSL), paving the way for the logistics arm of the erstwhile Future Group to formally join the Reliance stable.Before the tribunal’s approval, the secured lenders of the company had approved the revival plan submitted by Mukesh Ambani-promoted RRVL, with 91.71% voting in its favour.The successful revival plan proposes to pay Rs 170 crore to acquire the company. The bankrupt company’s major secured creditors include Azim Premji Trust IDFC First Bank and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction, which claimed dues of over Rs 485 crore. As per the latest available data with the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), the company’s total admitted claim stood at Rs 885 crore.“Approval of the resolution plan shall not be a ground for termination of any existing consents, approvals, licences, concessions, authorisations, permits or the like that has been granted to the corporate debtor...,” observed the division bench of judicial member Lakshmi Gurung and technical member, Hariharan Neelakanta Iyer, “...or for which the said corporate debtor has made an application for renewal, grant permissions, sanctions, consents, approvals, allowances, exemptions, etc.,” said the tribunal in its 36-page order.Before the tribunal’s approval, resolution professional Rajan Rawat, had informed the tribunal that out of seven bidders, two had submitted the resolution plan, through counsel Nausher Kohli. Later, one plan was withdrawn with the approval of CoC (committee of creditors) in its meeting held on April 18, 2024, and only one plan submitted by Reliance Retail Ventures was left with CoC.Originally, besides Reliance Retail Ventures and Tatkal Loan India, other bidders such as One City Infrastructure, Globe Ecologistics, Shanti G.D. Ispat & Power, Camions Logistics Solutions and Sugna Metals had shown interest in acquiring the company through the bankruptcy process.In January 2023, the company was admitted under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in an application filed by DHL Ecommerce (India) Pvt Ltd after the company defaulted on its dues of about Rs 7.26 crore.Mumbai-based Future Supply Chain Solutions is the country’s first fully integrated and IT-enabled end-to-end supply chain and logistics company, with capabilities in handling modern warehousing, express logistics, cold chain and e-commerce logistics.The company provides third-party logistics support to companies in sectors such as food and beverages, lifestyle, consumer electronics, automotive, engineering, home and furniture, healthcare, general merchandise and e-commerce.

[TITLE]UK's Biggest Retail Investment Platform Warns Against Including Bitcoin In Your Portfolio: 'Not An Asset Class,' 'No Intrinsic Value':
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Bitcoin is too risky to be included in investors’ portfolios, U.K.’s biggest retail investment platform says.

“Bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment – much riskier than stocks or bonds,” $225 billion asset manager Hargreaves Lansdown said last week. “The HL [Hargreaves Lansdown] Investment view is that bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn’t be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals.”

Don't Miss:

Hargreaves Lansdown added that, in its view, cryptocurrencies have “no intrinsic value.”

Hargreaves Lansdown’s statement came as the Financial Conduct Authority last week overturned a nearly six-year ban on the retail trading of spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes. While competitors like Interactive Investor and Saxo have largely opened their doors to cryptocurrency ETNs, HL said it will take the remaining months of the year to craft “the client journey and appropriateness assessment,” before offering cryptocurrency ETN trading to “appropriate clients.”

Meanwhile, under FCA rules, retail investors will be limited to Bitcoin- and Ethereum-based products on U.K. exchanges, such as the London Stock Exchange, Hargreaves Lansdown said. Investors may also be limited to allocating only up to 10% of their portfolio in cryptocurrency ETNs.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Hargreaves Lansdown’s statement aligns with sentiments from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon.

“I’m not personally a believer in Bitcoin itself, but you’re the customer—I don’t like to tell customers what they can and can’t do with their money,” Dimon told CNBC in August.

Still, the prevailing trend suggests that institutions are increasingly embracing cryptocurrencies. Among the prominent institutional backers of cryptocurrencies is the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).

“There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it’s an alternative,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CBS' "60 Minutes" in an interview aired on Sunday, while walking back 2017 remarks that Bitcoin was an “index of money laundering.”

[TITLE]AI and online shopping: how Shein, Temu and others get you hooked:
[TEXT]
In recent years, several websites selling ultra-low-cost goods have appeared on the French market. Shein, Temu and AliExpress, to name but a few, are shaking up the online retail landscape. According to a study conducted by BPCE Digital & Payments, the number of payment cards recording at least one monthly transaction on a discount site increased by 20% between the first quarters of 2022 and 2023.

This is hardly surprising given that Temu’s website has millions of French visitors every month, according to data from the Federation of E-commerce and Distance-Selling (FEVAD). In mid-July 2025, low-cost platforms accounted for 22% of parcels handled by the French postal service, compared with 5% five years ago. This increase is set to continue, with the sector expected to grow by a total of 6.5% in 2025.

Of course, the rampant inflation in France in recent years partly explains this craze. But this is not the only explanation for these developments. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is at the heart of the business model of these platforms, helps to build consumer loyalty.

Read more: The secret behind Temu’s rock-bottom prices

Behavioural profiling

In our latest articles on Shein and Temu, we analysed how these platforms operate behind the scenes. By analysing user behaviour data, the AI tools used by the platforms can identify the customers most likely to make a purchase and tailor the advertising messages they receive.

Predictive algorithms also analyse user behaviour to offer personalised recommendations. This approach aims to create a need before it even arises, by playing on feelings of scarcity and urgency. This is the famous Fomo, or “fear of missing out”.

These predictive algorithms have been around for many years, but their new capabilities, “augmented” by AI tools, are ushering in a new era, adapting even more finely and quickly to each Internet user. At the bottom of each page, there is a list of “items also viewed” by other users, which are similar to the product being searched for. This classic marketing technique is taken a step further: algorithms constantly submit new content to the customer to study their reaction. Every reaction (such as a click to add an item to a basket) is analysed in real time. The algorithm, supported by AI, then uses this data to encourage the user to buy other products that they did not initially come to look for.

Using play to sell

Gamification refers to the use of game mechanics for marketing purposes to capture customers’ attention.

On the Temu app, the interfaces are inspired by gambling games, which are known to be particularly addictive: wheels of fortune, countdowns highlighting limited-time offers, gifts and promotional codes to unlock, etc. These constant stimuli create a sense of urgency in the user, while disrupting the biochemical mechanism of the reward circuit. AI allows for greater precision and diversification of the “games” offered, to the detriment of buyers (and without their full awareness).

On Temu, mini-games integrated into the mobile app (such as Farmland and Fishland) promise free items and discount coupons. Points and voucher systems are used to encourage users to return to the site as often as possible, and personalised notifications are also sent at opportune moments, based on data collected

This Diwali turned out to be a blockbuster for retailers, with rate cuts under the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) giving consumption a noticeable push and encouraging middle-class families to fill their shopping bags with a wider range of products. Shoppers spent freely across categories — from lab-grown diamonds and casual wear to home furnishings — bringing both mass and premium markets to life.Raymond reported a revival in mid-market demand, particularly in the ₹1,000–₹2,500 range, after a quiet September. Ikea India also witnessed strong traction across price segments as customers looked for both design and affordability, The Times of India reported.Last year, high inflation combined with stagnant wages and a sluggish job market had forced many lower-income households to hold back on discretionary spending, weighing down overall demand. This year, the story looks very different.According to Crisil Ratings, an assessment of 40 organised apparel retailers — who together contribute

[TITLE]Food and Beverage Company Jongro Inks 7K-SF Storage Deal in Astoria:
[TEXT]
Food and beverage management company Jongro F&B, which manages several restaurant concepts in New York City, is taking storage space in Queens’ Astoria neighborhood, Commercial Observer has learned.

Jongro signed a five-year lease for approximately 7,000 square feet of flex space at Kassabian Associates’ 35-18 37th Street, according to broker Colliers. Asking rent was $21 per square foot.

Jongro’s new location between 35th and 36th avenues will be used for storage, warehouse, distribution and office space, Colliers said. The space — which was recently renovated by the landlord — will store supplies for Jongro’s existing restaurant concepts in the city, which include Korean restaurant Jongro BBQ, matcha cafe Nana’s Green Tea, barbecue restaurant Seven Scents and tea house Heytea.

“We’re continuing to see strong demand for these types of properties in the outer borough markets,” Joshua Kleinberg, an executive vice president at Colliers, said in a statement to CO.

Colliers’ Kleinberg, Daniel Mundle and Samuel Essery brokered the deal. Colliers will continue to market available space in the three-story Astoria building.

A spokesperson for Jongro did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for Kassabian could not be reached for comment.

News of the deal comes after another recent storage lease was signed in the neighborhood. In August, Piece of Cake Moving & Storage signed a deal for 4,500 square feet within an industrial property at 31-25 20th Avenue, as CO previously reported.

[TITLE]Gold glitters online as festive shoppers turn to e-commerce, quick commerce platforms for auspicious buys:
[TEXT]
Luxury and prosperity are shining bright this festive season, with online platforms like Amazon and BigBasket witnessing record demand for gold, silver, and fine jewellery purchases ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras.

Premium fashion on Amazon Fashion and Beauty has seen a sharp uptick, led by fine jewellery and luxury watches.

“This festive season, premium fashion is seeing remarkable growth, with luxury watches and gold and diamond jewellery — including lab-grown diamonds — driving demand,” said Siddharth Bhagat, Director, Amazon Fashion and Beauty, India.

Amazon reported a 96% year-on-year surge in gold jewellery sales, driven by brands such as CaratLane, PN Gadgil Jewellers, Joyalukkas, PC Chandra, KISNA, and Malabar Gold & Diamonds. The platform now offers more than five lakh styles across silver, gold, and diamond jewellery, making it the largest fine jewellery destination among online marketplaces.

Bhagat said the company is also seeing strong traction in affordable fine jewellery — with customers buying pieces starting at ₹2,000 for silver and up to ₹40,000 for gold and diamond. Demand for 14K daily-wear jewellery has grown 50 per cent year-on-year, while 18K styles are also gaining popularity.

In line with global trends, Amazon has expanded into lab-grown diamonds, offering jewellery starting at ₹1,699 across more than 50,000 styles. “Amazon is the first and only online marketplace focusing on this whitespace,” Bhagat said.

Gold coins remain a festive favourite, with the most purchased denomination being 2 grams. “Customers continue to prefer Amazon for their auspicious purchases of gold and silver coins during Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras and more,” Bhagat added.

Complementing this, Tata-owned bigbasket also recorded a strong Dhanteras, with gold coin sales rising 146 per cent and silver coins up 234 per cent from last year. Demand for pooja essentials — including diyas, flowers, and festive décor — grew 54 per cent year-on-year.

“Dhanteras is a time for prosperity, devotion, and togetherness. This year, bigbasket ensured our customers could celebrate without compromise, whether it was purchasing auspicious coins or getting the perfect gifts and pooja items in minutes,” said Seshu Kumar, Chief Buying and Merchandising Officer, bigbasket.

With 10-minute delivery and curated festive assortments, bigbasket blended technology and tradition, meeting last-minute festive needs — from auspicious buys to celebratory gifting.

Both platforms are capitalising on India’s accelerating shift toward online festive shopping, where authenticity, convenience, and trust are emerging as the new hallmarks of prosperity.
