[TITLE]AI is boosting the legacy business for top Indian IT firms, for now:
[TEXT]
Four of the country’s five largest offshore services providers have reported an increase in software modernization deals as Fortune companies prepare to automate much of their backend tech work.

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, and Wipro Ltd reported a significant uptick in such deals, according to their earnings calls with analysts for the second quarter ended September. Two of the four said artificial intelligence (AI) is expediting software upgrades to automate clients’ tech functions.

According to at least one analyst, TCS and Infosys are getting a higher share of such legacy or core modernization deals. These involve replacing or transforming a company’s old information technology (IT) software with new ones that can handle large amounts of data and perform AI tasks quickly.

Also Read | Why tech giants want fewer freshers and more specialists

“...firms are investing in their digital core, preparing them for AI. This requires them to modernize much of their legacy so they can more easily get at the data," said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of Everest Research. “...Firms have long wanted to modernize their legacy, but the (high) cost has caused them to defer this expense. AI and the AI-related tools are significantly reducing the cost."

For homegrown IT services companies, such contracts offer an opportunity at a time when the $283-billion sector faces an uncertain FY26 due to tariff fluctuations and visa flip-flops in the US.

TCS, Infosys lead

“...As you would appreciate, many of our customers globally have a lot of technology debt that they have carried over the years," K Krithivasan, chief executive officer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said during the company’s post-earnings analyst call on 9 October. “GenAI and Agentic AI are powerful tools to really address the tech debt. You can use these AI, GenAI to understand the legacy code, and forward-engineer and deliver the new code. Modernization with AI is a huge opportunity, and we are seeing a significant uptick across customers."

According to Krithivasan, these are short-term deals that can be completed within a quarter. TCS's management also noted that the company is actively looking at delivering business outcomes with AI in a matter of weeks as part of its AI strategy for customers.

The Mumbai-based firm is also eyeing heightened deal activity in application support services and software development.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh called the overhaul of legacy software a huge opportunity because of AI.

“...in the past, without the AI tools, you could do modernization, but clients needed a longer time horizon. With some of the AI tools, the time horizon becomes less and as a consequence, the ROI (return on investment) for the client on that program is much better," Parekh said in response to Mint’s question during the company’s post-earnings press conference on 16 October. “What we anticipate now is, as the AI tools mature, we will see more and more of them (AI) being deployed on the modernization program."

According to Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, TCS and Infosys have the “highest exposure by volume", especially in banking, insurance, and healthcare, where legacy systems create both the biggest risk and biggest opportunity. “Wipro and HCLTech have been more aggressive repositioning as transformation partners rather than maintenance shops."

While TCS and Infosys said AI is hastening legacy modernization, India’s third-largest software services provider HCLTech said the spending on non-essential IT services is also gaining momentum because of tech transformation deals.

“I think the biggest demand elasticity is in modernization. While discretionary spend is whatever it is, we are seeing a number of programs which are coming up based on legacy modernization," said CEO C Vijayakumar during the company’s post-earnings call with analysts on 13 October. He said the clients who were skeptical

[TITLE]The S&P 500 is close to market peak based on how many ‘bear market signposts’ it’s hitting, BofA says: a whopping 60%:
[TEXT]
Bank of America Research has issued a fresh warning for equity investors: the S&P 500, now hovering near historic highs, is demonstrating elevated risk levels with 60% of the firm’s proprietary “bear market signposts” flashing red—just shy of the point that has historically heralded a market peak. The bank’s S&P 500 Relative Value Cheat Sheet, published Monday, reflected growing caution among the team led by Head of U.S. Equity Strategy Savita Subramanian.

Subramanian’s team argued that investors should be increasingly selective, as the broad index has become “statistically expensive on everything.” All 20 of the valuation metrics tracked by her team are at expensive levels, and in fact have never been more expensive in several key areas, including market cap to GDP. The S&P 500 is also trading above its Tech Bubble levels on nine different metrics, Subramanian’s team noted.

BofA’s methodology tracks 10 signals that tend to precede cyclical market tops. Currently, six out of these ten are triggered, including elevated price-to-earnings ratios, extreme outperformance of high-multiple stocks compared to cheaper ones, and loosening credit conditions. Historically, major market peaks have occurred when roughly 70% of these indicators were triggered, making today’s 60% worryingly close. According to BofA’s strategists, these “bear market signposts — the triggers that typically precede an S&P 500 peak — suggest additional caution.”

Subramanian is far from the only analyst urging caution. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management CIO Lisa Shalett told Fortune earlier this month she was concerned

[TITLE]Stocks Pressured as Texas Instruments Drags Chipmakers Lower:
[TEXT]
The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is down -0.02%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.14%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down -0.18%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) are down -0.01%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) are down -0.16%.

Stock indexes are posting modest losses today, led by losses in chipmakers after Texas Instruments forecasted Q4 revenue that was below expectations. Other corporate earnings results today are mixed for stocks. Intuitive Surgical is up more than +16% after boosting its worldwide Da Vinci procedure growth forecast for the whole year. Also, Capital One Financial is up more than +3% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS. Conversely, Netflix is down more than -7% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 EPS.

US MBA mortgage applications fell -0.3% in the week ended October 17, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -5.2% and the refinancing sub-index up +4.0%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.37% from 6.42% in the prior week.

The markets are focusing on progress in US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods "if there isn't a deal" by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

The shutdown of the US government continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last three weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the Sep payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don't align with President Trump's priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts' expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets are lower today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.19%. China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.07%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.02%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are down -2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is up +0.8 bp to 3.963%. Supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $13 billion of 20-year T-bonds later today. Losses in T-notes are contained due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields are mixed today. The 10-year German bund yield is up +0.9 bp to 2.561%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 6.5-month low of 4.369% and is down -7.7 bp to 4.401%.

UK Sep CPI rose +3.8% y/y, unchanged from Aug and weaker than expectations of +4.0% y/y. Sep core CPI unexpectedly eased to +3.5% y/y from +3.6% y/y in Aug, weaker than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

US Stock Movers

Netflix (NFLX) is down more than -7% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after reporting Q3 EPS of $5.87, well below the consensus of $6.94.

Texas Instruments (TXN) is down more than -7% to lead chipmakers lower after forecasting Q4 revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.58 billion, with the midpoint below the consensus of $4.50 billion.

[TITLE]Nvidia’s First U.S.-Made Blackwell Wafer Marks a Milestone in AI Manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Key Takeaways Nvidia and TSMC have produced the first Blackwell wafer entirely on US soil , marking a major step toward domestic AI chip manufacturing.

signals progress toward reindustrialization, but full US-made Blackwell GPUs are still 1–2 years away. The initiative aligns with the US CHIPS Act and reshoring efforts , aimed at securing AI hardware supply chains and reducing reliance on Asia.

, aimed at securing AI hardware supply chains and reducing reliance on Asia. Meanwhile, Europe and the UK remain focused on research and IP through companies like ASML, NXP, and ARM, but lack comparable fabrication capacity.

Nvidia and TSMC have unveiled the first Blackwell wafer manufactured entirely on U.S. soil — a landmark moment for American semiconductor production.

Produced at TSMC’s cutting-edge Arizona facility, the wafer marks one of the earliest concrete steps toward reshoring advanced AI chipmaking back to the United States.

During its unveiling, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the wafer a “historic moment” for the industry. He described it as “The vision of President Trump of reindustrialization — to bring back manufacturing to America.”

The Blackwell wafer’s debut is a strong signal that U.S. facilities are gearing up for large-scale production. Still, the journey from wafer to a fully functional GPU is long — months of intricate layering, patterning, and rigorous testing lie ahead.

Nvidia and TSMC’s breakthrough highlights the bigger question: how close is America to real chip independence — and what milestones must come next?

From Wafer to Chip: How Far Away Are US-Made Blackwell GPUs?

The Arizona wafer unveiling marks only the first step in Nvidia’s U.S. chipmaking push.

At its core, a wafer is just the starting point — a thin slice of silicon that must pass through dozens of painstaking processes before it becomes a working GPU. Layering, patterning, etching, doping, and rigorous testing transform raw silicon into billions of transistors that power advanced AI chips.

At TSMC’s Arizona facility, engineers will use advanced process nodes to produce 2- to 4-nanometer wafers, as well as the upcoming A16 chips.

However, following this stage of production, much of the final packaging and assembly – the stage where chips are cut, stacked, and connected – is still expected to take place in Asia, at facilities in Taiwan or Japan.

Industry analysts suggest that Blackwell GPUs, which are entirely made in the US, are likely at least one or two years away from large-scale deployment. Given TSMC’s $100B investment in US chip facilities in March and Nvidia’s clear intent to shift its AI server supply chain to the US, stakeholders are likely to try to meet that timeline.

This milestone is both symbolically and strategically significant, as it proves that the domestic production of world-leading AI hardware is gaining real momentum and is looking increasingly within reach.

Reindustrialization and Onshoring: The Bigger Economic Vision

Nvidia’s Arizona milestone aligns closely with the broader US drive to reindustrialize its tech manufacturing base: a push accelerated by tariffs, CHIPS Act incentives, and reshoring policies aimed at reducing dependence on overseas foundries.

At the Blackwell wafer’s unveiling event, Jensen Huang described the moment as the “vision of reindustrialization” – bringing the world’s most important technology industry back to US soil.

The goal here is clear: the US wants to secure its place not just as the center of AI innovation, but also the chief producer of the hardware that powers it.

Local fabrication plants (fabs), such as TSMC Arizona, Intel Ohio, and Samsung Texas, offer the promise of job creation and supply chain independence for the US. However, they also face steep costs and yield efficiency challenges compared to their established Asian counterparts.

Still, TSMC Arizona’s CEO Ray Chuang emphasized the rapid progress we’ve seen here: from ideation to wafer output in under four years.

Meanwhile, Nvidia plans to use its own AI and robotics to optimize future US fabs, effectively working toward automating the very process of automation.

Global Perspective: Can the UK and EU Catch Up?

While the United States rapidly accelerates its onshoring of semiconductor production, Europe is still playing catch-up in the global chip race.

The EU Chips Act, introduced in 2023, aims to double Europe’s global semiconductor market share to 20% by 2030.

The initiative supports European giants, including ASML (Netherlands), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), and ARM (UK), aiming to enhance the continent’s role in chip research, design, and supply chain resilience.

Despite its ambitions, however, Europe lacks cutting-edge fabs comparable to TSMC’s Arizona facility or Samsung’s Texas facility.

On the other hand, rather than domestic fabrication, the UK’s semiconductor strategy focuses on intellectual property and R&D through ARM. This means that despite the US’s strides toward independence from Asian foundries, the UK will still continue to rely on them for advanced chip production.

Nvidia’s US milestone highlights what can be achieved when state incentives align with private-sector ambition: a formula Europe has yet to replicate at that scale.

The Long Road to “Made in America” AI

Nvidia’s first U.S.-made Blackwell wafer is an important milestone — but it’s more proof of progress than proof of completion. Manufacturing the wafer on American soil shows that reindustrialization is possible, yet it’s only the opening step in a much longer journey.

Real chip independence would require scaling every stage at home — from design and lithography to packaging, testing, and securing the raw materials supply chain. That goal remains years away.

Still, the achievement marks a powerful resurgence of U.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI infrastructure. For Nvidia, it doubles as both a patriotic signal and a strategic hedge, shoring up supply lines amid geopolitical strains and booming demand for AI compute.

As big technology companies double down on artificial intelligence by acquiring or investing in nimble startups, the workforces of those smaller companies are often the first to feel the impact. With Wall Street scrutinizing investments, instead of an eye towards keeping the startup culture and keeping employees happy, it's turning into quickly eliminating duplicate functions. "In the past, there would have been more concessions made to culture, to continuity, to that sort of thing," said JP Gownder, Forrester vice president and principal analyst. "That's just not where we are. Big Tech is all

Market Context: Data Integration Challenges

Data integration, not budget constraints, has emerged as the primary barrier to effective AI implementation across enterprises according to recent research.

Founded in India and now headquartered in Palo Alto, Uniphore has positioned itself in the enterprise AI market with its Business AI Cloud platform. The company's $260 million Series F funding at a $2.5 billion valuation comes amid a market where data quality increasingly determines AI success.

Enterprise leaders face significant challenges with data fragmentation, as only a third of organizations systematically manage insights. Most rely on separate tools or ad hoc combinations of vendors, making measurement difficult and limiting AI's value. Industry experts note that despite increased investment, technology adoption and high executive expectations, integration remains the primary constraint.

The market has shifted toward agentic AI solutions that can autonomously handle tasks while unifying fragmented data sources. Uniphore asserts its platform addresses these challenges through sovereign, composable AI architecture with integrated data capabilities.

This funding round reflects a broader industry recognition that competitive advantage comes not from algorithms alone but from quality, richness and integration of enterprise data that powers AI systems, precisely the problem Uniphore claims to solve.

[TITLE]Uber Wants Drivers To Train AI While Waiting For Their Next Ride:
[TEXT]
We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.

Uber is testing a new way to keep its U.S. drivers busy and earning money. But, oddly enough, it has nothing to do with driving people around or delivering meals to doorsteps. Through a new pilot program Uber's calling "digital tasks," drivers can complete small online jobs like recording short voice clips or uploading photos to help train the company's artificial intelligence models. And it's all in service of Uber's AI Solutions division.

This pilot program is something Uber wants its drivers to participate in during downtime, no matter if that's on or off the clock. It's already gone through a successful beta test in India, and Uber now plans to expand the trial across the United States before the end of 2025. To take part in it, drivers will have to opt in through the Driver app's Work Hub. That's where they'll find Uber's "Opportunity Center," which is where these digital tasks will live. Once a task is completed, payment gets credited to the driver's balance within 24 hours.

[TITLE]AI is boosting the legacy business for top Indian IT firms, for now:
[TEXT]
Four of the country’s five largest offshore services providers have reported an increase in software modernization deals as Fortune companies prepare to automate much of their backend tech work.

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, and Wipro Ltd reported a significant uptick in such deals, according to their earnings calls with analysts for the second quarter ended September. Two of the four said artificial intelligence (AI) is expediting software upgrades to automate clients’ tech functions.

According to at least one analyst, TCS and Infosys are getting a higher share of such legacy or core modernization deals. These involve replacing or transforming a company’s old information technology (IT) software with new ones that can handle large amounts of data and perform AI tasks quickly.

“...firms are investing in their digital core, preparing them for AI. This requires them to modernize much of their legacy so they can more easily get at the data," said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of Everest Research. “...Firms have long wanted to modernize their legacy, but the (high) cost has caused them to defer this expense. AI and the AI-related tools are significantly reducing the cost."

For homegrown IT services companies, such contracts offer an opportunity at a time when the $283-billion sector faces an uncertain FY26 due to tariff fluctuations and visa flip-flops in the US.

TCS, Infosys lead

“...As you would appreciate, many of our customers globally have a lot of technology debt that they have carried over the years," K Krithivasan, chief executive officer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said during the company’s post-earnings analyst call on 9 October. “GenAI and Agentic AI are powerful tools to really address the tech debt. You can use these AI, GenAI to understand the legacy code, and forward-engineer and deliver the new code. Modernization with AI is a huge opportunity, and we are seeing a significant uptick across customers."

According to Krithivasan, these are short-term deals that can be completed within a quarter. TCS's management also noted that the company is actively looking at delivering business outcomes with AI in a matter of weeks as part of its AI strategy for customers.

The Mumbai-based firm is also eyeing heightened deal activity in application support services and software development.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh called the overhaul of legacy software a huge opportunity because of AI.

“...in the past, without the AI tools, you could do modernization, but clients needed a longer time horizon. With some of the AI tools, the time horizon becomes less and as a consequence, the ROI (return on investment) for the client on that program is much better," Parekh said in response to Mint’s question during the company’s post-earnings press conference on 16 October. “What we anticipate now is, as the AI tools mature, we will see more and more of them (AI) being deployed on the modernization program."

According to Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, TCS and Infosys have the “highest exposure by volume", especially in banking, insurance, and healthcare, where legacy systems create both the biggest risk and biggest opportunity. “Wipro and HCLTech have been more aggressive repositioning as transformation partners rather than maintenance shops."

While TCS and Infosys said AI is hastening legacy modernization, India’s third-largest software services provider HCLTech said the spending on non-essential IT services is also gaining momentum because of tech transformation deals.

“I think the biggest demand elasticity is in modernization. While discretionary spend is whatever it is, we are seeing a number of programs which are coming up based on legacy modernization," said CEO C Vijayakumar during the company’s post-earnings call with analysts on 13 October. He said the clients who were skeptical
