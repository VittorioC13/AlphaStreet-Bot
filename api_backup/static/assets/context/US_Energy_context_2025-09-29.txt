Big Tech’s hunger for energy draws private equity to utilities

HARRISBURG

Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said.

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9 percent stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share .

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

[TITLE]Shale oil execs say Trump policies are hurting investment, 'business is broken':
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the UN headquarters on Sept. 23, 2025 in New York City.

Shale oil executives say President Donald Trump is hurting investment in the oil patch, and are giving a grim outlook for the future of the industry that turned the U.S. into the largest crude producer in the world.

The executives' anonymous comments were published in a quarterly survey of oil and gas companies by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas this week. The 139 companies that responded operate predominantly in Texas as well as northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.

Trump has championed fossil fuels while attacking the renewable energy industry since taking office in January. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, delivered virtually everything the oil lobby wanted.

But Trump's push for lower crude prices, higher tariffs, and the resulting uncertainty caused by his "stroke of pen" policies are hurting investment, executives at independent oil and gas producers told the Dallas Fed.

Nearly 80% of executives who participated in the survey said they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty

Trump urges Turkey to stop buying Russian oil as Erdogan chases deal on F-35s

Watch: Trump greets Turkey's Erdogan ahead of meeting

US President Donald Trump has urged Turkey to stop buying oil from Russia, part of a wider drive to cut off Moscow's energy funding as the war in Ukraine rages on. Speaking alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House, Trump said halting those imports would be "the best thing" his Turkish counterpart could do. The Oval Office meeting ended without any firm commitments to lift US sanctions on Turkey or to sell advanced F-35 fighter jets, though Trump expressed optimism on both issues. Turkey has for years been prevented from buying US F-35s. In 2019, it was expelled from a programme where it produced parts for the warplane after it acquired air defence systems from Russia.

During a brief question-and-answer session alongside Erdogan in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he would like Turkey to stop "buying any oil from Russia while Russia continues its rampage against Ukraine". "The best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia," Trump said. "If he did that, that would be the best thing." Trump added that he believes Erdogan is respected both by Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, meaning that he could "have a big influence" on the war "if he wants to". Alongside India and China, Turkey is among Moscow's biggest customers for oil and gas exports, and data shows that the volume of Russian gas that reached Europe through Turkey rose by more than 26% earlier this year. The US president's comments come just weeks after he said he stood poised to impose tougher sanctions on Russia if Nato countries met conditions that included halting imports of Russian oil. Earlier this week - during a lengthy speech at the UN General Assembly - Trump also accused Nato allies of "funding the war against themselves" through their purchases of energy from Moscow.

[TITLE]Chevron Strikes Deal With Israel To Build Natural Gas Supply Pipeline To Egypt:
[TEXT]
Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has signed a deal with Israel Natural Gas Lines, Israel’s state-owned pipeline operator, to begin construction of the Nitzana natural gas pipeline that will transport natural gas from the giant Leviathan Gas Field to Egypt. Scheduled to be completed in three years, the $610 million pipeline is expected to ease Egypt’s ongoing energy crisis, which currently spends billions of dollars every year importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet surging domestic energy demand. The Nitzana pipeline will transport ~600 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, bringing Israel's total export capacity to Egypt to more than 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. Israel’s NewMed is the largest shareholder in Leviathan, with a 45.3% working interest; Chevron is the operator with a 39.7% working interest, while Ratio Energies. (TASE: RATI) has 15%. Founded in 1992, Ratio Energy is one of Israel's leading energy partnerships, with a mission to develop and produce natural gas and oil.

Egypt's natural gas production has declined rapidly over the years due to the natural depletion of mature fields, including the Zohr gas field. Coupled with a lack of significant new discoveries since 2015, surging domestic demand for electricity, and past financial issues such as hard currency shortages and payment arrears to foreign companies, Egypt now finds itself in a tenuous position, becoming a net gas importer since 2022, and relying on imported Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as well as pipeline gas from Israel. Last year, Egypt imported a record 981 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Israel, good for 18.2% year-over-year increase. Egypt imports up to 20% of its gas from Israel. Last month, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced that the $35-billion gas supply agreement signed with Israel’s NewMed Energy was extended until 2040. But the fate of these gas flows now hangs in the balance, with tensions in the Middle East escalating after the Israeli military ordered residents of Gaza City to evacuate.

Last month, Netanyahu declared that he is "deeply committed to the vision of Greater Israel,’’ encompassing parts of Arab countries stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile. According to Israel Hayom, Netanyahu has instructed officials "not to move forward with the massive gas deal with Egypt without his personal approval.”

On its part, Chevron is now moving on three major geopolitical fronts at once: finalizing terms for the Nitzana pipeline to ship Israeli gas into Egypt, bidding for offshore blocks near Crete that Libya claims as its own and preparing a final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion. Together, the moves put the U.S. major at the center of the East Mediterranean’s most combustible mix of energy ambition and maritime dispute. Chevron has partnered with Greece’s HelleniQ Energy to bid for exploration rights in offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese. Athens views this development as a major step towards asserting its sovereignty over the contested waters. Waters south of Crete and the Peloponnese are contested due to a 2019 Turkey-Libya maritime agreement that ignores Greece's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims and is a response to potential hydrocarbon reserves in the area. Greece claims these areas based on international law, while Turkey disputes that islands like Crete can generate EEZs and views the situation as a geopolitical power struggle. Libya also claims significant portions of the area, aligning with Turkey's position.

Meanwhile, observers are awaiting Chevron’s final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion amid security concerns. However, Chevron and its partners, NewMed Energy and Ratio Energies, now expect to take the FID on the Leviathan Phase 1B expansion, which includes drilling, subsea systems, and a potential floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility, in the fourth quarter of 2025. This expansion is projected to significantly increase the field's annual production capacity and is supported by a recent historic gas export deal, a revised development plan approved by Israel in August 2025, and ongoing contract negotiations with potential customers.

Discovered in 2010, the Leviathan is located approximately 130 km off the shores of Haifa. The 330-square kilometer field holds ~22.9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, making it the largest natural gas reservoir in the Mediterranean, and one of the largest producing assets in the region. Production is facilitated by 4 subsea wells that are connected to an offshore platform via a subsea manifold and two 120 km long pipelines, where all processing of gas takes place. The gas is then piped to shore into the Israeli national grid and distributed to clients in Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.

Rectification note: The original article incorrectly stated that NewMed is the operator of the Leviathan gas field. The current operator is Chevron.

[TITLE]Private equity sees profits in power utilities as electric bills rise and Big Tech seeks more energy:
[TEXT]
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.
