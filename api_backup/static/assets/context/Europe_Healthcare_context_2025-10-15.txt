[TITLE]CHAPPER healthcare, AscellaHealth’s Global Pharmaceutical Distributor, Celebrates 50 Years of Global Pharmaceutical Excellence:
[TEXT]
WATFORD, United Kingdom and BERWYN, Pa., Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CHAPPER healthcare, AscellaHealth’s global pharmaceutical wholesaler, distributor, and service provider, proudly celebrates its 50th anniversary—marking five decades of delivering critical access to licensed and unlicensed medicines to patients in more than 80 countries across six continents. With subsidiaries in Ireland and the United Arab Emirates, and a strategic warehousing hub in Germany, CHAPPER has built a robust global infrastructure to support the timely and reliable delivery of life-saving medicines to markets worldwide.

Founded in 1975 by pharmacist Philip Chapper, the company has grown into a global leader and key member of the EUROPACCESS alliance—while staying true to its core mission: making a meaningful difference by ensuring patients receive the specialty medicines they need, whenever and wherever they need them.

“For over 50 years, CHAPPER healthcare has stood at the intersection of urgency, innovation and trust,” says Jonathan Chapper, CEO, CHAPPER healthcare. “Since its founding, we have expanded from a family-run UK operation into a trusted global partner for life sciences manufacturers, hospitals, and healthcare providers. Many of our client and supplier relationships span decades – in fact, our very first customer from 1975 is still a valued partner 50 years on, which speaks to the transparency and mutual trust at the core of our business.”

“I’ll never forget the night our team mobilised to get a critical antidote on a midnight flight—it arrived within hours and saved multiple lives,” remarked Jonathan, reflecting on the many instances where CHAPPER has successfully executed and stayed true to its mission. “Just this year, we expedited a newly approved cancer medicine to a hospital in Switzerland within 24 hours of the request, giving a patient a fighting chance when time was running out.”

Key milestones in CHAPPER’s journey include:

Launching unlicensed medicine programmes in the 1980s.

Establishing Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Health Research Approval (HRA)-licensed facilities in the UK.

Opening Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA)-authorised operations in Ireland.

Expanding into clinical trial supply and Named Patient Programmes (NPP).

Undergoing a pivotal transformation in 2021 from an export wholesale business to a diversified service model, introducing direct supply to hospitals and partnerships with pharmaceutical manufacturers to broaden patient access.

Marking a defining moment with the shift from international exports to also serving domestic markets across the UK and Ireland, including Great Ormond Street Hospital, with life-saving medicines.

In 2024, CHAPPER healthcare became part of AscellaHealth as its global pharmaceutical wholesaler, distributor, and service provider---enhancing and expanding the organisation’s specialty distribution capabilities on a worldwide scale.

“The acquisition of this recognized trailblazer in the import and export of specialty pharmaceuticals deepened AscellaHealth’s capabilities and leadership position, unlocking new opportunities for market access and product commercialisation throughout the global life sciences industry,” says Alexis Moss, Director of International Business Development, AscellaHealth EU/UK, “Our collective experience, expertise and competencies strengthen our customer value proposition for delivering innovative, end-to-end solutions to stakeholders and providing our specialty patient support programmes throughout the world.“

“We’re proud of CHAPPER healthcare’s remarkable 50-year legacy and excited for the future as we continue advancing global access to specialty medicines,” says Bill Oldham, Chairman and President, AscellaHealth. “Their strong partnerships and established Europe and UK distribution capabilities enable our life sciences partners to better serve patients with complex, chronic and rare disease communities.”

Following its acquisition, CHAPPER healthcare was appointed President of EUROPACCESS in 2025—a strategic joint venture of seven pharmaceutical service providers across Europe that offers integrated commercialisation and market access solutions to help pharmaceutical companies navigate the complex healthcare systems across Europe and UK. This leadership role further strengthens CHAPPER’s ability to support pharmaceutical manufacturers with seamless, pan-European market entry and improved patient access.

Most recently, CHAPPER healthcare was listed on SELECTT (Supplier Electronic Tender Tool), NHS England’s secure platform that enables suppliers to submit offers for specific CMU tenders across the United Kingdom, underscoring the company’s continued growth and alignment with national healthcare systems.

“This milestone not only celebrates CHAPPER’s legacy but also reflects the strength of our shared commitment to enhancing each patient’s treatment journey and driving better clinical outcomes,” continues Moss. “Looking ahead, we remain focused together on building a smarter, more responsive pharmaceutical distribution model—one that meets the growing demand for improved access, availability and affordability of specialty medicines.”

[TITLE]Denali Therapeutics Announces FDA Review Extension of BLA for Tividenofusp Alfa for the Treatment of MPS II (Hunter Syndrome):
[TEXT]
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Denali Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: DNLI) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended its review timeline of the Biologics License Application (BLA) seeking accelerated approval of tividenofusp alfa for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date has been extended from January 5, 2026, to April 5, 2026.

The extension follows Denali’s submission of updated clinical pharmacology information in response to an information request from the FDA as part of the standard review process and is not related to efficacy, safety or biomarkers. The FDA classified the submission as a Major Amendment (MA) to the BLA, which, per FDA regulations, extends the review by three months. No additional data were requested by the FDA in the MA letter. Denali believes that the updated information submitted in the amendment does not affect the clinical pharmacology or benefit-risk conclusions of the BLA.

“We appreciate the FDA’s continued collaboration throughout the review process,” said Ryan Watts, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Denali Therapeutics. “We continue to prepare for the potential approval and commercial launch of tividenofusp alfa. We feel the urgency to deliver for the MPS community, and we are committed to working together with regulators, physicians, and advocates to bring this important therapy to individuals and families living with Hunter syndrome.”
