[TITLE]Bain Capital Real Estate, 11North Partners Close $1.6B Raise for Retail Real Estate – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners, a real estate investment firm, have secured $1.6 billion in new capital commitments for a joint venture operating platform that specializes in acquiring grocery-anchored, open-air retail centers.

The two investment firms formed the platform in April 2024 with the intention of creating a portfolio of open-air retail centers across different markets that are all supported by the shared tailwinds of population growth and income growth. The platform purchases both single assets and large portfolios of retail centers using investor capital.

The $1.6 billion capital raise is largely funded by two unnamed institutional investors, who Brian Harper, founder and managing partner of 11North, described in prepared remarks as “two of the largest and most respected investors in the world.”

“Our shared vision with Bain Capital was to build a platform that could thoughtfully invest across both core-plus and value-add opportunities,” said Harper. “This first capital raise delivers on that vision and positions us to scale with discipline.”

Altogether, by sourcing additional capital from a Bain Capital Real Estate Fund III, the open-air retail center platform managed by the joint venture has more than $2 billion of investable equity to play with going into 2026.

“[This retail platform] reflects how we invest across Bain Capital Real Estate — thematically, with advantage, and with discipline in partnership with aligned operators who bring deep domain expertise,” said Ryan Cotton, head of Bain Capital Real Estate.

Deals the joint partnership has executed in recent months include a $395 million acquisition of 10 assets across Florida and South Carolina in August 2025 and the purchase of three retail centers in Oklahoma City — Nichols Hills Plaza, The Triangle at Classen Curve and Classen Curve — for $212 million in June 2025.

Martha Kelley, managing director at Bain Capital Real Estate, said in a statement that the two firms are mutually attracted to “durable sector trends” in open-air retail, notable strong sales metrics, new consumer shopping patterns, and the rise of online omnichannel shopping, which includes buying online and picking up at a store.

“These dynamics create a supportive environment for necessity-based centers in strong, accessible locations,” said Kelley. “With the right partnership in place, we believe we are well positioned to continue assembling a best-in-class portfolio that delivers lasting value for our investors.”

[TITLE]Forman Capital Provides $37M Construction Financing for Houston-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Ferguson Family Partners has secured $37.1 million in construction financing to build The Oaks of District West, a 10-building mixed-use center outside of Houston, Texas, Commercial Observer can first report.

Forman Capital provided the construction loan, while Daniel Eidson of Concord Summit Capital arranged the transaction.

Scott Mehlman, chief investment officer and partner at Forman Capital, noted in a statement that the Richmond submarket of Houston, where The Oak of District West will be located, has experienced a surge in residential building in recent years, but retail has failed to keep pace.

“Our client is addressing a clear market gap, and the early leasing momentum speaks to both the strength of the location and the quality of the concept,” said Mehlman.

The open-air project is already 70 percent pre-leased in its 15 tenant spaces, even though construction is expected to last until the third quarter of 2027. Tenants include Pacific Coast Tacos, Virtual Golf Bar, Pecan Jack’s Ice Cream, and Picklr, a national indoor pickleball company.

Located at 21711 FM-1093 in Richmond, Texas, directly off the Westpark Tollway and South Peak Road, The Oaks of District West will span more than 87,000 square feet across 10 buildings on a site that sits 30 miles southwest of Downtown Houston.

Brett Forman, managing partner of Forman Capital, said in a statement that the new retail center will tap into the affluent residential community within the Richmond area.

“The Oaks of District West aligns directly with Forman Capital’s retail thesis of investing in necessity-driven centers in affluent residential markets,” he said.

[TITLE]Numerator November Consumer Price Index Reveals Prices for Everyday Goods Up 2.2% vs. 2024:
[TEXT]
CHICAGO, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Numerator, a data and technology company providing insights into consumer behavior, released its November 2025 Numerator Consumer Price Index (CPI) with an advance read on inflation trends across everyday consumer goods. According to Numerator, prices for everyday household purchases increased 0.38% in November, following a 0.03% increase in October and a 0.66% increase in September. In November, prices for everyday goods are up 2.2% versus a year ago.

Similar to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Numerator CPI tracks prices and changes in consumer purchases over time. The data cover approximately 20% of the consumption basket captured in the overall PCE price index, and closely tracks the PCE Food & Beverage index, offering a reliable signal of retail price changes experienced by U.S. consumers.

“Inflation for everyday consumer purchases appears to be stuck between 2% and 2.5% per year, above the 0.5% to 1.5% inflation we were seeing prior to the pandemic,” said Leo Feler, Chief Economist, Numerator. “These are groceries and personal care items that consumers buy most frequently. It’s not surprising that inflation and affordability remain top of mind for consumers.”

Additional key findings from Numerator’s November CPI:

Prices for everyday household goods increased 0.38% month over month in November, following a 0.03% increase in October and a 0.66% increase in September.

Prices for everyday household goods are up 2.2% year over year.

November shows the 3rd highest monthly rate of inflation since the beginning of the year.

METHODOLOGY:

Numerator’s consumer inflation measure is constructed using both base-period and current-period quantity weights to combine item prices, an approach that is consistent with the structure of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ PCE Price Index.

The index is calculated from verified, item-level transactions provided by a panel of 200,000 geographically and demographically representative U.S. households. These data include purchases across categories such as grocery, household goods, and health and beauty. The data capture changes in consumer purchasing behavior when prices change, including brand switching, downsizing, and shifts in where consumers buy.

Values are aggregated monthly to produce index levels and month-over-month and year-over-year percent changes, providing a current view of inflation trends. The dataset uses verified household purchase data from the demand side, offering visibility into consumer behavior as prices evolve.

The Numerator CPI’s year-over-year inflation measure has a 0.93 correlation with the PCE Food and Beverage index since 2019.

About Numerator:

Numerator is a data and tech company bringing speed and scale to market research. Numerator blends first-party data from over 1 million US households with advanced technology to provide 360-degree consumer understanding for the market research industry that has been slow to change.

[TITLE]Capital One Lounge DFW: Grab n Go Now On Request, Hot Food Weaker — Maintenance Cited:
[TEXT]
Has the food at the Capital One lounge at DFW decline a lot? I’ve noticed on several visits that the food isn’t as good as it was when they first opened. And across lounges I’ve seen strategies to cut back on grab ‘n go as well.

There doesn’t seem to be as much as there used to be. At the outset they had these large bags – which just served to encourage guests to fill the bags. Their most recent lounge, JFK, has staff getting guests the food items – this discourages anyone that experiences shame from asking for scores of items. My most recent visit to DFW had less than ever before. The hot items were also pretty mid.

Irregular operations meant that I had nearly a 2.5 hour connection at the Dallas A gates.

My Austin to Dallas flight was delayed, and I was going to misconnect.

So I first got backed up both on a later Austin – Dallas flight and a later connecting flight. And then I confirmed the later connection.

All that was available was a non-extra legroom middle seat in economy and I took it. Fortunately the guy next to me at the aisle got an upgrade after boarding, and nobody was brought on to replace him even though the flight was full. So I shifted over to the window and had an empty middle. That made for a perfectly fine flight, even though it’s still a tight space for working on my laptop.

In the air I checked the wait time for the Capital One lounge and it surprisingly said just ‘5-10 minutes’. So I didn’t join the wait list then. Instead, I waited until I landed and joined through the app as I walked off the aircraft – for both the American Express lounge and for the Capital One lounge (and figured if both took a long time I’d use my Royal Jordanian status for American’s Flagship lounge). I headed over to the D concourse.

Capital One came back in one minute . I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case.

. I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case. American Express took 27 minutes. I didn’t remove myself from the list because they don’t give you a wait time estimate, and I wanted to compare how long it would take (plus I considered that I might want to switch for variety’s sake0.

When I checked in at Capital One, the woman at the desk seemed a bit bored, and was terse in checking me in. In the past, large tables were reserved for larger parties, but that didn’t seem to be the case today and staff weren’t proactively seating people as I’d seen in the past.

The only open spot in the lounge was a larger table that hadn’t been cleared. I took it, but I felt badly, because I was solo and it could have accommodated a party of four. I needed to use the bathroom but there was an 8-person deep line for that, so I waited and managed to return once the line had dwindled.

What was striking, though, was the food service on this visit.

The grab ‘n go section was closed.

Grab ‘n go items replaced at least half the hot food.

Pastries were simpler.

The ice machine by the self-serve soda was gone.

A sppkesperson shared,

We are working to resolve a small temporary maintenance issue at our grab-and-go station. During this time, some of those offerings have been temporarily relocated to the hot food service area however the entire grab and go menu is available upon request. This is not our standard operating procedure, and we anticipate the station will be operational soon.

I was there for a pass by the ‘rituals cart’ which in this case was jasmine tea and a macaron cookie. It seems like the cookie might have been a bit more nicely presented than in a shrink-wrapped package? And maybe some options for teas? Still, having some personal service rather than just buffet is a really nice experience.

National airport’s ‘Landing’ which is really a complimentary sit-down restaurant remains my favorite in the Capital One portfolio. JFK is the best lounge – based on size, experiences and offerings. DFW was first, and is now four years old. Recent visits haven’t been as good as earlier ones, and like Denver it is frequently very very busy. I want to see it getting a little love.

[TITLE]The Weekly Closeout: Levi’s adds Target vet to board, plus more Black Friday ‘standouts’:
[TEXT]

It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we’re still thinking about.

From consumer spending forecasts to Playboy energy drinks, here’s our closeout for the week.

What you may have missed

Levi’s brings Target vet on board

Levi Strauss & Co. appointed Jeffrey Jones to its board, effective Jan. 21, the company said in a Tuesday announcement. Jones will serve as a member of the board’s nominating, governance and corporate citizenship committee as well as the compensation and human capital committee.

Jones has been the CEO of H&R Block since 2017 and will retire from the company on Dec. 31. Jones was previously the chief marketing officer at Target, where he oversaw brand, digital and guest experience strategy, along with investor relations, among other efforts.

“Mr. Jones brings extensive experience in consumer insights, brand building and organizational transformation and has a proven record of creating significant stakeholder value,” Levi’s Board Chair Bob Eckert said in a statement. “He has repeatedly strengthened brands and organizations across industries, and his leadership will play a critical role as we evolve LS&Co. into a best-in-class, DTC-first retailer.”

The Athlete’s Foot steps into e-commerce in the US

The Athlete’s Foot has launched an e-commerce platform in the U.S., over 50 years after operating as a global brick-and-mortar retailer.

The sneaker and streetwear retailer said that up until this point, its U.S. presence has been focused almost exclusively on physical retail.

“This launch extends that experience nationwide for the first time, allowing the brand to reach consumers well beyond its existing store footprint,” the company said in an announcement emailed to Retail Dive.

The move is intended to grow its footprint, reach new customers and make its product offerings available in a “broader, more modern shopping journey.”

The chain currently operates over 400 stores worldwide.

What made Lululemon surge 6.5% in premarket trading

Activist investor Elliott Investment Management acquires over $1 billion stake in the struggling activewear retailer and proposes former Ralph Lauren executive as new CEO

Lululemon Athletica shares surged in premarket trading Thursday after news broke that prominent activist investor Elliott Investment Management acquired a stake exceeding $1 billion in the struggling activewear retailer. The investment represents a significant bet on the company’s potential turnaround, particularly given the stock’s dismal performance throughout 2025.

Elliott doesn’t plan to simply hold shares and wait for improvement. According to people familiar with the matter, the activist firm wants to actively participate in reshaping Lululemon’s future and has already identified a specific candidate for the company’s vacant chief executive position. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Elliott is pushing for former Ralph Lauren Chief Financial Officer Jane Nielsen to take the helm.

Perfect timing for intervention

The activist’s entrance comes at a critical moment for Lululemon. The company announced last week that CEO Calvin McDonald will step down from his position on Jan. 31, creating an immediate leadership vacuum. That news initially sparked investor optimism, with shares surging 9.6% on Friday in their best single-day performance in months. The market’s enthusiastic response suggested shareholders welcomed the prospect of new leadership direction.

Despite that encouraging Friday rally, Lululemon stock remains deeply underwater for 2025. Through Wednesday’s close, shares had plummeted 45% year to date, reflecting serious concerns

[TITLE]Upbeat FedEx Forecast Makes Holiday Sales Prospects Jollier:
[TEXT]
In less than a week, the North American Aerospace Defense Command will conduct its annual operation tracking Santa’s circumnavigation of the globe. Unfortunately, because of the government shutdown this fall, there’s not enough data on the elfen labor at his workshop to get a clear picture of Christmas demand.

Thankfully, that’s what FedEx’s earnings are for. The shipping company reported an adjusted profit of $1.1 billion in its latest quarter on Thursday, up 25% year over year, and revenue of $23.5 billion, up 7.7% year over year. Both figures bested Wall Street’s expectations and bode well for overhaul efforts at FedEx as well as the shipper-friendly holiday season.

Repackaged Offering

FedEx shares have gained a meager 2% in 2025, with quarterly revenue still lagging the company’s $24.4 billion pandemic peak in 2022. The end of lockdowns, which were a gift-wrapped turbocharger to the bottom lines of parcel firms, gave way to years of inflation followed by tariffs, putting a hurt on volumes and margins. Sales were flat or declined for three years until the quarter ending in August. That’s when FedEx delivered Wall Street a surprise 3% growth in year-over-year revenue to $22.2 billion. That helped turn investors bullish, with shares up 27% since late September.

Wall Street is also watching a handful of overhaul initiatives designed to unlock shareholder value. In the spring, FedEx won new business from Amazon after UPS reduced its ties with the e-commerce giant, citing low margins. The new Amazon partnership is expected to be fully onboarded by February. Then there are plans to spin off FedEx’s freight business by the middle of 2026, which executives say will position the two resulting companies to better focus on their own operations and capital allocation. Finally, an ongoing cost-reduction program is expected to trim $1 billion in fiscal 2026. FedEx’s latest earnings, announced Thursday, heralded more fuel for the rally:

In September, FedEx forecasted fiscal 2026 sales growth of 4% to 6%. On Thursday, executives upped that forecast to 5% to 6%.

FedEx now projects an annual profit of $17.80 to $19 per share, up from its previous $17.20 to $19 range. The company said package yields and volumes rose in its Federal Express segment, a sign that the traditional spike in holiday shipping hasn’t been disrupted by tariffs (FedEx previously warned of a $1 billion hit to its profits, mostly due to fewer shipments from China).

Fleeting: Following the fatal crash of an MD-11 freighter plane operated by UPS last month, US officials ordered the grounding of the aircraft, which is also used by FedEx. Stifel analysts said the MD-11 grounding’s impact, which applies to 5% of FedEx’s fleet, would prove “minimal.”
