Feeling growing that the company owners will sell, with Eamonn Quinn among those who would benefit most

Cork-based commercial lighting solutions company Nualight has freed up €3.6m to distribute to its shareholders, with indications that the company owners could be preparing it for a possible sale.

A deal could potentially value the business in the region of €30m.

Shareholders who would benefit from a potential sale include Eamonn Quinn, a scion of the late Feargal Quinn’s family, who sold Superquinn in 2005 for

Tesla's price point for its "more affordable" models is still higher than Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, floated in 2020. The reasons for these sticky prices may be bigger than Tesla.

On Tuesday, Tesla launched "standard" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, at $39,990 and $36,990, respectively.

The "standard" models are between $5,000 and $5,500 cheaper than the flagship versions — sans Autosteer and a radio — and the market was not enthusiastic. Tesla shares dipped around 4.4% after the launch on market closing compared to the day before.

EV and trade policies in the US may be to blame for these prices not being as low as Musk touted and analysts hoped.

[TITLE]Mega IPO in Hong Kong but fast-fashion retailer Shein is slow off the blocks in its second India innings:
[TEXT]
There’s a lot happening at online fast-fashion retailer Shein. The China-founded, Singapore-headquartered company is readying for multi-billion-dollar public listing in Hong Kong. It is in the middle of an aggressive revenue expansion that has market analysts downgrading shares of rivals such as H&M and Inditex, which owns the Zara brand.

But, here in India, more than six months after it relaunched partnering Reliance Retail Ventures, Shein is finding the going slower than from its earlier stint here when it and 58 apps from China were banned by the government in 2020.

Homegrown rivals and fashion industry executives tell Mint that in the five years of Shein’s absence, India’s fast-fashion and ‘Gen Z’ focused apparel business has accelerated with local players catching up and altering the competitive landscape. The break from India may have compromised the very core of Shein’s success—speed and variety.

The idea behind the Shein-Reliance licensing deal was that the Indian oil-to-retail conglomerate would handle all operations and production of the online giant’s rapidly-changing design catalogue. In other words, Reliance Retail would tap into India’s sprawling micro and small medium enterprise garments supply chain of over 25,000 units, per a report in The Economic Times, and power the partnership with the technology smarts of a global “ultra-fast fashion" leader.

Shein’s storied catalogue is updated by designs identified using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and the company claims that it rolls out small batches of new designs in as less as three to seven days.

In India, the design-to-launch timelines have improved dramatically but it still takes 30 days (earlier, it was 46 days). “Our superior sourcing ecosystem is a strategic advantage…a 30-day mind-to-shelf cycle in fashion, we can move products from concept to consumer faster than our competitors," Isha Ambani, director of Reliance Retail Ventures said at Reliance Industries’ annual general meeting (AGM) this August.

[TITLE]Share Market Today highlights 8 October 2025: Markets end lower as IT outshines amid pre-earnings caution; Gold hits historic high:
[TEXT]
* * Increased macro concerns keeping enterprise clients to remain cautious on spends

* Expect Midcap IT cos to post healthy QoQ sales growth

* * Sector valuations will remain under check and range bound in the near-medium term

Mumbai, October 6, 2025 — Financial services firm Equirus Securities has released a press note detailing a preview of Q2FY26 earnings of the IT sector. As per the press note, the Top-6 large IT companies are likely to report CC US$ Sales growth of 0% to 2.1% QoQ in Q2 (expect LTI Mindtree & Infosys at close to upper end and Wipro IT Services close to lower end). The midcap IT companies are expected to post healthy QoQ sales growth in Coforge, Persistent Systems, R-Systems and eClerx.

The heightened macroeconomic concerns that started in March 2025 has been keeping enterprise clients to remain cautious on incremental Tech led Services spend. But, at the same time demand trends are stable QoQ in Q2. Hence, with likely conversion of increasing deal wins (on cost-take-out side) into revenues, Equirus Securities expect most of the large caps to show some improvement in QoQ CC US$ sales growth rates in Q2 vs Q1FY26. Good execution on EBITM is likely to continue in 2Q with QoQ dip of 36bps (for Wipro IT Services) to increase of 71bps in top-6 large caps considering tailwinds from currency benefits (INR/US$ depreciated by nearly 3% QoQ in Q2 on an average for most companies) and benign supply-side issues, cost optimisation and productivity led gains.

Expect higher QoQ Sales growth in most of Top 6 large caps in 2Q vs. 1Q

Equirus Securities expect top 6 large caps to register QoQ growth of flat to 2.1% in US$ Sales in CC terms in 2QFY26E. A marginally positive impact of 2-28 bps QoQ is expected from cross currency tailwinds across most of the top 6 large caps in Q2. The sales performance will likely be healthy from some of the midcap companies incl. Coforge, Persistent Systems, R-Systems and eClerx with expected US$ Sales growth in the range of 3.6% to 5.8% QoQ (Persistent Systems at the lower end and Coforge at the upper end) in CC terms. Equirus Securities expect CC US$ Sales growth to remain tepid in most the ER&D companies (led by soft demand continuing in Mobility/Auto) with LTTS to lead with expected 1.6% CC QoQ growth in US$ Sales in Q2.

Demand commentary likely to remain cautious

Equirus Securities expects demand commentary to remain cautious (unless some certainty relating to tariff related issues emerges ahead). However, it believes vendors are still witnessing better demand tailwinds in BFSI. For 2QFY26E, they expect mix trends on deal TCV (on Qoq basis). Key thing to watch will be management commentary regarding deal pipeline and any further delays in decision-making regarding deal awards and start/ramp up of earlier won deals.

Expect some tweak in Infosys’s FY26E Sales growth guidance

Equirus Securities expects Infosys to guide for 2.0-3.0% CC growth in US$ Sales (vs. current growth guidance of 1-3%; inorganic growth contribution from Versent Group unlikely to be factored into growth guidance given its pending closure) with no change in its EBITM guidance of 20-22% for FY26E. Equirus Securities expects no change in HCL Tech’s CC US$ Sales growth guidance of 3-5% (c.2-4% Organic) both for Services & Consol. US$ Sales with no change in its Consol. EBITM guidance of 17-18% for FY26E. The research house expects Wipro to guide for (-) 0.5% to (+) 1.5% QoQ growth in IT Services US$ Sales for 3QFY26E in CC terms.

Remain selective

Equirus Securities recommends remaining selective and prefer Infosys/Tech Mahindra amongst large caps and prefer Mphasis/Zensar/KPIT/eClerx amongst midcaps on a relative basis

[TITLE]Share Market Today Highlights 7 October 2025: Sensex, Nifty ride up on festive optimism; gold hits record high:
[TEXT]
“Gold prices have risen to record highs near $4,000 an ounce as haven demand was reinforced with growing political uncertainty in the France, US, Japan to name a few. The wave of political uncertainty in the developed world kept investors largely pinned towards gold. Persistent bets on more interest rate cuts by the U.S. FED also benefited metal markets. Rate cuts are contingent on the path of inflation and the labor market. Increased gold buying by China has also been supporting the bullion prices. China is diversifying its foreign reserves from the dollar and U.S. Treasuries to Gold. Akin to these buying is the strong Gold ETF inflows. The safe haven demand for gold ramped up, especially as a U.S. government shutdown’s political deadlock doesn’t seem to end soon. It has stretched into the eighth day. Gold is not a short-term trade or a technical breakout story. Its factual about gold not being under any default and it’s a form of capital requiring no counterparty credibility to maintain value. Gold is the ultimate hedge against runaway debt. The world debt scenario is leading to the gold story. When the world runs on debt, gold becomes the final line of defense. The global debt-to-GDP ratio stands above 324%. Global debt climbing to a record-breaking height of $337.70 trillion. It’s this that’s driving gold and not inflation per se. Debt is climbing faster than output and gold has become the stabilizer. As regards the US angle, once the dollar was unpegged from gold, governments began to spend with abandon, instead of cutting spending or raising taxes. The deficits kept running and financed by the Federal Reserve. US government debt now stands at a jaw-dropping $37.5 trillion, equal to roughly 124% of GDP.”

Tailwinds for a case of Gold $4000 - $5000

•\u0009Accelerating massive debt pile in U.S, fiscal imbalances widening with constrained monetary policy.

•\u0009FED can’t raise rates without bankrupting the government. It can’t make deep cuts without tanking the dollar.

•\u0009US interest rate cut expectations and weakening of USD • Central banks continue to buy physical bullion (Year 2022 – 1080 tons, Year 2023 – 1051 tons, Year 2024 – 1089 tons, H1 2025 – 415 tons).

•\u0009Net inflows of gold ETF on record (H1 2025 Year 397 tons), robust retail demand from India & China.

•\u0009Deteriorating geopolitical situation (especially in Ukraine and Gaza) helping to create strong demand for gold.

•\u0009Financial conditions showed US Treasury yields to be the key variable influencing gold, rather than the U.S. dollar.

[TITLE]RedCloud’s RedAI Platform Breaks $2T Inventory Trading Barrier with Immediate Payments & Working Capital:
[TEXT]
LONDON, Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RedCloud Holdings plc (“RCT”) (“RedCloud” or “Company”) ​the RedAI intelligent trading platform used by Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) businesses, today announced partnerships with three leading payment providers collectively serving more than 63 million users¹.

RedCloud believes that digital payment friction is a major barrier to seamless trade across supply chains carrying $14.6Tn3 worth of FMCG products annually. Lack of secure and immediate payment methods or working capital for trade of inventory directly contributes to an estimated $2 trillion inventory gap2, where consumers face empty shelves while warehouses stockpile supplies.

Once deployed, the Company’s business customers in Argentina, South Africa and Nigeria will have new payment options when trading inventory or stock—including direct bank transfers and their favorite local digital payment wallets—bringing cost-effective convenience and choice to every trade.

In South America, the Company has entered an agreement with Mercado Pago—Argentina's dominant payment platform serving 53 million1 active fintech users as part of the Mercado Libre ecosystem. This integration delivers instant settlement, real-time reconciliation, and crucially—the first embedded credit offering within RedAI trading platform—to expand its global payments network, providing customers with real-time settlement and reconciliation. Traders gain access to delayed payment terms or credit instalments on the Mercado Pago Credit network to help them grow working capital and scale their business, the first example of extended financial services being offered within RedAI.

“We’re delighted to partner with RedCloud to offer their customers the ability to make payments easier when trading FMCG goods across Argentina," said Salvador Lo Valvo, Regional Business Development Lead, LATAM at MercadoPago. "Whether it’s a direct transfer, cash payments through Mercado Pago or other wallets, our focus is on delivering intuitive, reliable experiences that remove friction, increase trade and empower businesses to grow. This partnership reflects our shared belief in the power of technology to unlock trade between businesses, so consumers can find and buy the everyday food and supplies they need.”

South African customers will be able to pay for goods via Shop2Shop - one of the country’s predominant payment providers in the informal market. The Company is aiming to drive safe and secure payments to replace the use of cash, in a segment that has been challenged by security and governance concerns. This will allow customers to make immediate payment without concern for their own safety and distributor customers to get orders settled on delivery, without putting drivers at risk.

Finally, RedCloud customers in Nigeria will enjoy additional payment choices with the addition of MoniePoint—the predominant payments provider in the Nigerian B2B space—to facilitate cost effective, near real-time trade settlement between B2B supply chain customers. In addition, the Company anticipates the launch of an innovative trade finance solution with MoniePoint during Q4 2025.

"We know the positive impact that digital payments have in stimulating open trade between businesses, bringing greater choice and flexibility to support dynamic trade in high-growth markets such as South Africa—where cash is still most used for payment and collection is risky— and Argentina, where challenging economic conditions make supportive financial services more vital than ever to delivering working capital," said Juandre de Jong, SVP at RedCloud. “We’re thrilled to partner with Shop2Shop, Mercado Pago and MoniePoint in addition to the recently launched PayStack as part of our strategy to offer customers across our markets the widest range of digital payment options and providers to accelerate trade on our platform.”

These newly integrated partnerships are a step towards the creation of an anticipated RedAI Universal Payments Protocol (UPP). A UPP would deliver a global multi-layer payments infrastructure connecting banks, PSPs, wallets, crypto and local payment methods. Its objective would be to unify B2B remittances, embedded lending, agentic payment flows and reconcilable order to payment ledgers into one API. A future UPP would intend to deliver faster integration, greater interoperability and seamless access to regional and agentic finance.

India’s stock market may appear dull in the short term but remains resilient in the long run, said Atul Suri, CEO & CIO of Marathon Trends, who believes the current phase of consolidation could be setting the stage for the next major bull run.Speaking to ET Now, Suri described the Nifty’s recent flat performance as a “time correction, not a price correction,” suggesting that Indian equities are resting before a renewed leg higher.Suri also sees three structural sectors with long-term potential — defence, online retail, and green energy.Over the past year, Indian markets have largely moved sideways even as global markets like the Nasdaq, Dow Jones, and European indices hit new highs. This contrast, Suri said, often leaves investors with a sense of “FOMO” (fear of missing out).“You wake up and see the Dow or Nasdaq up 1.5% and hope we’ll follow, but the Nifty barely moves 20 points. The index hasn’t fallen, but many stocks are lower. When you compare with global markets, it feels like we’ve missed the rally,” he said.However, Suri maintained that this underperformance may not be a bad thing. “If you look at it over four to five years, it’s a healthy consolidation. It’s a time correction, not a crash. Such phases often precede a strong breakout.”Suri attributed much of the global rally to the AI revolution, which has created unprecedented wealth concentration in a handful of technology giants.“Globally, around 70–80% of markets have made new highs. The US, Europe, Japan — they’ve all done well. But the common driver is AI. The Fab-7 stocks — Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Tesla — are driving markets and delivering phenomenal earnings,” he said.He noted that while these stocks have gone “parabolic,” this time is different from the dot-com bubble of 2000.“Unlike the 2000 tech bubble, today’s leaders have real earnings and cash flows. They’re profitable, cash-rich, and their scale is like entire economies. This is an industrial revolution led by AI,” Suri said.However, he admitted India missed this wave. “We have large IT companies but the market doesn’t believe they can transition fast enough. Many are at 52-week lows — it’s a sign we didn’t ride the AI wave.”Suri also pointed out that a breakdown in the US dollar and structural weakness in crude oil could be reshaping global capital flows.“The dollar is weakening, and crude is breaking down. These shifts are tied to geopolitics and structural changes in the US economy,” he explained.This, he said, is fueling a mega bull trend in gold, silver, and other commodities.“Gold has crossed all targets and entered blue-sky territory. It’s not a speculative move; it’s structural. Sovereigns are buying gold and diversifying reserves. When the world’s traditional ‘safe haven’ — the US dollar — starts losing trust, money has to find a new home,” he said.Suri described gold’s current surge as part of a “supercycle in commodities”, with silver and copper also seeing strong breakouts. “Corrections will come, but the long-term trend remains bullish.”Among all asset classes, Suri said cryptocurrencies are showing the most spectacular technical patterns.“Bitcoin and Ethereum charts are mind-bending. They trend like nothing else. There are no fundamentals — just pure demand and supply — so charts reflect everything. For a chartist, crypto is a dream,” he said.Suri added that young investors globally — including many Indians abroad — are drawn to the volatility and quick gains of crypto over traditional equities.“They tell me, ‘I trade crypto, not stocks.’ The parabolic moves in crypto are unbelievable — it’s a new generation’s market,” he said.Despite comparisons to past bubbles, Suri dismissed fears of a massive crash in global equities.“Corrections, yes — but no bubble burst. Unlike 2000, today’s market leaders are highly profitable, not over-leveraged, and are genuinely transforming industries,” he said.He believes earnings strength remains the key driver of markets worldwide. “As long as earnings hold, markets will remain healthy. We’re not at irrational valuations yet.”Back home, Suri sees three structural sectors with long-term potential — defence, online retail, and green energy.“Defence has corrected 30–40% from last year’s highs but remains a mega theme. This isn’t just India — globally, defence is booming. The new geopolitical reality is that every nation must become self-reliant,” he said.He expects steady order flows and long execution cycles to drive sustained performance in the sector.Suri also sees enormous opportunity in India’s digital consumption ecosystem.“Online retail, payments, and quick commerce are reshaping daily life. First, it was Amazon, then food delivery, and now groceries. This is becoming a habit — and a business with scale and profitability,” he said.Another long-term play, according to him, is AI infrastructure. “Data centres are the new gold rush. Even if investors can’t directly participate, they can look at companies supplying the infrastructure — the ‘picks and shovels’ of this AI revolution.”Suri concluded that while traditional Nifty heavyweights — banks, old IT, and large-cap tech — remain sluggish, new leaders are emerging from midcaps, new-age platforms, and high-growth sectors.“We’re in a transition. The old guard is lethargic, but new players — from defence to data, green energy to digital commerce — are setting records. The next bull market will have new leadership,” he said.According to Suri, India’s current phase of consolidation is not a sign of weakness but preparation for a breakout. “This is the rest before the next sprint,” he said.

[TITLE]India’s growth depends on water— and climate change is making it scarcer for everyone:
[TEXT]
Businesses in India have typically treated water as a steady input—not perfect, but reliable enough. Climate change is unravelling that assumption. Variable rainfall, falling groundwater tables, depleting aquifers and intensifying floods are reshaping how firms source this most basic of industrial inputs. Water has quietly become a new frontier of business risk.

Rising temperatures, erratic monsoons, frequent droughts and increasingly likely extreme weather events are reducing reliable water availability while driving up demand, especially from water-intensive industries like power generation, textiles and steel. By 2030, for instance, 70% of India’s thermal power plants are projected to face severe water stress, threatening energy security.

Also Read | Crisis alert: Careless water management poses an existential threat to India

India’s economy is thirsty. Besides agriculture, textile factories, power plants, steel mills, food processors and drugmakers have long relied on abundant and predictable water supplies. This certainty is receding. As much as 17% of India’s groundwater blocks are already overexploited and the situation is worsening every year, according to the Central Water Commission. The Niti Aayog warns that almost 600 million Indians live under high to extreme water stress.

These numbers matter to business even if Indian industry, unlike farming, does not dominate India’s water withdrawal. Industries rely on consistent quality and timely supply. A thermal power plant cannot run if its cooling water fails. Textile dyeing, pulp and paper mills and steel production all suffer when water fails in quantity or reliability, or is too polluted.

[TITLE]The Formula Fueling Uniqlo’s Record-Breaking Profits:
[TEXT]
For a fourth consecutive year, Uniqlo reported record profits and is now eyeing a fifth year of breakthrough earnings with its global retail push. According to Reuters, profits increased roughly 13%, reaching $3.69 billion (564.3 billion yen) in the 12 months ending in August 2025. As the fashion industry reels from an uncertain year impacted by international trade reforms and economic instability, what is the Japanese retailer’s secret to success?

Uniqlo’s owner, Fast Retailing, saw its Japanese revenue surpass 1 trillion yen, a first-ever for the company. Meanwhile, in North America, revenue and business profit grew by 24.5% and 35.1%, respectively, despite the US’s newly enacted tariffs. The worldwide numbers overtook the company’s own fiscal 2025 forecast of 545 billion yen, and Fast Retailing expects that 2026 operating profit may once again break records, reaching up to 610 billion yen.

“As the times continue to change greatly, Uniqlo’s LifeWear concept has begun to gain broad recognition in major global markets,” said Tadashi Yanai, CEO and founder, in an official statement. “We are confident that we can fundamentally transform the very concept of clothing on a global scale and spark a movement that establishes LifeWear as a new world standard,” he added.

In an environment so highly saturated with competitors, Uniqlo’s highly curated approach to product is what differentiates the retailer. In comparison to shopping at an H&M or a Zara, where one might notice a focus on trend-forward assortments, busier patterns, and louder embellishments, Uniqlo is noticeably pared back in its presentation.

[TITLE]Uniqlo's owner sees stronger profit and sales in current fiscal year:
[TEXT]
Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing reported double-digit revenue and profit growth in North America in the current fiscal year, as its U.S. expansion defied tariff volatility sparked by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

The Japanese clothing retailer, known for its functional basics including T-shirts, sweatpants and down jackets, saw North America revenue and business profit grow 24.5% and 35.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended August 2025, according to its earnings statement on Thursday.

That performance led robust international gains across Europe, Southeast Asia and South Korea, helping offset a continued slump in China — long Fast Retailing’s largest overseas market — where consumer demand has remained weak since the COVID-19 pandemic.

[TITLE]Global Resale Market Set to Grow to $360 Billion by 2030, Says BCG:
[TEXT]
PARIS — The global resale market for fashion and luxury goods is continuing to soar, projected to reach between $320 billion and $360 billion by 2030, according to a new study by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective, released Thursday.

The study, based on a survey of 7,800 Vestiaire Collective users worldwide, puts the resale market at roughly 8 percent of total fashion and luxury sales globally, with penetration expected to hit 10 percent by the end of the decade.

And with a compound annual growth rate of 10 percent, it’s expanding three times faster than primary sales and reshaping how consumers shop, especially Gen Z and U.S.-based consumers hit by inflation.

“With resale now growing three times faster than firsthand fashion and luxury, the market has gone from experimental to essential,” said BCG managing director and partner Felix Krueger. “Many brands now see it as a key channel for attracting new customers. With Gen Z and other resale-native consumers leading the shift, momentum is only growing.”

Europe currently leads this growth, fueled by regulatory support from the European Union and heightened consumer awareness around sustainability and circularity, while U.S. consumers are most concerned by value and brand accessibility.

Fifty-five percent of resale purchases occur through online multibrand platforms such as Vestiaire Collective, The RealReal and Vinted.

Aspirational Access

Resale is no longer niche, and is an escape from the one-two punch of inflation and economic uncertainty, with affordability being the key driver behind the sector’s growth. Price was the primary motivator of 78 percent of respondents, especially among aspirational buyers seeking premium labels they might not otherwise be able to afford.

“Whether seeking desirable pre-loved fashion pieces at affordable prices or pursuing the thrill of the hunt for truly unique finds, resale is now firmly embedded in how people shop and build their wardrobes. Today, it’s a deliberate choice,” said Vestiaire Collective cofounder and president Fanny Moizant.

Notably, 66 percent of respondents indicated that resale enabled them to discover or purchase a brand for the first time, up from 59 percent in 2022. This highlights resale’s growing function not just as a secondary market but as a strategic customer acquisition channel that expands brand reach and fosters long-term loyalty.

While leather goods, apparel and footwear dominate the resale market as approximately 80 percent of transactions, luxury watches and fine jewelry are growing fast. The resale of watches alone is forecasted to capture 35 to 40 percent of the global watch market by 2030, the report said, in part due to the rising prices of timepieces in the primary market.

Gen Z is leading the charge here. Resale makes up nearly one-third of their wardrobes, almost half of their handbag collections, and they’re more likely than any other demographic to discover a new brand through a secondhand buy. In a world of rising retail prices and shrinking disposable income, secondhand offers both a point of entry and a statement of values.

U.S. Consumers Value-driven, Europe Cites Sustainability

The study reveals marked regional differences, particularly between U.S. and European resale consumers. While affordability ranks as the top driver in both markets, 87 percent of U.S. respondents cited price is their top reason for shopping resale — 11 percentage points higher than in Europe.

However, sustainability is less of a priority for U.S. consumers, with only 28 percent reporting resale as supporting more sustainable fashion behaviors compared to 33 percent in Europe.

U.S. consumers also more frequently reported preferring secondhand luxury labels to more affordable new premium-level items, reflecting what the report calls a “transactional, value-led approach” as they react to economic concerns and inflation.

The Big Opp of DPPs

As resale gains momentum, so does the need for trust, transparency and traceability, particularly in the luxury segment, where authentication is a primary concern. Enter digital product passports, or DPPs, a new technology solution set to reshape how consumers and brands interact with products over time.

Structured data that follows a product through its lifecycle, DPPs promise to streamline verification, improve resale efficiency, and offer richer product histories — from production details to ownership changes. They’re seen by some industry players as the missing infrastructure needed to scale resale securely, as well as add storytelling capabilities.

“The next wave of value in resale lies in how we digitize a product’s provenance,” said BCG managing director Catharina Martinez-Pardo. “DPPs are a strategic tool that builds trust with consumers and opens up new ways for brands to remain involved beyond the initial sale.”

But for now, awareness lags. According to the survey, two-thirds of consumers had never heard of DPPs, and another 15 percent were unfamiliar with what it actually does. But those who do understand DPPs believe they have value to authenticate, as well as understand product detailed specs. That ranked particularly important for the handbag category, where nearly 80 percent of respondents said they would want access to DPPs and additional information.

The stakes are especially high in Europe, where legislation mandating DPPs for textiles is expected to take effect in 2027. Early movers would have an advantage and build brand loyalty, the report said, as well as support authentication services.

BCG believes that the evolution of resale is an opportunity for brands not only to rethink their product pipelines, but also their long-term engagement strategies. If brands once thought of secondhand as a threat to full-price sales, it can be positioned as a discovery channel and promote customer loyalty and retention among aspirational and younger customers.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is learnt to have offered the option of closing a FEMA violation case against e-commerce major Flipkart if the Walmart group firm admits its mistake and pays a penalty, sources aware of the development said.The option was given by the Enforcement Directorate to Flipkart last week under the compounding rules of FEMA Foreign Exchange Management Act )."ED has given the option of compounding to Flipkart. ED has asked Flipkart to admit its mistake, pay a penalty and dismantle the seller network associated with it," a source told PTI.An email query sent to Flipkart elicited no reply.The ED had also summoned Amazon India to check the status of the company.When contacted, an Amazon India spokesperson said, "We do not comment on ongoing investigations.A query sent to ED in this matter also received no response. However, ED sources said they have not made any offer to Flipkart with regard to compounding.An official of one of the e-commerce firms, on condition of anonymity, said that the compounding option given by ED is to strengthen India's negotiating power during the ongoing bilateral trade negotiation with the US.The compounding rules allow companies to voluntarily admit breach of the provision under the FEMA and settle the case by paying a penalty for the contraventions without undergoing lengthy enforcement actions.Flipkart and Amazon India have been under ED scrutiny for alleged breach of FEMA provisions.There have been allegations that these companies are pushing discounts on their platform to garner sales.The ED had first issued a show cause notice to Flipkart, related firms and individuals in July 2021, seeking its reply as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015.The notice was related to the period between 2009 and 2015, before the majority stake in Flipkart was acquired by the US major Walmart.Walmart had acquired a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018.ED has also served notice to Flipkart even after acquisition by Walmart for investigation in its business after 2016 as well.The most recent notice was served to the company in April this year.The Competition Commission of India is also conducting an investigation against Flipkart regarding alleged competition law violations by certain subsidiaries of Flipkart in India and other parties.In September 2024, a non-confidential version of the CCI DG's Investigation Report was received by one of the Flipkart subsidiaries that alleged certain competition law violations.

[TITLE]This startup wants to make your iPhone 17 and S25 Ultra affordable with a new ‘smart ‘ownership’ model:
[TEXT]
Before buying a new flagship smartphone, one of the first things consumers in India look for is whether the device can be purchased through easy monthly installments (EMIs) spread over 12 months or more. This strategy has worked in favour of phone brands and the ecosystem players contributing to the rise in the adoption of high-end, premium smartphones in the world’s most populous country. In the recent quarters, the share of premium smartphones has registered the highest growth of 96.4 per cent in India, as per the data from International Data Corporation (IDC).

While it is already possible to buy flagship smartphones through accessibility schemes, a startup called BytePe, founded by a former Flipkart executive, aims to reduce the cost of EMIs even further by offering options to upgrade or retain smartphones, drastically cutting the cost of EMIs compared to standard EMIs.

“If you are buying a product today, you typically pay 100 per cent of its value upfront. Now, maybe a year or two down the line, if you stop using it, there’s still a left out value in that product. What we have done is build a proprietary model that predicts the lifecycle value of a product. This model works seamlessly with existing financing instruments, whether it’s a credit card or our own lending ecosystem,” said Jayant Jha, Founder & CEO of BytePe, explaining the rationale behind India’s first subscription-based smartphone service.

[TITLE]2 New IPO Stocks in Town – Goldman Sachs Picks the Superior One to Buy:
[TEXT]
Klarna’s stock opened for trading at $52 per share, and the company’s IPO raised a total of $1.37 billion for the company and the selling shareholders. Klarna raised $222 million from the shares it put on the market. Today, approximately one month after the initial offering, Klarna boasts a market cap of ~$15 billion.

Looking at the company’s IPO, we find that Klarna’s shares started trading on the NYSE on September 10. The initial price was set at $40 per common share, a figure that was $4 higher than the midpoint of the originally estimated range. The company’s offering totaled 34,311,274 common shares, of which 29,311,274 were put on the market by ‘certain selling shareholders’ and 5,000,000 shares were put up for sale by Klarna.

Klarna currently has some 111 million customers on its rolls, making use of the company’s payment services for online shopping. On the merchant side, Klarna has 790,000 businesses using the service. The customer and merchant user base, combined, spans 26 countries – and the company handles $112 billion in gross merchandise volume. Among the brand names that make use of Klarna’s services are such major names as Spotify, Samsung, Ralph Lauren, Airbnb, and Ikea.

The first stock on our radar here is Klarna Group, a Swedish-based technology firm with a global footprint. Klarna’s focus is on online financial services and payment processing for e-commerce. The company manages both store claims and customer payments, and specializes in offering ‘buy now, pay later’ services to customers.

The stock analysts at Goldman Sachs have been monitoring the recent IPOs, watching to see just how they measure up in their early days of public trading. We’ve used the TipRanks database to look behind the scenes at two of these new IPO stocks, and we’ve checked in with the Goldman analysts to see which one they’ve picked as the superior stock to buy. Here are the details.

The most recent past quarter, 3Q25, showed a jump in IPO activity. The quarter saw the most IPOs since 2021 and the most $100-million deals – a total of 23 – since the same year. In all, there were 60 IPOs in 3Q25, and they raised a total of $14.6 billion – and that figure represented a powerful jump from the $2.4 billion raised in 3Q24.

IPOs are among the most-watched events in the stock markets, and rightly so. They bring new blood to the market’s body in the form of new stocks for investors to trade in. IPO action keeps the markets fresh and injects new capital into companies of every stripe.

Story Continues

For Goldman analyst Will Nance, this newly public stock offers a sound route for investors to buy into the online financial services sector.

“We view Klarna as the market leader in Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions, with a particularly strong franchise in Europe, where we believe Klarna is a new, emerging closed loop payment scheme, similar to American Express in the United States… While we acknowledge the cyclicality of the consumer finance end market, and the favorable market conditions currently, through the cycle, we see Klarna as consistent share gainer over time, benefiting from 1) share shifts to the BNPL category, 2) network effects, particularly in Europe, and 3) further geographical expansion,” Nance noted.

For Nance, this adds up to a Buy rating on KLAR. His price target of $55 points toward a 12-month gain of ~42%. (To watch Nance’s track record, click here)

From the Street as a whole, KLAR shares get a Strong Buy rating, based on 14 recent reviews that favor Buys over Holds by a 11-to-3 margin. The stock is currently trading for $38.79, and its $50.46 average target price implies a one-year upside potential of 30%. (See KLAR stock forecast)

Gemini Space Station (GEMI)

The next stock we’ll look at here is Gemini, another tech firm. Gemini gives its customers an online crypto trading app and web wallet. The company is a registered crypto exchange and custodian that is positioning itself as a link between the more traditional financial services sector and the fast-growing cryptocurrency economy. Gemini provides an opening for both institutions and individuals to enter the decentralized, crypto-centered future, where they can take advantage of open, fair, and secure financial service options.

The Gemini app is designed for mobile use and is available on both iOS and Android devices. The company boasts multiple regulatory registrations, including ISO 27001 and PCI DSS, which speak to the quality and security of its Information Security Management System and to the safety and security of the Gemini Credit Card. This brings us to the company’s chief consumer perk – a credit card linked to the user’s crypto trading account.

Gemini’s credit card is offered with no annual fees and a ‘crypto back’ reward of up to 4% on every purchase. The Bitcoin rewards offered on the card are a real investment opportunity – unlike the point rewards offered by other cards, Bitcoin will appreciate over time, and Gemini boasts that the Bitcoin rewards it has given, which are held for at least one year, have appreciated by 277%.

That’s the background to this company – a foundation in sound financial services designed to give users access to the esoteric cryptocurrency marketplace. The company has been providing these services since 2014 and went public in September of this year.

In its IPO, Gemini’s stock started trading on September 12. The offering had an aggregate of 15,937,501 shares of Class A common stock and included, with the underwriters’ over-allotment option, 300,565 shares sold by Gemini and 458,364 shares sold by the selling stockholders. Gemini did not receive proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders. The stock was priced at $28 per share, and the IPO raised over $446 million in gross proceeds. Since the event, the stock has declined by 30%, and Gemini’s market cap now stands at just over $3 billion.

This crypto exchange has caught the eye of James Yaro. The 5-star analyst, in his coverage of GEMI for Goldman, takes a cautious approach here and lays out reasons why investors should be wary. He says of the stock,

“Despite the constructive growth outlook, lack of profitability, and cyclical and competitive questions keep us on the sidelines. GEMI faces cyclical risk, in terms of: 1) an uncertain path to profitability, as we forecast positive adjusted EBITDA only in 2028E. 2) In addition, rapid credit card business growth introduces both credit and interest rate risk in an economic downturn. 3) While regulatory reform could increase the crypto TAM, it could also enhance competition from across financial services. This could pressure GEMI’s market share and pricing over time.”

These comments are accompanied by a Neutral (i.e., Hold) rating, and Yaro’s $25 price target implies a 7% upside for the coming year; the stock is currently priced at $23.30. (To watch Yaro’s track record, click here)

Turning now to the rest of the Street, opinions are split almost evenly. 6 Buys and 5 Holds add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $31.64, the average price target brings the upside potential to ~36%. (See GEMI stock forecast)

With the facts and stats laid out on KLAR and GEMI, it’s clear that Goldman Sachs sees Klarna as the superior stock to buy after its recent IPO.
