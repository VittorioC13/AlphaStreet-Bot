The bankrupt company’s major secured creditors include Azim Premji Trust IDFC First Bank and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction, which claimed dues of over Rs 485 crore. As per the latest available data with the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), the company’s total admitted claim stood at Rs 885 crore.“Approval of the resolution plan shall not be a ground for termination of any existing consents, approvals, licences, concessions, authorisations, permits or the like that has been granted to the corporate debtor...,” observed the division bench of judicial member Lakshmi Gurung and technical member, Hariharan Neelakanta Iyer, “...or for which the said corporate debtor has made an application for renewal, grant permissions, sanctions, consents, approvals, allowances, exemptions, etc.,” said the tribunal in its 36-page order.Before the tribunal’s approval, resolution professional Rajan Rawat, had informed the tribunal that out of seven bidders, two had submitted the resolution plan, through counsel Nausher Kohli.

[TITLE]5 GPO Buildings on Dublin’s Henry Street on sale for €2.7m:
[TEXT]
Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM) is seeking €2.7 million through agent Bannon for 5 GPO Buildings, on Henry Street in Dublin city centre. The sale of the retail investment property offers the prospective buyer an initial yield of 13.5 per cent.

Acquired by Irish Life in 2015 as part of its wider €154 million purchase of a collection of eight retail units and five office blocks known as the Sovereign portfolio from Royal London Asset Management, 5 GPO Buildings comprises a ground floor and basement “lock-up” retail unit extending to a total area of 165sq m (1,774sq ft). Located within the historic GPO building, the entire property is let to phone retailer Three Ireland and sublet to international jewellery brand Lovisa. There are three years remaining on the existing lease and the current rental income is €410,000 a year. Three Ireland have vacated the property, and it is sublet under licence to Lovisa Ireland Limited at an annual rent of €175,000, expiring one month before the Three Ireland lease. Should Lovisa decide to sign a new lease agreement at that point, the purchaser of the property could reasonably expect to secure at least the same annual rent, according to the selling agent.

Brian Morton of Bannon says: “Number 5 GPO Buildings offers the opportunity to acquire a high-yielding prime retail asset located within one of the country’s most historic buildings”.

[TITLE]UK's Biggest Retail Investment Platform Warns Against Including Bitcoin In Your Portfolio: 'Not An Asset Class,' 'No Intrinsic Value':
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Bitcoin is too risky to be included in investors’ portfolios, U.K.’s biggest retail investment platform says.

“Bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment – much riskier than stocks or bonds,” $225 billion asset manager Hargreaves Lansdown said last week. “The HL [Hargreaves Lansdown] Investment view is that bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn’t be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals.”

Don't Miss:

Hargreaves Lansdown added that, in its view, cryptocurrencies have “no intrinsic value.”

Hargreaves Lansdown’s statement came as the Financial Conduct Authority last week overturned a nearly six-year ban on the retail trading of spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes. While competitors like Interactive Investor and Saxo have largely opened their doors to cryptocurrency ETNs, HL said it will take the remaining months of the year to craft “the client journey and appropriateness assessment,” before offering cryptocurrency ETN trading to “appropriate clients.”

Meanwhile, under FCA rules, retail investors will be limited to Bitcoin- and Ethereum-based products on U.K. exchanges, such as the London Stock Exchange, Hargreaves Lansdown said. Investors may also be limited to allocating only up to 10% of their portfolio in cryptocurrency ETNs.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Hargreaves Lansdown’s statement aligns with sentiments from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon.

“I’m not personally a believer in Bitcoin itself, but you’re the customer—I don’t like to tell customers what they can and can’t do with their money,” Dimon told CNBC in August.

Still, the prevailing trend suggests that institutions are increasingly embracing cryptocurrencies. Among the prominent institutional backers of cryptocurrencies is the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).

“There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it’s an alternative,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CBS' "60 Minutes" in an interview aired on Sunday, while walking back 2017 remarks that Bitcoin was an “index of money laundering.”

[TITLE]Lower GST, higher bills: Salons and fitness centres raise prices despite tax relief:

Most salon chains, fitness centres , gyms and yoga clubs across the country have raised prices by 10-20% despite the reduction in goods and services tax GST ) rate to 5% from 18%from September 22, citing the simultaneous withdrawal of the option to claim an input tax credit (ITC).Executives said these businesses had no choice but to increase prices since they were forced to absorb the GST incurred on expenses such as equipment, utilities and rent under the new rule."Many salons, including ours, increased prices of services just before the rollout of the new GST rates. We try to balance affordability with profitability, but without ITC benefits, we would be at a loss if we continued to charge consumers at pre-GST prices," the founder of a nationwide chain of salons said on condition of anonymity. Input tax credit allows businesses to claim credit for the taxes they have already paid on inputs including raw materials and services used in their production or business processes.This helps reduce the overall tax liability and avoids double taxation.In the case of a salon, for instance, without a refund of taxes paid on inputs, the benefit of a lower GST rate would be nullified, according to industry executives.Similarly, other services which are ineligible for ITC, including catering and leasing of taxis, have also seen a marginal increase in prices, mostly in the unorganised sector. Even in the organised sector, insurance firms, for example, are reluctant to lower prices owing to the withdrawal of ITC. "The beauty industry had been requesting a reduction of GST on grooming services for quite some time from the government. While the reduction is significant, the withdrawal of ITC makes it a zero-sum game," said Sandeep Ahuja, former managing director at VLCC Health Care and now an independent consultant.“More so for the beauty industry, where appliances and other gadgets salons use don’t have a very long shelf life and need to be replenished frequently. All these are recurring costs,” said Ahuja.Another executive at a salon chain, based in Delhi-National Capital Region, said its outlets had increased prices across its services following the withdrawal of ITC.Meanwhile, the government is aware that in some sectors where ITC has been withdrawn, rate cuts will not be fully passed on to consumers and, in some cases, businesses may even increase prices. The Centre has received many complaints in this regard and has acted in cases pertaining to the organised sector, but price monitoring is slower in case of services in the unorganised sector, said officials.“If we receive a complaint where higher GST on services is charged we will act on it,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be identified, while admitting that there had already been a price increase in cases where ITC can no longer be claimed.Since most such services don’t come with a fixed maximum retail price—unlike fast-moving consumer goods, cars and televisions—ascertaining pre- and post-GST-reform prices isn’t always feasible, according to the official.Both beauty and fitness services chains in the country have been growing at healthy double-digit rates, riding on aspirational demand and expansion into tier-2 and tier-3 markets, according to industry reports.

[TITLE]Kering Doubles Down on Cost Cuts Despite Glimmers of Hope in Q3:
[TEXT]
Updated 5:36 p.m. ET Oct. 22

PARIS — As it prepares for new chief executive officer Luca de Meo to detail his turnaround plan next spring, Kering will continue to cut costs and curb debt, with plans to ramp up store closures, refinance real estate and dispose of noncore assets.

De Meo pledged to double down on his efforts after the ailing French luxury group on Wednesday reported a 10 percent drop in revenues in the third quarter. Still, a better-than-expected performance at the company’s star brand Gucci provided a glimmer of hope.

Organic sales at the maker of Jackie handbags and Horsebit loafers fell 14 percent in the three months to Sept. 30, beating a company-compiled consensus forecast of a 16 percent decline. This compared with a 25 percent drop for Gucci in the second quarter.

Group revenues totaled 3.42 billion euros, representing a 5 percent decline in comparable terms. This came on the heels of a 15 percent drop in organic sales in the prior quarter, and was markedly better than the 3.31 billion euros the market was expecting.

“Kering’s third-quarter performance, while representing a clear sequential improvement, remains far below that of the market,” de Meo said in a statement.

“This reinforces my determination to work on all dimensions of the business to return our houses and the group to the prominence they deserve. We are working relentlessly on our turnaround, as shown by our recent decisions,” he added.

Since he officially took up his duties on Sept. 15, Kering has made several big moves geared at reviving Gucci and tackling the group’s net debt, which stood at 9.5 billion euros at the end of June.

Over the weekend, the group said it would sell its beauty division to L’Oréal for 4 billion euros in cash, in addition to granting the French beauty giant long-term fragrance and beauty licenses for some of its top brands. The partnership, hailed as a category game-changer, also includes a joint venture in the field of wellness.

De Meo did not participate in a call with analysts and media after the publication of the results, but chief operating officer Jean-Marc Duplaix and chief financial officer Armelle Poulou provided some insight into future actions.

No Stone Unturned

Hailing “positive signs of inflection” in the third quarter, with a favorable response to designer debuts at Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga during the spring 2026 runway shows, Duplaix said the group would leave no stone unturned in the search for cost savings.

“Our task is to implement structural solutions to the group’s challenges and reduce our sensitivity to cycles. In this endeavor, there are no sacred cows,” he said. “We are using every available lever to reduce our cost base.”

Kering has closed 55 stores so far this year, including 14 in the third quarter, leaving it with 1,758 retail locations at the end of September. Gucci accounted for half the stores shuttered in the first nine months of the year.

De Meo is expected to unveil more radical measures next year.

“We went a little bit too far in terms of expansion of the network, so without providing any figures, you can assume that in the two coming years we’ll continue to rationalize quite drastically the network,” Duplaix said.

He hailed the deal with L’Oréal as a “major step forward” and a “win-win deal,” clarifying that it should deliver a net gain, before tax, for Kering in addition to helping significantly to decrease the group’s debt.

“It’s a good price for both parties, considering the ambitions we have on both sides for our beauty brands but also for the joint venture,” Duplaix said. “All the brands, relatively to their respective size, have the potential to grow quite massively with, of course, an incremental level of royalties for us.”

In a separate results call on Tuesday, L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said he saw billion-dollar potential for Creed and Gucci, once that license is no longer held by Coty. Duplaix clarified that the plan is to wait for the Gucci license to expire.

He praised the performance of the Kering Beauté division, explaining that the decision to sell was prompted by the need to accelerate growth and optimize investments. Duplaix said Kering chairman François-Henri Pinault, who handed over CEO duties to de Meo last month, had started exploring a sale before his arrival, but de Meo sealed the deal.

Having said in July that Kering had no plans to sell underperforming brands, Duplaix indicated a shift in strategy. “We will review, of course, in a very open manner, as we already always did, the relevance of the assets we have in the portfolio,” he said.

However, he excluded a divestment of Kering’s eyewear division, a bright spot in the third quarter with a 6 percent increase in organic sales. “Kering Eyewear is core in the strategy of Kering. It’s doing extremely well, it’s the leader in its segment,” he said.

This appeared to contradict de Meo’s comment in an interview with The Financial Times this week that he remained “pragmatic” with regard to other potential asset sales, including the eyewear business. “I don’t want to close the door because we try to be very open,” de Meo said.

Duplaix also brushed off suggestions that L’Oréal could acquire Giorgio Armani and license its ready-to-wear activities to Kering in a future deal. “We have a lot of challenges in our brands. I think our plate is quite full,” he said. “It’s not a consideration we have so far

[TITLE]Hindustan Unilever Q2 Preview: To see low-single-digit revenue growth:
[TEXT]
Hindustan Unilever is expected to report low single-digit revenue growth on underlying flat sales in Q2FY26, when it announces its quarterly results on Thursday.

Earlier the company had stated it saw a transitory impact of GST 2.0 implementation in sales with disruption at the distributor and retailer’s end.

In a preview note on the FMCG sector Nuvama had said fast-moving consumer goods companies are expected to take a hit in sales during the quarter with the GST transition, which would impact their sales.

Kotak Equities is expecting the EBITDA margin to fall by 140 bps year-on-year to 22.1 per cent while Motilal Oswal expects a 2 per cent revenue growth driven by volume expansion. However, the financial service firm expects a 90 bps fall in gross margins with increased competition.

“The sector is likely to post 7 per cent year-on-year revenue growth in 2Q, with flattish EBITDA. GST 2.0 slowed primary-channel stocking, compressing reported growth and adding MoM volatility. Extended monsoon and restocking pause led to mixed category trend; summer and RTD/beverages softened, pricing-led staples held up, beer volumes stayed patchy,” said Equirus Securities

In September HUL had said the GST rate reduction, while a positive step by the government to support long-term consumption growth, it had seen a transitory impact in the form of disruption at distributors and retailers across channels to clear existing inventories with old prices.

“This has resulted in postponement of ordering in anticipation of receiving new stocks with updated prices and lower orders across the overall portfolio as consumers delayed their pantry buying. This has led to a short-term impact on sales for the company in September,” it had said.

Approximately 40 per cent of the company’s portfolio including toilet soap, toothpaste, shampoo, hair oil, talcum powder, lifestyle nutrition and other foods now benefit from a reduced GST rate of 5 per cent, down from the previous GST rates of 12 per cent or 18 per cent.

[TITLE]Food and Beverage Company Jongro Inks 7K-SF Storage Deal in Astoria:
[TEXT]
Food and beverage management company Jongro F&B, which manages several restaurant concepts in New York City, is taking storage space in Queens’ Astoria neighborhood, Commercial Observer has learned.

Jongro signed a five-year lease for approximately 7,000 square feet of flex space at Kassabian Associates’ 35-18 37th Street, according to broker Colliers. Asking rent was $21 per square foot.

Jongro’s new location between 35th and 36th avenues will be used for storage, warehouse, distribution and office space, Colliers said. The space — which was recently renovated by the landlord — will store supplies for Jongro’s existing restaurant concepts in the city, which include Korean restaurant Jongro BBQ, matcha cafe Nana’s Green Tea, barbecue restaurant Seven Scents and tea house Heytea.

“We’re continuing to see strong demand for these types of properties in the outer borough markets,” Joshua Kleinberg, an executive vice president at Colliers, said in a statement to CO.

Colliers’ Kleinberg, Daniel Mundle and Samuel Essery brokered the deal. Colliers will continue to market available space in the three-story Astoria building.

A spokesperson for Jongro did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for Kassabian could not be reached for comment.

News of the deal comes after another recent storage lease was signed in the neighborhood. In August, Piece of Cake Moving & Storage signed a deal for 4,500 square feet within an industrial property at 31-25 20th Avenue, as CO previously reported.

[TITLE]Gold glitters online as festive shoppers turn to e-commerce, quick commerce platforms for auspicious buys:
[TEXT]
Luxury and prosperity are shining bright this festive season, with online platforms like Amazon and BigBasket witnessing record demand for gold, silver, and fine jewellery purchases ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras.

Premium fashion on Amazon Fashion and Beauty has seen a sharp uptick, led by fine jewellery and luxury watches.

“This festive season, premium fashion is seeing remarkable growth, with luxury watches and gold and diamond jewellery — including lab-grown diamonds — driving demand,” said Siddharth Bhagat, Director, Amazon Fashion and Beauty, India.

Amazon reported a 96% year-on-year surge in gold jewellery sales, driven by brands such as CaratLane, PN Gadgil Jewellers, Joyalukkas, PC Chandra, KISNA, and Malabar Gold & Diamonds. The platform now offers more than five lakh styles across silver, gold, and diamond jewellery, making it the largest fine jewellery destination among online marketplaces.

Bhagat said the company is also seeing strong traction in affordable fine jewellery — with customers buying pieces starting at ₹2,000 for silver and up to ₹40,000 for gold and diamond. Demand for 14K daily-wear jewellery has grown 50 per cent year-on-year, while 18K styles are also gaining popularity.

In line with global trends, Amazon has expanded into lab-grown diamonds, offering jewellery starting at ₹1,699 across more than 50,000 styles. “Amazon is the first and only online marketplace focusing on this whitespace,” Bhagat said.

Gold coins remain a festive favourite, with the most purchased denomination being 2 grams. “Customers continue to prefer Amazon for their auspicious purchases of gold and silver coins during Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras and more,” Bhagat added.

Complementing this, Tata-owned bigbasket also recorded a strong Dhanteras, with gold coin sales rising 146 per cent and silver coins up 234 per cent from last year. Demand for pooja essentials — including diyas, flowers, and festive décor — grew 54 per cent year-on-year.

“Dhanteras is a time for prosperity, devotion, and togetherness. This year, bigbasket ensured our customers could celebrate without compromise, whether it was purchasing auspicious coins or getting the perfect gifts and pooja items in minutes,” said Seshu Kumar, Chief Buying and Merchandising Officer, bigbasket.

With 10-minute delivery and curated festive assortments, bigbasket blended technology and tradition, meeting last-minute festive needs — from auspicious buys to celebratory gifting.

Both platforms are capitalising on India’s accelerating shift toward online festive shopping, where authenticity, convenience, and trust are emerging as the new hallmarks of prosperity.
