[TITLE]Cloud Software Group to Acquire Arctera : @VMblog:
[TEXT]
Cloud Software Group, Inc. announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arctera, a global leader in data management, from funds affiliated with global investment firm Carlyle. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Upon close, Arctera will operate as a standalone business unit within the Cloud Software Group portfolio.

Arctera is a global data management company created in 2024 following the combination of Veritas' Enterprise Data Protection business with Cohesity. Arctera's portfolio comprises Data Resilience delivered through InfoScale, Data Compliance through the Insight platform and Data Protection through Backup Exec. Arctera helps organizations thrive by delivering market-leading solutions that enable customers to trust, access and illuminate critical data. Headquartered in Pleasanton, California with employees and facilities around the world, Arctera delivers tailored data solutions to thousands of customers globally and generates more than $400 million of annual revenue and more than 40% adjusted EBITDA margins.

"This acquisition marks an exciting milestone for Cloud Software Group and an important step forward in our long-term growth strategy," said Tom Krause, Chief Executive Officer of Cloud Software Group. "We have a strong track record of continuing to invest in our portfolio of leading software brands, as evidenced by our work to improve profitability and long-term sustainability of the Citrix and TIBCO businesses. Looking ahead, we aim to acquire at-scale enterprise-focused software businesses that provide proven mission-critical capabilities and high value to public and private sector customers while also ensuring they're a good fit to operate within our proven Cloud Software Group model."

Krause continued, "We have long admired Arctera's business and the work that the Arctera and Carlyle teams have done to expand the business. Arctera has grown into a leading provider of data and enterprise infrastructure software solutions for customers worldwide, and we are confident that Arctera's portfolio of Data Resilience, Data Compliance and Data Protection products will be a natural complementary addition to Cloud Software Group. We look forward to expanding the services and products we provide for both sets of customers through this acquisition."

"We are thrilled to enter this next chapter in Arctera's evolution as we become a part of the Cloud Software Group team," said Lawrence Wong, Chief Executive Officer of Arctera. "Our mission has been to build on our pedigree of innovation across our three distinct product lines, each tailored to solve the most demanding data challenges for their customers. With Cloud Software Group's global resources, industry leading portfolio and seasoned leadership team, Arctera will be even better positioned to continue helping customers manage one of their most valuable assets: data."

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Cloud Software Group expects to fund the acquisition using cash on its balance sheet. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is acting as legal counsel to Cloud Software Group. Citi is serving as exclusive financial advisor and Alston & Bird LLP is acting as legal counsel to Arctera.
