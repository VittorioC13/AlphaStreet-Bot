[TITLE]Nigeria launches oil blocks bid round, eyes $10bn investment:
[TEXT]
The Federal Government, through the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, has unveiled an ambitious plan to attract $10bn in new investments and unlock up to two billion barrels of crude oil reserves through the newly commenced Nigeria 2025 Petroleum Licensing Round.

Unveiling the bid round in Abuja on Monday, the Chief Executive, NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, said the exercise, covering 50 oil and gas blocks across onshore, shallow-water, frontier, and deepwater terrains, would help reverse declining exploration activity, expand reserves, and boost national production.

Komolafe said the round marks a major step in the country’s push to revitalise exploration and boost long-term production capacity. He said the commission had unveiled detailed guidelines on its portal, br2025.nuprc.gov.ng, and adopted a two-stage bidding process designed to ensure credibility, investor confidence, and fairness, as prescribed by Section 73 of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.

He said, “The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission is proud to formally announce the commencement of the Nigeria 2025 licensing round and the launch of the licensing round online portal br2025.nuprc.gov.ng.

“This announcement is in line with Section 73 of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021, which prescribes a fair, transparent, and competitive bidding process. Further to this, the NUPRC, following the gracious approval of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, has listed 50 oil and gas blocks across onshore, swamp/shallow water, and offshore terrains spanning diverse basins.”

Of these 50 blocks, 15 are onshore assets; shallow water 19; frontier 15, and 1 deep water asset. According to the NUPRC, the 2025 round is expected to significantly deepen upstream activity over the next decade, with projections indicating that the awarded blocks could collectively deliver up to 400,000 barrels per day upon full operationalisation.

“The Nigeria 2025 licensing round is therefore expected to attract

[TITLE]Ottawa-Alberta deal ‘game changer’ for conventional oil and gas, industry head says:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

A federal-provincial agreement on energy policy is being characterized as “pragmatic” and “a game changer” by the president of a group representing oil and gas drillers in Canada, even as the industry comes off a down year.

Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Energy Contractors (CAOEC), which represents 89 Canadian land drilling, offshore drilling and service rig companies, told reporters Monday that the agreement reached between Alberta and Ottawa was “great news for the conventional side of the business.”

“This is really pragmatic policy. I think it’s competitive policy, and I think it’s a game changer for the conventional business,” Scholz said.

The agreement lays out the groundwork for a new bitumen pipeline through British Columbia. It also includes a suite of changes to Ottawa’s environmental regulatory landscape, many of which the CAOEC had long been pushing for, including the suspension of the proposed federal oil and gas emissions cap.

But the MOU won’t translate into a dramatic change to the CAOEC’s forecast, with impacts expected more in the long term, Scholz said.

" We don't see a dramatic change in 2026," he said, noting the proposed pipeline through B.C. is years away from being realized.

Drilling activity expected to slightly increase

Scholz said the sector will finish 2025 with less activity than it saw the year prior, with year-over-year drilling activity expected to decrease by about six per cent.

The start of the year appeared promising, with first-quarter drilling two per cent higher than in 2024, but conditions deteriorated sharply.

Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Energy Contractors, told reporters Monday that the recent Alberta-Ottawa deal is a positive step for the conventional oil and gas industry. (Mike Symington/CBC)

Still, the CAOEC is expecting a slight uptick in activity next year. The industry group wrote in its 2025 State of the Industry report that it is expecting about 5,700 wells to be drilled in 2026, which would be up about three per cent from this year.

“The reason why we were seeing such a drop in activity was because we were seeing gluts within the market for natural gas within Western Canada, and it impacted our operations significantly,” Scholz said.

“Part of that was because of the timing issue with LNG offtake, and the ability to export that off the continent. We see that well dealt with, in the second half [of 2026], and so we do see a continued strong demand for natural gas drilling within Western Canada.”

He said CAOEC is also hopeful that oil markets show more discipline.

“We have already heard discussions about production cuts with OPEC , some more discipline from the Middle East producers. So I think that will firm up crude oil prices, which will provide some stability,” he said.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said while price fluctuations are painful for governments who rely on energy revenue, she remained optimistic about the industry’s long-term outlook. (Mike Symington/CBC)

A separate industry forecast from the Calgary-based Enserva was released last week . It suggested that drilling activity would fall further in 2026, as North American oil prices remain below $60 US a barrel.

That report suggested oil and gas companies would see their total capital spending decline by 5.6 per cent this year and a further 2.2 per cent in 2026.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects prices will decline to an average of $55 US in 2026, and while projections vary, others see prices headed lower in 2027.

Speaking to reporters Monday, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said “short-term price fluctuations are painful for governments” that rely on oil and gas as a source of revenue.

“But I remain very confident that when we look forward five, 10, 15 years, that there’s going to be more Alberta energy on the market,” Smith said.

[TITLE]‘Trump is targeting Nigeria’s oil’, mineral wealth – Pastor Tunde Bakare claims:
[TEXT]
The Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has explained why the United States President, Donald Trump, designated Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern (CPC).”

In October, PREMIUM TIMES reported that Mr Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, categorised Nigeria as a CPC.

He alleged that Christianity in Nigeria faced a grave existential threat due to killings by radical Islamist groups.

Speaking during a state-of-the-nation address delivered at the church on Sunday in Lagos, posted on Channels Television’s YouTube page, Mr Bakare said Mr Trump’s administration’s position was influenced by Nigeria’s vast oil and mineral resources, as well as its strategic sectors.

He recounted that shortly after Mr Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, he received a vision in which he (Mr Trump) arrived in Sabo, Yaba, Lagos, aboard Air Force One.

According to him, Mr Trump was dressed in an Arabian thobe and ghutra and declared, “We are here now.”

Nigerian interest

He said the vision indicated a particular interest MrTrump would develop in Nigeria, tied to Middle East geopolitics, the oil and gas industry, real estate, and the country’s fast-growing technology sector.

The 71-year-old said, “It was clear to us that President Donald Trump was going to have a particular interest in Nigeria. His interest in Nigeria was closely tied to his interests in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. Nigeria’s oil industry is expected to be crucial to the Trump presidency, as well as other mineral resources and key sectors, such as real estate.

“The American president will be particularly interested in Nigeria’s role in the value chain of emerging technologies. In that vision, the tech industry dimension was represented by Sabo Yaba, where the president’s aircraft landed. Sabo Yaba is a presenter of Nigeria’s tech startup hub, hosting such hubs as the co-creation hub, founded by Nigeria’s current minister of communication, innovation, and digital economy, Dr Bosun Tijani.”

The Ogun-born clergyman added that Mr Trump’s appearance in Muslim attire clearly signalled that his interest in Nigeria would carry significant religious implications.

“Sabo Yaba has unleashed such unicorns as Andala, Flutterwave, and Jumia to the extent that Yaba has earned the nickname Yabacon Valley, emulating the American-based global hub for technological innovation, entrepreneurship, and venture capital, Silicon Valley.

“Trump’s Muslim attire was a clear indication that his interest in Nigeria was going to have serious religious implications, so that could cause religiously motivated social unrest. By the way, Sabo in the Hausa language is a short form of Sabungiri, which means new town or migrant settlement”, he said.

Enter the national assembly

Furthermore, Mr Bakare criticised the National Assembly for engrossing itself in politicking while the US Congress convened a hearing on the nation’s worsening insecurity.

Politics of chaos

He argued that lawmakers were preoccupied with the politics of chaos and paid scant attention to the real work of governance, until Mr Trump’s remarks jolted what he described as a sleeping giant.

The former presidential aspirant said, “Nigeria’s political class have been dancing on the hot stool like the experimental frog that slowly boiled to death as the heat rises. They have numbed themselves to the painful realities that ordinary citizens endure daily. It is a stain on the Nigerian government that it took the threat of external intervention to rouse leaders to their responsibilities.

“It is a shame on our National Assembly that it took the United States Congress, not the representatives elected by Nigerians, to convene a hearing on the lived experiences of citizens suffering under insecurity, while those in Abuja were busy with politicking, posturing for political relevance, defecting from one political party to another in their desperate maneuvers to secure their seats ahead of the 2027 elections.”

He also criticised what he described as Nigeria’s failed foreign affairs architecture.

According to him, the government’s sudden flurry of activity following Trump’s remarks merely exposed its earlier lack of urgency.

He added that it reflected poorly on the Nigerian government that external pressure was required before officials took action.

Mr Bakare said, “It’s indeed a shame that Nigeria’s foreign affairs architecture failed all the while to mobilise Nigeria’s dwindling diplomatic goodwill to secure international support for the war on terror, only to respond with excuses when that goodwill reached its lowest ebb.

“Amid all of these developments, concerned Nigerians have been reaching out to me, both directly and through my aide, as well as through the media, asking why I have not spoken all this time.”

[TITLE]Harbour Energy to Cut 100 UK Jobs:
[TEXT]
Harbour Energy Plc, one of the largest independent oil and gas firms in the UK, expects to cut another 100 jobs.

Harbour Energy Plc, one of the largest independent oil and gas firms in the UK, expects to cut another 100 jobs after the government decided to keep a windfall tax on North Sea producers.

The Labour government last week said it plans to retain the Energy Profits Levy — introduced by the previous Conservative administration in 2022 — until March 2030. That was blow to oil and gas producers, which had been pushing for faster change to the tax to unlock investments, boost production and keep jobs.

“The future structure of our offshore workforce must adapt to reflect these realities,” Scott Barr, managing director of Harbour Energy’s UK business, said in an emailed statement. British offshore operations “will continue to struggle to compete for capital within our global portfolio, while the EPL remains,” he said.

Harbour Energy, which completed the acquisition of Wintershall Dea’s non-Russian assets last year, operates in nine countries, including in Norway, Germany, Argentina, Mexico and North Africa. The company has already cut

[TITLE]247Solar launches $25 million Series B round to scale around-the-clock industrial heat and electricity for C&I sector:
[TEXT]
GREAT FALLS, Va. , Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247Solar, the MIT-born innovator of clean, always-on industrial heat plus electricity for commercial and industrial customers, today announced the launch of a $25 million Series B capital raise.

Aimed at accelerating project deployment and advancing 247Solar’s breakthrough solution to global markets, the round has already secured $3.5 million from existing investors, with additional commitments under active due diligence.

The new funding will help the company advance its $250M active pipeline on six continents that includes a Top-20 global utility, off-grid mining operations, and other applications.

The Company has retained MaxEn Capital Advisors to advise on the offering. MaxEn Capital Advisors has a long history of providing technical and financial consulting in the energy space, with expertise in project finance, project development and capital structuring.

“With it’s unique ability to decarbonize high-temperature industrial heat while also providing clean electricity, 247Solar addresses one of the biggest challenges of all in industrial decarbonization,” says Howard Margulis, MaxEn’s Senior Managing Director. “We look forward to bringing the Company together with investors and funding sources that also realize the enormous potential of this technology.”

Solving industry’s hardest energy challenge

Industrial companies worldwide face the urgent need to decarbonize their energy use — without sacrificing reliability, cost, or performance. And 60% of industrial energy use across sectors is to produce heat, not power, typically by burning fossil fuels.

247Solar’s factory-built, modular system uniquely solves this challenge, harnessing the sun’s energy to offer highly reliable, high-temperature process heat and also around-the-clock clean electric power.

By addressing their power and heat needs simultaneously, customers can cut their energy bills by 25% or more and reduce carbon emissions by as much as 95%. In addition, 247Solar solutions typically increase reliability and improve performance.

Funding use and next milestones

With origins at MIT and more than 40 patents globally, 247Solar’s next-generation platform has attracted attention across mining, data center, hydrogen, and desalination markets, as well as electric utilities.

The company’s pipeline and near-term projects span Africa, India, Europe, Australia, and South America, as well as North America — including emerging markets that tend to be forgotten — with project values from $5 million to over $500 million.

The Series B capital will fund:

Scaling of 247Solar’s energy-as-a-service model to de-risk projects for both investors and customers (build-own-operate, with long-term PPAs)

Driving cost reductions and mass production of core technologies

Bringing a new industrial thermal battery to market, to deliver both clean heat and electricity from PV, wind or the grid.

Advanced development of a new, larger 3.5 MW solution (versus the current 400 kW module), to be fully engineered by mid-2026 and ready for deployment in 2027

Expanding the company’s business development and commercial team to enter new markets

247Solar anticipates its industrial heat-plus-power technology to rapidly expand as the PV solar, battery energy storage, and wind energy markets have before.

A decisive moment for industrial energy capacity

“247Solar exists to close the industrial clean energy gap—by delivering reliability, cost-savings, and round-the-clock performance that PV solar alone can’t match,” said CEO Bruce Anderson. “With this Series B, we’re scaling what we believe will become the industry standard for decarbonizing the world’s toughest energy loads.”

John Jovanovic, Export-Import Bank of the United States, said: "This investment demonstrates EXIM's commitment to strengthening domestic supply chains for strategic minerals essential to our national security and economic prosperity. Titan's innovative approach to developing America's first integrated graphite capability in more than 70 years aligns directly with our mission to support U.S. jobs and reduce foreign dependencies in critical sectors."

“The Kilbourne Project Study represents a pivotal milestone in advancing U.S. critical mineral independence,” said Rita Adiani, CEO and President of Titan Mining. “Backed by EXIM’s $120 million Letter of Interest and additional non-dilutive MMIA funding, Titan is poised to be able to supply nearly half of the nation’s natural graphite demand through a fully integrated operation in New York State.”

Adiani continued, “EXIM’s support is far more than capital—it is validation of Titan’s strategic role in establishing America’s graphite independence. By providing non-dilutive funding at the feasibility stage and confirming project-finance support for construction, EXIM is enabling Titan to move faster while preserving balance-sheet strength. Together with our established zinc operations generating cash flow, we are building a U.S.-anchored critical minerals platform with clear, long-term growth.”
