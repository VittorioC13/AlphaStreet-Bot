Singapore-based company Sembcorp Industries has agreed to acquire Australia’s integrated energy provider Alinta Energy to grow its global renewables capacity and strengthen its footprint in the Australian energy market.

Under a share sale agreement with Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises (CTFE), Sembcorp will acquire 100% of Alinta Energy at an enterprise value of A$6.5bn ($4.32bn).

Alinta operates a portfolio with 3.4GW of installed and contracted generation capacity across coal, gas, wind, and solar. It supplies electricity and gas to nearly 1.1 million customers nationwide.

Wholly owned by CTFE since 2017, Alinta is regarded as one of leading Australian energy retailers and generators.

The deal brings together Alinta’s local market expertise with Sembcorp’s global renewables capability, giving Sembcorp an established platform to speed up clean energy growth in Australia.

Sembcorp will execute the acquisition via its Australian subsidiaries by purchasing operating entities Pioneer Sail and Latrobe Valley Power, though the ownership structure was not detailed.

Alinta operates a portfolio of efficient generation assets, with a dispatchable portfolio availability of 93%.

The company also has a 10.4GW pipeline of renewables and firming projects, supporting Australia’s aim for energy transition and security.

Sembcorp has invested over A$5.9bn in renewable projects worldwide and targets 25GW of renewable capacity by 2028, with Australia as a key market.

The company said that it will continue backing Alinta’s strategy to deliver affordable and reliable power supply and advance a balanced and responsible energy transition.

Sembcorp Renewables East president and CEO Alex Tan said: “Australia is a well-established and forward-looking energy market, and this acquisition strengthens our presence in a key developed market while providing a scalable platform for Sembcorp to accelerate renewables and low-carbon growth.

“By combining Sembcorp’s global renewables expertise and access to capital with Alinta’s strong local workforce and project pipeline, we believe we can contribute meaningfully to Australia’s decarbonisation goals and support long-term employment opportunities in local communities.

“We remain committed to operating responsibly and sustainably, working closely with government, communities, and Alinta’s experienced management team to deliver a transition that meets national and stakeholder needs.”

Furthermore, CTFE has invested more than A$1.1bn to build a digital platform for Australian customers, upgrade its generation fleet for further flexibility and reliability, and develop a 10.4GW pipeline of renewables and firming projects.

In October, Sembcorp agreed to acquire ReNew Sun Bright, the solar energy unit of ReNew Energy Global, for approximately S$246m.

[TITLE]Trump plans envision major U.S. investment in Russia, restoring oil flows to Europe, WSJ says:
[TEXT]
MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies in deal for Namibia offshore oil field:
[TEXT]
TotalEnergies will join Portuguese firm Galp to operate Namibia's Mopane oil field, which could contain at least 10 billion barrels, according to estimates - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP Andrew Harnik

TotalEnergies said Tuesday it had reached a deal to become a partner in the Mopane oil field off the coast of Namibia, where exploration remains underway.

The deal with Galp will see TotalEnergies joining the Portuguese firm as an operator as more exploration wells are drilled in view to develop the field for production.

“The transaction positions TotalEnergies as the operator of the two largest oil discoveries in Namibia and opens the way for the development of a major producing hub, generating long-term value for the country and partners,” the French firm said in a statement.

Galp said last year it estimated the Mopane field could contain at least 10 billion barrels of oil.

The deal will see TotalEnergies take a 40 percent stake in the petroleum exploration licence that includes Mopane. Galp will retain a 40 percent stake, alongside the Namibian national oil company Namcor and private firm Custos, which each hold 10 percent stakes.

In exchange, TotalEnergies will finance half of Galp’s capital expenditures for exploration and appraisal of the Mopane field, as well as initial development, with repayment to come from future cash flows from the project.

Galp will also get a 10 percent stake in the nearby Venus exploration zone, where TotalEnergies has discovered oil.

TotalEnergies said it hopes to make a final investment decision on whether to develop production at Venus next year.

TotalEnergies shares were up 0.4 percent in afternoon trading on the Paris stock exchange, where the blue-chip CAC 40 index was down 0.6 percent.

The government has notified the new Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, bringing into force a modern regulatory framework aimed at attracting investment and improving ease of doing business in the oil and gas sector.The rules, issued under the recently approved Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025, replace the earlier system of multiple licences with a single petroleum lease covering exploration, development and production of all hydrocarbons, including shale, according to a gazette notification.The new framework provides lease tenures of up to 30 years, extendable for the full economic life of a field, with terms protected from adverse changes. Criminal penalties for violations have been removed and replaced with higher financial penalties of Rs 25 lakh, plus Rs 10 lakh per day for continuing breaches. The rules also allow lessees to share infrastructure to improve operational efficiency.Environmental provisions have mandated time-bound plans for zero gas flaring and reduced greenhouse emissions.Applications for petroleum leases must now be decided within 180 days, and disputes may be resolved through an expedited mechanism, including a neutral arbitration seat for foreign investors.The Oil Industry Safety Directorate has been designated as the competent authority for offshore safety, audits and standard-setting in exploration and production operations.Commenting on the move, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, "In a landmark moment today, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, have been amended to offer ease of business and operations".With a broader spectrum of rights under one petroleum lease, the lessees will have the right to carry out all types of mineral oil operations under one petroleum lease, he said, adding that they may undertake decarbonisation and comprehensive energy projects at oilfields.Application for the grant of a petroleum lease will be decided within 180 days. Long-term leases of up to 30 years may be granted and may be extended up to the economic life of the field, allowing the lessee to make a planned investment decision.Lessees will make an annual declaration to the government of the installed, utilised and excess capacity of the infrastructure facilities owned by it, he said.The new rules permit lessees to jointly develop or share infrastructure facilities by mutual agreement.Seat of arbitration of lease and contractual disputes, where all lessees or contractors are companies incorporated in India, will be New Delhi. Where any member is a foreign company as defined in the Companies Act, a neutral seat of arbitration may be opted for.Rules require NOCs to promptly notify all existing and new discoveries, submit field development plans within prescribed time limits, obtain central government approval for development areas, and regularly report development and production activities. Vedanta Group chairman Anil Agarwal said, "Notifying the landmark reforms to India's oil and gas regulatory framework" is "a truly historic development"."The world has long recognised India's vast untapped hydrocarbon potential, and these new rules finally create the environment needed to unlock it," he said."India produces some of the most affordable oil and gas globally. These reforms will directly benefit consumers - especially the poorest - by enabling greater domestic production and reducing dependence on imports."He said this is the kind of bold, inclusive policy that transformed the United States from a major importer into an energy surplus nation."I never imagined I would witness such a reform in my lifetime. Our energy security is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity. With these changes, I am confident that India can produce at least 50 per cent of its energy domestically."

[TITLE]Atlantica Closes the Acquisition of Statkraft's Renewable Energy Platform in Canada:
[TEXT]
December 10, 2025 – Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure today announced it completed the previously announced acquisition of a Canadian renewable energy platform, marking an important milestone in the Company’s growth strategy in North America.

The platform includes 236 MW in operation and a 0.6 GW pipeline of renewable and storage projects and a small team of experienced employees who have joined Atlantica. This acquisition expands Atlantica’s presence in the Canadian market and strengthens its position in the broader North American renewables sector.

The operating portfolio includes a 51% stake in l’Érable, a 100 MW wind facility in Quebec, in operation since 2013, and a 136 MW wind asset in Alberta that began operations in early 2025. Both assets are backed by long-term PPAs with investment-grade counterparties, with an average remaining contract life of approximately 13 years. The platform also adds approximately 0.6 GW of solar, wind, and storage projects under development across several Canadian provinces, further strengthening Atlantica’s position in Canada.

In addition, Atlantica successfully closed the project financing of Winnifred with National Bank of Canada.

Santiago Seage, Atlantica’s CEO, said: “This transaction is a key step in our North American growth strategy. We are pleased to welcome the new team members to Atlantica. The integration of this experienced local team will complement our existing Canadian operations and enhance our capabilities to capture future growth opportunities across the region”. Santiago added: “This acquisition significantly expands our presence in a core market with attractive growth prospects.”

Atlantica previously announced in August 2025 that it had signed an agreement to acquire this platform. Following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the transaction has now successfully closed.

[TITLE]South Carolina’s Abandoned Nuclear Plants Could be Revived as Firm Offers $2.7B:
[TEXT]
South Carolina’s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.

The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.

The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.

Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper’s costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.

The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site

[TITLE]80% of data centre energy must come from renewables - CRU:
[TEXT]
Data centres will be required to meet at least 80% of their annual energy demand with additional renewable electricity projects generating in the Republic of Ireland.

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has today published its decision on a new electricity connection policy for data centres.

Under the rules, data centre developers will be allowed a six-year "glide path" for renewables to be developed and start generating.

The CRU said that new data centres connecting to the electricity network will continue to be required to provide generation and/or storage capacity, either onsite or local in proximity to match the requested data centre maximum import demand capacity.

"This generation will be required to participate in the wholesale electricity market to support overall system adequacy, while providing a potential revenue stream to the developer.," the CRU said in its decision.

When it comes to the location of data centres, the CRU said that electricity system operators must consider whether a requested data centre connection is in a constrained or unconstrained location on the electricity network.

"This will require system operators to focus on the details of the specific application and its location on the electricity network instead of the current broader regional approach," the CRU said.

"The system operators will also be required to regularly publish information in relation to the availability of capacity on the electricity network, identifying current and future constraints to provide accessible information for all stakeholders," it added.

Electricity demand from data centres has grown from 5% of national electricity demand in 2015 to 22% in 2024.

Digital Infrastructure Ireland, which represents the data centre sector, said it was pleased that the policy has finally been released by the CRU.

"We are hopeful this will end the four-year de facto moratorium on data centres and begin to reset the digital infrastructure industry here in Ireland," the group said.

Cloud Infrastructure Ireland, the Ibec trade association that represents digital infrastructure providers, welcomed the publication of the connection policy, which it said provides the needed clarity for new sustainable data centre investments in Ireland.

"The policy will also support Ireland's wider digital economy and the hundreds of Irish firms supporting the digital infrastructure sector," it said.

Wind Energy Ireland also welcomed the publication of the connection policy.

"This new policy gives certainty to large-energy users and to the renewable energy industry," said Noel Cunniffe, CEO of Wind Energy Ireland.

"It will unlock investment into Ireland, support new wind farms and help to accelerate the electrification of our energy system," he added.

The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland (AmCham) said the publication of the CRU's decision provides much-needed clarity for investors and energy users.

"Vital digital infrastructure is foundational to Ireland's ability to attract and retain investment, support high-value jobs, and enable the continued growth of the wider digital economy, all of which rely on dependable access to electricity for large energy users," said AmCham CEO Paul Sweetman.

Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said it may be a good decision for data centres and renewables developers, but added that it is not a good day for climate, or for households and communities dependent on expensive fossil fuels.

"Requiring data centres to 'match' at least 80% of their annual demand with new renewables does not guarantee actual reductions in emissions," said Jerry Mac Evilly, Campaigns Director at Friends of the Earth.

"This is merely an accounting exercise and data centres’ colossal energy demand inevitably means more use of fossil fuel power plants."
