[TITLE]Catamaran Ventures to follow patient capital route in bets on India's manufacturing push:
[TEXT]
Billionaire N R Narayan Murthy's family office Catamaran Ventures plans to make more growth stage equity bets in manufacturing, a top executive at the firm said on Wednesday.

“Our thesis is based on the view that over the next 5-10 years in India, from a wealth and job creation perspective, the country needs to develop its supply chain for precision manufacturing," Deepak Padaki, president at Catamaran Ventures told Mint.

Murthy, a co-founder of information technology services bellwether Infosys Ltd, is chairman emeritus of Catamaran.

Over the last year, several funds have been deepening their focus on manufacturing as a sector, with some launching new funds to narrow down on the industry's potential. Much of this is backed by private equity and venture capital's belief that manufacturing and supply chain companies are going to be what pushes India to become an export-led economy.

“Themes like import substitution (for EMS), rising domestic consumption (for packaging, building materials) and India’s emergence as an export hub (for chemicals, auto, engineered solutions, aerospace and defense) are providing structural long-term impetus to companies," said Koushik Bhattacharyya, managing director and head of industrials investment banking at Mumbai investment bank Avendus Capital. (EMS is short for electronic manufacturing services.)

So far, Catamaran has two precision manufacturing investments: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker. Both companies are headed for IPOs.

Catamaran has so far made two investments in the manufacturing space, both of which are headed for the public markets: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker looking to raise up to Rs1,000 crore through an offer for sale. Catamaran has also invested in point-of-care medical diagnostics company Achira Labs.

The family office's sees supply chain manufacturing companies as not a good fit with typical venture capital bets given the long gestation period for such businesses. Most generalist VC funds look for exits in a five to six year horizon.

Manufacturing, which is considered a sub-sector of deeptech given the changing nature of the activity and patents around it, take as long as 10-15 years to come of some scale. For private equity to back such startups, on the other hand, they need them to be more mature businesses.

“We're more mid-market private equity when it comes to manufacturing. We thought about how we as a family office can put money into companies that is patient capital," said Padaki.

Sectors of opportunity

Catamaran is focused on a few areas within manufacturing: aerospace, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the electric vehicle space, medical devices and semiconductor companies.

The family office sees defence as “interesting" while on the lookout for companies that have achieved some scale and can be taken global — of which it has seen very few. Even on the aerospace side, apart from Aequs, despite Catamaran's desire to do more in the coming year, the pipeline is looking thin.

There's more action in electric vehicle OEMs, however. “There's a lot of small component manufacturers in places like NCR (Delhi region) and Coimbatore that are promoter-owned who are switching to EVs because we already have a strong base in auto component manufacturing," said Padaki. “We're more interested in EV supply chain components like motors, electronic systems, that kind of thing."

Catamaran is also looking to back battery recycling companies that are looking to claw back the rare earth materials used to make EV batteries.

In the electronics and semiconductor space, there are two burgeoning ends like a dumbbell. On the one end, there are plenty of startups but they're still very early in their journey, and on the other, there's fabrication companies which require very large investments to build out factories. Catamaran is scouting for those in the middle. “We're looking for companies that are in the semiconductor or data center space that are looking for growth capital support," said the Catamaran president.

Cheques from Catamaran would range from ₹50 crore to ₹250 crore and in some exceptional cases, the family office is willing to go up to ₹400-500 crore, especially when companies from outside India are looking to build joint-ventures for strategic partnerships in the country.

Previously, Catamaran had a joint venture with e-commerce behemoth Amazon back in 2014 called Cloudtail. In 2021, Amazon acquired the family office's stake due to stricter rules for e-commerce marketplaces with foreign investments.

The firm has traditionally been selective in how it makes investments and that's not changing going into 2026. "Our run rate is typically two to three investments, for which we have to look at 10-12 companies" said Padaki. “These are long gestation in terms of companies because we have to understand the promoters for some time to build relationships. Even next year, we're looking to do maybe two or three."

Manufacturing maturity in 2026

India saw some large deals by risk capital players in manufacturing this year. VIP Industries raised $206 million in a round led by Multiples. Euler Motors secured $75 million from GIC and British International Investments, while Scimplify raised $40 million in a deal led by Accel and Omnivore Partners. Rangsons Aerospace also raised capital in a round led by ValueQuest.

Many of the manufacturing startups that cropped up between 2018-2020 are also now on the lookout for their growth rounds. “Valuations need to see a shift," said Padaki. “The reason many of these companies don't get high valuations is because people don't understand that these are ROCE businesses and not growth-at-all-costs businesses."

ROCE stands for return on capital employed and is a ratio used to assess a company's profitability and capital efficiency, essentially giving insight into how well it is doing based on the money it is spending.

Aequs and SEDEMAC are both heading for the public markets and Catamaran hopes their debut will set the precedent for IPOs by other manufacturers. “Today, you don't have that many precedents of small promoter-owned companies that have suddenly gone public," Padaki said.

Given how the various themes are playing out across manufacturing and precision manufacturing, both venture capital and private equity players have their ears perked for companies that are growing sustainably. “While some near-term factors like tariff might lead to temporary uncertainty, we see large amounts of private capital entering this sector in the next 3-5 years," said Avendus' Bhattacharyya.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs says one of retail traders' favorite long-shot bets may be overhyped:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Flying cars were supposed to be the wave of the future. A lot of retail traders are betting that's still the case.

Over the years, names like Archer and Joby Aviation have garnered heightened interest from everyday traders wagering on the cutting-edge tech to revolutionize transportation.

While retail has been early to other parties in the stock market, including EV makers like Tesla and space tech companies like AST SpaceMobile, Goldman Sachs thinks they might be overhyping the flying car trade.

EVTOL—short for electric vertical takeoff and landing—stocks have been volatile in 2026, with just one name in the space up year-to-date. Joby stock is up 70%, but its closest competitor Archer is down 22%. EVTOL producers BETA Technologies and Eve Holding are down 16% and 13% respectively.

Goldman flagged high retail investor participation as a big driver of volatility in the stocks.

Both JOBY and ACHR are heavily traded in the retail community, which likely drives further dispersion and volatility. The estimated amount of retail participation in JOBY and ACHR is more than double that of the S&P 500," the analysts wrote.

In a note initiating coverage on several stocks in the sector, Goldman Sachs said it is actually more bearish on Joby than any other EVTOL stock, despite its success this year. It initiated coverage at a "Sell" rating.

"JOBY is the oldest company in the space with the most flight hours and a lead in certification," said analyst Anthony Valentini. "It is focused on being a one-stop shop (OEM, supplier, operator) which means it has the largest market opportunity, but we believe the operator model will have regulatory hurdles and significant capital requirements."

Among four main EVTOL stocks, only BETA Technologies has a "Buy" rating from the bank. Goldman said it is the sector's best-positioned company, citing the recent sell-off as an attractive entry point. Valenti's team also noted that BETA shares will likely benefit from the company's decision to sell both motors and chargers.

The analysts initiated Neutral ratings for both Archer and Eve Holdings, noting that the latter is noticeably behind its competitors. They added that while Archer has moved quickly in less time than its peers, they are still approaching it with caution.

"Its lack of vertical integration means less aftermarket, and we believe lower margins," Valentini said or Archer. "Its partnership with Anduril could prove to be the best defense offering in the industry, but without visibility into funding, it is difficult to underwrite."

Retail traders aren't known for following Wall Street's guidance but in this case, they seem to prefer Archer to Joby, despite the stock's performance. Stocktwits data from throughout 2025 has shown that they view Archer more favorably than the other flying car makers.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs Says This Flying Car Stock Is Its Top Pick. Should You Buy It Here?:
[TEXT]

Goldman Sachs recently made a bold call in the electric vertical takeoff and landing space. The investment firm named BETA Technologies (BETA) as its top pick while taking a cautious stance on competitors.

The financial services giant initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating on BETA, citing the company's strategic approach to certification and its vertically integrated business model. It also assigned “Neutral” ratings to Archer Aviation (ACHR) and Eve Holding (EVEX), while assigning a “Sell” rating to Joby Aviation (JOBY) despite its industry leadership position.

Goldman is bullish on BETA’s stepwise certification strategy and explained, “Its stepwise approach to certification with its CTOL aircraft brings forward revenue and accelerates the learning curve without sacrificing the EVTOL timeline. BETA is an aircraft OEM and parts supplier, the most attractive business model in aviation. It has partnered with GE to build a hybrid vehicle for defense and has taken a team approach to selling motors and chargers to competitors, which will help it scale.”

BETA operates as an aircraft manufacturer and parts supplier, a business model Goldman views as the most attractive in aviation. BETA has also partnered with General Electric (GE) to develop a hybrid vehicle for defense applications and sells motors and chargers to competitors, helping it achieve scale.

Goldman analyst Anthony Valentini noted that recent technology advancements and the current administration's focus on reshoring manufacturing provide better visibility into certification timelines for the sector.

However, the analyst emphasized that competition remains fierce and no single winner will dominate the market. Goldman favors companies with aftermarket-rich models, vertical integration, clear revenue visibility, and the capacity to meet future demand.

Is BETA a Good Stock to Buy Right Now?

Valued at a market cap of almost $6 billion, BETA Technologies' stock went public last month at $34 per share. It raised over $1 billion through an upsized initial public offering that saw strong investor demand.

The stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BETA in early November, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley serving as lead underwriters. The company is now ramping up its autonomous flight technology development through a partnership with Near Earth Autonomy. BETA has logged over 1,000 hours of uncrewed flights on subscale aircraft, demonstrating a range exceeding 158 nautical miles on a single charge.

The collaboration with Near Earth brings expertise in perception systems, guidance technology, and path planning from their work with the U.S. military. Flight testing of the integrated autonomous systems is expected to begin in the first half of 2026.

This autonomous capability will allow BETA aircraft to fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and travel longer distances without a pilot onboard. The development directly supports both defense and commercial customers, including UPS (UPS), Bristow, and military buyers. Current piloted BETA aircraft can carry up to 1,240 pounds or five passengers, but removing the pilot nearly doubles that capacity.

A Focus on Expansion

On the infrastructure front, BETA secured a contract with Abu Dhabi Airports to deploy its certified charging systems across the emirate's emerging air mobility network. The company will install its Charge Cube and Battery Thermal Management System at Al Bateen Executive Airport and Zayed International Airport to support the region's first electric vertical takeoff and landing flights expected in 2026.

This marks another step in BETA's international expansion, adding to its network of over 50 charging sites across the United States and Canada.

Ongoing policy support from Washington has provided additional tailwinds for the advanced air mobility industry. Executive orders directed at the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense signal the accelerated adoption of autonomous electric aircraft, making BETA an attractive stock for those with a high-risk appetite.

Analysts tracking BETA stock forecast revenue to increase from $30 million this year to $2.8 billion in 2029. The company's free cash outflow is projected to exceed $1.4 billion through 2028, indicating BETA will need to raise additional capital.

Analysts are pretty optimistic on BETA stock, with three out of the four covering it giving it a “Strong Buy” rating and the remainder giving it a “Hold.”

[TITLE]DP World to Invest R$1.6 Billion to Expand Santos Terminal by 25%:
[TEXT]
SANTOS, Brazil, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DP World has approved a new R$1.6 billion (US$296 million) investment cycle to further strengthen Brazil’s trade capacity and enhance terminal operations at the Port of Santos, increasing total handling capacity by 25% to 2.1 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) by 2028.

The new investment adds to more than R$3 billion (US$555 million) of capital deployed since DP World launched operations in Brazil in 2013, reinforcing its position as one of the largest private port investors in the country and a key driver of national logistics competitiveness.

These sustained investments have supported strong operational growth. In 2024, the terminal recorded a 14% increase in container throughput, handling more than 1.25 million TEUs – a new annual record. Since 2013, the terminal in Santos has processed over 10 million TEUs and nearly 20 million tons of cellulose – a key raw material widely used in producing paper, packaging, hygiene products, and textiles – solidifying its position as one of Brazil’s most vital logistics hubs. The terminal’s continued expansion positions it to handle larger vessels and rising export demand across Brazilian industries.

Fábio Siccherino, CEO of DP World in Brazil, said: “We are taking another decisive step in consolidating DP World as one of the leading logistics platforms in Brazil. This latest investment cycle reflects our confidence in the country’s economic potential and the strategic importance of Santos. By modernizing our terminal and integrating state-of-the-art equipment, we are increasing our capacity to operate larger vessels, improving productivity, and raising our service standards. The expansion also plays a critical role in preparing Brazil’s supply chains for future trade growth and supporting a more sustainable logistics ecosystem.”

Building on a Multi-Year Expansion Program

The new R$1.6 billion investment builds on a previously announced R$450 million (US$83.3 million) expansion currently underway. That phase includes a 190-meter quay extension that increases berth flexibility and will raise capacity to 1.7 million TEUs by 2026.

In 2023, DP World in Brazil began electrifying its fleet of 22 rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) – which has already resulted in a reduction of over 1,000 metric tons of CO₂ as of June 2025 (compared to the same period in 2024).

With the newly approved investment, total terminal capacity will increase further, from 1.7 million TEUs to 2.1 million TEUs by 2028.

Advanced Infrastructure and Equipment Upgrades

The R$1.6 billion investment will support a comprehensive terminal expansion designed to handle larger vessels, higher cargo volumes, and greater operational efficiency.

Key upgrades include:

Construction of a new berth and expanded yard supported by a new deck on piles

Upgraded access gates and expanded inspection areas

Additional reefer towers to serve rapidly growing agricultural exports

New operational buildings and support infrastructure

Acquisition of four quay cranes, 15 RTGs, and 40 internal transfer vehicles (ITVs), aligned with DP World’s global decarbonization strategy

Collectively, these enhancements will accelerate cargo flow, increase reliability, and deliver improved service for Brazil’s importers and exporters, while enabling more energy-efficient, lower-emission operations.

Sustainability and Decarbonization Progress

DP World has also invested heavily in modernizing its infrastructure and operations – extending quay length, deploying advanced technology, improving efficiency, and reducing carbon emissions. The company employs more than 2,200 people across Brazil, contributing to job creation, regional development, and community advancement.

Its decarbonization efforts, including the electrification of yard equipment and reducing CO2 emissions, align with DP World’s global net zero pathway and Brazil’s national climate commitments.

Strengthening Brazil’s Global Trade Competitiveness

Beyond terminal operations, DP World continues to strengthen its end-to-end logistics network nationwide. Over the past two years, the company has:

Together, these initiatives create a more integrated logistics ecosystem, linking Santos with Brazil’s trade corridors and enhancing nationwide supply chain resilience.

“These investments support the acceleration of Brazil’s foreign trade growth and reinforce our role as a long-term partner in advancing the country’s logistics infrastructure,” added Siccherino.

[TEXT]
Borough Developers has sealed $62 million of takeout construction financing for a newly completed multifamily development in Gowanus, Brooklyn, Commercial Observer has learned.

MF1 Capital provided the loan for the development firm’s 11-story The Baltic Canal apartment building at 526 Baltic Street. The deal retires a previous construction loan from BridgeCity Capital for the 99-unit property in an area along the Gowanus Canal that was rezoned in 2021 to enable denser development.

Landstone Capital Group arranged the takeout construction loan with a team led by Leah Paskus and Shlomy Wertzberger. Michael Squires and Ben Rosenberg represented MF1 in the deal, which closed last week.

The Baltic Canal will feature studio to two-bedroom apartment options with a portion of the units designated as affordable under the state’s expired 421a tax abatement program. Community amenities include a fitness center, a yoga studio, a sauna, a coworking lounge, a media room and a game room.

MF1 Capital and Borough Developers did not immediately return requests for comment.

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.
