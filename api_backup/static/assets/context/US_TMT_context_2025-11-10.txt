[TITLE]Diginex Announces Non-Binding MOU for the Acquisition of Kindred OS and entering the Edge AI Technology market:
[TEXT]
LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diginex Limited (“Diginex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DGNX), a recognized provider of Sustainability RegTech announces the execution of a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) to acquire Kindred OS (“Kindred”), an innovator in Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), a technology that enables AI models to run locally, securely, and independently of the cloud.

While much of the AI industry is racing toward large, cloud-based AI models, Diginex hopes to chart a different path, one centered on privacy, energy efficiency, and regulatory trust. Edge AI empowers organizations to perform complex data analysis within their own infrastructure, without transferring sensitive information externally. This privacy-first architecture is particularly relevant for regulated sectors such as financial services, healthcare, and the public sector, where data sovereignty, transparency, and auditability are critical.

“Compliance and reporting are evolving from static checklists into living and evolving intelligent systems” stated Miles Pelham, Founder and Executive Chairman of Diginex. “Edge AI allows us to place trusted intelligence within an organization’s own secure IT ecosystem, which is perfectly aligned with Diginex’s mission to make compliance transparent, efficient, and responsible.”

By integrating Kindred’s Edge AI framework into its platform, Diginex aims to enable clients to automate compliance and generate AI-driven insights directly within secure environments, minimizing data risk, cost, and latency.

“Edge AI bridges the gap between innovation and regulatory integrity,” stated Lorenzo Romano, Head of M&A and Strategic Development at Diginex. “By combining Diginex’s regulatory expertise with Kindred’s local AI architecture, we aim to set a new benchmark for how AI will enhance both performance and compliance in the years ahead.”

A Strategic Milestone in Diginex’s Growth Journey

The proposed acquisition of Kindred underscores Diginex’s vision to become the global platform for Regulatory Technology powered by responsible AI, helping organizations capture, verify, and act on any data with confidence.

Kindred’s “H1 Edge AI platform” , which is designed for predictive learning, healthcare, and industrial automation, will be integrated into Diginex’s product suite to create an intelligent, privacy-preserving operating layer across Diginex’s compliance and ESG solutions.

Once Kindred’s H1 Edge AI technology is integrated, the Diginex platform will empower organizations to:

Run AI models locally to analyze ESG, risk, and any operational data without exposing sensitive information to external third party platforms or data centers

Unlock real-time compliance intelligence that continuously evolves with changing regulations on data privacy

Advance sustainability goals by reducing dependence on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures.

Why it Matters

This proposed acquisition of Kindred will strengthen Diginex’s innovation capacity and broadens its access to new markets and customer segments. By incorporating Kindred H1 Edge AI technology into its platform, Diginex aims to enhance its ability to scale responsibly and deliver long-term value to clients and shareholders, while strengthening trust and transparency with regulators.

The global Edge AI market size was estimated at USD 20.78 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 66.47 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 21.7% from 2025 to 2030. Accordingly, we believe Diginex is positioning itself to capture future opportunities as regulated industries increasingly demand privacy-first, AI-enabled compliance and ESG solutions.

The transaction contemplated by the MOU reflects Diginex’s continued commitment to advancing responsible innovation and long-term value creation.

[TITLE]Yimutian Inc. Reaches Binding Acquisition Agreement to Acquire Ningbo Xunxi Technology Co., Ltd., Strategically Expanding into the "B2B2C" Business Ecosystem:
[TEXT]
BEIJING, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Yimutian Inc. (Nasdaq: YMT, hereinafter referred to as "Yimutian" or the “Company”), a leading agricultural digital service company in China, announced that it has reached a binding acquisition agreement with Ningbo Xunxi Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Xunxi Technology” or the “Target Company”). It plans to acquire 100% of Xunxi Technology’s equity through a combination of cash and stock, with the transaction consideration to be announced later. Upon the completion of this acquisition, it will help optimize the Company's strategic layout in B2C businesses, enhance its services such as channel development and digital supply chain management, and achieve the construction of an integrated industrial chain ecosystem from “B2B” to “B2B2C”.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. After the closing of the acquisition, it is anticipated to have a significantly positive impact on the Company's revenue and earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the Company’s IPO.

Founded in Ningbo, China, Xunxi Technology is a technology-driven comprehensive e-commerce operation service provider, co-founded by Qunhua Wan, a former senior executive of NetEase, and Lei Chen, a former senior executive of Alibaba and ex-president of Xianyu business. Meanwhile, Lei Chen, co-founder of Xunxi Technology, will join Yimutian Inc. as Vice President and General Manager of Retail Business. With over 20 years of operational experience in the e-commerce industry, Lei Chen joined Alibaba in 2001. He initiated the establishment of Juhuasuan, Taojinbi, and Taobao Live Streaming, and served as the first president of Xianyu. His industry insights and practical experience will provide crucial support for the rapid expansion of Yimutian’s B2C businesses.

As China’s largest digital service enterprise for agricultural product B2B transactions, Yimutian covers the entire industrial chain from agricultural production to bulk circulation, forming a sophisticated agricultural Industry internet service model. Xunxi Technology focuses on technology-driven channel e-commerce operations, providing core services such as corporate bulk purchasing, employee benefits, and marketing procurement for financial institutions as well as various enterprises and public institutions.

Currently, Xunxi Technology has partnered with more than 1,300 brands and built a comprehensive supply chain, offering over 250,000 SKUs of products. It serves nearly 200 channel clients, including Bank of Ningbo, Hangzhou Customs, and Jiangnan University, covering high-value scenarios across multiple sectors such as finance, government services, and education, with a member base exceeding two million. Its strategic cooperation project with the Headquarters of Bank of Ningbo — the “Better Life Mall” tailored for the bank’s members — stands as a benchmark project in 2025. Within the first month of its launch, the mall recorded over 40,000 transactions with a total turnover exceeding US$1.4 million. The core corporate bulk purchasing business of the “Better Life B2B Welfare Mall” is expected to achieve a turnover of more than US$49 million in 2025.

Following the acquisition, Yimutian Inc. will deeply integrate Xunxi Technology’s core capabilities in full-category supply chain management, channel client development, and C-end consumer goods supply.

[TITLE]UK's Starling signs software deal with Canada's Tangerine, plans 100 hires:
[TEXT]
LONDON :Starling Group has signed a 10-year agreement to upgrade core software at Tangerine, a Canadian digital bank owned by Bank of Nova Scotia, as the British-based bank continues its global expansion, Starling said on Tuesday.

The deal is the biggest yet for the British digital bank's Engine by Starling software services subsidiary, and will see Tangerine migrate its digital banking operations to Engine's cloud-based Software-as-a-Service platform.

The partnership follows Engine’s expansion into North America earlier this year, with new offices in Toronto and New York, and marks Engine's first North American client. The unit, separated from Starling Bank in 2022, already provides services to Salt Bank in Romania and AMP Bank GO in Australia.

As part of its latest expansion, Engine will hire more than 100 staff, a spokesperson told Reuters.

Starling, which has grown its customer base to 4.6 million in 2025 from 43,000 in 2017, is one of several British-based digital banks that saw explosive growth in the last decade but have battled to sustain revenue growth from traditional account services amid cut-throat competition.

Starling has focused in recent years on expanding its provision of software services to other banks around the world, diversifying its revenues in the process.

The lender's rapid rise has not come without setbacks, as Britain's financial watchdog last year fined Starling Bank 29 million pounds ($39 million) for lax financial crime controls.

Starling says it has since rectified the issues and invested in its governance.

Tangerine, previously known as ING Direct, was started in 1997 and has more than 2 million clients. It was rebranded after Scotiabank bought the business from Netherlands-based ING Groep in 2012 for C$3.1 billion ($2.2 billion).

Nvidia has established itself as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence chips, selling large quantities of silicon to most of the world's biggest tech companies en route to a $4.5 trillion market cap. One of Nvidia's key clients is Google , which has been loading up on the chipmaker's graphics processing units, or GPUs, to try and keep pace with soaring demand for AI compute power in the cloud. While there's no sign that Google will be slowing its purchases of Nvidia GPUs, the internet giant is increasingly showing that it's not just a buyer of high-powered silicon. It's also a developer. On Thursday, Google announced that its most powerful chip yet, called Ironwood, is being made widely available in the coming weeks. It's the seventh generation of Google's Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU, the company's custom silicon that's been in the works for more than a decade. TPUs are application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which play a crucial role in AI by providing highly specialized and efficient hardware for particular tasks. Google says Ironwood is designed to handle the heaviest AI workloads, from training large models to powering real-time chatbots and AI agents, and is more than four times faster than its predecessor. AI startup Anthropic plans to use up to 1 million of them to run its Claude model. For Google, TPUs offer a competitive edge at a time when all the hyperscalers are rushing to build mammoth data centers, and AI processors can't get manufactured fast enough to meet demand. Other cloud companies are taking a similar approach, but are well behind in their efforts. Amazon Web Services made its first cloud AI chip, Inferentia, available to customers in 2019, followed by Trainium three years later. Microsoft didn't announce its first custom AI chip, Maia, until the end of 2023. "Of the ASIC players, Google's the only one that's really deployed this stuff in huge volumes," said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst covering semiconductors at Bernstein. "For other big players, it takes a long time and a lot of effort and a lot of money. They're the furthest along among the other hyperscalers."

watch now

Originally trained for internal workloads, Google's TPUs have been available to cloud customers since 2018. Of late, Nvidia has shown some level of concern. When OpenAI signed its first cloud contract with Google earlier this year, the announcement spurred Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to initiate further talks with the AI startup and its CEO, Sam Altman, according to reporting by The Wall Street Journal. Unlike Nvidia, Google isn't selling its chips as hardware, but rather providing access to TPUs as a service through its cloud, which has emerged as one of the company's big growth drivers. In its third-quarter earnings report last week, Google parent Alphabet said cloud revenue increased 34% from a year earlier to $15.15 billion, beating analyst estimates. The company ended the quarter with a business backlog of $155 billion. "We are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions," CEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call. "It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year, and I think on a going-forward basis, I think we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that." Google doesn't break out the size of its TPU business within its cloud segment. Analysts at D.A. Davidson estimated in September that a "standalone" business consisting of TPUs and Google's DeepMind AI division could be valued at

[TITLE]Costa Rica ICE Receives 4G/5G Bids - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
Costa Rica Advances Towards 5G Network with Tender Bids

Costa Rica’s state-owned operator, ICE, has announced it received multiple bids in a long-awaited $250 million tender. The tender aims to provide 4G-5G network equipment. ICE received five bids from vendors keen on supplying the network infrastructure, and a further eight bids for backhaul infrastructure equipment.

This development follows Costa Rica’s regulator office’s approval of the process earlier this month, subsequent to a public auction for 5G frequencies held in January. ICE initiated the tender after substantial delays. The goal is to consolidate 4G and 5G acquisition necessities into a single, streamlined process.

The tender experienced holdups due to certain objections; however, it is now progressing. The process combines acquisition requirements for both radio access network (RAN) and backhaul equipment.

Notably, while Huawei showed interest in bidding for some aspects of the project, the government had previously indicated the company might not be able to participate in the upcoming 5G spectrum auction due to security concerns.

During the 5G spectrum auction phase, operators such as Liberty and Claro reportedly participated, signaling a strong interest in the development of next-generation mobile networks in Costa Rica. This tender marks a significant step towards advancing telecommunications infrastructure and bringing faster, more reliable mobile connectivity to the nation. Stay tuned for further updates on Costa Rica’s 5G rollout and the selection of network vendors.
