[TITLE]Haier India readying ₹3,500-crore investment plan as it looks to set up third manufacturing facility in India:
[TEXT]
Consumer durables major Haier Appliance India is readying an investment plan of ₹3,500 crore as it is looking to set up its third manufacturing facility in the country. The company said it is in the process of exploring locations for the new facility and expects to finalise plans by next year. It is also eyeing revenues of ₹14,500 crore in CY2026.

The company on Friday unveiled its Gravity AI Series air conditioners at an event held at its Greater Noida facility.

NS Satish, President, Haier Appliances India told businessline, “We are looking at setting up our third manufacturing facility in India. We are looking at possible locations and it could be in the southern or western region. We expect to finalise the plans by next year and expect to make investments of ₹3,500 crore in phases in the third facility. This will be funded through internal accruals,” he added.

Asked about the overall revenue target for 2026, he added, “We expect to end 2025 with revenues of about ₹11,000 crore – up about 22 per cent over previous year. For CY2026, we have set our sights on revenues of ₹14,500 crore. This growth will be led by air conditioners and LED televisions categories, besides washing machines and refrigerators. We are among the top three brands now and have been able to grow strongly in 2025 despite challenges.”

Capacity expansion

The company also aims to ramp up its air conditioner manufacturing capacity in India. It expects its annual production capacity to rise to 4 million AC units by 2027.

”Air conditioners segment has very low penetration levels of just about 11 per cent and hence is a rapidly growing segment in the country. We are ramping up our manufacturing capacity aggressively. We believe this will enable us to grow our market share to 18 per cent from the current 7 per cent by 2030,” he added.

The company said it has also been strategically investing in its Greater Noida facility to strengthen component development and enhance production agility.

“We believe the Haier Gravity AI Series AC powered by AI-Atmos represents the next frontier in AI-driven home appliances and reinforces our deep commitment to understanding the needs of Indian consumers. With 90 per cent of our products now manufactured locally, we are reinforcing self-reliance, improving efficiency, and ensuring faster availability for households across India,” Satish said. The new Haier Gravity AI Series AC range starts at ₹49,990.

Currently, Haier India operates two manufacturing facilities in Greater Noida and Pune.

[TITLE]Johnvents, Ondo reaffirm investment in agribusiness, manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Johnvents Group has reaffirmed its commitment to deepening partnerships, investing in capacity, and building industries that will accelerate Nigeria’s economic transformation and boost Africa’s global competitiveness.

The resolve came as the Ondo State Government restated its ambition to position the state as a competitive hub for agribusiness, manufacturing, technology, and energy.

According to a statement, the Johnvents Group’s leadership gave the assurance during the company’s 2025 End-of-Year Celebration held at The Dome, Akure, where industry leaders, international partners, traditional rulers, including the Deji of Akure, and senior government officials gathered to review what the firm described as “a transformative year.”

Delivering the welcome address, Group Executive Director of Johnvents, Tarun Chawla, stated that the organisation had strengthened its operations and expanded its global presence. He noted that the company’s growth was made possible by a supportive business environment provided by the Ondo State Government.

He said, “This year reshaped us as a business. We strengthened our operations, expanded our relevance, and demonstrated what a committed team can achieve when purpose and discipline align. The stability and clarity your administration provides form the foundation on which organisations like ours continue to grow and innovate.”

Chawla appreciated the confidence of partners such as British International Investment, the International Finance Corporation, AFRIEXIM Bank, and other financial institutions in the Group’s long-term vision. He said Johnvents had now become “a global value-chain participant with investments and collaborations spanning Africa, the UAE, Asia, and Europe.”

In his keynote address, the Executive Governor of Ondo State, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, described Johnvents Group as a model of how homegrown enterprises can become global powerhouses without losing touch with their host communities.

Aiyedatiwa noted: “Johnvents stands today as a monument to what focused investment and structured institutional support can achieve. With over ten factories, more than 1,500 direct employees, thousands of benefiting households and an ecosystem of over 5,000 farmers, Johnvents is living proof that prosperity becomes inevitable when ingenuity meets institutional support.”

He listed reforms in ease of doing business, digitisation of government processes, security enhancement, infrastructure expansion, and the work of the Ondo State Development and Investment Promotion Agency as critical pillars of the state’s strategy to strengthen private-sector competitiveness.

The governor noted that the success of companies like Johnvents aligns with the administration’s vision of an inclusive, opportunity-driven economy. “The Johnvents story assures every investor here and across the world that Ondo State is ready for investment, ready for expansion and ready for global competitiveness,” he emphasised.

The event also celebrated the resilience of Johnvents’ workforce and the company’s widening contributions to community development, including education, youth empowerment and agribusiness initiatives.

Johnvents added that it is committed to partnering with local and global institutions, scaling capacity, and building industries that deliver value across Nigeria’s agricultural and manufacturing value chains.

The Group operates seven businesses, including Johnvents Cocoa Factory, Johnvents Trading, Johnvents Foods, Johnvents Industries DMCC, Johnvents Farms, Premium Cocoa Product (Ile-Oluji), and Haven Hauling, spanning production, processing, manufacturing, and trade of commodities and food products in Nigeria and other regions.

[TITLE]Coca-Cola in talks with TDR Capital to rescue Costa Coffee deal:
[TEXT]
US soft drinks company Coca-Cola’s proposed sale of Costa Coffee is at risk of collapsing, with the company holding last-ditch talks this weekend with private equity firm TDR Capital in an effort to salvage the deal, the Financial Times reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

TDR was selected as Coca-Cola’s preferred bidder earlier this week, but talks have stumbled over the price, the report said, adding that the deal includes the soft drinks giant retaining a minority stake in the British coffee chain.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. TDR declined to comment. Coca-Cola did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In August, Coca-Cola was said to be working with investment bank Lazard to review options, including a potential sale, of Costa, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Lazard also did not respond to a request for comment.

In 2018, Britain’s Whitbread Pl csold Costa to Coca-Cola for an enterprise value of $5.1 billion.

Transportation Secretary Duffy Launches “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” Campaign, Announces $1B in Funding to Support Initiative

Posted on by Miami Rebel

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy today launched his “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” campaign ahead of a busy holiday travel season. The goal of the campaign is to address a common refrain from the public – it can be challenging to travel as a family. From needing more dedicated spaces for young children and exercise equipment, to finding places for mothers to nurse their children, to staying fit on the go, or struggling to find more healthy food options, the Trump Administration is committed to making every stage of the travel journey more seamless.

To improve families’ experiences in airport terminals, Secretary Duffy announced $1 billion in funding to incentivize more family-friendly resources in airport terminals. This can include:

Creating more children’s play areas or exercise areas Adding mothers’ rooms or nursing pods Reconfiguring security checkpoints to create family screening lanes Building sensory rooms for children with special needs Other creative terminal projects that focus on enhancing the family travel journey As part of the campaign launch, Secretary Duffy was joined by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Paul Saladino, a double board-certified Physician Nutrition Specialist, Isabel Brown, a content creator and young mom, and Luke Saunders, the CEO and Founder of Farmer’s Fridge.

In addition to the federal funding USDOT is providing to enhance physical infrastructure, the group also emphasized the administration’s interest in collaborating with airports and private sector partners to improve access to nutritional food options.

[TITLE]Kennedy Wilson, Affinius Provide $384M Construction Financing Package for Jersey City Multifamily Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
New Jersey developer Panepinto Properties has landed a $384 million financing package to develop the first building in its two-tower multifamily project on the Jersey City waterfront, Commercial Observer can first report.

Kennedy Wilson provided a $306 million senior loan, while Affinius Capital supplied $78 million of preferred equity for the planned 678-unit Harborside 8 project.

“We are proud to play a role in bringing this high-impact multifamily project to fruition in Jersey City, which continues to experience low vacancy levels and consistent rent growth,” Thomas Whitesell, head of Kennedy Wilson’s debt investment group, said in a statement.

The property is scheduled for completion in 2028. Units in Harborside 8 will have views of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline, and amenities will include a rooftop terrace, a pool, a fitness center and coworking spaces.

“Harborside 8 will address the significant demand for premium multifamily housing in one of the region’s most dynamic and fastest-growing markets,” David Greenburg, Affinius Capital’s co-head of credit originations, said in a release. “Panepinto Properties brings proven execution capabilities and extensive New Jersey market knowledge, critical advantages for a development of this scale in Jersey City.”

Panepinto Properties, led by founder and CEO Joseph A. Panepinto Sr., acquired the development site that will be utilized for Penepinto’s Harborside 8 and Harborside 9 projects from Veris Residential — formerly Mack-Cali Realty — for $75 million, Real Estate NJ reported. Veris has been busy divesting properties, also recently selling The James in Park Ridge, according to NJ Biz.

The towers will have a combined 1,267 units. Harborside 8 will reach 65 stories and comprise 678 rental units, 8,578 square feet of retail space, a 350-space parking garage and a 40,000-square-foot public park along the Hudson River, according to Real Estate NJ.

JLL’s Tom Didio negotiated the financing.

[TITLE]Kawa Capital Provides $79M Construction Loan for Boston-Area Life Sciences Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, a Boston-area developer specializing in transportation projects, has secured $79.3 million to build The Bolt, a 180,000-square-foot life sciences lab, office and manufacturing complex in Woburn, Mass., a suburb 10 miles outside Boston.

Kawa Capital Management provided the construction financing for a project that is expected to require a total of $125 million of investment capital. Aries Capital served as the capital markets advisor on the transaction.

Jeremy Lash, director at Kawa Capital Management, described The Bolt in a statement as a “high-quality asset” in a popular market near Boston.

“We are confident The Bolt will draw interest from energy, manufacturing, life sciences and technology companies looking for prime space in an optimal location,” he said.

Located at 216 New Boston Street in Woburn — which has become a minor hub for life sciences development in recent years — The Bolt is part of a larger $400 million investment project by Cabot, Cabot & Forbes.

These other projects include the development of Emblem 120, a 289-unit luxury multifamily complex with ground-floor retail, and Zero New Boston, a planned building that would bring 250 apartments and 1,200 square feet of retail to Woburn.

In a statement, Daniel Nagler, chief investment officer at Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, called Woburn “an ideal location,” noting that the suburb is accessible from both Boston and Cambridge via two highways and a commuter rail station, positioning it as a regional destination for life sciences and other CRE development.

“We believe it will continue to attract innovative companies, and it is why we are so bullish on the location,” Nagler added.

The Bolt is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2027.

[TITLE]With new tech and science roadmap, New Mexico looks to turn research strength into economic growth:
[TEXT]

Nora Meyers Sackett says New Mexico’s small, intertwined tech ecosystem can sometimes suffer from siloing itself.

But she hopes a newly released roadmap highlighting the state’s advancements from national labs and universities will help “clarify the path forward.”

“We’re going to work every single day to ensure that we are going down that path hand-in-hand with the ecosystem,” said Meyers Sackett, director of the state’s Technology and Innovation Office. “We can’t do it alone. It has to be done together.”

The Science and Technology Roadmap, released this month, identifies sectors where New Mexico has a competitive edge and charts how the state can capitalize on them. More specifically, the strategic plan aims to turn the state’s research strengths into long-term economic growth and high-paying jobs.

The roadmap’s creation follows the establishment of the Technology and Innovation Office earlier this year, spun out of the former Office of Strategy, Science and Technology. The team leads and executes programs encouraging the startup, growth and relocation of companies in the tech and science sectors.

The 158-page roadmap, put together by Ohio-based TEConomy Partners, outlines three powerhouse opportunities — quantum technologies, advanced energy, and aerospace and defense systems — and two emerging areas in biosciences and technologies linked to agriculture and water.

New Mexico has already made momentum on some of those fronts.

Qunnect, for instance, announced last month that it is building the state’s first quantum network, aiming to give companies and researchers working on quantum computers and sensors their own network on which to operate. Pacific Fusion in September said it will build its first research and manufacturing campus in Mesa del Sol, a $1 billion investment. And hypersonic missile manufacturer Castelion Corp. in November said it will bring a 1,000-acre campus to Sandoval County, creating up to 300 high-paying jobs.

Startups like YEEO, which creates sustainable solutions for global pest management, and Reprotox Biotech, a developer of models assessing the safety of drugs and chemicals, have already caught the state’s attention. The state recently awarded both companies, along with 17 other startups, $50,000 each in grants.

In order to transfer these opportunities into economic growth, the roadmap also highlights three investment actions. This includes establishing targeted industry centers, much like Roadrunner Venture Studios’ creation of its $25 million quantum hub in Albuquerque.

Ad

Additionally, the roadmap suggests that New Mexico should strengthen its innovation ecosystem by moving research from the labs into the commercial market, as well as expanding access to risk capital to increase nondilutive support for early stage startups.

“This is an opportunity where there is significant research that really has overlapping areas of interest, but the commercial market is maybe not quite there yet,” said TEConomy Managing Director Deborah Cummings. “But we know that these are global-leading challenges that continue to be positioned where there will be a market.”

The office launched a request for proposals in 2024 to complete analyses answering the question: “Which science and technology sectors is New Mexico most competitive in?”

After a competitive process, Meyers Sackett said the office chose TEConomy to complete the report. A “big name in science in tech,” she said the company’s previous experience with national labs helped tip the scales its way.

“That familiarity was one of many aspects
