CBS News Cuts ‘Evening News,’ ‘Mornings’ Streaming Shows in Newsroom-Wide Layoffs

The Wrap ^ | October 29, 2025 | Corbin Bolies

Posted on by Red Badger

The downsizing comes as the David Ellison-Bari Weiss era of CBS News kicks into high gear

CBS News eliminated multiple streaming programs on Wednesday as part of newsroom-wide layoffs, just one part of Paramount’s sweeping job cuts and a blow to the news organization’s headcount as Bari Weiss’ already turbulent tenure as editor in chief gets into full swing.

It was not immediately clear how many people were affected, though some reports pegged the figure at nearly 100 jobs. The cuts affected CBS News’ streaming companion shows to “CBS Mornings” and “CBS Evening News,” both of which were canceled, according to a source familiar with the matter. Its Johannesburg bureau is also closing, and CBS News has disbanded its race and culture unit (though the unit’s head, Alvin Patrick, remains on staff).

Its Saturday morning show is also getting a format change, according to the source, and it’s unclear whether it will retain its “CBS Saturday Morning” moniker as it’s absorbed into the weekday broadcast. Its hosts, Michelle Miller and Dana Jacobson, were both laid off, as was the show’s executive producer, Brian Applegate.

It was unclear whether Weiss’ other journalistic operation, the anti-woke news and opinion site the Free Press, was affected by the layoffs. Paramount acquired the site earlier this month for roughly $150 million, and Weiss remains its top editor.

A Free Press spokesperson did not respond to an immediate request for comment, though the division — as does CBS News — still has jobs posted.

A spokesperson for CBS News did not have a comment. Weiss told staffers during an editorial call on Wednesday that it was an “enormously difficult day” for the network, according to Semafor.

Paramount is laying off 1,000 employees across the company on Wednesday following its merger with David Ellison’s Skydance. The cuts are the first round of job losses at CBS News since Ellison took hold of Paramount in August, while the parent company is expected to eventually cut another 1,000 employees, including some in international divisions.

While layoffs are common after a merger, they come as Paramount Skydance builds a media empire by investing billions into sports, films and acquisitions, and attempting to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that would impact another news organization: CNN.

The layoffs are spread throughout Paramount’s workforce, Ellison told staffers in a memo on Wednesday, framing them as necessary for the company’s future growth.

“In some areas, we are addressing redundancies that have emerged across the organization,” Ellison wrote. “In others, we are phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth. Ultimately, these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success.”

The reduction in staff comes as Weiss has tried to make her mark on the century-old news organization. She’s reportedly trying to lure big names in TV news, including Fox News’ Bret Baier and CNN’s Anderson Cooper, and has used her contacts to help CBS News land interviews with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice. She has also brought on former New York Times colleague Adam Rubenstein as a deputy editor for both CBS News and the Free Press, and Breaker Media reported that Weiss hired former Wall Street Journal editor Charles Forelle as a deputy.

But she’s also rankled some staffers over her demands and suggestions. Weiss initially asked staffers to submit a memo detailing how they spent their workdays, prompting the Writers Guild of America East, the union representing many CBS News staffers, to ask its members to hold off until they received further guidance on the demand. The union eventually told staffers the memos, or lack thereof, would not be used as a basis for discipline or termination.

“Today, we once again see the toll on media workers and the news industry caused by unfettered corporate consolidation,“ the WGA said in a statement. “The WGAE and WGAW are working with impacted members to ensure our collective bargaining agreements are enforced and labor law is followed in these layoffs at Paramount Skydance.”

Meanwhile, Weiss’ Free Press staffers, including assistant editor Josh Code and Weiss’ sister, Suzy Weiss, have also made appearances on CBS. And Weiss discussed booking “The Da Vinci Code” author Dan Brown to discuss the recent robbery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, according to Breaker Media, puzzling some staffers.

Some high-ranking CBS News staffers already said they plan to leave. The news organization’s head of standards, Claudia Milne, said earlier this month she would leave the network, and “CBS Evening News” co-anchor John Dickerson said on Monday he would end his 16-year tenure in December.

[TITLE]Trump-Xi meeting: What’s at stake and who has the upper hand?:
[TEXT]
From tariffs to TikTok, rare-earth metals to fentanyl, a packed agenda awaits the leaders of the US and China, the world’s two largest economies.

United States President Donald Trump expects “a lot of problems” will be solved between Washington and Beijing when he meets China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea for a high-stakes meeting on Thursday, amid growing trade tensions between the two.

Relations between the two world powers have been strained in recent years, with Washington and Beijing imposing tit-for-tat trade tariffs topping 100 percent against each other this year, the US restricting its exports of semiconductors vital for artificial intelligence (AI) development and Beijing restricting exports of critical rare-earth metals which are vital for the defence industry and also the development of AI, among other issues.

Officials from Washington and Beijing have been locked in trade talks since August to de-escalate trade tensions, and they also came up with a framework for a trade deal during meetings in Malaysia over the weekend.

On the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Wednesday, Trump said an expected trade deal between China and the US would be good for both countries and “something very exciting for everybody”.

But only a meeting between Trump and Xi can confirm if a trade deal is really in the making.

Expectations for the agreement are modest, with analysts expecting the two world powers to continue to clash over their myriad differences long-term.

When are the two leaders meeting?

Trump is scheduled to meet Xi on Thursday in the port city of Busan in southeastern South Korea. The meeting is expected to start at 11am local time (01:00 GMT).

It will be the first time the leaders have met in person since Trump returned to the White House in January.

The US president last met Xi in 2019, during Trump’s first term, on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Osaka, Japan.

“I think we’re going to have a great meeting with President Xi of China, and a lot of problems are going to be solved,” Trump told journalists on Wednesday on Air Force One while en route to South Korea.

On Wednesday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the meeting between Xi and Trump in a statement and said the leaders “will exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest”.

What will Trump and Xi talk about?

Discussions are likely to cover:

Trade tariffs

Trafficking of fentanyl, a drug responsible for tens of thousands of deaths in the US each year

China’s export controls on critical rare-earth metals and its purchase of US soya beans

US export controls on semiconductors

Geopolitical and security issues, particularly Russia’s war in Ukraine and Washington’s position on Taiwan

Port fees on Chinese ships docking in US ports

Finalising a deal to buy TikTok, the social media platform, from its Chinese owners

Alejandro Reyes, adjunct professor at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera that at this meeting, both sides will want to steady an uneasy rivalry – but for different reasons.

“For Washington, the goal is to show that its tough line on China has delivered results. The Trump team is walking into this summit after signing trade pacts with Malaysia, Cambodia and Japan that link market access directly to national security cooperation. These deals require America’s partners to align with US export controls and supply-chain rules – essentially making ‘economic security’ a shared obligation,” he said.

“For Beijing, the priority is to project calm and endurance. The meeting comes just after the fourth plenum, which reaffirmed Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s authority and set the direction for the next five-year plan. China’s message is that it has weathered Western pressure and is back to focusing on growth and domestic stability,” he added.

But discussions on disputes over trade tariffs, critical rare-earth metals, AI technology and geopolitical strategies, the issues that most define the current relationship between the US and China, according to Reyes, are not going to be easy to resolve.

“The mistrust is structural now – it’s built into how both countries think

[TITLE]GlobalFoundries Plans Billion-Euro Investment to Expand Chip Manufacturing in Germany:
[TEXT]
GlobalFoundries (GF) today announced plans to invest €1.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities at its Dresden, Germany site. The investment will enable a production capacity increase to more than one million wafers per year by the end of 2028, making it the largest site of its kind in Europe.The expansion, known as project SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act, with EU approval for the full program expected later this year. This investment underscores Saxony's role as a critical hub for semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and reinforces Europe's strategic goal of supply chain resilience.As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements.Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as part of his visit to GF Dresden on 28 October, welcomed the planned investments in Germany: "The SPRINT project is a commitment to Germany as an industrial and innovation location - and above all to the sovereignty of our country and Europe. The investment in chip manufacturing in Dresden sends a signal that Germany wants to play an active role in shaping the development of the global semiconductor market. Germany already plays a leading role in microelectronics in Europe. With its national microelectronics strategy, the federal government is setting the course for further expanding this strength."Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer adds: "The further expansion of semiconductor manufacturing here at GlobalFoundries is a clear commitment to a unique location. The billion-euro investment is more good news for Silicon Saxony, Europe's most important microelectronics location, and demonstrates the attractiveness and dynamism of the cluster that has grown here. This will not only strengthen the Saxon economy—Germany and Europe will also benefit. After all, more chips manufactured here also means more German and European sovereignty and technological independence in this key industry. Germany's economic vulnerability due to excessive dependencies is currently being demonstrated by the example of chip manufacturer Nexperia."The new manufacturing capacity will focus on GF's highly differentiated technologies - with critical performance features including low power, embedded secure memory, and wireless connectivity - all essential for meeting Europe's chip demand for automotive, internet of things (IoT), defense and critical infrastructure applications. These sectors are being rapidly transformed by the rise of physical AI technologies for which GF's semiconductors are essential. The investment will also support continued innovation in next-generation compute architectures and quantum technologies as they scale into the next decade."Recent disruptions in the automotive sector underscore just how vulnerable global chip supply chains truly are. Our planned expansion in Dresden is yet another step in GF's strategy to address these challenges head-on and deliver on our commitment to support Europe's need for secure supply chains and differentiated technologies," said Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "By scaling our manufacturing footprint in Europe, in the U.S. and around the world, GF is reinforcing its role as a resilient and trusted partner to customers in critical industries and building a foundation for the next wave of innovation as physical AI becomes reality."Dr. Manfred Horstmann, senior vice president and general manager European fabs at GlobalFoundries, adds: "With this planned investment, we are deepening our commitment to Germany and Europe. Expanding cleanroom capacity is not just

[TITLE]In a world of crypto and ‘exotic instruments’, traditional exchanges are thinking about how they ‘stay relevant’:
[TEXT]
Good morning, Asia editor Nick Gordon, filling in for Allie Garfinkle.

Fortune just wrapped up its Global Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The agenda featured several financial sector luminaries: Barclays CEO C. S. Venkatakrishnan, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, DBS CEO Tan Su Shan and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio.

I had to enjoy the Forum remotely this year due to another mega-event (the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea). But I made sure to tune in to Monday’s mainstage session with Eng. Khalid Abdullah Al Hussan, CEO of the Saudi Tadawul Group; Bonnie Chan, CEO of HKEX; and Bob McCooey, vice chair of Nasdaq.

After a couple of down years, blockbuster IPOs have come back this year. The U.S. was home to two of the year’s biggest listings: CoreWeave on the Nasdaq and Figma on the NYSE, which raised $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. Hong Kong’s listings are dwarfing those in the U.S.: battery maker CATL’s secondary listing in the Chinese city is still the year’s largest IPO, raising $5.5 billion back in May.

The global competition for IPOs can seem cutthroat at times, as exchanges pitch friendly regulations, investor knowledge, and deeper pools of capital to win listings from their competitors.

But Nasdaq’s McCooey on Monday claimed that he spent a lot of time suggesting that executives look at home first, before looking abroad.

“I believe that most companies belong in their local markets. I firmly do,” he said. “I don’t go to Hong Kong, China, Tokyo, Singapore, Argentina, and try to convince companies not to list in their local markets, because most companies do belong there.” (Lest one think McCooey was being too charitable, he also said Nasdaq has “the strongest value proposition” for those companies that do decide to list overseas.)

Exchanges aren’t just competing against each other anymore. “The pace of change–on the alternative platforms, on the sophistication of investors–it’s unheard of,” Al Hussan, from Tadawul, said. “I have been in this business for the last 18, 19 years. You wake up every morning, there’s a new channel, there’s a new way of doing things, there’s a new requirement.”

Chan, from HKEX, agreed, noting that budding investors have a lot more options, like cryptocurrency, commodities and other “exotic instruments.”

“We’re entering into a stage where exchanges are not really competing with one another,” she said. “We’re working together with one another to make sure that we all stay relevant.”

Still, Chan can certainly feel secure

[TITLE]Cable Billionaire John Malone To Step Down As Chair Of Liberty Empire:
[TEXT]
John Malone, the billionaire cable-TV mogul, is stepping aside as chairman of two major companies in his media and telecommunications empire, part of the continued winding down of his role as a master architect of some of the most significant media and cable deals of the last half-century.

Malone, 84, will cede his position as chair of Liberty Global effective Jan. 1 and will be succeeded by the company’s Chief Executive Officer Mike Fries, according to a statement on Wednesday. Malone is also turning over the chairmanship of Liberty Media to Robert Bennett, who was a previous CEO of the company.

“Serving as Chairman of Liberty Global over the past 20 years has been a tremendous journey,” Malone said in the statement. “From our early investments to the creation of Liberty Global and the many chapters that followed, the return to long-term shareholders has been outstanding — and getting there has been, like the industry itself, never dull and a lot of fun.”

Malone will stay on as chairman emeritus of both companies. He will continue to manage his personal venture capital portfolio and retain his stake in the Atlanta Braves baseball team. He is also still chairman of GCI Liberty Inc., an Alaskan phone company.

Nicknamed the “Cable Cowboy,” and the ringleader of the “cable Cosa Nostra,” Malone rescued Tele-Communications Inc. from near bankruptcy in the 1970s and transformed it into a dominant force in the early days of cable and broadband. By 1993, TCI had cornered

[TITLE]Vodafone Idea AGR relief applies only to the troubled telco: SC written order:
[TEXT]
The Supreme Court’s 27 October order permitting the Centre to address Vodafone Idea Ltd’s grievances and reassess its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues applies solely to the beleaguered telecom operator, clarifies the top court's written order.

The written order, seen by Mint, makes it clear that the court’s observations apply only to the additional AGR demand raised by the department of telecommunications (DoT) for the period up to 2016-17, given the peculiar circumstances in which the Union government now owns 49% of the telco, which serves nearly 200 million consumers.

“We clarify that this is a matter falling within the policy domain of the Union of India and if, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the Union of India, keeping in view the larger public interest, desires to reconsider the issue, there is no reason to restrain or prevent it from doing so,” the bench of Chief Justice B.R. Gavai and justice K. Vinod Chandran noted in the written order.

“It is further to be noted that the prayer in the petition itself restricts its claim only to the additional AGR demand raised by the respondent for the period up to the Financial Year 2016-17. We further clarify that this order is passed only with regard to Vodafone Idea Ltd, taking into consideration the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case,” it added, dealing a blow to rival operators such as Bharti Airtel Ltd.

Setback for rivals The clarification may limit the chances of other telecom companies from citing the order as a precedent to seek similar relief or government intervention in their own AGR disputes.

Earlier, a government official had told Mint that the fine print of the order "will guide us on the direction we need to take on any possible relief,” for Vodafone Idea alone, or for other telcos as well.

A second official said Vodafone Idea would need to inform the government of the relief it expects once the order is in, adding that the extent of relief would be decided after studying the order and internal discussions.

Analysts at brokerage Emkay Global said the Centre will now have sufficient room to devise a plan for Vodafone Idea’s long-term sustainability.

“We note that leverage for Vodafone Idea remains higher even without AGR dues, and the government will need to consider plans toward reducing the spectrum debt as well,” Emkay Global said in a 27 October note. The brokerage house said it sees a low chance of the government reversing the current outstanding ₹37,100 crore AGR dues of Bharti Airtel.

The Vodafone Idea case The court on Monday disposed of Vodafone Idea’s plea after solicitor general Tushar Mehta handed over a proposal to the bench, noting that the Centre already holds a 49% stake in the company and may consider additional measures to support it.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Vodafone Idea, expressed satisfaction with the government’s assurance, leading to the closure of this petition by Vodafone Idea in the long-running legal dispute over AGR dues.

In its petition filed on 8 September, the telco had challenged the DoT’s fresh demand of ₹9,450 crore for the years up to 2018-19, including ₹2,774 crore raised against Vodafone Idea (post-merger) and ₹6,675 crore against the erstwhile Vodafone Group entities.

“In this sum of approx ₹9,450 crores, the majority amount of approx ₹5,606 crores (as on 31.03.2025) is for the period up to 2016-17, which has already been crystalized by this Hon'ble Court,” it said in its petition.

In an amended petition, the telco also sought a waiver of penalties and interest on AGR dues, arguing that the disputed components of the dues have yet to be finalized.

The company argued that the Supreme Court’s 2020 judgment had already finalized AGR dues till 2016-17 based on the DoT’s calculations, and that no re-assessment or self-assessment was permitted. However, it said the additional demands were raised with penalties and interest up to 2019 and updated until March 2025, with interest calculated at 8% per annum.

Vodafone Idea, which owes around ₹83,400 crore in AGR dues and has total government liabilities estimated at nearly ₹2 trillion, had earlier warned that the burden threatens its survival and the livelihoods of thousands of employees. It employs over 18,000 people and serves about 198 million subscribers.

Its former chief executive, Akshaya Moondra, said in August that early resolution of the AGR dispute was crucial for the company to secure bank funding and restore cash flows.

[TITLE]Nvidia lights a fire under AI-RAN partner Nokia with $1bn investment:
[TEXT]
Nvidia is buying a 2.9% equity stake in Nokia for $1bn as part of a broader strategic partnership agreement that will see the European network infrastructure vendor add Nvidia’s AI-RAN technology to its mobile network portfolio, “enabling communication service providers to launch AI-native 5G-Advanced and 6G networks on Nvidia platforms,” the partners noted in this announcement.

That the companies are advancing their technology collaboration will come as no surprise to anyone: That Nvidia is becoming a minor but significant shareholder in Nokia is more surprising (more on that later).

First, the tech angle.

The partners aim to enable network operators “to launch AI-native 5G-Advanced and 6G networks on Nvidia platforms”, including the Nvidia Aerial RAN Computer Pro (Arc-Pro), which the AI technology giant describes as “a 6G-ready telecommunications computing platform… that combines connectivity, computing and sensing capabilities, enabling telcos to move from 5G-Advanced to 6G through software upgrades.” It is an evolution of the AI-RAN open compute platform that Nvidia unveiled just more than a year ago – see Nvidia throws an AI-RAN curveball.

Dell Technologies is the named server partner for this particular development. An Arc-Pro reference design is already available for “manufacturers and network equipment providers to build commercial-off-the-shelf-based or proprietary AI-RAN products, supporting both new buildouts and expansions to existing base stations.”

Nokia, meanwhile, will “accelerate the availability of its 5G and 6G RAN software on the Nvidia CUDA platform,” which is the tech vendor’s AI workload operating system software stack, “and expand its RAN portfolio by embedding Nvidia ARC-Pro at the heart of the new AI-RAN solution. This partnership will enable Nokia’s mobile network customers to transition seamlessly from today’s RAN networks to future AI-RAN networks,” due to the flexibility of Nokia’s anyRAN architecture that enables the introduction of new baseband cards with existing systems, the partners noted.

The partners’ announcement lays out the details of the technology and radio access network (RAN) collaboration as well as repeating the AI-RAN Alliance members’ stock lines

[TITLE]Govt awaits Supreme Court written order before deciding on Vodafone Idea relief:
[TEXT]
The government is waiting for the Supreme Court’s written order before deciding on any relief measures for Vodafone Idea Ltd, two officials said. Based on the order, the government will determine whether the relief will apply solely to Vodafone Idea or extend to the entire telecom sector.

“We are waiting for the Supreme Court order which is yet to be issued. The order fine prints will guide us on the direction we need to take on any possible relief," one of the two officials said.

SC opens policy window

In a relief for Vodafone Idea, the Supreme Court on 27 October allowed a reassessment of the telecom department's demand for adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues from Vodafone Idea. The court also allowed the government to address the grievances of the beleaguered telecom operator without its intervention.

The bench of Chief Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice K. Vinod Chandran observed that a decision on any relief to the telecom operator was a policy matter. The government has a 49% stake in Vodafone Idea.

"We see no impediment in the interest of the Union of India reconsidering the issue and taking appropriate decision in law," the bench observed.

The court is yet to issue its written order.

Vodafone Idea’s petition and dues

Vodafone Idea filed a petition before the Supreme Court last month challenging the Department of Telecom's demand for an additional ₹9,450 crore in AGR dues. The company also sought a waiver on interest and penalties, arguing that the disputed components of the dues had not been finalised.

The Supreme Court’s verdict now paves the way for the struggling telecom operator to receive much-needed financial relief, easing concerns

[TITLE]Nvidia Is Accelerating Its Investing Spree in AI Startups:
[TEXT]
“Clearly for Nvidia, as this stuff gets built out, they want it built out on their technology,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “Once you get entrenched, it’s much more difficult for competitors to come in and take it away.”

The strategy, according to Huang, is to support the broader AI ecosystem. So far, Nvidia has been the largest recipient of the massive surge in spending on AI infrastructure. For that to continue, analysts say, it needs AI adoption to take off in the broader economy, buoyed by a slew of new uses pioneered by startups. “Many of these start-ups are now starting to create even more ways to enjoy our GPUs,” Huang said, referring to the chips central to AI capabilities. By becoming a supporter of AI upstarts, Nvidia is following a standard pattern for corporate venture arms — but doing it at a faster rate with much higher stakes.

This year the chipmaker has backed 59 AI startups as of mid-October, and at least 10 in just the last two months, according to PitchBook data. That’s already more than the 55 investments that Nvidia made in all of 2024, and a significant leap from the 12 it made in 2022. And it has plenty of capital to keep the bets coming: On Wednesday, Nvidia became the world's first company to achieve a $5 trillion market capitalization, surpassing the economies of entire countries.

“I'm delighted that AI startups build on Nvidia,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said during his keynote speech at the GTC conference on Tuesday. “They do so for several reasons. One: Of course, our ecosystem is rich. Our tools work great.”

The chipmaker said last month that it’s planning to invest $100 billion in OpenAI — a deal that would mark the largest startup investment of all time. It’s part of a growing string of bets on private artificial intelligence companies Nvidia has made across the world. At the company’s highly anticipated GTC event in Washington on Tuesday, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang called out a number of private companies that his company's taken stakes in by name, including the AI firm Perplexity, the Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide and the robotics startup Figure AI. He shouted out to several of their executives sitting in the audience.

Nvidia Corp. has gradually become one of the most important players in the venture capital world, without being a VC firm.

Story Continues

Huang has also stressed that he doesn’t believe that the AI industry is in a bubble, as his company piles more resources into the sector. “Nvidia’s just making a bet that this will turn profitable, as many others are,” Rasgon said.

In addition to its big bet on OpenAI, Nvidia has backed a diverse range of AI companies large and small. Those include Reflection AI, which builds autonomous coding agents, Reka AI, which makes models that analyze videos, and Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine that aims to unseat Google.

The investments can be helpful for startups both because of the capital as well as access to Nvidia’s leadership and coveted computing resources. In a meeting with Nvidia executives, Perplexity Chief Executive Officer Aravind Srinivas asked for technical resources to help a product demo run more smoothly, he told Bloomberg last year. Huang instructed someone to grant the request, and Perplexity had what it needed within a half hour, Srinivas said.

“I’ve made requests of this nature of other CEOs, and usually it’s routed through the next director or VP, and then they take another meeting to understand your use case better,” Srinivas said. “With Jensen — boom, boom, it’s done.”

Some of the startups’ cash will go toward buying Nvidia’s advanced chips, which are essential for training cutting-edge AI models. Each chip retails for tens of thousands of dollars, and while companies have different computing needs, most aim to stock up on thousands of processors. Nvidia does not require its funding to go toward buying its products, but they’re often one of a startup’s top expenses.

Reka, for example, secured $110 million in a funding round this year backed by Nvidia. Some of that money will go toward paying for processing power, said CEO Dani Yogatama. The company is also part of Nvidia’s Inception program, which guides AI startups through Nvidia’s platform and promises close cooperation with the chipmaker. Yogatama said that access to Nvidia’s engineers and distribution network was a game-changer as Reka looks to expand its customer base and develop its product.

“A company like Nvidia has a lot of visibility all over the world, and it can help distribute our technology,” Yogatama said. “A small company like ours, we can make the best technology, but if no one uses it, it won’t be helpful.”

Nvidia has found itself in a unique position: dominating the advanced chip market has helped expand the business, and soaring sales have led to a lot of free cash flow. “Nvidia is going to have more cash than it knows what to do with,” Morningstar analyst Brian Colello said.

The company “is also likely not in a position where a lot of its deals will be approved by the FTC,” Colello said, referring to the US Federal Trade Commission. “So I tend to think that smaller deals make more sense for the business at this point.”

Betting on startups could also eventually help the company diversify its customer base, which is disproportionately made up of the biggest tech companies.

Nvidia has five customers that make up nearly 50% of its revenue: the four major hyperscalers — Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. — who fill their data centers with Nvidia’s chips; and Super Micro Computer Inc., which fills its server racks with Nvidia’s chips before they’re placed in data centers. Nvidia can also count OpenAI as one of its biggest customers, although the company is still unprofitable, despite its promises to spend trillions on AI infrastructure.

At the same time, many large companies are working to lessen their reliance on Nvidia’s chips. OpenAI inked a partnership on Oct. 6 with Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and plans to deploy tens of billions of dollars’ worth of its chips. The following week, OpenAI also agreed to buy custom chips from Broadcom Inc. to power the ChatGPT-maker’s artificial intelligence services. Google has also developed its own chips with Broadcom, allowing the Gemini maker to cut costs.

Long term, Nvidia’s bets on AI companies signal an optimism
