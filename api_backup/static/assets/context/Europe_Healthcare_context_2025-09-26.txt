[TITLE]New Sleep.ai Study Demonstrates AI’s Role in Transforming:
[TEXT]
CARLSBAD, Calif., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sleep.ai, the company behind the world’s most validated sleep intelligence platform, presents results of its machine-learning R&D, demonstrating that smartphone-measured sleep stage data may be used to screen for risk of obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. The analyses highlight the potential for Sleep.ai’s scalable models to drive major breakthroughs in population health. The conference abstract results will be published in the supplementary issue of Sleep Medicine, the official journal of the World Sleep Society.

Research

The research, “Machine learning-based prediction of sleep apnea and insomnia using objective sleep data from a contactless smartphone application,” was recently presented at the World Sleep Congress in Singapore. Models were trained on 2.7 million nights of objective sleep data from over 68,000 users collected through Sleep.ai’s PSG-validated smartphone app, which uses sonar signals to stage sleep without the need for wearables or external devices.

Results

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): Sleep.ai’s model, which used objective sleep data collected from the smartphone app and no questions and answers, exhibited an AUC of 0.80, outperforming some commonly used screening approaches.

Sleep.ai’s model, which used objective sleep data collected from the smartphone app and no questions and answers, exhibited an AUC of 0.80, outperforming some commonly used screening approaches. Insomnia: The insomnia model, also using only sleep stage data from the smartphone application, approximated the accuracy of some screening methods with an AUC of 0.73.

Why It Matters

Rates of sleep apnea and insomnia going undiagnosed remain unacceptably high, with nearly 1 billion people globally remaining undiagnosed and untreated due to problems in the entire clinical pipeline, from education and knowledge through to screening, diagnosis, and access to medical and therapeutic services. By adopting smartphone-based screening technologies, Sleep.ai offers a simpler way to enable screening and subsequent treatment.

“Eliminating friction is key to improving population sleep health. These models were deployed on ubiquitous smartphones and may be well-positioned to scale triaging at-risk users for confirmatory testing, potential diagnosis, and timely treatment,” said Elie Gottlieb, PhD, Head of Applied Sleep Science at Sleep.ai.

Market POV

Most consumer health solutions today rely on wearables, focus narrowly on apnea, or remain limited to early-stage validation. Sleep.ai sets a new benchmark with a smartphone-only, dual-disorder screening model, assessed in real-world conditions, with further clinical validation ongoing. By combining scientific rigor with unmatched scalability, Sleep.ai advances its mission to make research-backed sleep intelligence universally accessible. “We know that people around the world are searching

[TITLE]Arecor announces Co-development Agreement with US Insulin Pump Device Company for AT278 & Sale of Royalty Rights and Technology Access Fees for AT220 and AT292:
[TEXT]
This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the retained UK version of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 ("UK MAR").

Arecor Therapeutics plc

(“Arecor” or the “Company”)

Co-development Agreement with US Insulin Pump Device Company for AT278

and

Sale of Royalty and Technology Access Fees for up to $11 million

AT278 (500U/mL) is the only ultra-concentrated and ultra-rapid acting insulin in development designed to enable the next generation of longer-wear and miniaturised automated insulin delivery (AID) systems

Arecor and Sequel Med Tech, LLC to commit up to $1.3 million each to fund development work in preparation for pivotal Phase 2 trial for AT278-Insulin Pump programme

Strategic intent is to progress to a broader co-development and commercialisation partnership for Phase 2 trial and beyond

Non-dilutive funds raised through the monetisation of Arecor’s royalty rights related to AT220 and milestone and technology access fees related to AT292

Cash runway extended to 1H 2027

Cambridge, UK, 25 September 2025: Arecor Therapeutics plc (AIM: AREC), the biopharmaceutical company focused on drug development and delivery in diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases, has signed a co-development agreement with Sequel Med Tech LLC (“Sequel”), a company developing state-of-the-art insulin delivery technologies, to combine AT278 (500U/mL) with Sequel’s twiist™ Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) system powered by Tidepool, and a royalty financing agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) (“Ligand”) which will raise non-dilutive capital of up to $11 million (£8.2 million).

Sarah Howell, CEO of Arecor Therapeutics said:

“The co-development agreement for AT278 and the non-dilutive fund raising via the monetisation agreement are both major strategic achievements for Arecor. The Sequel agreement marks a key milestone, furthering our ambitions to realise AT278’s significant benefits for people living with diabetes as well as building substantial value for our shareholders. The funding realised through the monetisation of specific royalty rights enables us to accelerate AT278’s clinical development and extends our cash runway to 1H 2027 without diluting our shareholders.”

Co-Development Agreement

To preserve long-term value within Arecor, the Company has pursued a strategic co-development partnership with an insulin pump innovator. Sequel’s advanced AID technology aligns with Arecor’s commitment to transformative drug delivery solutions. Its twiist™ AID System’s iiSure™ technology leverages acoustic sensing to precisely measure each insulin dose, delivering superior dosing accuracy and detecting occlusions up to nine times faster than other automated insulin delivery systems. This high level of precision makes it an ideal complement to AT278’s ultra-concentrated, ultra-rapid insulin product.

Under the terms of the agreement, Arecor and Sequel will co-fund all trial-enabling development activities for the AT278-AID System development programme to achieve Phase 2 trial-ready status. Each company will commit up to $1.3 million to accelerate and fund all Phase 2 clinical trial-enabling development work. This will include regulatory interactions and filings with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), clinical trial batch manufacturing and AID System compatibility work. Work will commence immediately and is expected to be completed during 1H 2026, culminating in the filing of an IND (Investigational New Drug). If approved, the programme would be ready to enter a pivotal Phase 2 clinical study during 2H 2026.

Longer term, both companies have confirmed their strategic intent to enter a broader, co-development and commercialisation partnership. This would enable the further development and future commercialisation of AT278 in a next generation AID system, serving a key unmet patient need in a high value market.

Sarah Howell, CEO of Arecor Therapeutics added:

“Sequel has expertise in the development and commercialisation of AID Systems, exemplified by the recent launch of the innovative twiist™ AID System. The pairing of AT278 - the only ultra-concentrated (500U/mL), ultra-rapid insulin in development - with the twiist™ AID system, enables longer wear, even for those people with diabetes (PwD) who require high daily doses of insulin, as well as future miniaturisation opportunities. This combination will unlock powerful benefits for more PwD and provide more choice in how they manage their diabetes.

“We are proud to be bringing devices and therapeutics together in a collaboration which addresses a real unmet need in a high value market, helping people with diabetes better manage their blood glucose whilst significantly lowering the daily burden of disease management.”

Alan Lotvin, CEO of Sequel Med Tech commented:

“We take a comprehensive approach to diabetes management, exploring every opportunity to improve systems that make life easier for people living with diabetes. Our collaboration with Arecor presents a unique opportunity to deliver a truly next-generation solution by integrating our twiist™ AID system - powered by precision iiSure™ technology - with Arecor’s AT278, the only highly concentrated ultra-rapid acting insulin.

iiSure™ technology enables twiist™ to be the first system that directly measures the volume of insulin delivered with each microdose and includes 4 checkpoints along the way to help ensure accurate delivery -something no other AID system can do. This precision is especially critical when working with highly concentrated insulin. Together, this combination has the potential to expand the benefits of AID to all individuals on intensive insulin therapy and provide additional options for PwD, helping them achieve tighter glucose control and improved outcomes.”

Market Opportunity

This partnership, including commercialisation outside the US, presents significant growth potential for Arecor. The Company estimates the total addressable US insulin revenue market opportunity for AT278 is very attractive at c.$2.9 billion with additional upside through commercialisation in Europe and other territories. This is driven by two high unmet-need market segments: 1) People with diabetes who require high daily insulin doses and prefer pumps yet currently lack a suitable pump option and 2) People with diabetes seeking the convenience of an extended-wear device with insulin capacity for 7+ days.

In the Arecor management’s opinion, AT278 has the potential to be the only insulin that can enable and catalyse the next generation of longer wear and miniaturised AID systems, simplifying care, reducing care burden and broadening access to people living with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.

Arecor’s strategic priority has been to pursue high-value R&D opportunities that have the potential to generate significant value for shareholders. Near term, the management anticipates that AT278, the ultra-concentrated, ultra-rapid acting insulin candidate, and the development of a novel oral delivery of peptides platform technology, offer the best opportunities to fulfil this aim. This partnership with Sequel Med Tech is a significant step forward in realising the benefits of AT278 for patients as well building significant value for shareholders.

Monetisation of Royalty and Technology Access Fee Streams

Arecor has sold the global royalty rights related to AT220, an Arestat®-enhanced biosimilar product marketed by a global pharmaceutical company, and all potential milestone and technology access fees related to AT292 (licensed to Inhibrx, now Sanofi’s Efdoralprin alfa) (the “Royalty Financing Agreement”) to Ligand.

Under the terms of the agreement, Ligand will pay Arecor up to $11.0 million (£8.2 million). This includes a $7.0 million upfront cash payment and an additional $4.0 million, which will be payable upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones related to AT220 and AT292, of which $1.0 million is expected to be received during 2026.

As part of the transaction, Ligand will receive warrants over 1,002,739 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company (“Ordinary Shares”) which will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares of the Company. The exercise price for the warrants will be 67.39 pence, being the 30-day volume-weighted average price at the date of the agreement. The warrants are exercisable over 10 years.

Arecor’s strategic priority has been to pursue high-value R&D opportunities that have the potential to generate significant value for shareholders. Near term, the management anticipates that AT278, the ultra-concentrated, ultra-rapid acting insulin candidate, and the development of a novel oral delivery of peptides platform technology, offer the best opportunities to fulfil this aim. The royalty financing agreement provides immediate, non-dilutive capital, allowing the initiation of AT278 Phase 2-enabling activities without delay, and strengthens Arecor’s balance sheet by extending the cash runway to 1H 2027.

Sarah Howell, CEO of Arecor said:

“The royalty financing agreement with Ligand is also an important step forward. This financing extends our cash runway to 1H 2027, strengthening the balance sheet for future potential partnering discussions.”

Todd Davis, CEO of Ligand said:

"We are excited to partner with Arecor on this compelling opportunity to invest in two partnered assets with significant commercial potential. This unique investment exemplifies the types of deals our team aims to pursue, focusing on highly differentiated, de-risked assets that are marketed by strong partners."

[TITLE]Learn!Bio—A time-limited cross-sectional study on biosciences students’ pathway to resilience during and post the Covid-19 pandemic at a UK university from 2020–2023 and insights into future teaching :
[TEXT]
Higher education in biosciences is substantiallyinformed by hands-on field trips and practical laboratory skills-training. With the first Covid-19 national lock-down in England in March 2020, on-campus education at higher education institutions was swiftly moved to alternative provisions, including online only options, a mix of synchronous or asynchronous blended, or hybrid adaptions. Students enrolled on an undergraduate bioscience programme have been faced with unprecedented changes and interruptions to their education. This study aimed to evaluate bioscience students’ ability to adjust to a fast-evolving learning environment and to capture students’ journey building up resilience and graduate attributes. A total of 317 Bioscience undergraduate students in years 1–3 at the biology department at a northwest English university participated in this anonymous, cross-sectional, mixed-method study with open and closed questions evaluating their perception and feedback to remote and blended learning provisions during the Covid-19 pandemic and post pandemic learning capturing academic years 2019/20–2022/23. The Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent restriction of personal social interaction resulted in an significant decrease in the mental wellbeing of undergraduate bioscience students in this study, cumulating in poor or very poor self-rating of wellbeing in spring 2021; while at the same time students showed evidence of advanced adaption to the new learning and social environment by acquisition of additional technical, social and professional graduate-level skills. Post pandemic, bioscience students worry

[TITLE]EUROBIO SCIENTIFIC: RESULTS FOR THE FIRST SEMESTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2025:
[TEXT]
RESULTS FOR THE FIRST SEMESTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2025

Revenue up 10% to €80.7 million Proprietary products account for 36% of revenue 42% of revenue generated outside France

2025 results impacted by the transfer of EndoPredict®/Prolaris® production to France

Free cash flow after investment of €4.4 million

Net debt of €-2.2 million including EB Development current account

Paris, September 24, 2025 - 5:40 p.m. - Eurobio Scientific (FR0013240934, ALERS, eligible for PEA-PME), a leading French group in in vitro medical diagnostics and life sciences, today presents its consolidated results as of June 30, 2025, prepared in accordance with French standards and approved by the company's Board of Directors at its meeting on September 23, 2025.

Eurobio Scientific's results as of June 30, 2025 show growth in activity, an improvement in gross margin linked to the increase in proprietary products, and a decline in EBITDA linked to pressure on distribution margins and transfer costs for EndoPredict®/Prolaris® production from Germany to France in the second quarter of 2025 (approximately €0.8 million).

Growth driven by recent acquisitions and increase in share of proprietary products

Eurobio Scientific posted revenue of €81.2 million in the first half of 2025, compared with €73.5 million in the first half of 2024, representing an increase of €7.7 million (+10.4%). On a comparable basis, i.e. excluding the impact of acquisitions, growth was €4.5 million (+6.1%).

The scope effects are detailed as follows: the inclusion of the EndoPredict® and Prolaris® businesses acquired on August 1, 2024, in the first half of 2025 for €2.7 million, and the acquisition of Quimark, also a distributor of EndoPredict® and Prolaris® in Italy, on March 1, 2025, for €0.5 million.

On a comparable basis, the €4.5 million increase in activity is mainly due to growth in France (+€5.1 million), driven by certain non-recurring factors such as the Chikungunya and Dengue epidemics in overseas territories and the extension for several months of certain tenders in Transplantation, which are maintaining business volumes in this segment for the One Lambda product range. GenDx HLA typing activity remained stable in the first half of 2025 at around €15.6 million. The activities of certain European subsidiaries experienced a slight decline following the discontinuation of the Technoclone distribution ranges in the United Kingdom (-€0.9 million) and T2 Biosystem in Italy (-€1 million).

The share of proprietary products increased from 29% of revenue in the first half of 2024 to 36% in the first half of 2025 due to the inorganic growth policy, but also to the loss of the distribution ranges mentioned above. It amounted to €29.1 million in the first half of 2025 (36% of revenue) compared to €21.2 million (29% of revenue) in the first half of 2024.

Operating income impacted by reorganization costs

The gross margin was 47.4%, up slightly from the first half of 2024 (45.6%) due to the growth in the share of proprietary products in the total revenue mix. Price and margin pressures remain strong for the Distribution business, particularly in the French market.

Research and development expenses were stable compared to 2024. The decrease is due to the implementation of more accurate analytical monitoring of the Transplantation business since the beginning of 2025. Marketing and sales expenses increased by €6.1 million, of which €3.5 million was related to the strengthening of the sales and marketing teams at the group and subsidiary levels and €2.6 million was related to scope effects. General and administrative expenses remained stable but included approximately €0.8 million in expenses related to the closure of the production site and the transfer of the EndoPredict® and Prolaris® product lines to France during the first half of 2025.

As a result, EBITDA reached €13.2 million at June 30, 2025, compared with €13.9 million at June 30, 2024. Operating income amounted to €10.3 million, compared with €11.2 million at June 30, 2024, excluding PPA amortization and PPA inventory write-backs.

Financial income was negative at -€2.1 million, mainly due to the servicing of financial debt to EB Development. Extraordinary income was zero due to changes in accounting standards.

Net income thus amounted to €2.4 million at June 30, 2025, compared with €4 million at June 30, 2024.

Free cash flow of €4.4 million

The Group generated a decline in free cash flow to €4.4 million during the first half of the year, mainly due to a change in working capital requirements, which had a negative impact of €5.7 million, and net investment flows of €1.4 million. The transfer of production of the EndoPredict® and Prolaris® ranges from Germany to France had a significant impact on inventories. In addition, the Group saw an increase in average payment terms in certain countries, such as France, for various public and private customers.

At the end of June 2025, Eurobio Scientific had cash and cash equivalents of €26.7 million, financial debt (excluding leases) of €11.3 million, and a current account from EB Development of €17.6 million, resulting in net debt of €2.2 million.

Outlook

Eurobio Scientific has a policy of not communicating its targets for the current financial year. In the medium term, the Eurobio Scientific Group will continue to pursue the strategic priorities it has developed over several years: the development of proprietary products, internationalization, and the opening of new markets. Over the next four years, the Group aims to increase the share of proprietary products to around 50% of its revenue.

[TITLE]New Sleep.ai Study Demonstrates AI’s Role in Transforming:
[TEXT]
CARLSBAD, Calif., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sleep.ai, the company behind the world’s most validated sleep intelligence platform, presents results of its machine-learning R&D, demonstrating that smartphone-measured sleep stage data may be used to screen for risk of obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. The analyses highlight the potential for Sleep.ai’s scalable models to drive major breakthroughs in population health. The conference abstract results will be published in the supplementary issue of Sleep Medicine, the official journal of the World Sleep Society.

Research

The research, “Machine learning-based prediction of sleep apnea and insomnia using objective sleep data from a contactless smartphone application,” was recently presented at the World Sleep Congress in Singapore. Models were trained on 2.7 million nights of objective sleep data from over 68,000 users collected through Sleep.ai’s PSG-validated smartphone app, which uses sonar signals to stage sleep without the need for wearables or external devices.

Results

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): Sleep.ai’s model, which used objective sleep data collected from the smartphone app and no questions and answers, exhibited an AUC of 0.80, outperforming some commonly used screening approaches.

Sleep.ai’s model, which used objective sleep data collected from the smartphone app and no questions and answers, exhibited an AUC of 0.80, outperforming some commonly used screening approaches. Insomnia: The insomnia model, also using only sleep stage data from the smartphone application, approximated the accuracy of some screening methods with an AUC of 0.73.

Why It Matters

Rates of sleep apnea and insomnia going undiagnosed remain unacceptably high, with nearly 1 billion people globally remaining undiagnosed and untreated due to problems in the entire clinical pipeline, from education and knowledge through to screening, diagnosis, and access to medical and therapeutic services. By adopting smartphone-based screening technologies, Sleep.ai offers a simpler way to enable screening and subsequent treatment.

“Eliminating friction is key to improving population sleep health. These models were deployed on ubiquitous smartphones and may be well-positioned to scale triaging at-risk users for confirmatory testing, potential diagnosis, and timely treatment,” said Elie Gottlieb, PhD, Head of Applied Sleep Science at Sleep.ai.

Market POV

Most consumer health solutions today rely on wearables, focus narrowly on apnea, or remain limited to early-stage validation. Sleep.ai sets a new benchmark with a smartphone-only, dual-disorder screening model, assessed in real-world conditions, with further clinical validation ongoing. By combining scientific rigor with unmatched scalability, Sleep.ai advances its mission to make research-backed sleep intelligence universally accessible. “We know that people around the world are searching
