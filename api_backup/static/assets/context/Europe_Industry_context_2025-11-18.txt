[TITLE]IFC, Siemens, Fullerton may buy 49% stake in clean hydrogen maker Hygenco in $250 million deal:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: The World Bank’s International Finance Corp (IFC), Munich-headquartered Siemens AG, and Singapore’s Fullerton Fund Management may acquire at least 49% in Gurugram-based green hydrogen manufacturer Hygenco Green Energies Pvt. Ltd, two people aware of the development said.

Avendus Capital is managing the primary equity raise for the deal, which has an equity value of around $125 million and an enterprise value of around $250 million. IFC plans to invest $50 million equity in the company, with the remaining $75 million to be invested by Siemens AG and Fullerton Fund Management. The deal documentation is underway, and the transaction is expected to be announced in mid-December, they added.

Hygenco's co-founders Amit Bansal, Anshul Gupta and Ashish Gupta along with their associates, collectively hold a 51% equity share in the company; and the balance 49% is owned by SBICAP Ventures Limited’s SVL-SME Fund, also known as the Neev Fund II. Hygenco plans to invest $2.5 billion over three years to set up green hydrogen projects in the country. The fundraising will help the company, which plans to develop 10 gigawatt (GW) of production and distribution assets by 2030, complete its portfolio.

Green hydrogen is generated by breaking down water in an electrolyser. The hydrogen produced can be combined with nitrogen to make ammonia, avoiding hydrocarbons in the production process. Green ammonia is used to store energy and in fertiliser manufacturing. India aims to produce 5 million tonnes (mt) of green hydrogen by 2030.

Mint reported in June 2024 that IFC and several other companies had evinced interest in the transaction and had signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). These included UAE’s Masdar (Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company), Beijing-headquartered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Australia's Macquarie Group, Japan's Sojitz Corporation, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (MHI) and Marubeni Corporation, private equity firm Actis Llp, and Gentari, a unit of Malaysia’s state-run oil and gas company Petroliam Nasional Bhd or Petronas.

An IFC spokesperson wrote in an emailed response to Mint, “ I’m afraid we would give this a pass, given the speculative nature of the query."

An external spokesperson for Fullerton Fund Management wrote, “As a matter of policy, we don’t comment on market speculation regarding potential transactions. We remain focused on identifying and supporting high-quality businesses that align with our strategic objectives, and we will share updates as appropriate."

An Avendus spokesperson in an emailed response said, “ We cannot comment on stories of this nature as per policy." A Siemens spokesperson declined comment. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of Hygenco Green Energies Pvt. Ltd, and SBI Capital Markets and SBI Ventures Ltd on Thursday evening remained unanswered.

IFC has an $8-billion portfolio in India and plans to double its annual commitments to $10 billion by 2030 from $5.4 billion in FY25. Siemens has a significant presence in the country, with its Indian arm betting on both organic expansion and targeted acquisitions to capture emerging opportunities in electrification, automation, and digitalisation space, managing director and chief executive officer Sunil Mathur said in an earlier interview to Mint.

Attracted by India’s electrification drive, Siemens AG had earlier acquired New Delhi-based C&S Electric Limited for €267 million. Fullerton Fund Management has been present in India since 2007 and recently invested in the transport company Routematic through its Fullerton Carbon Action Fund (FCAF).

This growing investor interest in India’s green hydrogen space comes in the backdrop of state-run Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) announcing the lowest rate of ₹49 per kg in August. A shift to large-scale use of hydrogen fuel could help bolster India’s geopolitical heft and its energy security, particularly in sectors such as fertilisers, refineries, steel, shipping, and road transport.

India’s playbook involves leveraging the country’s landmass and low solar and wind tariffs to produce low-cost green hydrogen and ammonia for export to countries including Japan, South Korea, and Europe. Several state-run majors such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and GAIL Ltd, and private sector firms such as ACME, ReNew Energy, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd and the Adani Group have announced plans to produce green hydrogen.

Experts said green hydrogen costs would fall further. “A robust policy framework is catalysing sectoral momentum. Key initiatives include the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Programme with a combined outlay of over ₹17,000 crore, production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for electrolysers and green hydrogen, and state-level policies offering fiscal and regulatory benefits. Together, these measures are expected to drive down the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) from around $5 per kg today to as low as around $0.8 to $3.3 per kg by 2030 through reductions in renewable energy tariffs, capital costs, and indirect taxes," Avener Capital wrote in a July report.

India’s push to tap clean energy sources such as green hydrogen has generated significant interest among global players. Recently, Mint reported that state-run NTPC Ltd's subsidiary NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) was in talks to supply green hydrogen to state-backed oil refiner and marketer Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and copper and aluminium maker Hindalco Industries. Malaysia's Gentari also plans to invest $1.5 billion for a 30% stake in AM Green Ammonia Holdings, a unit of AM Green, set up by Greenko Group founders Mahesh Kolli and Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty. AM Green Ammonia will produce 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of green ammonia, which is equivalent to about 1 mtpa of green hydrogen.

The government has been putting in place an enabling framework to promote this clean fuel. India’s ₹19,744-crore green hydrogen policy promises cheaper renewable power, fee waivers for inter-state power transmission, land in renewable energy parks, and mega manufacturing zones to help local industries wean themselves off fossil fuels. It aims to reduce fossil fuel imports by ₹1 trillion and prevent 50 MMT of greenhouse gas emissions every year by 2030.

India’s green energy capacity has been glowing steadily and is currently around 197GW. The country plans to add another 50GW annually and touch 500GW by 2030. The goal is to add 1,800 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2047 and 5,000 GW by 2070.

[TITLE]Boeing Strike Ends as Workers Approve New Contract With Major Pay Boost:
[TEXT]
Boeing’s defense operations are set to accelerate once again after unionized workers voted on Thursday to approve a new labor contract, ending a strike that had stretched for more than three months. The work stoppage, which began on August 4, halted key production programs including the F-15 fighter jet and several other high-stakes defense projects. With the new agreement in place, Boeing expects its teams to return to factories as early as Sunday, restoring momentum to a division that represents nearly a third of the company’s revenue.

The contract approval marks a significant shift after workers rejected earlier proposals they said failed to address core concerns. This final deal covers roughly 3,200 employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837, most of whom are based in the St. Louis region. It delivers five years of wage increases totaling 24 percent and raises the up-front bonus to $6,000, an increase from the previously proposed $3,000. Boeing has said the agreement will lift average base pay from $75,000 to $109,000 over the life of the contract, underscoring the scale of the adjustment workers secured.

Union leadership celebrated the vote, calling it a testament to member solidarity and their commitment to protecting long-term economic security. The strike was the group’s first since 1996, and the statement from IAM District 837 emphasized pride in both the stand workers took and their readiness to resume production of Boeing’s advanced military aircraft. The new deal arrives at a moment when defense manufacturing remains vital to Boeing’s overall performance, contributing about 30 percent of the company’s $65.5 billion in revenue during the first nine months of 2025.

Boeing’s management also expressed relief at the contract’s approval. In a statement, the company noted it looks forward to reuniting its full workforce on November 17 and meeting commitments to defense clients. CEO Kelly Ortberg had previously acknowledged that the strike disrupted fighter jet output, particularly for the F-15 and F-18 programs, as well as munitions work. During the stoppage, the company brought in non-union workers to help sustain limited progress, though unionized labor remained central to high-precision manufacturing across defense platforms.

This resolution follows a period of labor tension for Boeing. About a year earlier, more than 32,000 unionized machinists responsible for building commercial aircraft staged a seven-week strike after negotiations with the company failed. That work stoppage underscored the broader pressures Boeing faces as it navigates workforce expectations, production demands, and financial headwinds across its commercial and defense units.

As the defense workers prepare to return, the agreement signals a more stable period ahead for one of Boeing’s most critical divisions. The company will now focus on recovering lost production time, supporting government contracts, and managing the operational and financial impacts of the months-long disruption. For the workers, the new contract represents a significant financial step forward and reinforces their role in shaping the future of Boeing’s defense manufacturing capabilities.

[TITLE]Wells Fargo Reaffirms Underweight on Tesla (TSLA) Amid Sharp Delivery Declines:
[TEXT]
Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is among the most fantastic stocks every investor should pay attention to. With its innovations in electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology, the company remains a leader in this industry. However, demand headwinds and rising competition seem to be weighing on its outlook, as evidenced by the subdued price targets and cautious ratings from many analysts in recent weeks.

Among the analysts who foresee a sharp downside in Tesla shares is Wells Fargo’s Colin Langan, who reaffirmed his Underweight rating and $120 price target on November 10, as reported by TheFly. Langan’s analysis suggests that deliveries are seeing a “widespread weakness” across the U.S., EU, South Korea, and China, the four markets he tracks. The trends are relatively better in the U.S. than in other markets. He emphasized that October deliveries are down roughly 23% year-over-year and 54% month-over-month, with year-to-date volumes lower by

[TITLE]Customers left scrambling as Tesla makes sudden changes to vehicle pricing — here are the details:
[TEXT]
Tesla is shaking up its lineup again, this time with a sudden lease price hike that could make its popular EVs a little harder for drivers to afford.

What's happening?

The shift this time is raising U.S. leasing costs for several of its most popular models by up to $80 per month starting Nov. 4. According to EV, the change applies to the Model 3, Model Y, and Cybertruck, following weeks of fluctuating prices that left customers scrambling to keep up.

The Tesla website confirmed the increase, noting it had been delayed three days from an earlier November 1 date first spotted by Tesla investor Sawyer Merritt on X. The move comes shortly after Tesla temporarily reduced lease rates in late October — a brief window when the Model 3 dropped to $329 per month, its lowest point in months. With the new hike, that same lease could rise to $409 per month.

Tesla's lease-only lineup excludes its newer "Standard" models, leaving only higher-priced variants like the Model 3 Performance and Model Y Long Range available under the updated terms.

Why is this decision important?

Frequent price adjustments from Tesla make it difficult for potential buyers to plan, and higher leasing costs may put electric vehicles further out of reach for many households. Affordable EV access has been a key driver of the transition away from gas-powered cars — one that's already slowed by inflation, high interest rates, and inconsistent incentives.

The company's pricing instability has been a recurring challenge. Earlier this year, Tesla cut sticker prices multiple times to boost sluggish sales in the U.S. and Europe, even as global EV demand cooled. In the U.K., Tesla recently reported its weakest sales month of 2025, with only 511 units sold in October.

Rising lease prices could further complicate efforts to expand electric adoption, especially for families seeking lower-cost alternatives to combustion vehicles. If EV leasing remains expensive, the broader environmental shift toward cleaner transportation could stall — reducing emissions progress in the transportation sector, which remains one of the largest sources of U.S. pollution.

What's being done

The United States and Switzerland announced a framework agreement which significantly reduces US tariffs on Swiss goods from a steep 39% to a balanced 15%, marking a major step in improving trade relations and addressing longstanding barriers.The deal also includes a commitment by Swiss and Liechtenstein companies to invest $200 billion in the US, with $67 billion slated for 2026 alone, aiming to create thousands of American jobs and reduce the US trade deficit with Switzerland.The agreement, announced by US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer and Swiss officials, reflects the successful culmination of constructive negotiations to promote “Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade."ALSO READ: Trump plots major tariff cuts to slash soaring grocery bills for millions of Americans Ambassador Greer highlighted the deal as a continuation of the "America First Trade Policy" that removes tariff and non-tariff barriers, expands market access for U.S. exports, and welcomes sizable Swiss investment into the US economy.Key features of the agreement include:Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said the agreement “puts Switzerland on an equal footing with the European Union.” The framework contains sectoral safeguards (the United States will cap tariffs at 15% for Swiss goods, and some sectors, notably pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, have special treatment or caps under the arrangement), but detailed implementation and any sectoral exemptions will be specified as negotiations proceed.The US trade deficit with Switzerland and Liechtenstein stood at $38.3 billion in 2024, and this agreement is expected to pave the way for levelling that deficit by 2028 by fostering more balanced, reciprocal trade ties.This trade deal ends months of tariff tensions that began when the Trump administration imposed the 39% tariffs in 2025 as part of a broader strategy to address trade imbalances and alleged unfair trade practices by key partners.The agreement is seen as a mutually beneficial framework that strengthens economic ties, secures supply chain resilience, and supports job growth on both sides of the Atlantic through expanded market access and substantial new investments.

[TITLE]Exclusive-A new rare earth crisis is brewing as yttrium shortages spread:
[TEXT]
