[TITLE]Stocks Climb in Anticipation of Fed-Friendly US Economic News:
[TEXT]
The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is up by +0.39%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is up by +0.27%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is up by +0.50%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) are up +0.40%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) are up +0.47%.

Stock indexes are climbing today, recovering some of last Friday’s sharp losses. The outlook for lower interest rates and easier Fed policy is supporting stocks, with the 10-year T-note yield down -3 bp to 4.16%. Also, this week’s US economic news on employment and prices is expected to be Fed-friendly and supportive for stocks.

Dovish comments today from Fed Governor Stephen Miran were supportive for stocks, as he said the Fed's policy stance is unnecessarily restrictive for the economy, citing a benign inflation outlook and warning signs in the labor market.

Today’s economic news was dovish for Fed policy and bullish for stocks. The US Dec Empire manufacturing survey of general business conditions unexpectedly contracted -22.6 points to -3.9, weaker than expectations of 10.0.

Weaker-than-expected Chinese economic news is negative for global growth prospects. China's Nov industrial production unexpectedly eased to +4.8% y/y from +4.9% y/y in Oct, versus expectations of an increase to +5.0% y/y. Also, China's Nov retail sales rose +1.3% y/y, weaker than expectations of +2.9% y/y and the smallest pace of increase in 2.75 years. In addition, China's new home prices fell 0.39% m/m, marking the 30th consecutive month of declines.

This week's market focus will be on US economic news. Later today, the Dec NAHB housing market index is expected to increase by +1 to 39. On Tuesday, Nov nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase by +50,000, and the Nov unemployment rate is expected to be at 4.5%. Meanwhile, Nov average hourly earnings are expected to rise by +0.3% m/m and +3.6% y/y. Also, on Tuesday, Oct retail sales are expected to be up +0.1% m/m, and Oct retail sales ex-autos are expected to be up +0.2% m/m. Finally, on Tuesday, the Dec S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to decline by -0.2 to 52.0. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall -11,000 to 225,000. Also, Nov CPI is expected to be +3.1% y/y, and Nov core CPI is expected to be +3.0% y/y. On Friday, Nov existing home sales are expected to be up +1.2% m/m to 4.15 million. Also, the University of Michigan Dec consumer sentiment index is expected to be revised upward by +0.2 to 53.5 from the previously reported 53.3.

The markets are discounting a 27% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on January 27-28.

Overseas stock markets are mixed today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.71%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.55%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.31%.

Interest Rates

March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) today are up by +7 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down -2.0 bp to 4.165%. T-notes are climbing today after the Dec Empire manufacturing survey of general business conditions unexpectedly contracted, a dovish factor for Fed policy. T-notes also have support from dovish comments by Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who said the Fed's policy stance is unnecessarily restrictive for the economy. Strength in stocks today is limiting the upside in T-note prices.

The steepening yield curve is bearish for T-note prices. Steepening trades occur when bond investors buy short-term government debt and sell long -term debt. The yield curve has steepened since last Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, when the Fed said it would begin purchasing up to $40 billion of short-term T-bills a month, starting today, to boost liquidity in the financial system. Longer-term Treasury securities are also under pressure from concerns

New Delhi: Commercial rollout of satellite internet services may take longer than expected, due to a standoff between the telecom regulator and the department of telecommunications (DoT) over spectrum pricing , industry executives said. The process could potentially take another 3-6 months amid upcoming personnel changes at the DoT and industry interference, they said."The current spectrum pricing proposals, including the disagreements between Trai Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ) and DoT regarding LEO (low earth orbit satellite) spectrum pricing must first be reviewed by a standing committee.The proposal then moves to the digital communications commission (DCC) for approval," Shivaji Chatterjee, CEO and managing director of Hughes Communications India, told ET.After the approval, the matter will go to the union cabinet or the telecom minister, depending on the scope of the issue, he said.Once it receives ministerial approval, the wireless planning and coordination wing (WPC) is tasked with creating specific rules, which will then be put out for public consultation for 30 days."This stage is critical as terrestrial telecom operators may attempt to impede the process during the feedback window," Chatterjee said. Elon Musk's Starlink had on Monday briefly displayed prices of its broadband service in India at ₹8,500 per month, with a ₹32,000 fee for the home equipment, on its website, but later retracted it, citing technical glitches. This prompted industry-wide expectation of an impending launch.So far, Starlink, Eutelsat OneWeb, and Jio Satellite have completed most of the licensing and space-regulatory steps, including obtaining the Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence, and approvals from space-regulatory body In-SPACe. Commercial launch, however, hinges on the spectrum allocation based on pricing rules, and compliance with security and capacity rules. Trai had initially proposed a flat rate of 4% of adjusted gross revenues to be charged for spectrum allocation to ensure a standardised approach, offering to impose an urban-usage disincentive to spur more rural coverage. The DoT, however, proposed to raise charges to 5% of AGR with a 1% discount if they meet specific rural rollout targets.The government's proposal to raise the spectrum charges from the initially recommended rates could be a gesture to pacify the telcos who have been demanding a level-playing field, an industry executive said. The executive, however, noted that the difference in revenues from changing the pricing to 5% from 4% would be financially insignificant for the government. "It was done primarily as a symbolic gesture to show the DoT was addressing telco concerns," the person added.Experts said telcos are not necessarily afraid of the immediate competition in broadband internet with the entry of satellite internet services. "The long-term fear is direct-to-mobile (D2M) technology," one of the executives cited above said. Telcos view low-earth orbit satellites as "potential mobile towers in the sky" that can serve handsets directly, bypassing terrestrial networks.

[TITLE]A call to action to rebuild the UK’s semiconductor industry:
[TEXT]
Thirty years ago, Europe commanded nearly a fifth of the global semiconductor market. Today it holds less than 10%, and the UK’s share has shrunk to barely half a percent. On paper, that looks like failure. In reality, the picture is more complex. Beneath these headline numbers sits a set of capabilities, quiet, highly specialised, and globally relevant. How can the UK build on these?

The first step is recognising that the UK is not trying to win the semiconductor race on every front. It can’t, and it shouldn’t. Instead, the country has embraced a niche strategy, focusing on areas where it can lead the world. Crucially, these are the parts of the value chain that create the most intellectual property and the highest margins. It is a strategy grounded in realism, but also one that demands urgency and coordination.

Chip design has long been one of the UK’s most powerful assets. Arm remains the clearest example: its architectures, renowned for efficiency, sit inside billions of smartphones and increasingly inside data centres, cars, and the growing universe of IoT devices. Arm’s licensing model has allowed thousands of companies to innovate around British-designed cores, effectively making UK ingenuity foundational to global computing. Imagination Technologies stands beside it as another quiet giant. Its GPU IP powers everything from mobile gaming to automotive displays and emerging AI acceleration. These firms built global ecosystems not through manufacturing might but through ideas, and that is a strength the UK can amplify.

Alongside design, the UK’s leadership in compound semiconductors is becoming increasingly significant. These materials, which outperform silicon in high-frequency communications, power electronics and photonics, are essential for technologies such as 5G infrastructure, electric vehicles and radar. In South Wales, the Compound Semiconductor Applications Catapult has turned focused R&D into industrial capability, creating a centre of gravity for companies building next-generation electronics. This is not research for its own sake; it is industrial strategy made tangible.

The government has begun to recognise the strategic importance of this sector. Its £1bn National Semiconductor Strategy may be modest compared to the vast subsidies seen in the US and Asia, but its value lies in focus, not volume. Rather than chasing fabs at any cost, the UK is backing areas where it has a realistic chance of worldwide influence. The additional £500m commitment to quantum technology over the next four years shows similar intent. Quantum computing, sensing and communications will reshape everything from cybersecurity to national defence, and the UK aims to be among the nations defining that future.

Yet strategy alone is not enough. Other countries are already competing fiercely to attract semiconductor investment. Japan secured a major TSMC plant with a mix of subsidies, talent and predictability. Ireland has spent decades cultivating Intel’s European operationthrough a stable regulatory environment and a steady flow of engineers. The UK can learn from these approaches, but it does need to present a value proposition that is just as compelling. It must offer clarity, speed, and a business environment that rewards companies willing to innovate here.

The greatest constraint, both for the UK and globally, is talent. Semiconductor engineering is now one of the most competitive labour markets in the world, and the UK faces the same challenge as every nation: too few people with the specialised skills that chip design, advanced manufacturing and materials science demand. Solving this will require a long-term shift. Universities will need more industry-aligned courses, and colleges must develop more pathways that connect students directly into semiconductor careers. Engineers working in aerospace, automotive, defence and software must be given opportunities to move into semiconductor roles through meaningful retraining programmes. And once the UK has this talent, it must become a place where they want to stay. Competitive salaries matter, but so does the promise of interesting work, modern facilities and a sense that the country is committed to leadership rather than merely participation.

One of the UK’s most underrated advantages is its collaborative culture. Historically, the country has excelled when industry, academia and government work together towards a shared technological goal. The semiconductor sector is no different. The GCAP Electronics Evolution Consortium - bringing Leonardo and partners together to develop next-generation sensing technologies - shows the power of pooled expertise and shared infrastructure. The UK needs examples like this. Universities can provide the fundamental research that fuels breakthroughs; Catapults can accelerate translation; and industry can scale the results into real products. In semiconductors, no single organisation can succeed alone. The winners are ecosystems, not isolated champions.

This matters because semiconductors are now inseparable from national sovereignty. They underpin artificial intelligence, telecommunications, defence systems, energy networks and the entire digital economy. A nation’s strength in semiconductors increasingly defines its economic and strategic independence. The UK already leads in design, intellectual property and compound materials. The task now is weaving these strengths into a coherent industrial base, one capable not only of producing world-class innovation but of attracting and retaining global partners aligned with the UK’s long-term ambitions.

The opportunity is real. With the right focus, the UK could become one of the world’s leading hubs for advanced semiconductor design and next-generation materials. The next decade will determine which countries shape the future of computing and which merely buy it. The UK must decide where it wants to stand.

To succeed, the UK must double down on its niche strengths, accelerate collaboration between academia and industry, strengthen its talent pipeline, and create an environment that gives global innovators a reason to build here. The UK will not outspend the US or out-subsidise the EU, but that should not be the ambition. Instead, it should lead in the parts of the value chain that define the direction of the industry, not just the volume of output.

Quantum shows what this can look like. The UK has firmly established itself as a global leader in the field, ranking third worldwide for the quality and impact of its quantum research, and standing as one of the top two countries for creating and scaling quantum companies. It now hosts the largest number of quantum start-ups in Europe and attracts more investment into the sector than any other European country. This is proof that when the UK aligns world-class science, early commercialisation, and targeted support, it can shape frontier markets rather than chase them.

London: After a stellar 2025, investors expect shares in European banks to keep heading higher in 2026, supported by strong earnings and, crucially, cost savings stemming from artificial intelligence. As fears of a recession and interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank have subsided, investors have turned even more positive towards European banks, revising up their expectations for the sector, despite a complicated backdrop.Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a new force drawing investors to European lenders' shares, partly because a dearth of technology companies in the region has forced many to hunt for AI beneficiaries in old-economy markets. Banks have started to use AI to improve operational efficiency and fraud detection, as well as to reduce staff costs. "European banks could be a real beneficiary of AI," said Helen Jewell, chief investment officer for fundamental equities at BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, with
