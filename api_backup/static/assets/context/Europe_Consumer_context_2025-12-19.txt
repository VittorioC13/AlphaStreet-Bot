[TITLE]Adulteration fears may spur premium dairy boom in urban markets:

“Our prices are premium compared to the broader market, but the idea is that with scale, we can transfer those savings to consumers and bring prices down. There are also some categories where we are experimenting with more aggressive pricing, such as cold-pressed oils and jaggery powder,” Hange said. “Pricing at around ₹120 per 500 grams (for jaggery) is very competitive because we have our own manufacturing units and our own farms. With scale, the intention is clearly to pass on efficiencies to consumers and reduce prices over time.”

Avolta, the Swiss-based global leader in airport duty free shops (Fortune 500 Europe No. 274) best known in the U.S. for its Hudson stores, on Wednesday announced it was awarded the first duty-free contract for an international operator in mainland China in 26 years, giving it the right to open stores in Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport, the 8th largest in the world.

Under the terms of the deal, Avolta, which operates over 5,000 stores in over 1,000 locations worldwide, will set up 43 stores and restaurants across its duty free, duty paid, and food and beverage categories in the Shanghai airport, covering over 85,000 sq ft (8,000 m2). The company did not disclose the size of the deal in financial terms.

The Chinese government, which has yet to comment on the deal, has been courting foreign retail companies in recent years. At a November conference, Vice Commerce Minister Sheng Qiuping invited foreign groups to invest in Chinese retail to “strengthen confidence in long-term growth.” China has long been trying to shepherd its economy from one that is export- and production-based to one that is more consumption-based.

Avolta CEO Xavier Rossinyol, a Catalan-Spanish industry veteran who has led the company since 2021, attributed the win to his company playing the long game in China.

“There was a complete lack of belief in the industry that what is happening […] would ever happen,” Rossinyol said in an interview with Fortune prior to the official announcement. “And we have been the company making that happen.”

For three and a half years, Avolta has built a local team in China and invested in “creating the know-how of the market, etc.,” he said. “From a European or North American point of view, that patience, it didn’t make too much sense. But from the local market point of view, that patience, it was necessary.”

Avolta is the global leader in the travel retail sector, with full year sales in 2024 of CHF 13.7 billion ($17.2 billion), and a leading position in both North America and Europe, but a weaker presence in Asia. It aims to sustain an annual organic growth rate of 5 to 7% in the upcoming years.

The Avolta announcement comes amid a boom in the global travel retail sector but a slowdown in the U.S. Globally, the sector, which operates shops and restaurants in airports, is expected to post sales of approximately $68 billion in 2025, with strong annual growth of between 8 and 10% projected until 2030.

But strong regional differences underlie the global picture. The U.S., historically a strong market for travel retail, has been flat in the past year, according to Rossinyol, whereas Europe— especially the tourism hotspots of Spain, Italy, and Greece—experienced an unexpected surge, despite the European economy being at a near standstill.

The most important growth market, though, for both the industry as a whole and Avolta, Rossinyol said, is Asia-Pacific. The mega region counts for about half of the global market, and within the region, China and its travelers dominate. But until now, Western companies like Avolta have achieved only a limited presence in the region and no direct presence at all inside mainland China’s airports, which had long favored state-owned operators.

“If I look at the next five years, and I look also not only at the organic growth, but also at the capacity to acquire or to get new spaces, probably the biggest change for our portfolio will be Asia-Pacific,” Rossinyol said. “We have a lot of potential to grow there.”

[TITLE]Outdoor Retailer Parent Emerald Holding is Reviewing its Options:
[TEXT]
Just as Outdoor Retailer (OR) is getting into its groove again with a move to Minneapolis as its new stomping ground, it might see another change ahead in 2026.

On Tuesday, OR’s parent Emerald Holding Inc. said it has begun a review of “potential strategic options” for a possible sale of itself following receipt of inquiries from interested buyers. The B2B event organizer said it has hired Goldman Sachs & Co. as its lead financial advisor.

“The inquiries we’ve received from multiple parties underscore the market’s recognition of the value we’ve created and the essential role live events play in driving connection, innovation, and commerce across the industries we serve,” said Emerald’s president and chief executive officer Hervé Sedky. “Our board is taking a thoughtful, proactive approach to evaluating these as part of its responsibility to maximize shareholder value.”

Emerald said there was no guarantee that a transaction would occur following the review of options, and that it didn’t plan to provide any updates until either an agreement is reached or the review is “otherwise completed.”

Emerald said it is reaffirming its full year 2025 guidance of revenues between $460 million to $465 million. Sedky noted that the company’s “disciplines execution and resilient business model continue to reinforce our position as a scaled, insights-driven B2B events platform built for durable, long-term growth.”

In addition to OR, the event organizer also owns and operates other tradeshows that include Overland Expo, Surf Expo, and Sports Licensing & Tailgate Show.

The outdoor retail sector has been undergoing a bit of a reset as consumer preferences shift, and tariffs and trade issues have impacted how retailers operate to stay relevant. That has resulted in some specialty chains such as REI and Orvis deciding to close some stores earlier this year. The shift also has included tradeshow groups trying to figure out how to adapt.

The European Outdoor Group paused its international trade show in 2025, but will return next year from May 17-18 in Riva del Garda in Italy as part of a new initiative called European Outdoor Week.

Meanwhile, OR in October said it was moving to Minneapolis to rebuild its presence in the tradeshow circuit. The move saw OR working with Leadership Village — co-led by athlete and Summit Scholarship founder Sunny Stroeer and industry veteran Paul Gagner — to shape the format of the new show. Other experts in the outdoor sector are also lending a hand through Leadership Village to craft the show’s reinvention.

The OR show is set to host its inaugural Urban Outdoor Experiences on Aug. 20-21, 2026, at its 2026 Minneapolis show from Aug. 19-21. The curated outdoor experiences program includes hiking, trail running, yoga, walking, birding and climbing. OR said the events are minutes away from the Minneapolis Convention Center, and will be hosted in partnership with The Loppet Foundation. The primary location will be at the Theodore Wirth Regional Park, considered the crown jewel of the Minneapolis park system that spans over 740 acres.

OR is focused on the outdoor and winter sports industry. Its main event brings together retailers, manufacturers, designers, distributors, industry advocates and more to connect on the business of outdoor recreation. But while OR was in the midst of moving from Denver back to its former home in Utah, it faced challenges that saw its role in the events space decline. That created room for Switchback to become the go-to for the outdoor sector, and it became a stand-alone event this past June in Nashville at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center. Before becoming a stand-alone event, Switchback was the outdoor-focused section that was part of The Running Event trade show. Plans are already in place for a second standalone event in New Orleans in June 2026.

Representatives for Outdoor Retailer did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

[TITLE]Rad Power Bikes files for bankruptcy and is looking to sell the business:
[TEXT]
Electric bike company Rad Power Bikes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding.

The company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.

“This step allows us to keep operating in the ordinary course of business while we pursue the best possible outcome for the people who rely on Rad every day,” they said in a statement. “Our goal is to keep the company intact and preserve the relationships we have built with riders, vendors, suppliers, and partners.”

Rad Power is the latest in a series of e-bike companies from around the world to go through bankruptcy after pandemic-era excitement for the category wore off. Some of those companies have re-emerged, though, with VanMoof and Cake finding new owners during their respective court-led restructuring processes.

Rad itself had told employees in November that there had been a “very promising” option to keep the company afloat that was “likely to close,” but the deal fell apart. The company has not shared more details

[TITLE]Bulgaria joins the Euro: Changes coming to northern Greece in property, tourism, business, and consumerism:
[TEXT]
Newsroom December 16 10:40

The move is expected to bring significant changes to Northern Greece, affecting real estate markets, tourism, cross-border business activity, and the popular practice of weekend shopping trips. Despite the resignation of Rosen Zhelyazkov’s government last Thursday, January 1, 2026, it remains a historic milestone for Bulgaria and its citizens. In less than 20 days, the neighboring country will adopt the euro at a fixed exchange rate of 1 euro to 1.95583 leva. This development is not expected to be affected by Bulgaria’s prolonged political instability, which has seen seven elections over the past four years.

A year earlier, Bulgaria—along with Romania—joined the Schengen Area amid nationwide celebrations. That move significantly facilitated travel to and from Greece, making the Bulgarian market even more attractive to Greek consumers due to lower fuel prices and cheaper basic goods. It also boosted tourism flows in both directions and triggered a strong wave of Bulgarian investment in Greek real estate, particularly in Central and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.

Key questions

The adoption of the euro—whose banknotes will now also bear the word “Евро” in Cyrillic—signals several positive developments: a strengthening of the Bulgarian economy (still the weakest in the EU), easier access to international capital, lower borrowing costs, compliance with European fiscal rules, and the elimination of currency risk, creating a safer investment environment.

At the same time, it raises crucial questions, especially for Greece. How will bilateral economic and trade relations be affected? Will they strengthen or weaken, and at what cost to each side?

There are also everyday concerns. Will Greeks continue their weekend trips across the border to fill car trunks with cheap goods and fuel tanks with significantly cheaper petrol, draining the Greek market? Will Bulgarian winter resorts such as Bansko remain popular with Greek tourists? And conversely, will Bulgarians continue to invest heavily in homes along the beaches and islands of Northern Greece, creating small “Bulgarian Rivieras” in some areas?

Market outlook

Clear answers are hard to come by. Political instability and weak governance in Bulgaria remain major risks, as they encourage speculation, lax oversight and market distortions. Stability will be crucial—but it is unclear when it will materialize.

Still, markets often operate independently of politics. As long as the adoption of the euro does not lead to sudden price hikes in Bulgaria, major changes to the current situation are not expected. Border cities are likely to remain crowded with Greek shoppers, especially on weekends. Over time, however, price convergence may gradually reduce this flow.

Cheap fuel remains a major draw

Travel to Bulgaria remains inexpensive, largely due to fuel prices. As of December 1, 2025, the price of unleaded petrol (95 octane) stood at €1.21 per liter in Bulgaria, compared with an average of €1.765 per liter in Greece—a difference of €0.55 per liter. Filling a 50-liter tank costs

[TITLE]Uber Freight sees U.S.–Mexico trade driving freight rebound into 2026:
[TEXT]
Nearshoring, Mexico investment and tightening truck capacity could reshape North American freight flows next year.

Uber Freight’s latest market outlook points to a U.S. freight market that is quietly stabilizing and setting up for tighter conditions in 2026, with cross-border trade with Mexico emerging as one of the most important structural drivers.

Uber Freight is a part of San Francisco-based Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER), which operates three platforms: Uber (ride-hailing), Uber Eats (food and goods delivery) and Uber Freight (logistics).

In its “Q4 2025 Market Update & Outlook,” released on Thursday, Uber Freight said resilient consumer spending, nearshoring activity and capacity discipline among carriers are helping stabilize demand after a prolonged freight downturn — even as manufacturing remains under pressure and geopolitical risks persist.

Mexico strengthens position as top U.S. trading partner

Uber Freight highlighted Mexico’s expanding role in North American supply chains, driven by nearshoring and reshoring activity across automotive, industrial machinery and advanced manufacturing.

Mexico increased its share of U.S. imports to 15.5%, up from 14.5% previously, cementing its position as the largest U.S. trading partner, according to the report.

Foreign direct investment into Mexico reached $34.3 billion in the first half of 2025, up 10.2% year over year, with the U.S. remaining the country’s top investor.

Uber Freight said export growth from Mexico has been particularly strong in vehicles, auto parts, industrial machinery, furniture and medical instruments — categories that generate steady truckload and cross-border freight demand.

Despite ongoing U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum and copper, Mexico has largely maintained export volumes, albeit at higher production costs, reinforcing its importance in North American manufacturing supply chains.

Border risks and regulatory headwinds remain

While the long-term outlook for U.S.–Mexico trade remains constructive, Uber Freight flagged several risks that could disrupt cross-border freight flows in 2026.

The report pointed to road blockades across Mexico’s Bajío region, led by labor groups such as the country’s National Union of Workers, that have disrupted more than 8,000 truckloads, causing delays and congestion on key Mexico-U.S. corridors.

Security concerns, including cargo theft, continue to drive shipper investment in advanced tracking, geofencing and in-cab monitoring technologies.

[TITLE]Dollar falls versus yen after smaller-than-expected rise in US inflation, euro eases:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 18 : The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc on Thursday after data showed a lower-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation, while the euro eased after the European Central Bank held interest rates steady.

The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 2.7 per cent year-on-year in November, according to Labor Department data, compared with a 3.1 per cent increase forecast by economists polled by Reuters.

The dollar weakened 0.12 per cent to 155.50 against the Japanese yen and was down 0.14 per cent to 0.79405 against the Swiss franc.

"The margin of error shouldn't be this great and it is questionable whether what we got in this release is going to make its way into the more traditional data collection discussion," said Marvin Loh, senior global market strategist at State Street in Boston.

"One of the things that ends up being a challenge in terms of changing expectations significantly is that we're already pricing in a Fed that gets to neutral within the next 12 months. So you either need to aggressively push against the neutral and/or start believing that there's a recession that will make you go below neutral and I don't think we're anywhere near there," Loh said.

The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history had impacted data collection for the inflation report. The Federal Reserve tracks the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index for its 2 per cent inflation target.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the next Fed chair will be someone who believes in lower interest rates "by a lot".

All of the known candidates - White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and current Fed Governor Chris Waller - advocate for interest rates to be lower than they are now.

CENTRAL BANK MOVES

The euro edged lower in choppy trading after the European Central Bank kept its policy rates steady and took a more positive view on a euro zone economy that has shown resilience to global trade shocks.

The euro was last down 0.14 per cent at $1.17240 against the dollar.

"Today's meeting offered no new information to change our view on the most likely policy path or the surrounding risk balance," Barclays analysts led by Mariano Cena said in an investor note. "We continue to expect the ECB to remain on hold for the next two years and see the risk tilted towards lower, not higher, policy rates over our forecast horizon."

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, edged up 0.06 per cent to 98.435.

Sterling rose after the BoE delivered its fourth rate cut this year, although markets pushed back their expectations for further easing, with the next cut not fully priced until June, from April prior to the decision.

Sterling strengthened 0.09 per cent to $1.33846.

"Interest rate markets have reduced their bets on further easing, likely on account of both the finely balanced nature of upcoming decisions and the Governor's comment that room for further reductions is becoming more limited. Two-year sterling swap rates are roughly five basis points higher," said Tom Priscott, FX trader at Investec.

"The pound may have further room for upside as traders recalibrate their outlooks for 2026 through the afternoon," Priscott said.

The Swedish and Norwegian central banks both kept their main interest rates on hold, in line with expectations. The Swedish crown was last down 0.29 per cent at 10.8855 per euro, while Norway's crown was last down 0.52 per cent at 11.9173 per euro.

The Bank of Japan looks almost certain to raise short-term interest rates on Friday to 0.75 per cent from 0.5 per cent as high food costs keep inflation above the central bank's 2 per cent target.

[TITLE]India, Oman to sign free trade pact today to boost economic ties:
[TEXT]
STATE TIMES NEWS

NEW DELHI: India and Oman will sign a free trade agreement on Thursday in Muscat, opening greater opportunities for sectors such as textiles, food processing, automobiles, auto components, and gems and jewellery.

It will be signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a four-day, three-nation visit. He arrived in Ethiopia on Tuesday from Jordan and will depart from Addis Ababa for Oman.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal has reached Muscat for the FTA signing.

Talks for the free trade agreement, officially termed as CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement), formally began in November 2023 and the negotiations concluded this year.

In free trade agreements, the two trading partners either significantly reduce or eliminate customs duties on a maximum number of goods traded between them. They also ease norms to promote trade in services and attract investments.

Oman is the third-largest export destination for India among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.

Speaking at the Oman-India Business Forum in Muscat, Goyal said it would be the first trade agreement Oman is entering into in nearly two decades.

Oman last inked a similar agreement with the US in January 2006, he said.

“The free trade agreement offers immense opportunities for all of you,” Goyal told the gathering of businesses.

He said huge potential is there to increase cooperation in sectors such as textiles, footwear, auto and auto components, gems and jewellery, agrochemicals, and renewable energy.

Oman is a gateway for other GCC countries, Eastern Europe, Africa and Central Asia, the minister said, adding, “We can look at collaborations in services sectors, such as chartered accountants, research and development, tourism, healthcare and education.

The four prominent areas of collaboration are energy transition, infrastructure development, food security, and startups, he said.

Minister of Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion of Oman Qais Al Yousef, in his address, said that India has emerged as Oman’s third-largest trading partner and Oman continues to be a key destination for Indian investments across strategic sectors.

He stated that Indian investments in Oman have more than tripled since 2020, reaching USD 5 billion, spanning sectors such as green steel, green ammonia, aluminium manufacturing and logistics.

India already has a similar agreement with another GCC member, the UAE, which came into effect in May 2022. The other members of the council are Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.

India and Qatar will soon begin talks on a trade pact.

New Delhi: The India-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA) opens significant opportunities across sectors including textiles, food processing, automobiles, gems and jewellery, agrochemicals, renewable energy and auto components, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday while addressing the India-Oman Business Forum in Muscat. The pact will be signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday in Oman."The sky is the limit in terms of potential, particularly with Oman opening the doors as a gateway to the Gulf Cooperation Council region, eastern Europe, central Asia, and to Africa," Goyal said.The minister said there are four broad areas in which the two countries can collaborate with each other-energy, food security, startups and infrastructure, multimodal logistics and export warehouses. "The free trade agreement offers immense opportunities for all of you," Goyal said.The negotiations for the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement began in November 2023 and concluded this year. This will be Oman's first FTA in nearly two decades.At the same event, Oman's commerce, industry and investment promotion minister Qais Al Yousef said that India has emerged as the country's third-largest trading partner and that Oman continues to be a key destination for Indian investments across strategic sectors.The minister said that Indian investments in Oman have more than tripled since 2020, reaching $5 billion, spanning sectors such as green steel, green ammonia, aluminium manufacturing and logistics. He emphasised that these investments reflect India's confidence in Oman as a long-term operating base.India-Oman bilateral goods trade totalled about $10.5 billion in 2024-25. Petroleum products and urea account for more than 70% of India's imports from Oman.

[TITLE]From Farming to Fashion, the Trends Shaping the Cotton Industry for 2026:
[TEXT]
A year drawing to a close marks a time of reflection for many. And for two of the industry’s relentlessly hopeful sectors—farming and retail—it’s also a time to take stock and consider the outlook for next year.

In the farming branch, cotton prices have been stable but low, which has made it a tough time for growers. But this stability could benefit apparel makers and retailers that take advantage of the lower pricing.

“This stability in raw material pricing may be one bright point in the sea of uncertainty that has been facing the industry over the past year,” said Cotton Incorporated’s Jon Devine, senior economist, in an interview with the Lifestyle Monitor™.

By working with cotton instead of synthetic apparel, brands can both win over consumers and help their bottom lines after facing a host of challenges in 2025. Consider that nearly three-quarters of shoppers (74 percent) say their favorite fiber or fabric to wear is cotton, denim or a cotton blend, according to Cotton Incorporated’s 2025 Lifestyle MonitorTM Survey. The survey completes 500 interviews per month with U.S. consumers between the ages of 13 and 70. Further, nearly six in 10 consumers (59 percent) say they would pay more for natural fibers such as cotton.

Devine explains that crop prices declined after surging during the pandemic and are now as low as they were pre-Covid. This puts growers in a bind though, since the cost of inputs have increased with inflation. The USDA estimates that costs have risen

[TITLE]What your cheap clothes cost the planet:
[TEXT]
This story is a partnership between Grist and The Nation.

The Atacama desert in Chile is one of the most beautiful and forbidding places on Earth, so dry that it’s sometimes used by scientists to test run Mars missions. Most years the area sees less than half a centimeter of rain, but this past September unusually heavy precipitation brought forth a desert bloom, blanketing the ground with delicate purple flowers that disappeared as quickly as they’d appeared.

It was a rare treat for locals used to grimmer ornamentation: Since 2001, colorful mountains of used clothing have been the main feature growing across the Atacama. By the time the largest mound was set on fire in 2022, it contained some 100,000 tons of discarded fabric, roughly the weight of an aircraft carrier. Today, piles like it continue to grow.

This fashion graveyard has become so large that some outlets have dubbed it the “great fashion garbage patch.” It owes its growth to the nearby duty-free port of Iquique, where Chile imports all manner of international goods without customs or taxes — including heaps of used clothing from the United States, Europe, and Asia. While the best items are resold to international markets, overwhelming volumes of cheap fast-fashion pieces don’t make the cut. Instead, they are dumped in the desert — an open secret that the government largely ignores. The burnings, whether they’re intended to destroy the evidence or make more space, fill nearby towns with smoky, unhealthy air.

Activists have been fighting against this desert dumping for years, documenting the burnings and suing both the federal and local governments to stop it. But the real blame for Chile’s mess lies beyond the country’s borders. From the moment these garments are spun from fibers to the time of their undignified disposal, they are part of a vast global pollution machine — one that has grown massively as the world economy has globalized and factories have begun pumping out ever-cheaper, ever-faster styles to customers half a world away.

This new hyper-vast, hyper-fast-fashion system is phenomenally destructive. Today, the clothing trade generates some 170 billion garments a year — roughly half of which wind up being thrown out within that year, and almost all of which despoil the world’s land, air, and seas. In the process, it generates as much as 10 percent of all planet-warming emissions, making it the second-largest industrial polluter, while also holding the distinction of being the world’s second-largest consumer and polluter of water. When all its many offenses are cataloged and counted, fashion is the third-most-polluting industry on the planet, after energy and food.

Things weren’t always this bad. While fashion has long left trails of environmental devastation in its wake — just ask the poor snowy egret, sacrificed by the thousands to decorate a generation of women’s hats — it was kept in relative check, even as globalization ramped up, by a 1974 trade agreement known as the Multi Fibre Arrangement. This agreement allowed nations to regulate the number of textile and clothing imports allowed into their countries, thereby protecting domestic production. But its expiration on January 1, 2005, essentially heralded fashion’s NAFTA moment. Low-cost goods from countries such as China and Bangladesh began flooding the United States and the European Union, which undercut domestic production in developing countries by saturating those markets with used clothing. The loosening of the century-old de minimis loophole in 2016, which allowed packages under $800 to enter the United States without tariffs, allowed Shein and Temu, the notorious Chinese e-commerce giants, to grow exponentially.

Some observers of the fashion industry have speculated that it might be on the cusp of a reckoning. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, together with Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, has sent shock waves through the industry, rattling U.S. consumers — and with them, major brands like Shein and Temu. Both have already begun to compensate for the drop in U.S. sales by redirecting their efforts toward Europe and Australia while moving their operations to other countries. Other companies, meanwhile, have simply begun offsetting their losses by trimming their sustainability efforts, raising serious fears of an even faster race to the bottom.

All of which raises the questions: How did we get into this situation? And, more important, how do we get out?

The typical fast-fashion jeans are worn only seven times before being tossed, giving the garment a carbon footprint that is more than 10 times higher per wear than traditional denim.

Step 1: A dirty, bloated underbelly

To understand how our garments got so noxious, it helps to go back to the beginning: to how our clothes become clothes in the first place. Take any item of attire — from Lululemon athleisure leggings to the summer of 2024’s viral Uniqlo baby tee; from the swankiest gowns to the most nondescript knockoff jeans — and the story is almost always the same: Most clothes start their lives deep in the ground, either as seeds of cotton or in the nearly 342 million barrels of crude oil that go into the making of synthetic fabrics every year. Most of the problems start with one of these two origin stories.

Today, synthetic fibers make up nearly 70 percent of all textile production. Polyester has become particularly ubiquitous across styles and brands, whether those brands are fast-fashion behemoths or rarefied luxury houses. Its soft, stretchy nature can mimic traditional textiles or be engineered into modern, high-performance meshes. Its low cost — just half the price of cotton in some instances — makes it an attractive option for brands and suppliers looking to snag profits while offering lower prices to customers.

But beneath its malleable folds lies a nasty business. Commercialized by the chemical giant DuPont in the mid-1900s, the process of making polyester involves superheating two petroleum-based chemicals — ethylene glycol (also used in antifreeze) and terephthalic acid (commonly used in plastic bottles) — and extruding the mixture through tiny holes to form yarn. In 2015, this process was estimated to produce as much annual carbon pollution as 180 coal-fired power plants. As the resulting polyfabrics are woven, washed, treated, and sewn into garments, they continually shed plastic microfibers.

Meanwhile, plant-based fibers like linen and cotton, which currently make up a quarter of global textile production, come with their own complications. Compared to other major crops, cotton is considered resource-intensive, earning a reputation among environmental organizations, such as the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Justice Foundation, as particularly thirsty, based on the amount of water it consumes, and dirty, based on the quantity of chemical pesticides used to grow it. The cotton fiber needed to manufacture a classic jeans-and-tee outfit requires roughly 500 gallons of irrigation water (and an additional 1,500 gallons of rainwater) to grow. And while cotton takes up a little less than 3 percent of all farmable land, its production accounts for some 5 percent of all pesticide sales and 10 percent of insecticide sales.

Other, less common fashion fabrics, such as viscose (made from the pulp of more than 100 million trees per year), come with their own environmental trade-offs — a 2023 report found that nearly a third of those trees came from old-growth or endangered forests. Over the past decade, blended fabrics that mix various types of synthetic fibers and organic ones have become increasingly common, creating an engineering headache for recycling initiatives and spreading plastic’s presence ever further.

The environmental impact of your jacket Higher impact: Quilted jackets stuffed with down — generally goose feathers — have been standard-issue for the last century. But polyester fill has begun to dominate the market, and manufacturers have relied on a toxic group of chemicals known as PFAS to waterproof the jackets. These “forever chemicals” don’t degrade naturally, and they have infiltrated drinking water, farmland, and the human body. Down carries its own baggage: It often involves plucking feathers from birds while they’re still alive. Lower impact: Brands have begun developing alternatives to PFAS in anticipation of bans that went into effect in 2025 in California and New York. Patagonia and Vaude have phased out PFAS use entirely, while Gore-Tex, Fjällräven, and Sympatex all offer PFAS-free options. Patagonia, Houdini, and Cotopaxi have also revamped their process for making synthetic fill to use recycled and plant-based materials and produce less emissions.

The environmental impact of your T-shirt Higher impact: Growing, weaving, dyeing, and manufacturing cotton into a T-shirt can require more than 700 gallons of water — enough for a single person to drink for 900 days. Cotton cultivation also requires heavy chemical use; some estimates indicate the crop accounts for roughly 16 percent of all insecticides sold worldwide. Lower impact: Hemp-jersey blends can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of a T-shirt. Hemp has low water needs, requiring as much as 90 percent less water than cotton. And because the plant sequesters a lot of CO2 as it grows, its overall carbon footprint is significantly lower than that of other fibers.

Step 2: Toxic textiles

Once the requisite materials have been grown, harvested, or extracted from DuPont’s primordial ooze, they’re turned into fabric, bleached, and dyed. This is an enormously toxic process that’s estimated to be responsible for 20 percent of water pollution worldwide. Pesticides used to grow cotton are flushed into waterways, along with bleach and the heavy metals — such as cadmium, chromium, lead, and arsenic — found in dye. The World Bank has identified at least 72 toxic chemicals involved in the standard industrial dyeing process, and once those chemicals make their way into aquifers, the knock-on effects are dire.

Dark sludge from clothing factories fills nearby lakes and streams, blocking the light needed for photosynthesis and destroying aquatic ecosystems. Even rinsing synthetic fabrics sends microplastics racing down the drain, and experts estimate that

[TITLE]The Key to Sarah Jessica Parker’s Holiday Looks This Year? Google’s Virtual Try-On Feature (Which Our Editors Tested Out):
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission.

Real-life Carrie Bradshaw steps out into the snow-dusted NYC streets looking, naturally, flawless. One minute, Sarah Jessica Parker is tempted by a roasted nuts vendor. The next, she’s sitting in a cozy, “Ralph Lauren Christmas”–coded living room, typing into her phone the following prompt: “I’m shopping for an outfit that has a classic holiday New York City vibe, perfect for a friend’s downtown party.”

This isn’t a heart-to-heart with ChatGPT but a snippet of a campaign video depicting SJP’s latest obsession: Google Shopping’s AI–powered try-on tool that helps users not only pick out and shop for a spot-on getup across various occasions but also see how billions of apparel listings will look on their own bod (or that of their gift recipient) once the clothing in question is unwrapped and put on.

In the aforementioned campaign, shot by Chloe Horseman and directed by Max Bartick, Parker ends up settling on a bow-bedecked cocktail dress that we can easily imagine taking her from the holiday dinner to that downtown soirée in no time. She whizzes away in a taxi, carried by the spirit of Christmas, of course, but also the ease that comes with having your holiday outfit equations all figured out thanks to modern-day tech.

During our phone-call interview, I ask Parker if she thinks Google‘s innovation comes close to mimicking the je ne sais quoi of visiting a designer store in person — of touching each fabric, speaking to the sales reps, and catching a glimpse of your final, breathtaking look in the dressing-room mirror.

“I’m certain AI hasn’t been able to replicate that yet,” she tells WWD. “But all the in-between guesswork that happens [during online shopping] — like, ‘Does it suit my height and hair color? Will this be a good gift for somebody who’s a little taller than me?’ — will be cut out.”

Parker herself has had no shortage of online shopping–related disappointments in the past, caused by feeling “seduced,” as she says, by how something looks on a model, only to realize upon receiving the item that said model’s dimensions were wildly different from Parker’s own 5’3″ frame: effectively annulling its allure. Google, though, makes it easy to gauge the proportions of a given dress, pair of jeans, blouse, and anything else that’s piqued your interest on the internet recently.

There’s also an element of whimsy attached to it all. Per Parker, “[the technology] allows you to live in a fantasy” — dabbling in sartorial aesthetics that, to date, you’ve only been able to admire from afar.

I decided to trial the try-on feature myself, which proved to have a nonexistent learning curve. To initiate the process, I uploaded a full-length selfie to the online software, before choosing a body size for my mini-me (key to ensuring the state-of-the-art technology caters to your unique body type) and generating four stylized versions of myself wearing ‘fits spanning from a loafers-and-leather pants combo to an unlikely Canadian tuxedo mashup.

The next step was perusing through Google Shopping’s “Holiday Party Outfit” and “New Year’s Eve” edits, replete with trending styles like bubble-skirt sweater dresses, swathed-in-satin ones, and striking, cutout-clad maxi gowns. Clicking on the ones I fancied most allowed the platform to seamlessly transfer them onto my avatar, and the result was three distinct holiday ensembles that I don’t have in my closet (yet) but which seemed to come alive on my figure: no IRL trip to a label’s flagship location required.

Indeed, the visuals I got back were nothing if not natural, testament to the sophistication of Google’s latest. According to the company, its software “understands the human body and nuances of clothing — like how different materials fold, stretch and drape on different bodies,” all while “preserv[ing] these subtleties when applied to poses in your photos.”

Courtesy WWD/Stacia Datskovska

If you so happen to find a look that’s “the one,” you can hit “Shop” next to your AI-generated image mockup — which allows Google to find the closest matching style that can actually be shopped. And if you’re trying on an already-shoppable offering (say, a festive, cropped cardi from Old Navy, Madewell’s bestselling pair of straight-leg jeans, or a softer-than-soft Ralph Lauren blazer), simply search for the “Try it on” icon on the product’s Google listing and watch as it’s fitted to you, as if by magic.

As for my interview subject’s advice on nailing the ideal cold-weather outfit? It’s not as prescriptive as you’d think (though Carrie Bradshaw would, no doubt, suggest something maximalist and Manolo Blahnik–based).

“I never tell anybody what is right or wrong or what they should or shouldn’t be wearing. In a million years, I would never,” Parker shares. “I would simply say to feel most like yourself.”

The star reveals that she’s usually “shy” in settings with a lot of people: “Bigger parties intimidate me, so I try to do anything I can to feel closer to myself when I’m out in the world, especially in social engagements.”

Other than that? Follow that one fashion vision you can’t get out of your head. “If you have a fantasy
