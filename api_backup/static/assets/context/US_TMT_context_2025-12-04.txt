[TITLE]Groww, Pine Labs IPOs spark fresh deal flow for fintech startups:
[TEXT]
ETtech

India’s fintech sector is seeing renewed dealmaking momentum after a protracted funding winter and regulatory interventions on unsecured lending. Several startups are now in talks with venture capital funds to raise money for expansion after policy clarity on payments and lending, multiple industry sources told ET.Furthermore, highly successful recent public listings of Pine Labs and Groww have strengthened exit prospects for risk investors in the Indian market, boosting the confidence for early-stage firms. ET reported on November 10 that the Groww IPO had quickened dealmaking in the wealth-tech segment , with several mid-stage startups now in discussions for sizeable fundraises.Bengaluru-based consumer lending startup Olyv (formerly SmartCoin) is in late-stage discussions to close a $15–20 million round, people aware of the matter said.The round is likely to be led by Nandan Nilekani-backed Fundamentum, with participation from Japan’s SMBC Rising Asia Fund, they said.Home financing startup Ambak is raising $8 million from existing investors. The company passed a board resolution last month seeking to raise $3 million each from Z47 (previously Matrix Partners India) and Peak XV Partners and the remaining from DeVC India and Advantedge Technology Fund.Ambak is founded by former Policybazaar senior executive Raghuveer Malik, ex-ZestMoney executive Rashi Garg, and Rameshwar Gupta, the former CTO of Freecharge.It had raised $7 million from Peak XV’s accelerator programme Surge in January 2025. Back then, the company said it aimed to expand lending operations to 35 cities and target $1 billion in loan disbursements by March 2026.“Besides Peak XV and Z47, some of Ambak’s other existing backers are also likely to participate,” said one of the persons cited above.Email queries to these fintech startups and their potential investors remained unanswered until the publication of this report.Renewed interest in India’s fintech sector is being driven by a more stable policy environment around payments and lending, along with rising consumption trends.Pune-based Fibe (previously EarlySalary), for instance, is in talks with International Finance Corporation for a $35 million round, as reported by ET in August. Gurugram-based advanced salary startup SalarySe recently closed an $11.5 million round led by Flourish Ventures and SIG Venture Capital.Some large consumer lenders, including KreditBee and Kissht , are preparing to tap public markets for their next phase of growth.ET reported on October 22 that festive-season purchases sparked a surge in instant lending, giving consumer lending startups a sudden boost in disbursals.Besides digital lending startups, the fintech infrastructure space has emerged as an attractive segment, with several large venture funds looking to stretch their commitments to the segment. As banks and NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) undertake wide-scale digitisation projects, investors believe this segment provides the next big opportunity. Knight Fintech, which provides enterprise software for digital lending, co-lending and treasury management to banks and financial services firms, is in discussions with Dutch investment group Prosus for a $20–25 million funding round, two people aware of the matter said.“Prosus is negotiating the deal… but other US-based private equity funds are also talking. The contours haven’t been finalised yet,” one of the persons cited above said. “Knight Fintech is currently tracking an ARR (annualised revenue run rate) of $10–12 million.”Founded in 2019, Mumbai-based Knight Fintech closed a $20–25 million round led by Accel last year. Its other backers include 3one4 Capital and Blume Ventures.Chennai-based M2P has raised $188 million across multiple rounds, emerging as one of the largest players in this space. Earlier this year, banking-tech startup Zeta raised $50 million from US-based healthcare and financial services major Optum.Bengaluru-based cross-border payments startup Skydo is also looking to raise fresh capital. According to the people cited above, Skydo has held early discussions with SIG (Susquehanna International Group) Asia VC for a $4–5 million infusion.“Skydo is stitching together a bigger round and is in talks with more investors, but the deal terms are not closed yet,” said one of the persons aware of the plans.Skydo cofounder Movin Jain, responding to ET’s queries, declined to confirm the developments.

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as weak ADP jobs data reinforces growing Fed rate cut bets:
[TEXT]
US stocks edged up on Wednesday as a surprise decline in private-sector employment revealed cracks in the job market, but also reinforced bets on a Fed rate cut next week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.9%, or over 400 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed 0.2% after the major gauges finished Tuesday with gains across the board.

The ADP report looked to add fuel to the rate-cut fire, as nearly 90% of bets sit on a quarter-point reduction from the Federal Reserve next week. Private employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, compared with expectations for a modest gain. ADP said the decline was driven primarily by a sharp pullback from small businesses.

Meanwhile, from the Institute for Supply Management showed US services activity expanded slightly in November to a reading of 52.6%, while the index for prices paid eased to a seven-month low in a potentially positive sign for inflation. The next official update on consumer prices — the PCE print due Friday — is playing catch-up from September.

Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) extended its bid to bounce back from a deep, weeks-long slump that pulled the token below $83,000 in recent days. The leading cryptocurrency rose to a two-week high above $93,000 on Wednesday before retracing some of its gains.

Microsoft (MSFT) helped spur an early decline in tech stocks, and its shares ended down 2.5% after The Information reported that the software giant is lowering its AI sales quotas. That appeared to reignite investor skepticism around AI demand. Leading semiconductor stocks retreated, with Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) dropping, among others.

On the earnings front, Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock climbed nearly 8% after the US chipmaker's upbeat sales outlook and deal to buy Celestial AI. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) surged 15% after the retailer's strong start to the holiday shopping season.

Salesforce (CRM) results are on Wednesday's docket after the bell.

[TITLE]Morgan Stanley Just Named This Stock a Top Semiconductor Pick. Should You Buy Shares Now?:
[TEXT]
Semiconductor stocks remain the backbone of the AI and data center boom, even as geopolitics and uneven spending have tilted the group through recent cycles. Investors hunting durable exposure to chipmaking often focus on names that supply the factories, not just the chips.

One name now moving up that list is ASML (ASML). The company just received a major vote of confidence from Morgan Stanley, which not only raised its price target but also labeled ASML its Top Pick in European semiconductors. The call comes as demand strengthens across memory and logic, with new EUV tool cycles and DRAM transitions pointing to healthier margins heading into 2026.

For investors looking for a potential leader in the next semiconductor upcycle, here’s a closer look at ASML.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The US government is poised to become a shareholder in a semiconductor startup chaired by Pat Gelsinger, who ran Intel until his resignation last year.

The Commerce Department said on Monday that the Trump administration signed a nonbinding letter of intent to invest up to $150 million in xLight, a startup trying to build a more advanced and cost-effective way to manufacture chips.

The investment would come from the CHIPS and Science Act and would be structured as equity, giving the federal government direct ownership in the company.

The deal — a first from the Trump administration's CHIPS Research and Development Office — signals Washington's effort to regain leadership in chipmaking. Most advanced semiconductors are manufactured outside the US, led by TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung in South Korea — areas where China's influence looms large.

Intel warned in July that it may halt development of its next-generation chip, 14A, due to financial reasons. If Intel gives up on 14A, this could be a death blow to US chip manufacturing, Business Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in a July report.

"For far too long, America ceded the frontier of advanced lithography to others. Under President Trump, those days are over," said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Monday's

[TITLE]How AI can improve 5G telecommunications for enterprises:
[TEXT]
AI and machine learning are having a significant impact on wireless networking and telecommunications for network operators. Various innovations have enhanced coverage, optimized operations and improved customer experience.

At the same time, telecom operator lethargy and pushback contributed to the rise of alternative approaches, driven by the simplicity of alternatives like TCP/IP and Wi-Fi. Other innovations in wireless telecommunications show promise for extending the reach of enterprise operations across a wide variety of use cases.

When 5G first came out, it promised better and faster networks across a multitude of applications. Yet users were frustrated by dead zones that required failing over to legacy network protocols to fill the gaps. The core 5G protocols also enable 5G to be a promising alternative to Wi-Fi in enterprises and can help reduce latency as well as improve resilience. Nevertheless, commissioning a 5G link is still a more challenging proposition than onboarding a new Wi-Fi device.

Recent innovations in AI, particularly generative AI (GenAI), are helping to mitigate these challenges. And just around the corner, next-generation 6G standards that use AI more directly in the network to enhance resilience could help overcome these limitations, thereby boosting enterprise adoption of these cellular telecommunications standards as a viable alternative to Wi-Fi and other internet options.

"Currently, the telecom ecosystem is benefiting from what AI can bring to the table in several ways. Directly related to the telecom systems, operators are now building LLMs [large language models] that can analyze incoming packets to predict maintenance and downtime before it occurs," said Scot Glover, global leader of technology, media and telecommunications at Protiviti, a digital transformation consultancy.

Another concern is the significant power needed for telecommunications networks. While AI consumes power to perform its tasks, the ability of AI to build and design new radio access networks and manage them more efficiently during both peak and slow times should bring

[TITLE]Big Tech’s ‘Spend Little, Earn Lots’ Formula Is Threatened By AI:
[TEXT]
For two decades, the playbook for Big Tech was fairly simple and extremely successful: Create disruptive innovations, deliver blinding growth rates and keep a lid on spending.

A handful of behemoths like Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. used this formula to seize market share from legacy businesses and power the US stock market to record after record. But a key part of the program — the relatively small amount of capital required to generate those huge profits — is increasingly under threat from the race to develop artificial intelligence.

Most Read from Bloomberg

“They’re some of the best business models the market has ever seen,” said Jim Morrow, chief executive officer at Callodine Capital Management, which oversees $1.2 billion in assets. “Now you’ve seen this explosion in capital intensity to the point where it’s now the most capital intensive sector in the market. That’s just a radical change.”

Those four companies alone are expected to devote more than $380 billion combined to capital expenditures in their current fiscal years, with most going to chips, servers and other data center-related expenses. That’s a more than 1,300% jump from a decade ago. And they’ve all pledged to spend significantly more in the year after that.

Microsoft’s capex is now 25% of its revenue, more than three times what it was 10 years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The software and cloud-computing giant’s spending-to-sales ratio is among the top 20% in the S&P 500, as are Alphabet’s and Amazon’s, well above companies in traditionally capital-intensive industries like oil and gas exploration and telecommunications.

Despite the uncertainty of future payoffs, investors are giving the tech giants the benefit of the doubt on their AI plans, at least so far. Almost all of the big spenders have seen their stock prices rise this year, and their valuations are elevated. For example, Microsoft shares are up 16% in 2025, and the stock is priced at more than 28 times profits projected over the next 12 months, higher than its 10-year average of roughly 27 times and the S&P 500’s multiple of 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

But there are creeping signs of doubt. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was punished after its third-quarter earnings report because Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg failed to chart a convincing path to bigger profits from rising AI spending. The stock had its worst session in three years on Oct. 30, plunging 11% the day after Meta reported earnings, and it has lost an additional 3.7% since then. After soaring 25% through the first three quarters, the shares are now up 9.6% for the year, underperforming the S&P 500.

[TITLE]ITU unveils four-year plan to “bring connectivity to everyone around the world”:
[TEXT]
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)’s World Telecommunication Development Conference (WTDC-25) held in Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, has closed after two weeks of debate and deliberations. Its final communique, the Baku Declaration and Action Plan, reports that delegates agreed on a roadmap “to bring connectivity to everyone around the world”.

The United Nations body claims the action plan document “sets the agenda for human-centred digital development driven by telecommunications and information and communication technologies with focus on the needs of developing countries, unserved communities and vulnerable populations” via “universal, meaningful connectivity” (UMC).

The new four-year plan will run from 2026 until the end of 2029. It will support initiatives to spread global, meaningful and affordable digital connectivity to the remaining 2.2 billion people who, even after all the years devoted to attempt after attempt to finally bridge the digital divide, still have no broadband access and remain disenfranchised from the internet and the global digital economy.

Speaking at the WTDC-25 closing ceremony, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, the secretary general of the ITU, said: “WTDC-25 has brought us closer to our goal of making connectivity universal, meaningful and affordable for everyone, everywhere, in this decade.” She added, “The new plan is our roadmap towards human-centred digital development that leaves no one behind.”

WTDC-25 was hosted by the government of Azerbaijan and, as is par for the course for these events, it produced masses of wordy worthiness. Nonetheless, between them, the 2,000 delegates from the 153 member states of the ITU did reach a broad consensus on practical plans to map out a route to bring the benefits of sustainable broadband and digitisation to, and for, all.

The communique once again proves that the venerable organisation, founded back in 1865 as the International Telegraph Union and specialised agency of the United Nations (UN) since 1947, still has a major role to play in the era of AI and quantum computing. To this day, the ITU continues to coordinate the global use of the radio spectrum and satellite orbits, establishes international technology standards and strives to enable universal connectivity and access to digital services.

In addition to both new and revised resolutions to focus the agency’s digital development works, the Baku Declaration and Action Plan also includes recommendations on how the ITU’s Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D) unit might address key digital development priorities in ITU-D regions.

Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, the director of the ITU’s Bureau of Telecommunication Development, commented: “The plan outlines the roadmap of action to bridge the remaining digital divides, while addressing the unique needs of [the] least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small-island developing states. We look forward to delivering tangible results and accelerating digital transformation by working with governments and regulators to create an enabling policy and regulatory framework that paves the way for industry and private sector to invest and contribute to our efforts to close infrastructural gaps so we may achieve meaningful connectivity and bring everyone online.”

During the course of WTDC-25, the ITU published its Global Connectivity Report 2025. It is based on the agency’s newly released Facts and Figures 2025 document and provides “policy guidance, measurement frameworks and detailed analysis across the key dimensions of universal and meaningful connectivity: Quality, availability, affordability, devices, skills and security.”

The WTDC also agreed on a two-year project to enhance the sustainability of national smart villages and smart islands programmes in the Asia Pacific region. This project, to be carried out in collaboration with Australia’s Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications, Sport and the Arts, is mooted as a model via which digital skills and access to digital services is enhanced in rural and remote communities, directly benefitting seven countries and 3,000 people. Not many, but not unimportant either – every little helps.

A further, rather vague, declaration to “promote capacity building and digital skills in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), was also agreed. The CIS is a russophone Eurasian intergovernmental organisation that was formed after the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991. The CIS charter has it that all its members are “sovereign and independent nations”. The organisation “encourages cooperation in economic, political and military affairs”, which is both very dated and horribly ironic given that Ukraine has been illegally invaded by fellow-CIS member, Russia. Unsurprisingly Ukraine no longer participates in the CIS and another member country, Moldova, has announced that it will withdraw from the CIS.

Ongoing massive disparity between high-income and low-income nations

The ITU’s 129-page Global Connectivity Report 2025 (GCR) is jam-packed with facts, figures and statistics as it takes stock of the current state of connectivity worldwide and highlights the continuing divides between and within countries. It reports that broadband connectivity is now a defining feature of the global economy and a major driver of human development. What’s more, there is an ever-increasing body of evidence to show the correlation between broadband expansion, the availability of connectivity and improved socioeconomic performance.

However, the expansion of connectivity around the globe also throws up what the GCR calls “a connectivity paradox” whereby, although connectivity provides immense benefits, it also introduces new challenges and vulnerabilities. The fact is that unequal access, uneven quality, high costs and limited digital skills leave billions of people still unable to participate fully. What’s more, these digital divides often compound pre-existing ‘analogue’ socioeconomic inequalities.

Furthermore, affordability (or the lack of it) plays a decisive role in whether or not universal, meaningful connectivity can be achieved. ‘Digital poverty’ results in exclusion from digital opportunities. High costs for both ICT services and devices are constantly cited as barriers to internet access, especially among low-income households. In economies where the price of mobile broadband amounts to a significant share of monthly gross national income (GNI) per capita, not only is the share of internet users lower but so too is data usage per subscription.

In contrast, economies that meet the Broadband Commission’s target of ensuring that entry-level broadband services cost less than 2% of monthly GNI per capita have the highest shares of internet users in the population and benefit from much higher data traffic. (The Broadband Commission is a public/private partnership co-founded by the ITU and UNESCO to advance broadband technology for sustainable development.)

Where domestic subscriptions are concerned, spend on ICT services varies widely. In the richest countries, ICT services account for 2% to 3% of household expenditure, while in lower-income economies, this climbs to 9% higher. As has been the case for so long, rural populations generally spend a bigger part of their income for broadband connectivity than urban populations. Not only that, rural subscribers can, and often do, get lower-quality services than their urban counterparts because deploying broadband outside urban areas costs more and so the tariffs are higher.

Fortunately, as the Global Connectivity Report notes, between 2013 and 2025 global affordability eased, with the median price of entry-level mobile broadband falling by some 50% during those years. However, in nine out of ten low-income economies, a 5 gigabytes mobile broadband package costs more than 10% of the average monthly income, five times more than the Broadband Commission’s 2% target.

The report also reveals that the cost of connectivity for the lowest earners can be prohibitive. For at least 40% of earners in the least-developed countries (LDCs) and low-income economies, the cost of broadband services can be as high as 20% of their gross national income per capita. That’s 10 times the Broadband Commission’s target.

The ITU says achieving universal, meaningful connectivity will depend on sustained investment in the “statistical foundations of digital development”. Many countries still face gaps in data, capacity and financing that constrain evidence-based policy-making. Thus, the strengthening of national data ecosystems should be a central objective of the global digital agenda.

Governments need to treat ICT statistics as a strategic public good and integrate them into national development and statistical strategies. Strong institutional arrangements – linking national statistical offices, regulators and digital ministries – are essential to ensure regular data collection, stable financing and the effective use of statistics in policy design. At the international level, current support for data systems remains fragmented, and few mechanisms focus specifically on ICT and digital inclusion. Establishing a coordinated, multipartner financing facility could provide predictable resources, align donor efforts with national priorities, and promote sustained, comparable data production.

Innovation will also be key. The use of mobile phone, geospatial and other alternative data sources can complement traditional surveys, offering timelier and more granular insights. To harness these opportunities, countries must invest in data literacy, privacy safeguards and modern infrastructure.

The report also stresses that continued international cooperation and standardisation will be essential, and this is where the ITU emphasises its own pedigree and asserts that it will continue to “lead global efforts to harmonise definitions, methodologies and tools for ICT measurement, while supporting capacity development and providing technical assistance. Strengthened collaboration across the United Nations system, development partners and the private sector can ensure that all countries are equipped to produce and utilise high-quality digital-development statistics, establishing data as a cornerstone for inclusive and effective digital transformation,” it noted.

Meanwhile, the ITU’s Facts and Figures 2025 report shows that some 6 billion people around the world,

[TITLE]UNFI’s AI and digital overhaul gains momentum as fiscal 2026 begins:
[TEXT]
United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) opened fiscal 2026 with straightforward evidence that its long-running investment in artificial intelligence (AI), automation and digital transformation is starting to reshape the distributor’s operations in meaningful ways.

While the company reported a solid earnings beat, the most significant developments of the quarter came from technology. More specifically: how it changes forecasting, fulfillment, merchandising — and the pace at which new products reach retail shelves.

UNFI ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in revenue, flat from the prior year. Meanwhile, profitability expanded sharply. Growth in natural and organic products remained standout at 11% year over year. At the same time, conventional sales declined following the company’s planned exit from its Allentown, Pennsylvania, distribution center.

UNFI taps into AI to improve forecasting and fulfillment

Much of the quarter’s operational lift stemmed from the continued rollout of Relex, which UNFI’s uses for AI-powered demand forecasting and inventory management. Now deployed across

[TITLE]Citigroup Strategists Say AI Boom Supports Strength of US Dollar:
[TEXT]
Citigroup strategists reportedly said the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and the resiliency of global trade have reversed the weakness in the U.S. dollar that was seen during the first half of the year.

Citi strategists recommended in a Tuesday (Dec. 2) research note that emerging-market investors seek trades that would cushion against a potential rebound in the dollar, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The AI boom and the resiliency of global trade amid higher U.S. tariffs have reversed the earlier weakness in the dollar, Citi said, according to the report.

“These two important factors combined generated a gradual comeback to U.S. exceptionalism, ultimately changing the dollar dynamics once again,” the research note said, per the report. “Barring significant repricing in U.S. equities, we believe global markets are likely to remain in this regime, which basically means a more resilient USD.”

Citi strategists see greater potential for a rebound in the U.S. dollar than their peers at other banks, the report said.

Strategists at Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs expect more weakness in the dollar, saying that Federal Reserve rate cuts will put downward pressure on the U.S. currency, according to the report.

Companies are sprinting to build the data centers and buy the chips needed to train and run large language models amid the continuing AI boom, PYMNTS reported in September.

AI captured 42% of U.S. venture capital in 2024, up from 36% in 2023 and 22% in 2022. During the first half of 2025, AI startups raised $104.3 billion.

Private capital is stepping in, too, with the AI boom representing as much as a $1.8 trillion opportunity for non-bank lenders.

As for tariffs, it was reported in October that global companies expect the impact of these levies to lessen as more countries negotiate new trade deals with the U.S.

While companies expect their combined cost of tariffs to total between $21 billion and $22.9 billion this year, they expect it to drop to $15 billion in 2026.

In addition, companies feel there is less uncertainty around tariffs now and that they are better able to make plans.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Profit Slips, Policy Shifts: Product Leaders Navigate the Crossfire” found that companies are adjusting portfolios, forecasting models and supply strategies around the assumption that trade levies will define the landscape for years.

[TITLE]Vultr to invest $1 billion in Ohio AI cluster using AMD chips:
[TEXT]
Dec 2 : Cloud infrastructure company Vultr said on Tuesday it would invest more than $1 billion to launch a new artificial intelligence cluster powered by Advanced Micro Devices' processors at a new data center in Springfield, Ohio.

The new cluster is a 50-megawatt, 24,000-chip facility that will deploy AMD's Instinct MI355X graphics processing units, which will be interconnected with ethernet-based fabric that improves data transfer speed and traffic flow.

Vultr is trying to benefit from the AI boom by positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to hyperscalers, offering computing at lower prices. Vultr CEO J.J. Kardwell said that its cloud infrastructure services are typically half the price of what hyperscalers charge.

The company forecasts the new cluster to go online by early 2026. "We expect the cluster to be sold before it goes live. We also have MI355X GPUs racked in our Chicago region for customer testing and pilots," Kardwell told Reuters in an interview.

In December 2024, Vultr secured a $3.5 billion valuation in a financing round led by LuminArx Capital Management and AMD Ventures, the investment arm of AMD.

The company said it does not yet have clients for the Ohio cluster, but is in active discussions with several companies. Some existing customers, including Chai and LiquidMetal AI, currently utilize Vultr's AMD-powered offerings at other clusters.

Vultr acquires chips from companies such as AMD and Nvidia, and operates them from leased data center spaces.

The firm has provided access to central processing units since 2014. Since integrating GPUs into its services in 2021, AI infrastructure has become the majority contributor to Vultr's revenue over the past two years.

West Palm Beach, Florida-based Vultr is financing the cluster by extending its line of credit with a syndicate that includes Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.
