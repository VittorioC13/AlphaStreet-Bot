The British company has been notifying investors of the allocation of shares they’ll receive from this oversubscribed funding round, Bloomberg News reported Friday (Oct. 17), citing sources familiar with the matter.

Those sources said Revolut conducted the fundraising on its own without assistance from its usual banking partners. The round will both solidify the company’s status as the most valuable startup in Europe and — per Bloomberg’s sources — help it enter dozens of new markets. The company’s offerings include banking products such as checking.

A spokesperson for Revolut declined to comment when reached by PYMNTS.

Revolut’s last funding effort came a little more than a year ago, with a secondary share sale valuing the firm at $45 billion.

Revolut is a digital bank that offers checking and savings accounts, cross-border money transfers, cryptocurrency and stock trading.

The company has been expanding throughout the world in recent years, including into the U.S., where Revolut last month introduced a new high-yield savings account.

Revolut is also “actively looking” at whether to acquire a U.S. bank or to apply for its own banking license there, Sid Jajodia, Revolut’s U.S. CEO and global chief banking officer, told Reuters last month.

He told the news outlet that “being a bank in every market we operate in is critical,” especially in the U.S. where Revolut’s business is still expanding.

As noted here at the beginning of this month, the “U.S. offers fertile ground for expansion: Gen Z, the first generation of true digital natives, is beginning to accumulate income, savings and purchasing power — and their expectations for banking services align neatly with the digital-first DNA of those providers.”

Research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows how attractive a demographic Gen Z is to the digital banking world, with 72% of this group saying they use a digital wallet at least once per a week, and 62% saying they’d consider making a neobank their primary bank account provider.

And close to 70% told PYMNTS “they prefer to manage their financial lives entirely online, underscoring the digital-first mindset that plays to neobanks’ strengths,” that report said.

In other Revolut news, the company last week announced that it had acquired Swifty, a startup offering an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered travel agent. The companies say that Swifty’s technology will be integrated into Revolut’s loyalty program to help the company bolster the development of its AI-powered financial assistant.

[TITLE]With T-Mobile's "Jump on Demand" gone, what are your options for flexible phone upgrade plans?:
[TEXT]
T-Mobile is officially sunsetting its flexible 'Jump! On Demand' program, leaving frequent upgraders in the lurch. With true carrier leasing options now effectively extinct, we explore what few alternatives remain for tech enthusiasts.

What happened to Jump! On Demand?

For years, T-Mobile 's Jump! On Demand (JOD) was a unique gem for smartphone enthusiasts. It wasn't a standard financing plan, but a true leasing program, and it stood out in a market increasingly dominated by long-term contracts. Its core appeal was simple: flexibility.

JOD allowed customers to upgrade their smartphone as often as once every 30 days. You paid a monthly lease payment, and when a new, shiny device caught your eye, you could simply walk into a store, trade in your current phone, and start a new lease. It was the perfect program for tech journalists, developers, and enthusiasts who wanted to try the latest hardware—be it an iPhone, a Galaxy Fold, or a Pixel—without being locked in for years.

T-Mobile 's standard 36-month Equipment Installment Plans (EIPs), while the "parting gift" mentioned in the report seems to be a small, one-time bill credit (around $25 for some) or a final payoff offer on their leased device. Now, that era is over. As we previously reported, T-Mobile is ending this beloved program for good . Existing JOD customers are reportedly being transitioned to's standard 36-month Equipment Installment Plans (EIPs), while the "parting gift" mentioned in the report seems to be a small, one-time bill credit (around $25 for some) or a final payoff offer on their leased device.

It's a minor gesture that does little to soften the blow of losing the most flexible upgrade program in the US. This move solidifies the industry's complete pivot away from consumer-friendly leasing and toward carrier-friendly long-term financing.

Why the end of JOD leaves a huge hap

The demise of JOD is more than just the removal of one carrier feature; it signals the end of an era for consumer choice. The US carrier market— T-Mobile , The demise of JOD is more than just the removal of one carrier feature; it signals the end of an era for consumer choice. The US carrier market— AT&T , and Verizon —has now fully and unequivocally embraced the 36-month financing plan as its default.

This model is fantastic for carriers. It locks customers in for three years, dramatically reducing churn and guaranteeing a steady, predictable payment stream. It also allows them to advertise flagship phones for deceptively low monthly payments.

For consumers, the "good" is that lower monthly payment. The "bad" is almost everything else. You are locked into a three-year loan for a device that is often considered "old" after two.

Recommended Stories By the 36-month mark, that phone is likely three generations behind, will have a significantly degraded battery, and may have stopped receiving crucial OS and security updates. You're still paying for a device that the market considers to have little value.JOD was the antidote to this. It treated smartphones as what they are for many enthusiasts: a rapidly depreciating piece of technology that you "use" rather than "own" until it's obsolete. With JOD gone, where do serial upgraders turn? The other carriers offer little comfort.

AT&T has its "Next Up" program, but it's an add-on fee (typically $6/month) just for the privilege of upgrading once you've paid off 50% of your device (which is 18 months on a 36-month plan). Verizon has a similar 50% payoff requirement for its early upgrade options. These are not leases; they are just financing plans with a paid "early exit" clause. They lack the spontaneity and value that JOD provided.

This pushes the focus away from carriers and onto the manufacturers themselves, who have thankfully stepped in to fill the void, at least partially.

The best remaining upgrade-focused programs

Apple iPhone Upgrade Program:

Samsung Upgrade Program

Google (and Everyone Else) : This is where the options fall flat. Google had the "Pixel Pass" program, which bundled a phone, protection, and services. They discontinued it. Now, the Google Store offers standard 24-month financing (often through a third party like Synchrony Bank), but there is no structured "Pixel Upgrade Program" to compete with Apple or Samsung. You're simply expected to trade in your old device for whatever its depreciated value is, which is not a true upgrade program. With carrier options dried up, enthusiasts must now look directly to the source. Here are the best leasing-like options left.

Which one works best for your situation, upgrade programs like JOD or 36-month financing programs? Upgrade programs like JOD. 36-month financing programs. Neither. I buy my phones outright and unlocked. Upgrade programs like JOD. 58.73% 36-month financing programs. 6.35% Neither. I buy my phones outright and unlocked. 34.92%

The 36-month "trap" has been sprung

From my perspective, the end of Jump! On Demand is a significant and disappointing loss for consumer choice. It was the last vestige of carrier-level flexibility, a program that acknowledged not everyone wants to "own" a phone for three full years. The industry-wide pivot to 36-month EIPs feels decidedly anti-consumer, even as it's marketed as "more affordable."

Who are these 36-month plans for? They are for consumers who are purely sensitive to the monthly payment amount and don't mind using a phone until, as a friend of mine says, "until the wheels fall off." They are for people who see a phone as a simple appliance, not a piece of enthusiast technology.

T-Mobile 's decision, while understandable from a business perspective (JOD was likely complex and expensive to manage), hammers the final nail in the coffin of carrier-based flexibility. The future of frequent upgrades now lies squarely with Apple and Samsung, leaving fans of other great brands like Google, OnePlus, or Motorola out in the cold.

[TITLE]Tesla (TSLA) Stock in Focus as Barclays Lifts Price Target to $350, Citing Tariff Advantage:
[TEXT]
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week. On October 17, Barclays reiterated the stock as “Equal Weight” and raised its price target to $350 (from $275). The firm stated that the stock is a beneficiary of tariff changes.

“Tesla: Key beneficiary of tariff relief on U.S. production as 100% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are made in the U.S.”

According to the analysts, Tesla heads into Q3 earnings with two contrasting “stories,” namely an accelerating autonomous and AI narrative fueled by Elon Musk’s proposed comp package and a weakening fundamental backdrop.

Pixabay/Public Domain

Barclays anticipates a Q3 EPS beat driven by gross margin and volume strength. However, it is “leaning neutral to slightly negative” into the print owing to a recent rally driven by a “muted view” on fundamentals.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives.

While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

Understanding the Main Forces Driving Performance Marketing Software

Technological Evolution: Advancements in AI, machine learning, and data analytics are revolutionizing how performance marketing platforms operate. Automation reduces manual effort, while predictive analytics enable more precise targeting.

Regulatory Changes: Data privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA are reshaping how companies collect and utilize consumer data. Compliance is now a critical factor in vendor selection.

Pricing and Cost Dynamics: Competitive pressures and technological efficiencies are driving down costs, but the complexity of features can lead to varied pricing models. Buyers must evaluate value over price.

Global Economic Factors: Economic fluctuations influence advertising budgets and investment strategies. During downturns, organizations prioritize ROI, demanding more transparent and accountable solutions.

Impact on Buyer Priorities and Decision-Making

These dynamic forces influence how organizations approach procurement. Buyers now expect platforms to be compliant with privacy regulations, scalable to support growth, and capable of integrating with existing systems. Procurement cycles are becoming more data-driven, with emphasis on vendor transparency and proven ROI. As competition intensifies, vendors are compelled to innovate rapidly, making vendor evaluation more complex but also more critical.

Myths vs. Reality in Performance Marketing Software

Myth 1: More features always mean better value. Reality: Focus on features that align with your strategic goals. Overly complex solutions can hinder usability and ROI.

Myth 2: Bigger vendors are always more reliable. Reality: Smaller, specialized providers often offer more innovative and flexible solutions tailored to specific needs.

Myth 3: Compliance is optional if the platform is effective. Reality: Non-compliance risks hefty penalties and reputational damage. Prioritize vendors with proven compliance capabilities.

Myth 4: Automation replaces the need for human oversight. Reality: Automation enhances efficiency but still requires strategic oversight for optimal results.

Myth 5: All platforms are equally scalable. Reality: Scalability varies; assess vendor infrastructure and support for growth before committing.

Data-Driven Steps to Evaluate Vendors

Verify Claims: Request case studies, customer references, and performance benchmarks. Cross-check vendor-reported data with independent sources.

Analyze Competitor Data: Use third-party tools and reports to benchmark vendor offerings against industry standards.

Forecast Validation: Examine vendor growth forecasts and technological roadmaps. Seek evidence of ongoing innovation and adaptability.

Assess Compliance and Security: Confirm adherence to relevant privacy laws and security standards through audits or certifications.

Strategic Purchase Criteria in a Dynamic Environment

Scalability: Ensure the platform can grow with your organization痴 needs without significant re-investment.

Regulatory Compliance: Prioritize vendors with robust compliance frameworks to mitigate legal risks.

Innovation Capabilities: Look for platforms that incorporate emerging technologies like AI and machine learning.

Long-term ROI: Evaluate total cost of ownership, including implementation, training, and ongoing support, against expected benefits.

Risks and How to Avoid Them

Overlooking Compliance: Failing to verify vendor adherence to privacy laws can result in legal penalties.

Ignoring Scalability: Choosing solutions that cannot support future growth leads to costly replacements.

Focusing Solely on Features: Prioritizing feature lists over strategic fit can cause misalignment and underperformance.

Neglecting Vendor Stability: Partnering with financially unstable providers risks service disruptions.

Underestimating Implementation Complexity: Poor planning can delay deployment and inflate costs.

Final Recommendations: Your Buyer Checklist

Define clear objectives aligned with your strategic goals.

Assess vendor compliance and security credentials thoroughly.

Prioritize scalability and integration capabilities.

Verify claims with independent data and references.

Evaluate total cost of ownership versus expected ROI.

Consider vendor stability and ongoing support.

[TITLE]Hearthstone and Warcraft Rumble devs join the over 1900 Blizzard workers to unionize: 'We deserve to be heard and respected':
[TEXT]
Only a few months after most of the Warcraft Rumble team was laid off as all future development was canceled, a majority of the remaining workers therein and the Hearthstone team have voted to organize—joining over 1,900 Blizzard workers now in a union under the Communications Workers of America.

As the CWA posted on their site, the new group represents "over 100 workers including software engineers, designers, artists, quality assurance testers, and producers." They are the fifth group at Blizzard to do so, following the Diablo team's vote less than two months ago. Microsoft has already recognized the union.

The CWA shared quotes from various developers supporting the motion in its announcement. Game designer on the Hearthstone team and organizing committee member Dominic Calkosz said, "My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals.

"We chose to organize in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity that the industry cannot ignore."

Another committee member and QA analyst Carol Blean stated in the same post, "I support our union because we deserve to be heard and respected … Real solutions, not free therapy or relocation suggestions, are needed to address being overworked, underpaid, and forced into unreasonable choices."

These waves of unionization follow Microsoft's historic, $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, which begat thousands of layoffs and the cancellation of a Blizzard survival game six years into development. Meanwhile, the tech giant achieved "record performance" financially in 2024, raking in $245 billion in revenue—something CWA called attention to earlier this year amid another round of layoffs.

Microsoft's internal strife marks a much larger ill blighting the games industry, but union votes like the ones passing all over Blizzard mark that developers aren't keen to take the exploitation sitting down.

[TITLE]Trump admits China tariff threats ‘not sustainable’ as trade tensions persist:
[TEXT]
President Trump said his threatened high tariffs on Chinese goods are “not sustainable,” even as his administration presses ahead with sweeping trade penalties against Beijing in a deepening tariff standoff.

“It’s not sustainable,” Trump told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures,” when asked whether the massive levies could remain in place without hitting the US economy.

“But that’s what the number is, it’s probably not, you know, it could stand, but they forced me to do that.”

5 President Trump said his threatened high tariffs on Chinese goods are “not sustainable.” Trump is seen with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. AP

Trump also sounded a more conciliatory note in his Friday interview with Bartiromo, particularly in light of reports that the president threatened to cancel a planned meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.

“I get along great with him,” Trump said of Xi. “I think we’re going to be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal. It’s got to be fair.”

The president’s remarks came as Washington and Beijing face the steepest trade confrontation in years — with US import taxes on Chinese products climbing as high as 145% in a tit-for-tat exchange that has rattled global markets.

Trump’s latest tariff pause — a 90-day truce set to expire Nov. 10 — has kept those duties on hold while both sides attempt to reach new terms.

But with China expanding export controls on rare earth minerals and the US announcing fresh restrictions on Chinese shipping, the path to a deal remains uncertain.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business on Friday that he had “high confidence” Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “are going to be able to get together with the Chinese and get this back to a place that’s good for both countries.”

The comments followed Trump’s threat last week to impose a new 100% tariff on all Chinese goods by Nov. 1.

The remarks marked a notable shift from earlier in the week, when Trump signaled on Truth Social that tensions could escalate.

The markets plunged last week after Trump threatened to impose new levies on China. Reaction from Wall Street apparently prompted the president to put out a more conciliatory message to calm jittery investors.

[TITLE]How China tightens the screws in trade war with the US – DW – 10:
[TEXT]
Beijing is standing firm in its trade dispute with Washington — and finding new partners along the way. The higher the tariffs, the more China's confidence seems to grow.

A recent picture that's gone viral in the United States captures the prevailing mood among Americans: a clear plastic bag containing an American flag, labeled "Made in China."

For supporters of US President Donald Trump, it's proof that something is deeply wrong with the US economy. They've called on "patriots" to boycott Chinese goods.

Trump's dilemma — the US economy cannot do without China-made products Image: X/@joemccuiston

But can America really afford to cut ties? Is the free flow of mutually traded goods like rare earths, smartphones, soybeans and microchips at risk of becoming a victim of the fight for geopolitical dominance?

Deep economic ties

Were all trade between the two world powers to cease, experts say the US economy would struggle more than Chinese economy. Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) in Washington D.C. said the mutual dependence of both sides "remains quite high."

"Despite economic security concerns, both sides still gain significantly from trade," he told DW.

However, the US-China trade gap is quite significant. Over the past decade, the US trade deficit with China has widened from $295 billion (€252 billion) to $382 billion. In 2024, China exported goods worth $526 billion to the US — more than triple what it imported.

Chinese products are part of everyday life in America. Of those imports, $127 billion were smartphones and computers. Any new tariffs would hit US consumers directly.

Of tariffs and counter-tariffs

Trump's 100% tariffs have angered Beijing, but unlike Europe, China is responding with defiance. Government officials in Beijing have vowed to "fight to the end" and urged Washington to "correct its approach," warning in an October 13 statement on social media platform X that "threatening high tariffs is not the right way to deal with China."

Beijing has already retaliated by imposing counter-tariffs and export restrictions, including on the rare-earth minerals critical to electric vehicles, semiconductors and defense technology. The US depends on imports for more than 90% of its rare earth supply — over 80% of which comes from China. Beijing controls

[TITLE]Bessent, Chinese vice premier to meet to try to defuse US tariff hike:
[TEXT]
By Doina Chiacu and Andrea Shalal

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday he expects to meet next week with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to try to forestall an escalation of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that President Donald Trump said was unsustainable.

Bessent made the announcement during a White House cabinet meeting and later confirmed plans for a meeting after a call with He on Friday evening. Bessent said on X the two officials "engaged in frank and detailed discussions regarding trade between the United States and China."

"We will meet in-person next week to continue our discussions," Bessent wrote.

China state news agency Xinhua reported that He and Bessent had "candid, in-depth, and constructive discussions on major issues in bilateral economic and trade relations" in a video call, and agreed to a new round of trade talks as soon as possible.

The two officials previously met in four European cities over six months to hammer out a tariff truce that brought duties down from triple-digit levels for each country. That agreement expires on November 10.

A meeting in Malaysia would shift the venue to a Southeast Asian exporter that trades heavily with both China and the U.S. and whose goods are now subject to a 19% duty imposed by Trump. Malaysia also faces a threatened 100% U.S. tariff on its semiconductors and derivative electronics devices under a national security trade review.

Trump earlier on Friday blamed Beijing for the latest impasse, a dispute over China's sweeping new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals and magnets. He has threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on November 1 unless Beijing scraps the restrictions.

Asked whether such a high tariff was sustainable and what that might do to the U.S. economy, Trump replied: "It's not sustainable, but that's what the number is."

"They forced me to do that," he said in an interview with Fox Business Network that was broadcast on Friday.

Trump also has threatened to impose new U.S. export controls that would halt supplies of "any and all critical software."

The new trade actions were Trump's reaction to China dramatically expanding its export controls on rare-earth elements. China dominates the market for such elements, which are essential to tech manufacturing.

Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday blasted the restrictions as a threat to global supply chains.

Trump also confirmed he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in two weeks in South Korea and expressed admiration for the Chinese leader.

"I think we're going to be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal. It's got to be fair," Trump said on FBN's "Mornings with Maria," which was taped on Thursday.

Later, as he was preparing to have lunch at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss efforts to end its war with Russia, Trump said: "China wants to talk, and we like talking to China."

The softening in tone and affirmation of his intent to meet with Xi helped stem Wall Street's early losses on Friday. Major U.S. stock indexes, which have been rattled over the last week by Trump's abrupt re-imposition of steep levies on Chinese imports and by credit worries among regional banks, were up in afternoon trading.

WTO URGES DE-ESCALATION OF TRADE SPATS

The head of the World Trade Organization urged the U.S. and China to de-escalate trade tensions, warning that a decoupling by the world's two largest economies could reduce global economic output by 7% over the longer term.

[TITLE]Bangladesh Spectrum Auction Uncertain - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
Bangladesh Plans 700 MHz Spectrum Auction: What it Means for 4G and 5G Expansion

Exciting news for the telecommunications sector in Bangladesh! The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) is reportedly gearing up to auction 700 MHz spectrum early next year. This move could significantly impact the expansion of 4G and 5G services across the country.

According to reports, the BTRC aims to make 45 MHz of spectrum available in the 703- to 803-MHz range by January 2026. This potential spectrum auction is designed to empower telecom companies to enhance their existing 4G network capacity and accelerate the rollout of 5G coverage. This will mean faster internet speeds and more reliable mobile connectivity for consumers and businesses alike.

However, a legal hurdle exists. A portion of the 700 MHz spectrum is currently tied up in a legal dispute between the BTRC and a broadband provider, AlwaysOn Network Bangladesh Ltd. This company holds 12 MHz of spectrum in that band. The dispute stems from a 2007 allocation of the 700 MHz spectrum to AlwaysOn, which was later revoked by the BTRC. The case is currently under appeal, and the outcome could influence the amount of spectrum ultimately offered in the auction. This legal challenge could impact the interest from mobile operators.

The BTRC has already applied to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to proceed with the auction. Their current plan involves offering at least 25 MHz of the 700 MHz spectrum in January. If AlwaysOn loses its appeal, the BTRC could potentially offer the full 45 MHz. The success of this spectrum auction is crucial for telecom operators to meet the growing demand for high-speed data.

Leading telecoms like Grameenphone, Robi Axiata, and Banglalink reportedly hope that the regulator releases the entire 45 MHz block for auction. These mobile operators are eager to acquire more bandwidth. Furthermore, the potential bidders are reportedly concerned

Industry body Broadband India Forum (BIF) has asked the highest policy-making body of the Department of Telecommunications, the Digital Communications Commission (DCC), to reconsider its rules related to satellite communications (satcom) spectrum.

In a letter addressed to Dr. Neeraj Mittal, Chairman of DCC, the BIF argued that concerns around the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) satellite spectrum recommendations are influenced by “protectionist and anti-competitive mindsets” and violate free, fair and non-discriminatory treatment of new service providers.

Level playing field

Regarding reports of the DCC proposing satcom operators seek fresh permissions after crossing a certain number of subscribers, the BIF said such caps will constrain a satellite operator’s ability to scale, hurting investment incentives and increasing the service cost per user.

“The notion stems from the threat perception of the incumbents -- that satcom providers might amass large user bases and, thereby, cannibalise their existing markets, ostensibly without bearing equivalent regulatory burdens,” said T V Ramanchandran, Chairman of the BIF, warning of a ‘License Raj’ in case of such a cap.

The BIF also called the proposal for mid-term revision of satellite licences unfair, considering the renewal period is already set for five years as opposed to terrestrial broadband players, who have licences for 20 years. A mid-term renewal of licence would increase the capex costs for satcom players, as the entire cost would have to be amortised in a much shorter time.

Use of Bharat Nidhi

BIF supported TRAI’s recommendation of Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) for satellite user terminals and satcom services as “lawful” and “necessary,” given the high capex, steep terminal costs and lower revenues that satcom players are subject to in unserved and under-served geographies. BIF argued that should not be viewed as a subsidy, but as a national priority for bringing

[TITLE]Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market to 2030 Featuring Saudi Telecom Co, Mobily, Zain, Integrated Telecom Co, GO Telecom, Bayanat Al Oula, Detecon Al Saudia, and NourNet:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services Market was valued at USD 18.72 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 24.05 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.26%. The Saudi Arabia Telecommunication Services market encompasses a broad range of services including mobile voice and data, fixed-line broadband, satellite communication, and enterprise network solutions.

These services are delivered by key national operators such as STC, Zain KSA, and Mobily, and are vital to enabling both consumer connectivity and business operations across the Kingdom. With the highest population in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Saudi Arabia has emerged as a digitally active economy, with increasing demand for faster, more reliable telecommunications infrastructure.

The market is poised for significant growth driven by the expansion of 5G networks, fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) initiatives, and government-led smart city projects such as NEOM and The Line. These national efforts require high-capacity, low-latency connectivity to support technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology is actively driving digital infrastructure development, aiming to increase internet speed, coverage, and digital inclusion across urban and rural areas.

Growing demand for enterprise-level connectivity solutions in sectors like banking, logistics, and manufacturing is contributing to the telecom market's evolution. Enhanced regulatory frameworks, investment in ICT infrastructure, and strategic public-private partnerships are further accelerating sector development. As Saudi Arabia continues its digital transformation journey, the telecommunication services market will remain at the core, providing the foundational layer for future technological innovation and national economic diversification.

Key Market Drivers

Nationwide 5G Deployment and Infrastructure Modernization

Saudi Arabia is rapidly expanding its fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network as part of its national digital transformation under Vision 2030. This rollout is not limited to major urban centers like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam but is extending to remote and underserved areas. Investments in 5G base stations, fiber backhaul, and spectrum acquisition are enabling the country to build one of the most advanced telecom infrastructures in the region.

This aggressive infrastructure development is improving connectivity speed, latency, and network capacity across all user categories. 5G enables use cases like smart manufacturing, autonomous transportation, and real-time healthcare diagnostics, increasing demand for advanced telecom services. The government, in collaboration with major telecom providers, is also offering incentives for private sector adoption of 5G, which in turn accelerates revenue generation for the sector and fosters innovation ecosystems across industries. As of early 2025, more than 65 percent of Saudi Arabia's population has access to 5G connectivity - up from just 23 percent in 2021. This rapid rise in coverage is driven by large-scale investments in nationwide base stations, spectrum rollout, and private-public collaboration to accelerate high-speed internet availability across both major cities and rural zones.

Key Market Challenges

Regulatory Complexity and Evolving Compliance Requirements

The regulatory environment for the telecommunication services market in Saudi Arabia is becoming increasingly complex due to the convergence of data protection, cybersecurity, localization, and international investment standards. While the Communications, Space and Technology Commission has implemented forward-looking frameworks to promote digital growth, the simultaneous application of multiple regulatory layers - especially concerning cross-border data transfer, 5G infrastructure sharing, and cloud services - creates compliance ambiguity for telecom operators. These overlapping mandates often slow down the introduction of new services or infrastructure deployments due to longer approval cycles and legal risk assessment periods.

The continuous revision of cybersecurity guidelines and national digital standards requires telecom companies to allocate substantial resources to legal, IT, and compliance functions. For smaller operators or new entrants, these burdens can restrict innovation and delay service expansion. Additionally, global technology vendors partnering with Saudi providers must also adjust to local legal frameworks, which can complicate integration timelines and strategic alliances. As the market matures and becomes more digitally interconnected, the need for unified, streamlined regulations that balance innovation with control will become increasingly vital to sustaining growth.

Key Market Trends

Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Network Optimization

Telecommunication service providers in Saudi Arabia are increasingly embedding artificial intelligence technologies across their operations to enhance network performance and customer service efficiency. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions are being used for predictive maintenance, automated network configuration, dynamic resource allocation, and anomaly detection. This has allowed operators to proactively resolve network issues, reduce service downtime, and deliver consistent, high-quality connectivity to a digitally demanding user base.

Moreover, customer experience management has benefited significantly from the application of artificial intelligence. Telecom operators are deploying virtual assistants, natural language processing systems, and intelligent analytics to personalize services, automate queries, and minimize human intervention in customer support. These tools help operators gain insights from large volumes of user data, enabling more agile decision-making. As Saudi Arabia accelerates its transition toward smart cities and digital governance, the role of artificial intelligence in automating and enhancing telecommunication services is expected to become more prominent and deeply embedded in network management strategies.

[TITLE]Matawa Chiefs Council wants Rogers to delay 3G shutdown, telling CRTC it's 'a matter of life and death':
[TEXT]
The Matawa Chiefs Council is warning that Rogers’s planned 3G network shutdown could have consequences for remote First Nations communities in northern Ontario, including putting lives at risk.

The council said it sent a letter to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) this week that calls for an urgent delay to the Dec. 31 shutdown. The CRTC regulates telecom providers, sets basic service standards, monitors access and affordability and can encourage, but not force, companies to maintain service in specific communities.

The chiefs argue the move could “pose serious risks to the safety, health and well-being” of the region’s remote communities, which already face limited access to cellular and broadband services.

The Matawa region includes nine member First Nations, several of which are remote fly-in communities located in the mineral-rich Ring of Fire area, including Eabametoong, Marten Falls, Neskantaga, Nibinamik and Webequie.

“Reliable communications infrastructure is a matter of life and death in our communities,” Chief Sonny Gagnon of Aroland First Nation said in a news release announcing the council's letter to the CRTC. “In Aroland First Nation, we don’t even have the benefit of 3G (or any other cellular services), but that could change with immediate investment in upgrades to finalize compatibility to meet today’s standards.”

The letter comes as Canadian providers gradually disable 3G networks to free up frequencies for faster 4G and 5G networks, which improve call quality and internet speeds, and support new technologies.

The Matawa Chiefs Council says the issue extends far beyond resource development.

'Reliable telecommunications are fundamental to health, safety and sustainable development in our territories,” says Chief Solomon Atlookan of Eabametoong First Nation. (Marc Doucette/CBC )

[TITLE]Tesla (TSLA) Stock in Focus as Barclays Lifts Price Target to $350, Citing Tariff Advantage:
[TEXT]
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week. On October 17, Barclays reiterated the stock as “Equal Weight” and raised its price target to $350 (from $275). The firm stated that the stock is a beneficiary of tariff changes.

“Tesla: Key beneficiary of tariff relief on U.S. production as 100% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are made in the U.S.”

According to the analysts, Tesla heads into Q3 earnings with two contrasting “stories,” namely an accelerating autonomous and AI narrative fueled by Elon Musk’s proposed comp package and a weakening fundamental backdrop.

Barclays anticipates a Q3 EPS beat driven by gross margin and volume strength. However, it is “leaning neutral to slightly negative” into the print owing to a recent rally driven by a “muted view” on fundamentals.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives.

While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Revolut Valued at $75 Billion After $3 Billion Funding Wave:
[TEXT]
Revolut is reportedly wrapping a $3 billion fundraising effort valuing the FinTech at $75 billion.

The British company has been notifying investors of the allocation of shares they’ll receive from this oversubscribed funding round, Bloomberg News reported Friday (Oct. 17), citing sources familiar with the matter.

Those sources said Revolut conducted the fundraising on its own without assistance from its usual banking partners. The round will both solidify the company’s status as the most valuable startup in Europe and — per Bloomberg’s sources — help it enter dozens of new markets. The company’s offerings include banking products such as checking.

A spokesperson for Revolut declined to comment when reached by PYMNTS.

Revolut’s last funding effort came a little more than a year ago, with a secondary share sale valuing the firm at $45 billion.

Revolut is a digital bank that offers checking and savings accounts, cross-border money transfers, cryptocurrency and stock trading.

The company has been expanding throughout the world in recent years, including into the U.S., where Revolut last month introduced a new high-yield savings account.

Revolut is also “actively looking” at whether to acquire a U.S. bank or to apply for its own banking license there, Sid Jajodia, Revolut’s U.S. CEO and global chief banking officer, told Reuters last month.

He told the news outlet that “being a bank in every market we operate in is critical,” especially in the U.S. where Revolut’s business is still expanding.

As noted here at the beginning of this month, the “U.S. offers fertile ground for expansion: Gen Z, the first generation of true digital natives, is beginning to accumulate income, savings and purchasing power — and their expectations for banking services align neatly with the digital-first DNA of those providers.”

Research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows how attractive a demographic Gen Z is to the digital banking world, with 72% of this group saying they use a digital wallet at least once per a week, and 62% saying they’d consider making a neobank their primary bank account provider.

And close to 70% told PYMNTS “they prefer to manage their financial lives entirely online, underscoring the digital-first mindset that plays to neobanks’ strengths,” that report said.

In other Revolut news, the company last week announced that it had acquired Swifty, a startup offering an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered travel agent. The companies say that Swifty’s technology will be integrated into Revolut’s loyalty program to help the company bolster the development of its AI-powered financial assistant.
