[TITLE]Sharpie shows us how it’s done —invest in Americans and we’ll produce again:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump loves a good Sharpie, and now he has all the more reason to love the company that makes them.

The president signed the flurry of executive orders the day he returned to office with a Sharpie.

He’s used them for years since discovering they were more reliable than more expensive pens.

They have another merit, too: They’re almost entirely made in America.

Only the felt tip of a Sharpie comes from abroad — it’s made in Japan, according to The Wall Street Journal’s Natasha Khan, who published an eye-opening article on the penmaker this week.

What makes Newell Brands, the corporation that makes Sharpies, so newsworthy is its success in saving money — and holding down consumer prices — by making the pens in America.

Newell was once as dazzled as other manufacturers by the prospect of making its products more cheaply in Asia.

But in 2018, Newell’s Chris Peterson decided to try making the latest Sharpie, a gel version, at the company’s factory in Maryville, Tenn.

Prompted perhaps by the political environment of the first Trump administration, the company had already been trying to move some manufacturing back to America from China.

The new pen required updating its Tennessee plant’s equipment and training workers to operate and maintain the new machines.

That’s what made the project a triumph — investment in an American factory, and in the Americans working there.

This country can make top-quality consumer goods at affordable prices, but only if companies invest in their equipment and in enhancing their workers’ skills.

Peterson had the company pay to send factory-floor workers to college.

They came back ready to take on more technically demanding tasks, and their wages shot up, on average by 50% over the last five years in the CEO’s estimation.

The mandarins of globalization say higher wages surely have to mean lower profits, and doesn’t better machinery mean fewer workers?

But Newell’s production costs dropped even as employment levels held steady: The company, its plant and its workers improved together.

Not every story in American manufacturing has such a happy outcome, of course — but Newell has proved the process that once led manufacturers and their workers alike to prosper still works in the 21st century.

Ford Motor Company famously discovered it could sell more cars by paying its workers well enough they could afford to buy the automobiles they were making.

Long before globalization and containerized shipping, America’s national economy boomed thanks to a virtuous cycle of rising wages, more technological investment, an increasingly educated workforce and higher consumer spending on products made in America.

Success at home led to success abroad: America was an exporting superpower that “ran persistent trade surpluses” from 1870 to 1970, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Trump wants to make American manufacturing great again — but tariffs, which can help, are not enough by themselves.

The Sharpie case shows more domestic investment is critical.

One reason for American manufacturing’s relative decline in recent decades has been the high cost of building new plants or renovating old ones.

Even if it’s profitable to manufacture in America, the upfront expenses are a hurdle, especially when foreign countries, which subsidize their industries in myriad ways, offer quicker returns on investment.

Trump incurred the wrath of free-market purists by getting government more involved in businesses like Intel and US Steel.

Yet industries like chip-making and steel — or for that matter ship-building and aerospace — are sectors with heavy government involvement throughout the world.

The few countries that have significant manufacturing in those fields all use government to sustain their industries.

Many smart free-market economists are dangerously naive

[TITLE]NRSInsights’ September 2025 Retail Same-Store Sales Report:
[TEXT]
September same-store sales increased 5.8% year-over-year

The average price paid for the top 500 items in August increased 2.9% year-over-year

NEWARK, N.J., Oct. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NRSInsights, a provider of sales data and analytics drawn from retail transactions processed through the National Retail Solutions (NRS) point-of-sale (POS) platform, today announced comparative retail same-store sales results for September 2025.

As of September 30, 2025, the NRS retail network comprised approximately 37,400 active terminals nationwide, scanning purchases at approximately 32,400 independent retailers, including convenience stores, bodegas, liquor stores, grocers, and tobacco and sundries sellers, predominantly serving urban consumers.

September Highlights

(Same-store sales, unit sales, transactions, and average price data refer to September 2025 and are compared to September 2024 unless otherwise noted. All comparisons are provided on a “per calendar day” basis to remove from consideration variability in the number of days per month or three-month period.)

SALES Same-store sales increased 5.8% year-over-year. In the previous month (August 2025), same-store sales increased 8.3% year-over-year.

Same-store sales decreased 2.5% compared to the previous month (August 2025). Same-store sales in August 2025 increased 3.4% compared to the previous month (July 2025).

For the three months ended September 30, 2025, same-store sales increased 5.8% compared to the corresponding three months a year ago.

UNITS SOLD Units sold increased 2.5% year-over-year. In the previous month (August 2025), units sold increased 4.3% year-over-year. Units sold decreased 1.1% compared to the previous month (August 2025). Units sold in August 2025 increased 1.8% compared to the previous month (July 2025).

BASKETS (TRANSACTIONS) PER STORE Baskets increased 1.9% year-over-year. In the previous month (August 2025), baskets increased 2.6% year-over-year. Baskets decreased 1.1% compared to the previous month (August 2025). Baskets in August 2025 increased 2.2% compared to the previous month (July 2025).

AVERAGE PRICES A dollar-weighted average of prices for the top 500 items purchased increased 2.9% year-over-year, a lower rate of increase than the 3.0% year-over-year increase recorded in August 2025.

Retail Trade Comparative Data

The table below provides historical comparative data with the U.S. Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade same-store sales data excluding food service:

Over the past twelve months through August 2025, the US Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade data, excluding food services, outpaced the NRS network’s three-month moving average same-store sales by 0.1% on average. In August, the NRS network’s three-month rolling average increase exceeded the US Commerce Department’s by 1.4%.

The NRSInsights data in the chart above have not been adjusted to reflect inflation, demographic distributions, seasonal buying patterns, item substitution, days per month, or other factors that may facilitate comparisons to other periods, to other same-store retail sales data, or to the U.S. Commerce Department’s retail data.

Commentary from Brandon Thurber (VP, Data Sales & Client Success at NRS)

"NRS retailers delivered another month of strong year-over-year sales increases across both beverage and center-store categories in September, while the sequential sales decrease was inline with expectations following the peak summer months. The three month rolling average increase, also 5.8%, is the most since 2023.

“Growth was led by prepared cocktails and sparkling water, which continue to capture consumer attention with premium positioning. Coffee also stood out as a beverage momentum driver.

“Retailers also experienced a lift from cold and flu remedies in September. The early strength in these seasonal offerings in combination with increases across indulgent categories reflect the diversity of the modern convenience store’s offerings, and the resilience of consumer spending as we approach the holiday season."

NRSInsights Reports

The NRSInsights monthly Same-Store Retail Sales Reports are intended to provide timely topline data reflective of sales at NRS’ network of independent, predominantly urban, retail stores.

Same-store data comparisons of September 2025 with September 2024 are derived from approximately 224 million transactions processed through the approximately 23,400 stores on the NRS network that scanned transactions in both months. Same-store data comparisons of September 2025 with August 2025 are derived from approximately 284 million transactions processed through approximately 31,400 stores.

Same-store data comparisons for the three months ended September 30, 2025 with the year-ago three months are derived from approximately 662 million scanned transactions processed through those stores that scanned transactions in both three-month periods.

NRS POS Platform

The NRS platform predominantly serves small-format, independent, retail stores nationwide including convenience stores, bodegas, liquor stores, grocers, and tobacco and sundries sellers. These independent retailers operate in all 50 states and the District of Colombia, including 205 of the 210 designated market areas (DMAs) in the United States, and in Canada. During September 2025, NRS’ POS terminals processed $2.1 billion in sales (+17% year-over-year) across 143 million transactions.

[TITLE]Online Sales Growth Slowing for Holiday, Adobe Predicts:
[TEXT]
Software giant Adobe predicts U.S. online sales during the holiday 2025 stretch will increase 5.3 percent to $253.4 billion, representing some slowing in digital sales growth.

For the holiday 2024 season, online sales in U.S. grew 8.7 percent to $241.4 billion, according to Adobe.

Adobe’s projections cover the Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, 2025 period and are based on analyzing direct transactions online, covering over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million stock keeping units and 18 product categories.

Those categories combined will represent 53.7 percent of the online spend this holiday season with electronics totaling $57.5 billion, up 4 percent; apparel totaling $47.6 billion, up 4.4 percent, and furniture reaching $31.1 billion, up 6.5 percent. Grocery sales will hit $23.5 billion, up 9.2 percent and cosmetics will reach $8.4 billion, up 9.1 percent.

While online sales for holiday are seen growing midsingle digits, overall holiday sales — digital and brick-and-mortar store sales combined — are seen growing just low-single digits. As the year has progressed, industry experts have been getting increasingly more cautious and conservative in their expectations for holiday sales gains. Concerns center around rising prices from tariffs and general inflation, declining consumer confidence, economic uncertainties and potential stockouts.

In addition, holiday shopping began as early as July for some consumers, who were looking to avoid higher prices and shortages on retail shelves later in the year, inevitably depleting the sales tally for the traditional November through December holiday period. There should be a pick-up in purchasing this month with Amazon’s “Prime” sale happening Tuesday and Wednesday, and Walmart, Target and Costco launching their own sales this week to compete. That will further snatch sales from November and December.

The London Stock Exchange Group said that, every year, retailers ride the coattails of Amazon’s Prime Days. “This Prime Week it’s highly likely that retailers are banking on aggressive promotions to encourage spending, especially as shoppers continue to prioritize value,” LSEG reported on Monday. “With consumers more price-sensitive than ever, online price comparisons will be a key part of their shopping behavior. Other retailers are aiming to capitalize on this trend by offering steep discounts to stay competitive.”

Among the shopping trends that are getting stronger this year, Adobe pointed to the increased use of AI by retailers to help consumers discover products and expedite purchasing, and that purchases attributed to social traffic should rise by 51 percent year-over-year, compared to just a 5 percent gain in the 2024 season.

Vivek Pandya, lead insights analyst for Adobe, told WWD, “We’re coming into the first really major year where consumers will be able to do a lot of ideation with these generative AI platforms. They’ll lean on them to get a better sense of prices and deals, who’s offering free shipping or not, and to get their Christmas lists together. This is going to be a nice tailwind. They’re looking at the social conversation. They’re looking at what’s being said on things like Reddit about different products. We see that play in a major way for the first time this holiday season. It’s going to be a much more comfortable experience for the consumer [with] much more awareness and utilization around generative AI platforms.” It’s helping consumers be “strategic” in their purchasing, he said, which suggests spending less.

In other key trends cited by Adobe:

Buy-now, pay-later services will drive $20.2 billion in online spend, up 11 percent and roughly $2 billion above holiday 2024.

Mobile devices will drive a record 56.1 percent share of online spend, representing $142.7 billion, up 8.5 percent year-over-year.

Cyber Monday will remain the biggest online shopping day of the year, generating $14.2 billion in sales, a 6.3 percent gain over Cyber Monday 2024.

Black Friday sales are expected to rise 8.3 percent to $11.7 billion.

8.3 percent to $11.7 billion. On Thanksgiving, consumers are expected to spend $6.4 billion online, up 4.9 percent.

The deepest discounts are expected to land throughout Cyber Week, with Cyber Monday being “last call” for the best deals.

Thanksgiving Day will be the best day to shop for sporting goods; Black Friday will see the deepest discounts for TVs, toys, and appliances; Cyber Monday will be the best day to shop for electronics, apparel and computers.

[TITLE]Georgia Tech reportedly inks massive nine-figure apparel deal to ditch Adidas:
[TEXT]
Georgia Tech is going to have a new apparel partner and it comes with a big time price tag. According to ESPN’s Pete Thamel, the Yellow Jackets have agreed to a 10-year deal with Under Armour to become the school’s official apparel provider, starting July 1, 2026.

Source: Georgia Tech and Under Armour have agreed to a new 10-year deal for UA to become the official apparel provider, effective July 1 of 2026. The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that GTech is getting from current adidas deal. pic.twitter.com/MeZfbDkuTU — Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) October 3, 2025

The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that Georgia Tech is getting from the current Adidas deal, according to Thamel and Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Chad Bishop.

"Tech was receiving an average of $3.11 million annually from Adidas in cash and product over its original six-year contract that was signed in 2018," Bishop said. This figure puts the reported value of Georgia Tech's new deal with UA at $186.6 million over ten years.

Georgia Tech’s previous deal with Adidas was set to expire in the summer of 2024, but the two sides put together a new two-year deal. However, the short-term fix wasn't enough to keep the Yellow Jackets from looking elsewhere.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Under Armour, an organization that shares our commitment to excellence, innovation, amplifying the Georgia Tech brand across the globe and enhancing the student-athlete experience, including through innovative NIL opportunities," GT's Vice president and director of athletics Ryan Alpert said in a statement. "Our partnership with Under Armour will play a big part in Georgia Tech continuing to move forward in the new era of collegiate athletics and reaching our ambitions of competing for championships at the highest levels of collegiate athletics.”

For Under Armour, this deal puts the outfitter back on the map in the new era of college athletics.

“As we mark our 30th anniversary next year, we’re thrilled to team back up with Georgia Tech, our first collegiate client, to experience our commitment to enhancing athletic performance." Under Armour's VP of the Team Division Craig Cummings said in a statement. "We are energized by the momentum in Atlanta and look forward to amplifying our presence in the community through meaningful activations and shared purpose.”

Georgia Tech had worn Russell Athletic for over two decades before switching to Under Armour in 1996. They migrated to Adidas and now the two brands will be reunited after thirty years apart.

The Yellow Jacket's first time officially back in the UA branding will come against Deion Sanders and Colorado in Atlanta on Sept. 5, 2026.

[TITLE]Adobe predicts AI-assisted online shopping to grow 520% during the 2025 US holiday season:
[TEXT]
The U.S. holiday shopping season is expected to bring in $253.4 billion in online sales this year, up 5.3% year-over-year, according to a new report from Adobe’s e-commerce connected division, Adobe Analytics.

Adobe Analytics develops its predictions by analyzing over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, encompassing 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. Its analytics software is used by a majority of the U.S.’s top 100 online retailers, giving it deep insights into online shopping and consumer behavior.

The company forecasts that Cyber Monday will again be the biggest shopping day of the year, up 6.3% year-over-year to reach $14.2 billion. Black Friday will also see higher growth, up 8.3% year-over-year to hit $11.7 billion. U.S. consumers on Thanksgiving Day are also expected to spend $6.4 billion online, up 4.9% year-over-year, as online sales start early.

Driving the sales this holiday season will be consumer demand for discounts, where products are expected to be 28% off listed prices. Other trends like shopping from mobile devices, the use of AI services to shop, and buy now, pay later services are other factors behind the rise in online sales.

Notably, Adobe predicts that generative AI-powered shopping will boom this year, with AI traffic set to rise by 520% year-over-year and peaking in the 10 days leading up to Thanksgiving. This follows the 1,300% increase in AI traffic to U.S. retail sites seen in 2024.

The company expects consumers to largely use AI for research ahead of purchases, based on a survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers — 53% of whom said they may use AI services for this purpose. The survey also found that 40% said they would use AI for recommendations, 36% for deal finding, and 30% for gift inspiration. Adobe expects AI to be used most across categories like toys, electronics, jewelry, and personal care.

Another trend expected this year involves mobile devices once again driving more online spend compared with desktop shopping, reaching a record 56.1% share. Last year, mobile accounted for 54.5% of the online transactions during this period, up from 51.1% in 2023. It’s unclear when the mobile growth will taper off and stabilize, especially given the larger-screened smartphone devices available on the market, which make it easier to shop online.

The 2025 holiday shopping will also see further growth of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services, which are expected to drive $20.2 billion in online spend, up 11% year-over-year, and around $2 billion more than the 2024 holiday season. Cyber Monday is also expected to see a new BNPL milestone, when online spend in this category is expected to reach $1.04 billion, up 5% year-over-year.

Social media will also drive more online sales this year. Social media advertising is expected to drive a 51% year-over-year increase in online revenue, up from 5% year-over-year growth in 2024.

Top categories for spending overall include electronics ($57.5 billion, up 4% YoY), apparel ($47.6 billion, up 4.4% YoY), and furniture ($31.1 billion, up 6.5% YoY).
