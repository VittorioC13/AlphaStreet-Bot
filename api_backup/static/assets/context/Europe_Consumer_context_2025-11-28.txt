[TITLE]Levi’s Opens Its Biggest Italian Store in Milan:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Levi’s has opened its biggest store in Italy, a testament to its lifestyle ambitions and direct-to-consumer-first strategy.

Located in the central shopping avenue of Corso Vittorio Emanuele, the 3,810-square-foot store spans two levels and is the brand’s 12th unit in the city. But the new location is meant to be Levi’s prime retail hub in Milan in terms of offering and activations, said Lucia Marcuzzo, senior vice president and managing director for Europe at the brand’s parent company Levi Strauss & Co.

In an interview with WWD, Marcuzzo underscored the important role of the Italian market — where Levi’s has more than 70 stand-alone stores and is available at more than 1,000 wholesale doors — and how the new unit is strategic for the brand.

[TITLE]LVMH Is Leading the Luxury-Meets-Art Race:
[TEXT]
LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is winning luxury’s race to associate itself with the art world, according to a new research report from Bernstein.

Its “quantified assessment” put Kering in second place, and Chanel in third.

Researchers at Berstein took into account the wide swath of tactics Europe’s luxury groups are deploying, from contributing to the restoration of artistic landmarks and sponsoring art museums to high-profile collaborations with famous artists and architects.

“Luxury brands need to associate themselves with global aspirations and ideals in order to ignite desire,” said the report, issued Wednesday. “Doing this in a de-globalizing world is tricky. Hence, the need to find naturally global realms — like the arts and the sports.”

Megabrands are best positioned to capitalize on the associations, given their financial might, rich heritage and capabilities to monetize enhanced branding, according to Bernstein.

The report includes some staggering figures, including an estimated 800-million-euro investment for the Frank Gehry designed Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, and the 25 million euros Tod’s ponied up for the restoration of the Coliseum in Rome.

It also laid bare the additional pricing power art associatons can bring, noting Louis Vuitton’s Nano Speedy bag embellished with Yayoi Kusama artworks commanded a retail price of 1,740 British pounds versus 1,260 pounds for a plain monogram version.

In its analysis, HSBC blurred the lines between Kering and the family vehicles like Artémis behind the spaces housing François Pinault’s vast art collection, including the Tadao Ando-designed Bourse de Commerce in Paris — and Chanel and its Culture Fund partnerships.

Still, the quantification “is less

[TITLE]Black Friday 2025 could be your last chance for cheap PC deals, experts warn:
[TEXT]
This year, Black Friday tech shoppers should heed one important message: Don’t wait, buy now. Why? Because certain components are skyrocketing in price—and it’s expected to get even worse. DRAM prices, for example, have doubled in little more than a month.

AI hyperscalers have snapped up whatever they can buy. As OpenAI and its rivals throw billions of dollars at hardware makers, commodity chip vendors are prioritizing them over consumers. That means fewer components for you. And have you heard

[TITLE]Shein faces European Union scrutiny over child safety and illegal products:
[TEXT]

LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators are stepping up scrutiny of Shein’s safety measures after French authorities found illegal weapons and child-like sex dolls on the fast-fashion company’s website.

The European Commission said Tuesday it was using the 27-nation bloc’s digital rulebook to demand more information from the company on what it’s doing to protect children and to prevent illegal goods from showing up on its online marketplace.

Shein has come under fire in France after officials found the sex dolls with childlike features for sale on its website, and then discovered large quantities of illegal “Class A” weapons including firearms, knives and machetes.

The French government responded by moving to suspend access to the Shein website in France. It also asked the European Commission — the EU’s executive arm — to investigate under the bloc’s Digital Services Act, which requires online platforms to do more to protect users under threat of hefty financial penalties.

The Commission has sent a so-called request for information to Shein because “we now have serious indications that indeed Shein may be posing more systemic risks for our consumers across the entire European Union,” spokesman Thomas Regnier told a daily briefing in Brussels.

The commission wants to know, “first, what are the systems that the company has put in place to prevent these illegal goods from being sold online? Second, what has the company done to prevent minors from accessing them?” Regnier said.

Shein said it has received the request, “and we are working to promptly address it.”

The company, founded in China in 2012 and now based in Singapore, said it maintains “an ongoing and constructive dialogue with EU regulators.”

[TITLE]U.K. Retail Industry Finds Little Cheer in Labour Government’s Latest Budget:
[TEXT]
LONDON — Retail, beauty and luxury organizations reacted with dismay to the 2025 budget delivered by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves on Wednesday and accused the government of failing, once again, to support business.

Although Reeves kept the Labour party’s electoral promise of not raising income tax, she instead offered a package laden with loads of other taxes that will hit middle-earners, homeowners, businesses, employees and tourist-dependent industries such as retail and hospitality.

The government announced plans to freeze income tax thresholds, meaning that more people will be dragged into higher brackets as their salaries increase.

It will also slap extra taxes on employees’ pension contributions, and the funds that employers pay into pension pots, and jack up the National Living Wage for workers, and the minimum wage for teenagers, putting further pressure on employers.

Selfridges is among the larger stores that will continue to be impacted by soaring business taxes in the U.K. David Parry/Courtesy

Reeves is also giving local mayors across the country powers to impose a “tourist tax” on overnight stays. She has largely preserved the stiff taxes that companies pay on their physical stores, hotels and other brick-and-mortar properties, especially in the big cities.

That “business rates” tax has long been a bone of contention here, with companies accusing government of de facto favoring online retailers over physical stores. Under Reeves’ new proposals, some businesses with smaller premises will be eligible for lower tax rates.

Helen Brocklebank, chief executive officer of U.K. luxury lobby Walpole, called the budget “a missed opportunity. Instead of introducing measures that would boost growth and help businesses thrive, the Chancellor chose the opposite.”

She said Britain’s 81 billion pound luxury sector “remains a resilient driver of growth for the U.K. economy and supports 454,000 jobs across the country. Luxury businesses want to invest and grow, but this budget missed its chance to support this agenda. Large luxury retailers now face higher business rates, while hospitality faces a double whammy of business rates and a tourist tax.”

[TITLE]Malaysia’s trade hits record RM2.23 trillion in first 9 months of 2025, says Zafrul:
[TEXT]
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s trade performance reached its highest level on record for the January-September 2025 period, rising 4.4% to RM2.235 trillion despite global uncertainties, says Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.

The Investment, Trade and Industry Minister said Malaysia’s strong 134% trade-to-GDP ratio, among the highest in the world, underscored the country’s deep integration with the global economy and the importance of ensuring that Malaysia remains competitive, resilient and inclusive.

“Trade has always been the heartbeat of the Malaysian economy.

“Our focus remains on strengthening diversification, fully leveraging free trade agreements, accelerating export digitalisation, expanding high-value industries and reinforcing our industrial ecosystem,” he said in a written parliamentary reply on Wednesday (Nov 26).

Tengku Zafrul said Malaysia continued to demonstrate resilience in international trade despite geopolitical tensions such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, US-China rivalry and retaliatory tariff actions by the United States.

In 2024, total trade hit an all-time high of RM2.879 trillion, generating a trade surplus of RM136.88bil - the 27th consecutive year of surplus since 1998.

For the first nine months of 2025, he said exports grew 4.8% to RM1.170 trillion, while imports rose 4.0% to RM1.064 trillion, resulting in a surplus of RM105.65bil.

According to him, growth was driven mainly by electrical and electronics products especially semiconductors, machinery and equipment, palm oil and palm-based products, and processed food.

Tengku Zafrul said the sharp rise in E&E exports was partly due to front-loading activities in early 2025 to mitigate the impact of US tariff measures, alongside a strengthening global tech upcycle.

Malaysia, he said, also recorded higher exports to key markets including the US, Taiwan, Asean, the European Union and Hong Kong.

Trade grew moderately by 6.1% in the second quarter of 2025 to RM749.04bil as global trade policy uncertainties weighed on performance, he said.

He added that exports expanded 3.3% to RM381.67bil, while imports surged 9.0% to RM367.37bil, narrowing the trade surplus by 55.9% year-on-year.

“The temporary dip in surplus was largely due to higher imports of E&E goods, particularly integrated circuits and electrical components, driven by rapid development in domestic data centres and 5G infrastructure,” Tengku Zafrul said.

In contrast, he said Malaysia posted a stronger performance in the third quarter where trade rose 3.7% to RM769.81bil, with exports jumping 6.7% to RM410.06bil and imports inching up 0.4% to RM359.75bil.

Additionally, he said the trade surplus nearly doubled to RM50.31bil, supported by robust growth in E&E, machinery, equipment, optical and scientific products.

Malaysia also recorded encouraging investment inflows, according to Tengku Zafrul.

For the first half of 2025, he said approved investments totalled RM190.3bil, an increase of 18.7% compared with the same period in 2024.

The 3,011 approved projects in manufacturing, services and primary sectors are expected to generate 89,294 jobs, he added.

[TITLE]Why an ASEAN power grid is key to tapping Southeast Asia’s green potential:
[TEXT]
The International Energy Agency reports that energy demand across Southeast Asia rose at twice the global average rate in 2024 and finds that consumption is set to double by 2050. To maintain rising living standards, economies across the region are pushing into higher-value and more energy-intense industries, data centres being one obvious example.

That creates a problem.

The ASEAN nations enjoy vast but as yet largely untapped potential for renewable energy, especially PV solar, and onshore and offshore wind. The IEA puts potential supply at 20 terawatts, roughly 55 times the region’s present generation capacity. And this energy would be cheap. But the increase in overall demand is for now far outpacing new supply from renewables. Until that changes, ASEAN nations remain dependent on rising fossil fuel imports that expose them to price risk, potential supply disruptions, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Asian corporate executives have focused recently on coping with tariffs and trade restrictions, potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical insecurity—rather than energy and power. In the latest EY-Parthenon Global CEO Outlook survey, Asia-Pacific CEOs expressed greater unease than their peers in Europe and the Americas

[TITLE]URBN Reports Record Q3 Sales and Income:
[TEXT]
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle products and services company which operates a portfolio of global consumer brands including the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement, Urban Outfitters and Nuuly brands, today announced record net income of $116.4 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.28 for the three months ended October 31, 2025. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, net income was a record $368.7 million and earnings per diluted share were $4.01.

Total Company net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2025, increased 12.3% to a record $1.53 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 9.6%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 8.0%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by high single-digit positive growth in both digital channel sales and retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 12.5% at Urban Outfitters, 7.6% at Anthropologie and 4.1% at Free People. Subscription segment net sales increased by 48.7% primarily driven by a 42.2% increase in average active subscribers in the current quarter versus the prior year quarter. Wholesale segment net sales increased 7.6% driven by an 8.4% increase in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to an increase in sales to specialty customers.

For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, total Company net sales increased 11.5% to a record $4.36 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 8.0%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 6.1%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by mid single-digit positive growth in both retail store sales and digital channel sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 6.8% at Anthropologie, 6.4% at Urban Outfitters and 4.7% at Free People. Subscription segment net sales increased by 53.4% primarily driven by a 47.3% increase in average active subscribers in the current period versus the prior year period. Wholesale segment net sales increased 15.7% driven by a 16.8% increase in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to an increase in sales to specialty customers.

“We are pleased to report record revenues, profits, and earnings per share for the quarter,” said Richard A. Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. “Trends observed last quarter have remained consistent with broad-based comparable sales growth and robust results in the Retail, Subscription, and Wholesale segments. These results underscore the strength of our diversified business model, which enables us to continue capturing market share, and drive consistent long-term growth,” finished Mr. Hayne.

Net sales by brand and segment for the three and nine-month periods were as follows:

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 31, October 31, 2025 2024 2025 2024 Net sales by brand Anthropologie $ 634,828 $ 587,923 $ 1,811,713 $ 1,683,408 Free People 399,272 365,857 1,167,398 1,049,677 Urban Outfitters 339,848 300,577 946,524 887,550 Nuuly 144,629 97,232 407,915 265,870 Menus & Venues 10,773 10,266 30,056 28,041 Total Company $ 1,529,350 $ 1,361,855 $ 4,363,606 $ 3,914,546 Net sales by segment Retail Segment $ 1,296,454 $ 1,182,557 $ 3,716,233 $ 3,441,698 Subscription Segment 144,629 97,232 407,915 265,870 Wholesale Segment 88,267 82,066 239,458 206,978 Total Company $ 1,529,350 $ 1,361,855 $ 4,363,606 $ 3,914,546

For the three months ended October 31, 2025, the gross profit rate increased by 31 basis points compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024, and gross profit dollars increased 13.3% to $563.3 million from $497.3 million. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the gross profit rate increased by 135 basis points compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024, and gross profit dollars increased 15.7% to $1.62 billion from $1.40 billion. The increase in gross profit rate for both periods was primarily due to improved Retail segment markdowns driven by lower markdowns at Urban Outfitters and Free People and leverage in store occupancy costs due to the increase in comparable Retail segment net sales, partially offset by deleverage in initial merchandise costs. The increase in gross profit dollars for both periods was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company recorded store impairment charges of $2.0 million, and during the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recorded store impairment and lease abandonment charges of $4.6 million.

As of October 31, 2025, total inventory increased by $46.5 million, or 5.9%, compared to total inventory as of October 31, 2024. Total Retail segment inventory increased by 6.3% and comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 7.4%. Wholesale segment inventory was flat. The increase in Retail segment inventory was due to increased sales.

For the three months ended October 31, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $50.4 million, or 13.7%, compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses deleveraged 32 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $121.1 million, or 11.5%, compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, partially offset by leverage in store payroll expenses due to the Retail segment stores net sales growth. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses for both periods was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, as well as increased store payroll expenses to support the Retail segment stores net sales growth.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was 23.6%, compared to 24.2% in the three months ended October 31, 2024. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, was 22.2%, compared to 23.6% in the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, was primarily attributable to the ratio of foreign taxable earnings to global taxable earnings and the release of certain valuation allowances.

Net income for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was a record $116.4 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.28. Net income for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, was a record $368.7 million and earnings per diluted share were $4.01.

On June 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20 million common shares under a share repurchase program. During the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 3.3 million shares for approximately $152 million. During the twelve months ended January 31, 2025, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 1.2 million shares for approximately $52 million. As of October 31, 2025, 14.7 million common shares were remaining under the program.

During the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company opened a total of 41 new retail locations including: 25 Free People stores (including 13 FP Movement stores), 9 Anthropologie stores and 7 Urban Outfitters stores; and closed 6 retail locations including: 4 Urban Outfitters stores and 2 Free People stores.
