Net revenues were $70.2 million, a decrease of 13.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China.

Loss from operations was $112.3 million, or operating margin of -160.0%, compared to loss from operations of $30.9 million, or operating margin of -38.2%, in the year-ago period. Loss from operations included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. Loss from operations also included the following charges recorded in operating expenses: $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses; $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a previously-disclosed contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer; and $0.6 million in costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s campus headquarters building in El Segundo, California (the “Campus Headquarters”).

Net loss was $110.7 million, or $1.44 per common share, compared to net loss of $26.6 million, or $0.41 per common share, in the year-ago period. Net loss in aggregate included $81.2 million in expenses related to non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets, the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China, certain non-routine SG&A expenses, incremental arbitration-related legal expenses, and costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters.

Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $21.6 million, or -30.8% of net revenues, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.

Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, "As we approach the end of 2025, we’ve achieved three important building blocks for our broader transformation efforts. These are significantly reducing our overall leverage in connection with the previously announced exchange of substantially all of our 2027 convertible notes; meaningfully extending our debt maturity; and finally, adding substantial liquidity to our balance sheet.”

Brown continued “Simultaneously, we are taking equally strong measures to accelerate our path to sustainable operations, including pursuing further and sizable cost reductions, gross margin expansion investments and targeted strategic growth initiatives. Though category headwinds and an accompanying softer top-line continue to weigh on and reverberate throughout our current performance, including our Q3 results, we are closing out the year with a much improved balance sheet, important transformation spadework underway, and genuine optimism and excitement regarding our future.”

Third Quarter 2025

Net revenues decreased 13.3% to $70.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $81.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 10.3% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 3.5% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand, reduced points of distribution in the U.S. retail channel, and lower sales of burger products to Quick Service Restaurant (“QSR”) customers in the international foodservice channel. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts, changes in product sales mix and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

U.S. retail channel net revenues decreased 18.4% to $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $35.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.6% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 6.6% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and reduced points of distribution. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

U.S. foodservice channel net revenues decreased 27.3% to $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.5 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 27.1% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 0.3% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and the lapping of sales of chicken products to a U.S. QSR customer in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

International retail channel net revenues decreased 4.6% to $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $16.6 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.5% decrease in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 9.1% increase in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by reduced sales of the Company’s burger, dinner sausage and chicken products. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by higher trade discounts.

International foodservice channel net revenues increased 2.3% to $15.3 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $15.0 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by a 4.4% increase in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in net revenue per pound. The increase in volume of products sold was primarily due to higher sales of chicken products to a QSR customer, partially offset by reduced sales of burger products to certain QSR customers. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by changes in product sales mix, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, lower trade discounts and, to a lesser extent, price increases of certain of our products.

Gross profit in the third quarter of 2025 was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China. Additionally, gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 were negatively impacted by increased cost of goods sold per pound and decreased net revenue per pound. The increase in cost of goods sold per pound primarily reflected higher materials costs and higher inventory provision, partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses, including depreciation, and lower logistics costs.

Operating expenses were $119.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $45.2 million in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. The Company performed a quantitative assessment in accordance with ASC 360 and concluded that an impairment of its long-lived assets existed at September 27, 2025. There were no such impairment charges in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 also included $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses, $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer and $0.6 million in costs related to the partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters. Excluding these items, the decrease in operating expenses compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by reduced marketing expenses and reduced non-production salaries and related expenses.

Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2025 was $112.3 million, compared to $30.9 million in the year-ago period. The increase in loss from operations was driven by the increase in operating expenses and the reduction in gross profit.

The following table summarizes certain charges recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the third quarter of 2025 (unaudited):

(in thousands) Charges recorded in cost of goods sold Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 1,721 Total charges recorded in cost of goods sold $ 1,721 Charges recorded in operating expenses Non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets $ 77,414 Certain non-routine SG&A expenses $ 838 Incremental legal and other fees and expenses related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer $ 662 Costs related to partial lease termination $ 555 Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 36 Total charges recorded in operating expenses $ 79,504 Total $ 81,225

Total other income, net, was $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to total other income, net, of $4.4 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in total other income, net, was primarily due to a reduction in net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and an increase in interest expense related to leases and to the Company’s delayed draw term loan facility, partially offset by benefit from the remeasurement of warrant liability and interest income.

Net loss was $110.7 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $26.6 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per common share was $1.44 in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.41 in the year-ago period. The increase in net loss in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by the increase in loss from operations and the decrease in total other income, net.

Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $21.6 million, or -30.8% of net revenues, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.

[TITLE]Workhorse Group Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
CINCINNATI, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or “the Company”), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

“We continue to make important progress on our product roadmap at Workhorse,” said Company CEO Rick Dauch. “We recently announced the availability of the Utilimaster Aeromaster body for our W56 Class 5/6 step van, designed to enhance the flexibility, durability, efficiency, and safety of the W56 platform. This exciting new offering will enable us to deliver the performance and reliability of our step van in the traditional form factor that fleet operators already know and trust. During the third quarter we completed the sale of 15 trucks, in a combination of both Class 4 and 5 versions.”

Mr. Dauch added: “We are focused on completing our proposed transaction with Motiv to create a leading North American medium-duty electric truck OEM. By building on our complementary strengths, Workhorse and Motiv are positioned to win the medium-duty EV market as the long-term industry trend towards electrification continues. We are confident that this transaction will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the potential upside of the combined company, with a significant ownership stake.”

Demonstrating Real-World Performance and Enhancing Flexibility of the W56: Workhorse continues to demonstrate the reliability and performance of its W56 platform with more than 42 vehicles operating in customer and partner fleets across diverse real-world routes. These vehicles delivered 97% uptime in daily last-mile operations.

During the third quarter, Workhorse advanced its product roadmap to broaden W56 application options. This work included the completion of integration, testing and validation efforts for the industry-standard aluminum Aeromaster walk-in body from Utilimaster. The new configuration expands the proven capabilities of the W56 product line.

Conserving Cash and Improving Liquidity: The Company took additional actions to reduce costs and conserve cash during the third quarter, decreasing operating expenses by $1.2 million year-over-year. Comparing year to date nine-month periods, operating expenses decreased $17.5 million in 2025 compared to 2024.

In connection with its proposed transaction with Motiv, Workhorse has benefitted from funding totaling approximately $25 million from Motiv’s controlling investor, including a $20 million sale leaseback transaction and $5 million secured convertible note financing. At closing of the merger, which is expected in the fourth quarter of this year, all remaining indebtedness and other obligations to Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender, including all warrants currently held by the lender, will be repaid and/or cancelled, with the only remaining secured indebtedness of the combined companies being the $5 million secured convertible note held by an affiliate of Motiv’s controlling investor, which may convert to equity in connection with post-closing financing. The transaction with Motiv also includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s largest investor provide Workhorse with up to $20 million in debt financing at the closing.

Third Quarter Financial Results

Sales, net of returns and allowances, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The decrease in sales of $0.1 million was primarily due to lower sales of approximately $2.3 million related to the sale of fewer trucks in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, offset by an increase of $2.2 million related to the recognition of seven vehicles from deferred revenue.

Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $10.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively. The increase in cost of sales of $3.5 million was primarily a result of an increase in inventory excess and obsolescence reserve of $3.3 million.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $7.8 and $7.7 million, respectively. The increase in SG&A of $0.1 million was primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in consulting and legal expenses due to the proposed Motiv merger, offset by a $2.9 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses, a decrease of $0.2 million in marketing and trade show related expenses, and a decrease of $0.3 million in IT-related expenses.

Research and development (“R&D”) expenses for three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The decrease in R&D expenses of $1.2 million was primarily driven by a $0.3 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount, a $0.5 million decrease in prototype part expenses and a $0.3 million decrease in consulting and professional services expenses.

Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $0.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The difference was primarily driven by higher financing fees related to the 2024 Notes recognized in the prior year period compared to current period.

As of September 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of the notes held by Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender (the “2024 Notes”) totaled $27.1 million and the estimated fair value of the Convertible Note from Motiv’s controlling investor was $5.1 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender converted $19.0 million in principal into Common Stock, and the Company recorded a $1.4 million fair value net loss on conversion.

As of September 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of the warrants held by Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender (the “2024 Warrants”) totaled $10.0 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded a net fair value loss of $6.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to the 2024 Warrants.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized a gain on sale of assets of $13.8 million primarily related to the Sale Leaseback of its Union City, IN Facility.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized a gain of $4.8 million related to deferred revenue upon termination of the Tropos Assembly Services Agreement.

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $12.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25.5 million in restricted cash, net accounts receivable of $1.2 million, other receivables of $1.5 million, net inventory of $30.0 million and accounts payable of $11.2 million.

The proposed transaction with Motiv includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s largest investor provide Workhorse with up to $20 million in debt financing at closing. Approximately $10 million is to be made available after the closing for general corporate purposes pursuant to a revolving credit facility, and $10 million is to be made available after the closing to fund vehicle manufacturing upon the receipt of confirmed purchase orders pursuant to an ABL facility. The terms of this financing have not been finalized.

Third Quarter Financial Overview

“Our proposed transaction with Motiv will provide Workhorse with a simplified capital structure and the near-term liquidity to support our operations through the proposed transaction close,” said Workhorse CFO Bob Ginnan. “We continue to take additional steps to extend our financial runway and efficiently manage our cash flow by reducing operating costs and improving working capital needs. We are confident in our ability to generate additional purchase orders and revenue from our customers while strengthening our financial position, and we look forward to completing the proposed transaction with Motiv.”

Global Cardiac Arrest Treatment Market Overview

Market Driver

1. Rising Incidence of Cardiovascular Diseases

The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, and hypertension is one of the key drivers fueling the global cardiac arrest treatment market. Lifestyle changes, sedentary habits, and rising stress levels have resulted in a surge in cardiac arrest cases across all age groups.

This growing disease burden has prompted healthcare providers to invest in advanced cardiac care technologies and emergency medical equipment.

The demand for life-saving drugs, defibrillators, and cardiac monitoring systems has risen significantly as hospitals focus on improving response times and patient outcomes.

According to leading health organizations, cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, urging both public and private sectors to expand treatment capabilities.

Pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, and research analysts are capitalizing on this trend by developing innovative products and expanding their market presence through strategic partnerships and mergers.

This increasing global awareness of early cardiac intervention and the continuous demand for advanced treatment solutions are expected to drive substantial growth in the cardiac arrest treatment market over the coming years.

2. Technological Advancements in Emergency Response Systems

Rapid innovation in cardiac emergency response systems has transformed the way cardiac arrests are managed globally. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive analytics in cardiac monitoring is significantly improving survival rates and patient recovery outcomes.

AI-powered defibrillators and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) with smart features can now detect abnormal rhythms and guide users with real-time voice prompts.

Portable ECG monitors and wearable devices enable continuous heart rate tracking, helping clinicians predict and prevent cardiac events.

Tele-cardiology platforms are bridging the gap between patients and healthcare providers, especially in remote and underserved regions.

The integration of cloud-based patient data management systems ensures faster decision-making and accurate diagnostics during emergencies.

These technological advancements not only enhance treatment efficiency but also create strong growth potential for manufacturers, investors, and healthcare institutions aiming to modernize their cardiac care offerings.

3. Government and Institutional Initiatives for Cardiac Care Awareness

Government agencies and healthcare organizations across the world are launching initiatives to raise awareness

[TITLE]BioCardia Reports Third Quarter 2025 Business Highlights and Financial Results:
[TEXT]
SUNNYVALE, Calif., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCardia, Inc. [Nasdaq: BCDA], a developer of cellular and cell-derived therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2025 and filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will also hold a conference call at 4:30 PM ET today in which it will discuss business highlights. Following management’s formal remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.

“This quarter’s $6 million financing is actively supporting approvability discussions of CardiAMP cell therapy for patients suffering from heart failure, submission for approval of our Helix Transendocardial Delivery Catheter via DeNovo 510(k) to enable the field of local biologic therapy to the heart, and our actively enrolling in our CardiAMP HF II phase 3 confirmatory trial,” said BioCardia CEO Peter Altman, Ph.D. “These next two quarters promise to be truly transformative for our business because of these and other activities underway.”

Recent Business Highlights

CardiAMP® autologous cell therapy in ischemic heart failure of reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), BCDA-01

Our CardiAMP cell therapy for HFrEF is supported by three completed clinical trials with consistent results supporting safety and patient benefit, with a fourth active trial enrolling. Benefits are seen across all patients enrolled in our completed trials, with the strongest signals in our two randomized controlled double-blind trials, TACHFT and CardiAMP HF, in patients having elevated biomarkers of heart stress. In this patient population, both trials demonstrated statistical significance in the primary composite outcome used in our actively enrolling CardiAMP HF II trial.

In September, we had a positive preliminary clinical consultation with Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) on the CardiAMP Heart Failure Trial results. We have responded to PMDA questions from this meeting and anticipate our next consultation in the coming months, the outcome of which could enable us to submit for approval of the CardiAMP system for market entry in Japan.

This quarter, FDA has received and accepted our annual report. We anticipate requesting a meeting on the approvability of the FDA Designated Breakthrough CardiAMP System in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Our confirmatory CardiAMP HF II phase 3 trial is underway in the United States, focusing on patients with elevated biomarkers of heart stress. The study has a primary composite endpoint of all cause heart death, non-fatal major adverse cardia and cerebral vascular events (MACCE), and quality of life which would have been met in both CardiAMP HF and in TACHFT. Four world class centers are actively enrolling patients.

CardiAMP® autologous cell therapy in chronic myocardial ischemia with refractory angina, BCDA-02

In September, we announced top line primary outcomes from the open-label roll-in cohort of the CardiAMP Cell Therapy in Chronic Myocardial Ischemia Trial. Results showed that patients experienced increased exercise tolerance of an average of 80 seconds and an average of 82% reduction in angina episodes at the six-month primary endpoint when compared to measurements prior to cell therapy treatment. Sixty percent of the patients showed substantial improvements in both measures. The minimally invasive therapy was well tolerated with no treatment emergent major adverse cardiac events. All patients were on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and responded positively to the autologous cell therapy.

CardiALLO™ allogeneic cell therapy in Ischemic Heart Failure, BCDA-03

The Investigational New Drug application (IND) for our Phase 1/2 includes a 3+3 roll-in dose escalation up to a dose of 200 million cells followed by a randomized double-blind controlled study of 30 patients. The low dose cohort of 20 million cells has been completed and there have been no treatment-emergent adverse events, arrhythmias, rejection, or allergic responses. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended that the study proceed as designed based on the 30-day data safety assessment from this cohort. This study is the first study to focus prospectively on the ischemic etiology heart failure patients with active inflammation. Steps are being taken to secure nondilutive funding to advance this effort.

Biotherapeutic Delivery

The Helix ™ transendocardial biotherapeutic delivery system is a therapeutic-enabling platform for minimally invasive targeted delivery of biologic agents to the heart and underlies BCDA-01, 02, and 03 programs. We have completed a comprehensive update to our Master File for this delivery device which supports our therapeutic programs and those of our therapeutic partners. This effort prepares the way for the submission for approval of the Helix transendocardial delivery catheter via DeNovo 510(k) in the fourth quarter of 2025 based on the performance of the Helix system in clinical trials.

Heart3D™ fusion imaging has performed well in preclinical settings using both MRI and CT imaging. Recent procedures with machine learning annotated Heart3D integrated with twenty orthogonal real time two dimensional X-ray imaging views, required only 30 minutes while performing ten intramyocardial deliveries as specified in each of our clinical programs.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:

In September, BioCardia closed a $6.0 million financing, with net proceeds totaling $5.2 million.

Research and development expenses increased to $936,000 for the three months ended September 2025 from $931,000 in the three months ended September 2024, and increased to $3.8 million in the nine months ended September 2025 from $3.0 million for the nine months ended June 2024, primarily due to closeout activities in the CardiAMP HF Trial and the beginning of enrollment in the CardiAMP HF II Trial.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $0.6 million in the three months ended September 2025 from $0.8 million for the three months ended September 2024, primarily due to lower executive compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $2.4 million in the nine months ended September 2025 from $2.8 million in the nine months ended September 2024, primarily due to lower professional service fees coupled with lower share-based compensation expense.

Our net loss decreased to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 2025, compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended September 2024, primarily due to lower compensation expense, including share-based compensation. Our net loss increased to $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 2025, compared to $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 2024 primarily due to the increased expenses associated with closeout activities in the CardiAMP HF Trial and the beginning of enrollment in the CardiAMP HF II Trial.

Net cash used in operations for the three months ended September 2025 decreased to $1.7 million, as compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 2024. Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 2025 decreased to $4.9 million, as compared to $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 2024.

Our cash balance on September 30, 2025, was $5.3 million, providing runway into the second quarter 2026 exclusive of additional capital.

[TITLE]Duos Technologies Reports 112% Increase in Quarterly Revenue:
[TEXT]
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Duos Technologies Group, Inc. (“Duos” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: DUOT), a provider of adaptive, versatile and streamlined Edge Data Center (“EDC”) solutions and operational services for the deployment of "behind the meter” electrical power, reported financial results for the third quarter (“Q3 2025”) ended September 30, 2025.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

It should be noted that the following Financial Results represent the consolidation of the Company with its subsidiaries Duos Technologies, Duos Edge AI, Inc., and Duos Energy Corporation (“Duos Energy”).

Total revenues for Q3 2025 increased 112% to $6.9 million compared to $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 (“Q3 2024”). Total revenue for Q3 2025 represents an aggregate of approximately $263,000 of technology systems revenue and approximately $6,600,000 in recurring services and consulting and hosting revenue. The significant revenue increase in the third quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, was primarily driven by Duos Energy executing against the Asset Management Agreement ("AMA") with New APR that was signed on December 31, 2024. Under the AMA, Duos Energy oversees the deployment and operations of a fleet of mobile gas turbines and related balance-of-plant inventory, providing management, sales, and operational support services to New APR. Other revenue sources included the start of hosting revenues for its edge data centers and limited progress of two Railcar Inspection Portals (“RIP®”) currently being developed for Amtrak.

Cost of revenues for Q3 2025 increased 88% to $4.36 million compared to $2.32 million for Q3 2024. The significant increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to supporting the AMA with New APR, where Duos Energy oversees the deployment and operations of a fleet of mobile gas turbines and related balance-of-plant inventory, providing management, sales, and operational support services to New APR. The cost of revenues on technology systems decreased compared to the equivalent period in 2024. This reduction is primarily driven by our ability in Q3 2025 to reallocate certain fixed operating and servicing costs for technology systems to support the AMA, an allocation we could not make in the comparative period because the agreement was not yet in effect. It also reflects the limited manufacturing progress ahead of field installation of our two high-speed RIP®s while we await customer readiness for site deployment.

Gross margin for Q3 2025 increased 174% to $2.5 million compared to $0.9 million for Q3 2024. Gross margin improved primarily due to Duos Energy’s performance of the AMA with New APR. This also includes $904,125 in revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2025, related to the Company's 5% non-voting equity interest in the ultimate parent of New APR, which carries no associated costs and therefore contributes at a 100% margin. These revenues and the associated margin contribution were not present in the prior year period.

Operating expenses for Q3 2025 increased 28% to $3.6 million compared to $2.8 million for Q3 2024. The increase in expenses is largely attributed to non-cash stock-based compensation charged for restricted stock granted to the executive team on January 1, 2025, under new employment agreements with a three-year cliff vesting schedule. Overall, sales and marketing costs declined as resources were allocated to costs of service and consulting revenues in support of the AMA with New APR. Additionally, research and development expenses fell by 71% owing to scaled-back testing of prospective technologies. The Company continues to focus on stabilizing operating expenses, including evaluating reductions in some areas, while continuing to meet the increased requirements of our new businesses.

Net operating loss for Q3 2025 totaled $1.1 million compared to net operating loss of $1.9 million for Q3 2024. The decrease in loss from operations was primarily the result of increased revenues during the quarter, driven by revenue generated by Duos Energy through the AMA with New APR, offset slightly by non-cash stock-based compensation charged for restricted stock that was not in the comparative period.

Net loss for Q3 2025 totaled $1.04 million compared to net loss of $1.4 million for Q3 2024. The 26% decrease in net loss was mostly attributed to the non-cash stock-based compensation charged for restricted stock and one-time compensation expenses that were not in the comparative period, offset by an increase in revenues generated by Duos Energy through the AMA with New APR as described above. Net loss per common share was $0.06 and $0.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2025 totaled $33.20 million compared to $6.27 million at December 31, 2024. In addition, the Company had over $3.00 million in receivables and contract assets for a total of approximately $36.20 million in cash and expected short-term liquidity.

Nine Month 2025 Financial Results

Total revenue increased 202% to $17.6 million from $5.8 million in the same period last year. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2025 represents an aggregate of approximately $370,000 of technology systems revenue and approximately $17.2 million in recurring services and consulting revenue. The significant revenue increase in the period, compared to the same period last year, was primarily driven by Duos Energy executing against the AMA with New APR originally signed on December 31, 2024. The decrease in technology systems’ revenues was primarily attributed to delays outside of the Company’s control with deployment of our two high-speed Railcar Inspection Portals. Although these systems remain largely ready for deployment, customer delays at the deployment site continue to prevent the Company from entering the installation phase although this is now expected to be mitigated in the last quarter of 2025. In spite of the timing delays that continue to impact the quarterly results, management remains confident in the long-term potential of the RIP® product.

Cost of revenues increased 143% to $12.2 million from $5.0 million in the same period last year. The significant increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to supporting the AMA with New APR, where Duos Energy oversees the deployment and operations of a fleet of mobile gas turbines and related balance-of-plant inventory, providing management, sales, and operational support services to New APR. The cost of revenues on technology systems decreased compared to the equivalent period in 2024. This reduction is primarily driven by our ability in the period to reallocate certain fixed operating and servicing costs for technology systems to support the AMA, an allocation we could not make in the comparative period because the agreement was not yet in effect. It also reflects the ramp-down of manufacturing ahead of field installation of our two high-speed RIP®s, which have continued to temporarily slow project activity and further reduce cost of revenues while we await customer readiness for site deployment.

Gross margin increased 569% to $5.4 million from $800,00 in the same period last year. Gross margin improved primarily due to Duos Energy’s performance of the AMA with New APR. This includes $2,712,375 in revenue recognized during the period, related to the Company's 5% non-voting equity interest in the ultimate parent of New APR, which carried no associated costs and therefore contributed at a 100% margin. These revenues and the associated margin contribution were not present in the prior year period.

Operating expenses increased 34% to $11.7 million from $8.7 million in the same period last year. The Company experienced a significant increase in overall operating expenses compared to the same period in 2024. Sales and marketing costs declined as resources were allocated to costs of service and consulting revenues in support of the AMA with New APR. Additionally, research and development expenses fell by 28% owing to scaled-back testing of prospective technologies. General and administration costs increased 71%, largely due to non-cash stock-based compensation charged for restricted stock granted to the executive team on January 1, 2025, under new employment agreements with a three-year cliff vesting schedule as well as one time compensation costs related to the closing of the AMA and 5% ownership agreements as previously described. Additionally, there were general and administration costs that were allocated to cost of service and consulting revenues in support of the AMA with New APR. Overall, the Company continues to focus on stabilizing operating expenses while meeting the increased needs of our customers.

Net operating loss totaled $6.35 million compared to net operating loss of $7.90 million in the same period last year. The decrease in loss from operations was primarily the result of increased revenues during the period, driven by revenue generated by Duos Energy through the AMA with New APR.

Net loss totaled $6.64 million compared to a net loss of $7.36 million in the same period last year. The 10% decrease in net loss was mostly attributed to the increase in revenues generated by Duos Energy through the AMA with New APR as described above. Net loss per common share was $0.49 and $0.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.

Financial Outlook

At the end of the third quarter, the Company’s contracts in backlog represented approximately $25.8 million in revenue, of which approximately $12.4 million is expected to be recognized in the remainder of calendar 2025 including an estimated $9.5 million of contracted backlog and $3 million in expected near-term awards, renewals and anticipated additional business. The remaining contract backlog consists of multi-year service and software agreements, along with project revenues extending beyond 2025, related to Duos Technologies, Duos Edge AI, and Duos Energy.

Based on these committed contracts and near-term pending orders that are already performing or scheduled to be executed throughout the course of 2025, the Company is reiterating its previously stated revenue expectations for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. The Company expects total revenue for 2025 to range between $28 million and $30 million, representing an increase of 285% to 312% from 2024. Duos expects this improvement in operating results to be reflected over the course of the full year in 2025.

Management Commentary

“I am very pleased with the continuous improvement in Duos’ results this year,” said Chuck Ferry, Duos CEO. “Having embarked on the strategic shift to becoming a data center provider for the rapidly growing market for edge computing, we are well positioned to capture market share for products and services related to this important industry. I also welcome our new senior management and latest addition to our Board to assist in realizing the potential in 2026 and beyond.”

Overview

Solid Group Q3 performance with AMPs +9% and revenue +17% year-over-year reflecting the benefit of Snai and Betnacional acquisitions ("M&A"), combined with excellent organic iGaming growth which offset the impact of customer-friendly sports results

US: Revenue +9% year-over-year led by strong, product-driven iGaming revenue growth of 44% Sportsbook AMP growth accelerated to 5% (Q2: -4%). Sportsbook revenue was -5% year-over-year due to the temporary impacts of sports results, and very high levels of uneconomic generosity from sportsbook competitors at NFL season start, leading to Q3 Adjusted EBITDA of $51m, -12% year-over-year In response, increased FanDuel investment during Q4 has been effective, with year-over-year handle growth +10% Q4 to date, and the NBA season off to a strong start FanDuel Predicts, a new prediction market product which will include sports in states without access to regulated sports betting, to launch in December. Capitalizing on FanDuel's strong brand presence and CME Group's exchange capabilities, with strategic investment to expand the FanDuel customer ecosystem

International: Revenue +21% and adjusted EBITDA of $505m, +10% year-over-year including the benefit of M&A Organic iGaming revenue +10%, with strong SEA iGaming growth offsetting the impact of previously announced regulatory changes in India 3 Organic Sportsbook revenue -6% due to the impacts of a strong European Football Championships ("Euros") and bookmaker friendly results in the prior year

Group Q3 adjusted EBITDA grew 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin declined 130bps, driven by the factors detailed above. This, combined with the benefit of non-controlling interest credits, contributed to adjusted earnings per share +29% to $1.64

Group Q3 net loss of $789m was $675m higher year-over-year due to the non-cash impairment charge of $556m triggered by Indian regulation changes 3 , and the previously communicated $205m payment to Boyd to revise US market access terms 4 ("Boyd payment"). As a result, net loss margin and loss per share were 20.8% and $3.91 respectively

, and the previously communicated $205m payment to Boyd to revise US market access terms ("Boyd payment"). As a result, net loss margin and loss per share were 20.8% and $3.91 respectively Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in Q3 declined by 28% and 78% respectively, due to the Boyd payment

Updated full year 2025 guidance

Q4 has started well on an underlying basis. In the US, FanDuel's increased customer acquisition and retention investment in Q4 is proving effective with continued player momentum and year-over-year handle growth stepping up to 10% quarter to date with the NBA season off to a strong start. Sports results, however, have been customer friendly across the Group with an adjusted EBITDA impact of approximately $170m from October 1, through November 9, 20256.

2025 outlook5 is therefore primarily updated to include the impact of: (i) Q3 performance, (ii) Q4 sports results6, (iii) Q4 sportsbook investment, (iv) FanDuel Predicts investment7, (v) tax costs associated with the Illinois wager fee which we are now treating as taxable, and (vi) Indian regulatory change

Group revenue is now expected to be $16.69bn with adjusted EBITDA of $2.915bn at the midpoint. This reflects a reduction from previous guidance of $570m and $380m in revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations respectively, with updated guidance now representing 19% and 24% year-over-year growth.

Peter Jackson, CEO, commented:

"Flutter delivered a solid third quarter, with continued momentum in both our US and International businesses. We are the clear number one operator in the US, and we will continue to build on that position to drive future profitability. Our strategic investments, including the launch of FanDuel Predicts and recent International acquisitions, position us exceptionally well to capture new opportunities and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Our diversified portfolio and disciplined approach give me great confidence in our ability to lead the industry and increase long-term value for shareholders.”

To our shareholders

Flutter delivered a solid Q3 performance with AMP growth of 9%, revenue increasing 17% and adjusted EBITDA 6% ahead year-over-year. These results reflect the positive impact of our recent Snai and Betnacional acquisitions, as well as excellent organic iGaming growth which helped offset customer-friendly sports results. The Group reported a net loss of $789m for the quarter compared to $114m in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of a non-cash impairment charge relating to regulatory changes in India and the previously communicated $205m payment to Boyd for improved US market access terms.

I am really pleased with the strong positioning of Flutter's core business as we continue to execute in the final quarter of the year. Before sharing more detail on our Q3 performance and outlook, I first want to present how we are strategically positioning FanDuel to capture the emerging prediction markets opportunity. This area has been a source of significant industry discussion over recent months and I am very excited to announce our expansion into the market with the launch of “FanDuel Predicts”, a new FanDuel branded app which we expect to launch in December, through our joint venture with the CME Group.

FanDuel Predicts unlocks an immediate growth opportunity by allowing us to offer a compelling sports product to the vast majority of the US adult population in states that do not currently have access to sports betting. This represents a significant incremental addressable market for FanDuel in addition to our existing sportsbook and iGaming business. We believe this new sports opportunity lies solely in these states, as prediction markets are having a negligible impact in the states where FanDuel sportsbook is already available to customers. FanDuel Predicts will also accelerate acquisition of customers into the FanDuel ecosystem ahead of the state regulation of sports betting. Furthermore, the strength of our world-class pricing and risk management capabilities present potential market-making opportunities which we continue to assess.

We are exceptionally well positioned to harness this growth opportunity. We have a powerful combination of assets enabled through our strategic partnership with CME Group, who have a long track record of operating the world's leading derivatives marketplace, together with FanDuel's nationwide brand presence and sports betting expertise, which has already successfully delivered a position as the clear leader in sports betting. Our extensive experience operating the Betfair Exchange within the Flutter Group also equips us with a deep understanding of this space.

Our launch strategy has been developed in close consultation with state regulators and tribal authorities, resulting in a tailored, state-specific approach that enables us to launch in those states where no local regulation exists. At launch, FanDuel Predicts will offer sports markets in states without a current sports betting regulatory framework. Sports markets will also be restricted to non-tribal lands. This means that a significant proportion of the US population will soon have access to a brand new FanDuel sports product, operating with the same high standards regarding customer protection, know your customer, and anti-money laundering as all our FanDuel products. A range of financial and cultural markets will also be offered across virtually all states. In our existing sportsbook and iGaming states our primary focus will continue to be the state-regulated market and strengthening our leadership position in our core sports betting and iGaming businesses.

The opportunity to extend the FanDuel footprint into new states is significant and our aspiration is to be the clear market leader. Our investment will therefore be meaningful, while maintaining a disciplined approach, a strategy which has served us so well since the inception of sports betting in the US. At this early stage, we anticipate incremental EBITDA cost of $40-$50m in Q4 2025 and $200m-$300m in 2026 with the majority arising in H27. In line with our proven investment strategy on sportsbook to date, we will closely monitor returns with a priority on building value for the future, while also maintaining the flexibility to accelerate investment where performance warrants. We believe this will position FanDuel to deliver future growth and harness the long-term opportunities for our business.

In conclusion, we believe prediction markets present a very significant incremental growth opportunity for FanDuel, and that their evolution will also accelerate the path to state-regulated sports betting and iGaming. In the long-term, we firmly believe that state-regulated sports betting and iGaming remains the most valuable long-term opportunity in the US. The importance of having the best quality sports betting product, combined with the ability to price increasingly complex sports products accurately, cannot be overstated. These are both areas where Flutter and FanDuel excel. As demonstrated by international precedent, long-term success in the US gaming sector will be achieved by those operators with scale positions and the highest quality sports betting product.

US update

Q3 AMP growth in the US was encouraging at 8% year-over-year, with continued strong iGaming AMP growth of 30%, and sportsbook AMP growth of 5% representing an acceleration in year-over-year growth compared to Q2.

FanDuel's revenue performance was underpinned by another very strong iGaming quarter with revenue growth of 44% delivering a GGR market share of 27% in Q3. Player frequency continued to grow with over 500 new slots titles added during the quarter, as access to the proprietary Flutter gaming platform unlocked a faster pace of content delivery. Exclusive content also continued to resonate strongly and drive increased customer engagement, with new Wonka and Samurai titles added in Q3 as well as the latest installment of our Huff and Puff series. Huff 'N Lots of Puff was our most successful game launch to date, setting all-time highs in actives and GGR on launch. Our consistent delivery of innovative and engaging iGaming product features ensures we are well positioned to capitalize on the long-term opportunity. With population penetration still well below our long-term expectations, we believe a very long runway for future growth remains in existing states, before factoring in any future state legalization.

Turning to sportsbook, and while September and October have been impacted by customer-friendly NFL sports results, it is still early in the season. We have complete conviction in our pricing and we remain confident that this short-term variability of outcomes will revert to expected levels over time. Higher levels of parlay and SGP penetration ultimately drive higher structural revenue margin, and we continue to make good progress toward our longer-term 16% structural hold expectation.

The start of the NFL season consistently sees heightened levels of competition in the market and Q3 this year was even more pronounced than in previous years. September was characterized by very high levels of competitor customer generosity, including a range of unsustainable, uneconomic customer offers. These competitive dynamics resulted in lower than anticipated FanDuel NFL handle growth and Same Game Parlay (SGP) penetration in the opening weeks of the season. This impact was transitory in nature, with trends significantly improved by the start of the fourth quarter as FanDuel's disciplined investment approach proved effective. Despite this impact in September, FanDuel's structural advantages ensured we maintained a strong sportsbook market share, with a 47% net gaming revenue (NGR) share of the online sports betting market in September8.

While market competitive intensity has moderated from the NFL season start, it still remains at elevated levels. FanDuel's scale as the #1 operator in the US (Q3 GGR share: 38%, Q3 NGR share: 41%), has subsequently enabled us to take action to strengthen our market leadership. We responded in a strong but disciplined way at the start of Q4, with increased investment in customer acquisition and retention, and we have been very pleased with the momentum that this has driven.

During the quarter we believe the impact from prediction market activity on our business was negligible, as in regulated states customers continue to prefer the richer experience provided by regulated sportsbooks. Based on our analysis, we believe the vast majority of this activity is taking place in states without sportsbook regulation. We therefore do not see sports prediction markets as a meaningful challenge in states where regulated sportsbooks like FanDuel are available.

From a product perspective, the NFL season launch in September was an important milestone for innovation. FanDuel Futures Day showcased a new, first-to-market NFL feature enabling customers to create season long SGPs, driving high levels of parlay engagement. Live betting represents over half of handle, with further enhancements to our live SGP proposition including expanded NFL drive offerings. This helped deliver an NFL parlay penetration increase of 300 bps in the season to date. Our Your Way feature benefited from the addition of SGP+ capabilities and while this currently remains a separate sportsbook experience, the underlying next-generation pricing technology now powers our entire NFL sportsbook pricing and is driving a number of product improvements. This included an increased range of cashout markets helping drive a 20% increase in cashout activity.

We have been really pleased with our NBA performance since the season start in late October. Customer engagement, handle and SGP penetration are all tracking strongly in the early weeks of the season, giving us confidence that growth this season is shaping up to be stronger than last year. We are excited to see what our new strategic NBA partnership with Amazon Prime can unlock including merchandising integrations, product integrations and in-game virtual signage.

Finally, I wanted to share my thoughts on recent concerns around sports integrity. This is hugely important to us and something we take very seriously across the Group. At FanDuel, we use advanced technology and real-time monitoring to identify suspicious activity and work closely with leagues, data monitoring groups, and law enforcement to alert them to any suspicious activity. This highlights the important role the regulated industry plays in assuring the integrity of these great sports. We will continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to ensure that effective frameworks are in place to protect sports integrity, the players and our customers.

International update

The International division delivered 21% year-over-year revenue growth, with the Snai and Betnacional acquisitions contributing 18 percentage points of the increase. Organic growth was impacted by the cessation of real-money gaming in India and a strong prior-year sportsbook performance, which benefited from the Euros and more favorable sports results. iGaming continued to drive organic growth in Q3, with exceptional growth in Turkey and positive momentum in SisaI's Italian online business.

Our focus on the Flutter Edge is delivering innovation across our International business. In Southern Europe and Africa (SEA), we launched MyCombo on Sisal, the only full SGP product available in the Italian market, in time for the start of the Italian soccer season. Customer engagement has been strong with half of customers placing a MyCombo bet during the first seven rounds of the season.

The September integration of Flutter Studios into the SEA Italian online platform has enabled in-house content to be offered to our Italian customers, with a strong pipeline of future content. In July, we migrated PokerStars Italian customers to our SEA platform, a key milestone in the PokerStars transformation which will deliver material savings in 2027 after completion of the final migration from the existing PokerStars technology stack.

The Snai integration has been progressing well; we have enhanced the iGaming proposition, optimized retail gaming machines and commission structures, and increased customer acquisition volumes by deploying Sisal's proven retail signup program. The migration of Snai customers to the SEA online platform remains on track for H1 2026, providing increased confidence in our Snai synergy targets.

In the UK and Ireland (UKI), the successful migration of Sky Bet onto our shared Flutter UKI platform has enabled delivery of new product and improvements for our Sky Bet customers. This included the launch of our highly popular SuperSub offering and the new Squad Bet proposition, powered by our next-generation pricing capability. Continued roll out of premium content has also helped drive positive iGaming momentum.

There has been much speculation around potential gaming tax increases in the upcoming UK budget. We remain engaged with policymakers and expect decisions will be based on economic merit, taking into account the industry's substantial contribution to UK tax revenues and employment. Significant increases to the tax rates would threaten jobs and investment across the UK market, as well as driving more customers to unregulated operators on the black market - where there are no player protections and regulatory oversight. We continue to engage with policymakers and await the outcome in the Budget later this month, however, should taxes increase, Flutter's growing scale and market leading position will help to mitigate the impact, and we would likely benefit from the consolidation of share among sub-scale operators over time.

Brazil is an exciting growth opportunity for Flutter and we retain a strong conviction that scale operators with the best products will win the largest share of the market. This quarter, our expanding portfolio of games and more sophisticated generosity delivered record iGaming revenues. On sportsbook we will continue to integrate Flutter's in-house pricing capabilities and generosity functionality to materially elevate the overall customer proposition ahead of the World Cup next year.

The good progress we are making across the numerous transformation projects both detailed above and in previous quarters, is helping us deliver further scale benefits and positions us to deliver enhanced experiences for our customers. Our cost efficiency drivers go beyond the $300m target we set out our Investor Day last year, with the redesign of our UKI organizational structure a good example of an incremental initiative.

Outside of performance during the quarter, the enactment of the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025 forced Junglee and all other operators to immediately cease real-money operations. We are extremely disappointed with the sudden and unexpected change to the regulatory landscape in India. Flutter has invested significantly in India over the last number of years, responsibly delivering innovative skill-based games to Indian customers. Junglee will now only offer free-to-play gaming content as we assess our medium-term options in that market.

Final thoughts and outlook

[TITLE]Cold Chain Logistics Market Set to Reach Valuation of US$ 1,455.8 Billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global cold chain logistics market was valued at US$ 371.4 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 1455.8 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 16.39% over the forecast period of 2025–2033.

The biopharmaceutical sector is a primary engine of growth for temperature-controlled logistics. In 2024, the U.S. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 50 new molecular entities. Of these approvals, 18 were new biologic entities requiring specialized handling and transport. A significant 81% of these new biologics were antibody-based drugs, products that frequently depend on an uninterrupted cold chain. Furthermore, the FDA designated 22 of the new drugs approved in 2024 as "first-in-class," many with complex temperature stability requirements that challenge existing supply chains. These developments are directly impacting the global cold chain logistics market.

Consequently, the air freight sector reflects this specialized demand. Worldwide air transport of temperature-controlled pharmaceutical products grew by a tonnage of 2% in 2024. Regional data underscores this trend, with the Middle East & South Asia recording an 8% increase in outbound pharma air cargo weight in 2024. Similarly, outbound volumes from North America rose by 4% in 2024 and accelerated significantly in the first three months of 2025, with outbound tonnage increasing 16% year-over-year. Specialized hubs are also seeing growth; Vienna Airport's Pharma Handling Center processed 4,238 tons of these sensitive goods in 2024 alone.

Key Findings in Cold Chain Logistics Market

Development of sustainable and energy-efficient cold chain packaging solutions. Top Challenges Maintaining temperature integrity during complex last-mile delivery processes.

Addressing the environmental impact of energy-intensive refrigeration systems.

Navigating fragmented and inconsistent infrastructure in emerging global markets.

Online Grocery Adoption Redefines Last-Mile Consumer Expectations in cold Chain Logistics Market

The digital shift in consumer shopping habits is a monumental force. By mid-2025, an estimated 81 million U.S. households are expected to buy their groceries online, creating massive last-mile delivery needs. The number of individual Americans shopping for groceries online is projected to climb from 138.3 million in 2024 to 148.4 million in 2025. This sustained growth is a cornerstone of the modern cold chain logistics market. Consistent high demand is now the new normal for temperature-controlled delivery services.

Sales figures provide a stark illustration of this new reality. U.S. online grocery sales reached an unprecedented peak of US$ 12.5 billion in the single month of September 2025. Impressively, this figure represents a US$ 3 billion increase over September 2024 sales. The market's momentum is undeniable, with sales hitting US$ 10 billion in July 2025 and US$ 9.7 billion in March 2025. Moreover, March 2025 marked the eighth consecutive month where sales exceeded US$ 9.5 billion, while in November 2024, 77.8 million U.S. households participated in online grocery shopping.

Global Quick Commerce Creates New Hyper-Localized Logistics Challenges

The rise of quick commerce places immense pressure on hyper-localized cold chains but favoring the cold chain logistics market growth. Globally, an estimated 1.4 billion consumers are using online grocery services monthly in 2024, setting a broad stage for rapid delivery models. Within this group, a substantial 600 million people worldwide will use quick commerce services for essentials in 2024. The growth trajectory for this sub-sector is steep, with the number of global quick commerce users expected to reach 900 million by 2029.

In the United States, the quick commerce user base is already significant and growing. In 2024, 56.1 million people in the U.S. are using these rapid delivery services. The expansion of this model, exemplified by Amazon's launch of 15-minute deliveries in India in December 2024, intensifies the need for distributed micro-fulfillment centers with sophisticated refrigeration. The cold chain logistics market must adapt to service these on-demand expectations for perishable goods, a trend validated by a 25% rise in such deliveries in India during the 2024 Diwali season compared to 2023.

Critical Cold Storage Infrastructure Expands Amidst Tightening Vacancy Rates

The demand is fueling a wave of new construction in the cold storage sector. In the U.S., five speculative cold storage (SCS) projects were completed in 2024, adding 1.1 million square feet of crucial space. The pipeline remains robust across the cold chain logistics market, with another 2.2 million square feet of speculative cold storage space expected to be completed in the U.S. during 2025. As of early 2024, 15 specialized spec cold buildings were under construction or

[TITLE]Beyond Meat® Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) (“Beyond Meat” or “the Company”), a leader in plant-based meat, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 27, 2025.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights1

Net revenues were $70.2 million, a decrease of 13.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China.

Loss from operations was $112.3 million, or operating margin of -160.0%, compared to loss from operations of $30.9 million, or operating margin of -38.2%, in the year-ago period. Loss from operations included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. Loss from operations also included the following charges recorded in operating expenses: $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses; $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a previously-disclosed contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer; and $0.6 million in costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s campus headquarters building in El Segundo, California (the “Campus Headquarters”).

Net loss was $110.7 million, or $1.44 per common share, compared to net loss of $26.6 million, or $0.41 per common share, in the year-ago period. Net loss in aggregate included $81.2 million in expenses related to non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets, the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China, certain non-routine SG&A expenses, incremental arbitration-related legal expenses, and costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters.

Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, "As we approach the end of 2025, we’ve achieved three important building blocks for our broader transformation efforts. These are significantly reducing our overall leverage in connection with the previously announced exchange of substantially all of our 2027 convertible notes; meaningfully extending our debt maturity; and finally, adding substantial liquidity to our balance sheet.”

Brown continued “Simultaneously, we are taking equally strong measures to accelerate our path to sustainable operations, including pursuing further and sizable cost reductions, gross margin expansion investments and targeted strategic growth initiatives. Though category headwinds and an accompanying softer top-line continue to weigh on and reverberate throughout our current performance, including our Q3 results, we are closing out the year with a much improved balance sheet, important transformation spadework underway, and genuine optimism and excitement regarding our future.”

Third Quarter 2025

Net revenues decreased 13.3% to $70.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $81.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 10.3% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 3.5% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand, reduced points of distribution in the U.S. retail channel, and lower sales of burger products to Quick Service Restaurant (“QSR”) customers in the international foodservice channel. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts, changes in product sales mix and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

U.S. retail channel net revenues decreased 18.4% to $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $35.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.6% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 6.6% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and reduced points of distribution. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

U.S. foodservice channel net revenues decreased 27.3% to $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.5 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 27.1% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 0.3% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and the lapping of sales of chicken products to a U.S. QSR customer in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

International retail channel net revenues decreased 4.6% to $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $16.6 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.5% decrease in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 9.1% increase in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by reduced sales of the Company’s burger, dinner sausage and chicken products. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by higher trade discounts.

International foodservice channel net revenues increased 2.3% to $15.3 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $15.0 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by a 4.4% increase in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in net revenue per pound. The increase in volume of products sold was primarily due to higher sales of chicken products to a QSR customer, partially offset by reduced sales of burger products to certain QSR customers. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by changes in product sales mix, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, lower trade discounts and, to a lesser extent, price increases of certain of our products.

Gross profit in the third quarter of 2025 was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China. Additionally, gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 were negatively impacted by increased cost of goods sold per pound and decreased net revenue per pound. The increase in cost of goods sold per pound primarily reflected higher materials costs and higher inventory provision, partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses, including depreciation, and lower logistics costs.

Operating expenses were $119.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $45.2 million in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. The Company performed a quantitative assessment in accordance with ASC 360 and concluded that an impairment of its long-lived assets existed at September 27, 2025. There were no such impairment charges in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 also included $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses, $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer and $0.6 million in costs related to the partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters. Excluding these items, the decrease in operating expenses compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by reduced marketing expenses and reduced non-production salaries and related expenses.

Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2025 was $112.3 million, compared to $30.9 million in the year-ago period. The increase in loss from operations was driven by the increase in operating expenses and the reduction in gross profit.

(in thousands) Charges recorded in cost of goods sold Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 1,721 Total charges recorded in cost of goods sold $ 1,721 Charges recorded in operating expenses Non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets $ 77,414 Certain non-routine SG&A expenses $ 838 Incremental legal and other fees and expenses related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer $ 662 Costs related to partial lease termination $ 555 Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 36 Total charges recorded in operating expenses $ 79,504 Total $ 81,225

Total other income, net, was $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to total other income, net, of $4.4 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in total other income, net, was primarily due to a reduction in net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and an increase in interest expense related to leases and to the Company’s delayed draw term loan facility, partially offset by benefit from the remeasurement of warrant liability and interest income.

Net loss was $110.7 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $26.6 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per common share was $1.44 in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.41 in the year-ago period. The increase in net loss in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by the increase in loss from operations and the decrease in total other income, net.

Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $21.6 million, or -30.8% of net revenues, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance, including restricted cash, was $131.1 million and total outstanding debt was $1.2 billion as of September 27, 2025. Net cash used in operating activities was $98.1 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to $69.9 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures totaled $9.3 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to $4.5 million in the year-ago period. Net cash used in investing activities was $8.0 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to $10,000 in the year-ago period. Net cash provided by financing activities was $87.8 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.3 million in the year-ago period. Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 27, 2025 included draws in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million from the Company’s Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility with Unprocessed Foods, LLC, partially offset by related debt issuance costs.

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, on October 29, 2025, the Company announced the final tender results of its previously-announced exchange offer (the “Exchange Offer”) to exchange any and all of its 2027 convertible notes for a pro rata portion of: (i) up to $202.5 million in aggregate principal amount of new convertible second lien notes; and (ii) up to 326,190,370 shares of the Company’s common stock. Following the final settlement date of the Exchange Offer on October 30, 2025 (the “Final Settlement Date”), a total of (i) $209,721,000 in aggregate principal amount of new convertible notes (inclusive of $12.5 million in aggregate principal amount of new convertible notes as payment to certain holders of 2027 convertible notes that had entered into a transaction support agreement with the Company related to the Exchange Offer) and (ii) 317,834,446 shares of the Company’s common stock have been issued by the Company in connection with the Exchange Offer.

In addition, subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Company sold 58,888,790 shares of common stock under its “at-the-market” offering program (“ATM Program”) for an aggregate offering price of $151.7 million. Sales agent’s commissions related to these sales under the ATM Program were $3.0 million, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $148.7 million. As of October 27, 2025, the Company had approximately $2,000 in capacity remaining for further sale of shares of common stock under the ATM Program.

2025 Outlook

The Company continues to experience an elevated level of uncertainty within its operating environment, which has, and management believes could continue to have, unforeseen impacts on the Company’s actual realized results.

[TITLE]Autonomous EV trucking company Einride going public in SPAC deal valuing it at $1.8 billion:
[TEXT]
The Einride EV freight truck charging station in Lynwood, California, built by Voltera and located close to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

Autonomous EV freight trucking company Einride is planning to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a SPAC deal with Legato Merger Corp. III , a blank check company, valuing it at $1.8 billion.

The deal is expected to raise $219 million in gross proceeds, with up to an additional $100 million in PIPE capital from institutional investors, with Einride to begin trading during the first half of 2026.

In announcing its plans, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company reported a contracted annual recurring revenue base of $65 million and over $800 million in potential long-term ARR.

Founded in 2016, Einride has over 25 customers across seven countries, and regulatory permits in the United States and Europe. Its current fleet of approximately 200 electric vehicles is used by customers including GE Appliances and Swedish online pharmacy company Apotea.

"Today marks a defining moment for Einride and for the future of freight technology," said

Roozbeh Charli, CEO of Einride, in a release. "We've proven the technology, built trust with global customers, and shown that autonomous and electric operations are not just possible, but better. This transaction positions us to accelerate our global expansion and continue to deliver with speed and precision for our customers," said Charli, who took over the CEO post from co-founder and previous CEO Robert Falck last May.

Einride has made the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for three consecutive years, ranking No. 24 in 2025.

Freight trucking in the U.S. and elsewhere, estimated by Einride at a $4.6 trillion market, is both carbon-intensive and inefficient. Einride's technology is designed to reduce emissions at scale and prove electric freight is viable both technologically and economically.

PepsiCo is among the companies that has piloted use of Einride freight solutions, in markets including Germany, and in the U.S., Memphis, Tennessee. Heineken added EV freight routes between the Netherlands and Germany in 2024, and to Austria. Einride also has plans to deploy 300 electric trucks across Europe by 2030 with Mars.

[TITLE]Applied Digital Advances AI Factory Buildout with Second $787.5 Million Draw from Macquarie Asset Management:
[TEXT]
DALLAS, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Digital (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APLD) a designer, builder, and operator of high-performance, sustainably engineered data centers and colocation services for artificial intelligence, cloud, networking and blockchain workloads announced today it expects to receive additional funding as part of its previously disclosed perpetual preferred equity financing facility of up to $5.0 billion with Macquarie Asset Management.

The anticipated additional draws of an aggregate amount equal to $787.5 million are expected to be completed by the end of the month and will support the continued build-out of Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 and Polaris Forge 2 AI Factory campuses in North Dakota.

Of the anticipated funding, $450 million will be allocated toward completing the build-out of Polaris Forge 2, Applied Digital’s AI Factory campus in Harwood, North Dakota. The Polaris Forge 2 campus has leased 200 MW of critical IT capacity, currently under construction, to a U.S.-Based Investment Grade Hyperscaler, which also holds the first right of refusal for an additional 800 MW of critical IT load at that campus – representing the full 1-gigawatt expansion potential of the site.

Macquarie Asset Management will fund the remaining $337.5 million into Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, North Dakota, subject to the closing of the Company’s previously announced $2.35 billion senior secured notes offering and other customary conditions. The investment will provide additional non-dilutive capital for the 400-MW campus, support platform-level general and administrative expenses, and cover transaction costs.

“This funding underscores the continued execution of our AI infrastructure strategy and the confidence in Applied Digital’s ability to deliver at scale,” said Wes Cummins, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Applied Digital. “With Macquarie Asset Management’s ongoing support and the anticipated completion of our senior secured notes offering, we believe we’re positioned to strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate development, and expand our AI Factory platform. We recently achieved our first Ready-for-Service milestone for our first data hall at Polaris Forge 1, and both Polaris Forge 1 and 2 remain on schedule, reflecting our disciplined execution and commitment to on-time delivery.”

“Applied Digital continues to distinguish itself as a trusted partner to hyperscale customers, with a differentiated portfolio of near-term power availability built by a pioneering leadership team,” said Anton Moldan, Senior Managing Director of Macquarie Asset Management. “We are pleased to deepen our partnership with Applied Digital as it scales its high-performance compute data center platform. Our global experience as an owner and manager of some of the largest private data center portfolios positions us to help Applied Digital become an industry-leading data center platform.”

“With Macquarie Asset Management’s continued support, we believe we are well-positioned to drive meaningful progress across our platform of large-scale AI Factories,” said Saidal Mohmand, Chief Financial Officer of Applied Digital. “These additional investments provide the capital needed to deliver on Polaris Forge 1 and continue advancing Polaris Forge 2, reinforcing the strength of our financing model and execution strategy.”

Up to one-half of the $337.5 million Macquarie Asset Management funding that is allocated to Polaris Forge 1 may be, but need not be, used for the second building on our Polaris Forge 1 campus. Any portion of the Macquarie Asset Management funding not used for that building is expected to be used for our other data center projects and general corporate purposes, and will not be credit support for the proposed senior secured notes. These Macquarie Asset Management fundings are subject to customary conditions, including in the case of the Polaris Forge 1 funding, the closing of the senior secured notes offering on terms reasonably acceptable to Macquarie Asset Management, all of which we expect to be satisfied reasonably promptly.

In addition, on November 10, 2025, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with First National Bank of Omaha, pursuant to which the lender agreed to make one or more revolving loans, and issue letters of credit, from time to time to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $65 million. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance at a rate of SOFR plus 2.75% per annum. The loan is secured by all of the Company’s (but none of its subsidiaries’) assets.

[TITLE]Cold Chain Logistics Market Set to Reach Valuation of US$ 1,455.8 Billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global cold chain logistics market was valued at US$ 371.4 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 1455.8 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 16.39% over the forecast period of 2025–2033.

The biopharmaceutical sector is a primary engine of growth for temperature-controlled logistics. In 2024, the U.S. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 50 new molecular entities. Of these approvals, 18 were new biologic entities requiring specialized handling and transport. A significant 81% of these new biologics were antibody-based drugs, products that frequently depend on an uninterrupted cold chain. Furthermore, the FDA designated 22 of the new drugs approved in 2024 as "first-in-class," many with complex temperature stability requirements that challenge existing supply chains. These developments are directly impacting the global cold chain logistics market.

Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/industry-report/cold-chain-logistics-market

Consequently, the air freight sector reflects this specialized demand. Worldwide air transport of temperature-controlled pharmaceutical products grew by a tonnage of 2% in 2024. Regional data underscores this trend, with the Middle East & South Asia recording an 8% increase in outbound pharma air cargo weight in 2024. Similarly, outbound volumes from North America rose by 4% in 2024 and accelerated significantly in the first three months of 2025, with outbound tonnage increasing 16% year-over-year. Specialized hubs are also seeing growth; Vienna Airport's Pharma Handling Center processed 4,238 tons of these sensitive goods in 2024 alone.

Key Findings in Cold Chain Logistics Market

Market Forecast (2033) US$ 1,455.8 billion CAGR 16.39% Largest Region (2024) Asia Pacific (35%) By Technology Evaporative Cooling Technology (28%) By Temperature Type Frozen (63%) By Solutions Cold Chain Warehouse/Storage Solution (55.60%) By Industry Food And Beverage Industry (59.60%) Top Drivers Surging e-commerce demand for perishable goods and online groceries.

Shifting consumer preferences toward fresh, convenient, and healthy foods. Top Trends Adoption of artificial intelligence for predictive analytics and route optimization.

Integration of blockchain technology for enhanced transparency and product traceability.

Development of sustainable and energy-efficient cold chain packaging solutions. Top Challenges Maintaining temperature integrity during complex last-mile delivery processes.

Addressing the environmental impact of energy-intensive refrigeration systems.

Navigating fragmented and inconsistent infrastructure in emerging global markets.

Online Grocery Adoption Redefines Last-Mile Consumer Expectations in cold Chain Logistics Market

The digital shift in consumer shopping habits is a monumental force. By mid-2025, an estimated 81 million U.S. households are expected to buy their groceries online, creating massive last-mile delivery needs. The number of individual Americans shopping for groceries online is projected to climb from 138.3 million in 2024 to 148.4 million in 2025. This sustained growth is a cornerstone of the modern cold chain logistics market. Consistent high demand is now the new normal for temperature-controlled delivery services.

Sales figures provide a stark illustration of this new reality. U.S. online grocery sales reached an unprecedented peak of US$ 12.5 billion in the single month of September 2025. Impressively, this figure represents a US$ 3 billion increase over September 2024 sales. The market's momentum is undeniable, with sales hitting US$ 10 billion in July 2025 and US$ 9.7 billion in March 2025. Moreover, March 2025 marked the eighth consecutive month where sales exceeded US$ 9.5 billion, while in November 2024, 77.8 million U.S. households participated in online grocery shopping.

Global Quick Commerce Creates New Hyper-Localized Logistics Challenges

The rise of quick commerce places immense pressure on hyper-localized cold chains but favoring the cold chain logistics market growth. Globally, an estimated 1.4 billion consumers are using online grocery services monthly in 2024, setting a broad stage for rapid delivery models. Within this group, a substantial 600 million people worldwide will use quick commerce services for essentials in 2024. The growth trajectory for this sub-sector is steep, with the number of global quick commerce users expected to reach 900 million by 2029.

In the United States, the quick commerce user base is already significant and growing. In 2024, 56.1 million people in the U.S. are using these rapid delivery services. The expansion of this model, exemplified by Amazon's launch of 15-minute deliveries in India in December 2024, intensifies the need for distributed micro-fulfillment centers with sophisticated refrigeration. The cold chain logistics market must adapt to service these on-demand expectations for perishable goods, a trend validated by a 25% rise in such deliveries in India during the 2024 Diwali season compared to 2023.

Critical Cold Storage Infrastructure Expands Amidst Tightening Vacancy Rates

The demand is fueling a wave of new construction in the cold storage sector. In the U.S., five speculative cold storage (SCS) projects were completed in 2024, adding 1.1 million square feet of crucial space. The pipeline remains robust across the cold chain logistics market, with another 2.2 million square feet of speculative cold storage space expected to be completed in the U.S. during 2025. As of early 2024, 15 specialized spec cold buildings were under construction or

[TITLE]Investors Now See Some Corporate Bonds as Safer Bets Than Government Debt:
[TEXT]
In the 10 years after the global financial crisis, net supply — new debt minus old bonds coming due — grew at similar rates for governments and corporates, according to Bloomberg indexes. Since 2020, sovereign debt issuance has raced ahead after governments introduced expensive policies to buoy their economies during widespread Covid lockdowns.

The power to raise taxes and print money has meant that, for decades, the core of portfolio construction in the US or Europe has been Treasury bonds, followed by German or UK sovereigns. Even the best companies have, in developed markets, always been seen as just a little riskier than their sovereign. But debt dynamics have changed to an extent where that’s less and less true.

“It’s the erosion of the perception of rule of law which keeps investors at bay,” said Pilar Gomez-Bravo, London-based co-chief investment officer of fixed income at MFS International, which has around $660 billion under management. “Structurally we do feel that the regime is shifting. People prefer corporate balance sheets which are in better shape than some sovereigns.”

A weakening of the safe haven status enjoyed for decades by a small handful of nations — the US foremost among them — is a sign that populist politics is corroding the basis for tough fiscal compromises. Successive French prime ministers have so far failed to pass measures reining in the budget and in the US, the federal deficit is set to remain above 6% for the rest of President Donald Trump’s second term. His moves to bypass convention have unnerved investors.

The result: Investors demand lower yields for bonds issued by Microsoft Corp., Airbus SE, L’Oreal SA, and Siemens AG than they do for their countries of origin. While the phenomenon isn’t unprecedented, a combination of huge demand for corporate bonds plus fiscal backsliding is adding more and more companies in developed markets to the list.

In corporate boardrooms since the pandemic era, executives have dealt with the rise in interest rates by keeping budgets lean and reducing overall indebtedness. Meanwhile, governments in rich countries continue to spend, with the average debt-to-output ratio across the Group of Seven industrialized nations set to keep rising until the end of this decade at least.

In the $150 trillion global bond market, investors are coming to the conclusion that some companies are safer bets than even the most powerful governments.

Story Continues

That’s been reflected in credit ratings: the US and France have both faced credit-rating downgrades in recent months, while firms in North America and Western Europe are being upgraded at the fastest clip in a decade.

The gap will likely widen: The Institute of International Finance in September warned over the surge in public indebtedness, arguing that it’s becoming “increasingly difficult for policymakers to take the tough decisions needed to correct course.”

The US Congressional Budget Office in July estimated that tax cuts introduced by Trump this year would add $3.4 trillion to US deficits over the next 10 years. In France, the euro-area’s second-largest economy, deadlock over proposed budget-cutting reforms threatens to keep the deficit above 5% into next year. Even Germany is skirting its own budget rules in order to boost long-neglected defense and infrastructure spending.

“For the government, it’s

A flagship European environmental policy -- dubbed a " carbon tax " on imports -- is raising hackles abroad and is becoming a flashpoint at the UN's COP30 climate summit in Brazil.The European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is designed to level the playing field for European industries subject to strict emissions rules.But critics say it risks becoming an unwelcome source of friction with Europe's global partners.Tested since 2023 and set to become fully operational in 2026, CBAM targets imports of carbon-intensive goods such as steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, electricity and hydrogen.The goal is to make foreign companies pay the same as EU producers are already doing under the bloc's internal emissions trading system.Importers -- often large trading firms -- must declare the CO2 emissions embedded in the production of goods abroad. If they exceed EU standards, firms are required to purchase emission certificates at the EU carbon price."The aim is to prevent carbon leakage ," Pierre Leturcq, a policy expert at the Institute for European Environmental Policy, told AFP. In other words: to stop companies relocating production to countries with weaker climate rules.With EU carbon prices currently hovering between 70 and 80 euros per tonne -- and expected to exceed 100 euros by 2030 -- the cost implications are significant."That could nearly double the price of a tonne of steel," Leturcq said.Brussels is also considering expanding the mechanism to other sectors -- a move that would be highly sensitive for the automotive and aerospace industries in particular.The EU promotes CBAM as a "virtuous" tool that encourages greener practices worldwide. But some trading partners see it as a veiled form of protectionism."The instrument has been misunderstood or misinterpreted by these trade partners," said Elisa Giannelli of the E3G environmental think tank."Nobody really took care of explaining to them what this is about."Among the scheme's most vocal critics is US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly slammed the EU's climate agenda and demanded exemptions for US firms."What he really dislikes is having a worldview imposed on him," said Leturcq. "His opposition to CBAM is part of a broader rejection of environmental policy altogether."Leturcq points to broader concerns from developing countries, however."There's a real fear that the Global North will end up shifting the financial burden of emissions reductions onto the South -- rather than shouldering it itself," he said.But EU lawmaker Pascal Canfin, who helped steer the legislation through the European Parliament, pushed back on that claim."CBAM mainly affects trade with industrialised countries -- the US, Canada, China, Russia and Ukraine for fertilisers," he said. "It's a non-issue for developing nations."Several countries including China, India and Bolivia are targeting the carbon border tax in their request to include "unilateral trade measures" on the agenda at COP30, which opens Monday in Brazil.Leturcq warned the mechanism could distract from "more substantive talks" on climate finance and emissions mitigation -- areas that require hundreds of billions of euros in investment.While CBAM is expected to generate 1.4 billion euros ($1.2 billion) annually for the EU from 2028, he said its actual impact on global emissions will be "fairly modest".To ease tensions, some experts have suggested the EU earmark part of the revenue raised to support decarbonisation efforts in developing countries.Beyond the EU, Britain is planning to roll out its own carbon border mechanism by 2027, and other countries may follow suit.One of the US Congress's most outspoken voices on climate change, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, has called the EU's approach with CBAM a "last lifeboat" to raise the global cost of pollution."If that persists, and if that expands with the UK, Australia, Canada, others adding to it, a pathway to climate safety begins to emerge," he recently told reporters."Without that, it's game over."
