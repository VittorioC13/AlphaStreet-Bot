[TITLE]The launch of IBM Quantum System Two is Europe’s quantum moment:
[TEXT]
When Europe looks to the East and the West, one question stands out: how can our countries come together to lead in tomorrow’s technological landscape—and in which domains should we focus our expertise? What is needed to prepare for the future?

This month, IBM will launch Europe’s first IBM Quantum System Two, our most advanced quantum computer, at the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center in San Sebastian, Spain.

While artificial Intelligence reaches a fever pitch, quantum computing is emerging as the next great technological transformation, with an estimated value of $850 billion by 2040. UNESCO even named 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. If Europe seizes this opportunity, quantum computing has the power to be a genuine differentiator for the continent, and shape our economy, and world, for the better.

Getting there will require a policy strategy that favors technological neutrality, harnesses open-source software, prioritizes funding for algorithm and application development research, and has a low barrier of access. Thankfully, Europe’s strong leadership in the physical sciences and technical expertise provides the perfect springboard.

You may ask, in a world of AI-accelerated computing capacity, why do we need quantum computers? Simply put, there are complex problems that cannot be solved by classical computers, such as simulating molecules for drug discovery and materials science and optimizing large-scale systems in finance and logistics.

This year, UK financial services group HSBC published research that demonstrated what is believed to be the world’s first-known empirical evidence of the potential value of quantum computers for solving real-world problems in algorithmic bond trading. And E.ON, one of Europe’s largest energy companies, is exploring how quantum can improve energy pricing amid volatile weather or different usage patterns from newly electrified sectors.

In addition to unlocking the maximum efficiency of energy grids and financial services, other opportunities are being explored in how quantum could optimize global shipping, and to help understand the complex chemical reactions that could lead to the discovery of new materials and medicines.

Quantum Infrastructure for Europe’s Quantum Ecosystem

The launch of Quantum System Two follows the deployment last year of our first European quantum data center with multiple installations of our best quantum computers in Germany.

Efforts in the Basque Country represent a microcosm of what could happen across all of Europe. The quantum computer at the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center in San Sebastian expands the region’s embrace of the technology that started years ago—one that has also served to unite scientists across the continent.

These rapid deployments to meet the increasing user demand are exactly what Europe needs to ensure its industries, research institutions, and governments play a leading role in the successful use of the technology. Most importantly, they will further the European Commission’s Quantum Europe Strategy, which seeks to position Europe as a global leader in quantum by 2030.

One hundred years ago, IBM got its start in Spain setting up tabulating machines for the country’s national telephone and telegraph company—peak technology at the time that was key in connecting people and enterprises. A century later, IBM offers Europe’s industries, research institutions, and governments a data center of quantum computers, and the continent’s first IBM Quantum System Two, as important pieces in an equally transformative moment. Taking action together now, the continent’s ecosystem can lead in the development of these quantum applications with advantages never before possible.

[TITLE]The World’s Chip Supply Chain Is Bracing for Fallout From China’s Rare-Earth Curbs:
[TEXT]
Businesses across the global semiconductor supply chain are bracing themselves for disruptions from an escalating trade war, after China imposed curbs on rare-earth mineral exports and the US responded with additional tariffs and restrictions on software sales to the Asian nation.

China’s restrictions, the most targeted move yet to limit supplies of rare-earth materials, represent the first major attempt by Beijing to exercise long-arm jurisdiction over foreign companies to target the semiconductor industry, threatening to stall the chips powering the AI boom. They prompted US President Donald Trump to announce on Friday that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China and export controls on “any and all critical software.”

The rare-earth curbs may lead to weekslong delays in shipments for ASML Holding NV, the only manufacturer in the world of machines that make the most advanced semiconductors, a person familiar with the company said.

A senior manager at a major US chip company said the firm is still assessing potential impacts. But the clearest risk the company is facing now is an increase in the prices of rare earth-dependent magnets that are critical to the chip supply chain, this person said, asking not to be identified discussing operations.

An official at another US chip company said the business is rushing to identify which of its products contain rare earths from China and is worried that the country’s requirement for licenses will grind its supply chain to a halt.

It’s not clear what software products from the US might be hit by Trump’s latest proposed export ban. In July, the administration lifted export license requirements for chip-design software sales, rules that had been imposed in May as part of a raft of measures responding to Beijing’s earlier limits on shipments of essential rare earths.

China’s new rules require overseas firms to seek approval for shipping any material containing even trace amounts of Chinese rare earths — and explicitly call out parts used to make certain computer chips and advance AI research with military applications.

“These are the strictest export controls that China has utilized,” said Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals-focused director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It’s quite clear that they have the sticks and the leverage to make, not just US firms, but firms worldwide comply.”

Chipmaking machines, like those sold by ASML and Applied Materials Inc., are especially dependent on rare earths because they contain extremely precise lasers, magnets and other equipment that use these elements.

ASML is preparing for disruptions, particularly due to a clause that requires foreign firms to seek China’s approval for reexports of products containing its rare earths, said the person familiar with ASML, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters and noted that ASML is lobbying Dutch and US allies for alternatives. The company declined to comment.

“Within the semiconductor value chain, China’s new export controls will likely most impact chipmakers that use rare-earth-based chemicals during the chip fabrication process and toolmakers that integrate rare-earth magnets into their equipment,” said Jacob Feldgoise, senior data research analyst at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.

Some have questioned how long the restrictions will last, viewing them as potential posturing ahead of a trip to Asia Trump had planned that was expected to include a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month. It’s unclear how China would even track rare earths at such discrete levels to enforce the rules.

But China’s move has instead escalated tensions with the US. Trump’s announced tariffs would raise import taxes on many Chinese goods to 130% starting next month. That would be just below the 145% level imposed earlier this year, before both countries ratcheted down the levies in a truce to advance trade talks. On Friday, Trump also threatened to call off his meeting with Xi altogether, describing the new rare-earth controls as a “hostile” action.

“I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

This isn’t the first time that rare earths have landed in the center of US-China trade wars. After Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese imports earlier this year, China’s government responded by cutting off mineral exports to US companies. Officials from both sides had agreed to a truce in the spring, under which Trump lowered duties and Xi’s officials agreed to resume the flow of the minerals.

The world’s biggest chipmakers, including Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., rely on ASML to produce semiconductors. Samsung and Intel declined to comment. TSMC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A White House official said the government and relevant agencies are assessing any impact from the new rules, which were announced without notice and imposed in an apparent effort to exert control over the entire world’s technology supply chains.

The US House Select Committee on China panned the Asian nation for the move, describing the restrictions as “an economic declaration of war against the US.” Committee Chairman John Moolenaar, a Republican, said in a statement on Thursday that China has “fired a loaded gun at the American economy.”

Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, has already introduced measures to diversify its supply of raw materials, and its economic ministry called China’s curbs a “great concern” on Friday. The government said it’s in close contact with affected companies and the European Commission to respond.

Taiwan relies mainly on Europe, the US and Japan for rare-earth supplies. “We still need further assessment before deciding on the impact” on the chip industry, the nation’s economic affairs ministry said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor indirect impact from fluctuations in the pricing of raw materials and supply chain adjustments.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping ’s blistering response to Donald Trump violating the terms of their fragile trade truce has reignited a tit-for-tat spiral, exposing the rocky path to any US-China trade deal.After China unveiled wide-ranging global export controls on products containing even traces of certain rare earths this past week, Trump fired back by threatening to cancel a planned in-person meeting with Xi — their first in six years. The US leader also announced plans to double tariffs on Chinese goods to 100%, along with sweeping curbs on “any and all critical software.”On Sunday, Beijing justified its moves as defensive actions and accused the US of introducing new restrictive measures targeting China since talks between the two in Madrid in September. Last month, the US Commerce Department unveiled a dramatic expansion of its export controls, which closed loopholes in current measures to block Beijing from cutting-edge chips.“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” the Commerce Ministry said. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it.”China’s backlash shows Beijing viewed a tariff truce stuck during Geneva talks in May — and reinforced a month later in London — as hinging on an agreement both sides would freeze any new curbs on critical shipments. The latest rupture demonstrates Xi is drawing red lines on such curbs, setting up Beijing now either to retaliate on tariffs or engage in damage control with the US to regain an equilibrium where trade can flow.“We will not be intimidated by such coercive and unilateral actions of power politics,” said Zhou Mi, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under the Ministry of Commerce. “Our actions have clearly shown this.”Both sides have left room for deescalation. Trump’s tariffs are slated for Nov. 1, days after the expected meeting with Xi at a summit in South Korea. China’s new controls are set to begin taking effect a week later, shortly before the latest trade truce holding back tariffs as high as 145% expires.Export controls on technology and magnets critical to artificial intelligence and weapons manufacturing are at the heart of trade negotiations between the world’s biggest economies.After Trump hit China with 145% tariffs in April, Xi blocked US firms from buying its magnets, sparking factory closures and panic over the nation’s dependence on Beijing for metals vital to national security. If the US leader hikes tariffs again, Beijing could reimpose that blockade bringing both sides back to a battle of which superpower can withstand more economic pain.Washington’s fear of China is strategic, not economic,” according to analysts at Hutong Research, an independent analysis firm. “A disruption in rare earth flows threatens defense production capacity, a core pillar of US global power projection and, by extension, dollar stability.”The latest showdown underscores the difficulty for two rivals to strike a trade deal. Chinese negotiators have reportedly dangled a huge investment package to Trump’s team, but such capital flows would likely be blocked by US national security controls. The fallout could also jeopardize a deal for China-owned social media giant TikTok ’s US operations, which US lawmakers have previously opposed over security concerns.Ultimately, the US will find the escalation and any collapse of the TikTok deal harder to bear than its rival, according to CF40, a Beijing-based economic think tank, which said China could hedge against higher US tariffs with policy support.“The Trump administration relies on TikTok to woo young voters, and with political pressure from the 2026 mid-term elections it has limited scope for extreme measures,” the organization wrote in a Saturday paper. “Inflation and shortages that tariffs are causing in the US will be hard to alleviate in the short term.”Chinese exports have hit new records in many markets this year, showing Beijing can survive without the US consumer. Data due Monday is expected to show the factory engine surging ahead again, giving Xi more breathing room. Still, a huge spike in tariffs would put more pressure on an economy already battling weak domestic demand and deflationary pressures.Officials from both sides could sit down again as soon as this week, when a team from China heads to Washington for a regular round of meetings with international finance chiefs. Officials from Beijing could face pushback there from global counterparts, as its latest rare earths curbs are not limited to the US, threatening to also disrupt European and Asian firms.The renewed brinkmanship revives fears of a deeper rupture in global trade that could push the two economies toward partial decoupling. Markets recoiled on Friday, with US stocks suffering their worst selloff in six months, and commodities from soybeans to wheat, copper and cotton all falling.Ultimately, the endgame will likely involve some form of negotiated settlement, said Ray Wang, lead semiconductor analyst at The Futurum Group. “The economic, security and supply-chain stakes for both sides are simply too high to sustain the current standoff indefinitely,” he added.Earlier this year, China used its dominance of vital rare earths to help force Trump into easing export controls on certain goods to the Asian nation. Xi’s team could push the US for a similar climb down in their next round of talks.Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of state-run tabloid Global Times, described the rupture in recent days as a “turning point” in China’s relationship with the US, as it wields its leverage in rare earths to hold back chip curbs.“This year, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese products several times without even consulting us. Sanctioning our companies was done just as casually,” he wrote on X. “China will use its strength to prevent the US from crossing the line.”

[TITLE]Trump Says U.S. Will Hit China With 100% Additional Tariff Over Rare Earth Restrictions:
[TEXT]
President Trump said Friday he would impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports and new export controls on critical software, responding to China’s announcement of stringent new restrictions on rare earth minerals.

The measures would take effect Nov. 1, Trump said on Truth Social, potentially raising the average U.S. tariffs on many Chinese goods above 150 percent. Trump also said he saw no reason to proceed with a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.

“It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them,” Trump wrote.

Trump’s tariff move came one day after China’s Ministry of Commerce announced new export restrictions on rare earth elements, lithium batteries, and related technologies. The rules, which would reportedly take effect in early November, require foreign entities to obtain licenses to export products containing Chinese rare earths comprising as little as 0.1 percent of a product’s value or items manufactured with Chinese rare earth processing technology.

China processes approximately 90 percent of the world’s rare earths, minerals critical for manufacturing semiconductors, electric vehicles, and military equipment. Its dominance in processing gives Beijing significant leverage over global technology supply chains.

China’s rare earth restrictions have upended months of negotiations between Washington and Beijing. The two countries agreed to a tariff truce earlier this year that reduced U.S. duties on Chinese goods from a peak above 140 percent in April. Average U.S. tariffs on China currently stand at 57.6 percent, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods average 32.6 percent.

Trump said other countries had contacted him expressing anger over China’s actions. “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,” he wrote.

China also imposed new port fees on U.S. ships this week and launched an antitrust investigation into U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm.

The dispute over rare earths marks a repeat of tensions that erupted earlier this year. In April, China tightened export controls on the minerals, prompting warnings of supply chain disruptions in autos and defense. The two sides eventually relaxed most restrictions after a series of meetings in the U.K. and Europe.

The latest Chinese restrictions could prove more disruptive. Many global technology companies will struggle to demonstrate their products fall below the 0.1 percent threshold, potentially requiring them to seek Chinese government approval for exports.

A cancellation of the APEC meeting would represent a setback for Xi, who has sought continued engagement with Trump to manage bilateral relations.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that China’s decision to tighten its export controls stemmed from a belief among Chinese officials that they had gained leverage over the U.S. economy and President Trump in advance of the APEC meeting. Officials view recent U.S. responses to Chinese trade threats as “feeble,” the Wall Street Journal reported. Chinese officials sought to force the U.S. to remove tariffs and export controls on technology, especially related to artificial intelligence.

One analyst described China’s restrictions as “an economic equivalent of nuclear war—an intent to destroy the American AI industry,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

The shutdown of the federal government over budgetary disputes may also have emboldened the Chinese regime, which appears to have interpreted it as a sign of governmental disarray.

Trump’s reaction to the export controls suggests that the Chinese miscalculated Trump’s eagerness to make a deal.

Trump said the U.S. would impose export controls on “any and all critical software” starting Nov. 1, though he didn’t specify which products would be affected.

The U.S. maintains significant leverage in advanced semiconductor technology and manufacturing equipment. American companies and their allies control more than 90 percent of global semiconductor equipment manufacturing, and China remains heavily dependent on foreign sources for advanced chips essential to artificial intelligence and military applications.

China’s moves are emboldening trade hawks in the Trump administration, contributing to their arguments that the U.S. may eventually have to decouple its economy from China’s.

[TITLE]What are the latest sticking points in US-China tensions?:
[TEXT]
Beijing is stacking up its bargaining chips ahead of expected US-China talks when Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping visit South Korea's Gyeongju, announcing new export controls to tighten its grip over high-tech manufacturing supply chains. The two superpowers look to be struggling to move beyond their current tariff truce - a 90-day pause from August 11 that ends around November 9 - with officials from both sides continuing to meet to discuss issues predating September's Madrid summit, widely seen as a breakthrough for its Tiktok deal, which would see the US take a stake in one of China's most successful companies overseas.

How the trade war unfolded

On February 4, Trump implemented an additional 10% tariff on imports from China demanding Beijing do more to stop the flow of fentanyl precursors into the US China hit back with levies on some US commodities, farm equipment and automobiles, as well as probes into several American businesses.

In April, Trump singled out China for tariffs exceeding 100% following his sweeping "Liberation Day" duties, while pausing the reciprocal tariffs he placed on some other countries the White House also deemed to be trading unfairly with the US China retaliated, and over the next few weeks, both sides continued raising duties on each other's goods - peaking in May - before agreeing on May 12 to their first 90-day pause, which also saw US tariffs on Chinese goods fall from 145% to 30% and Chinese tariffs on American products drop from 125% to 10%.

There have been two more 90-day extensions since then, the latest agreed on August 11.

Critical minerals

On October 9, along with the addition of five new elements to its control list, Beijing unexpectedly announced export curbs on certain types of artificial diamonds and artificial graphite anode materials - other areas where China is the top producer - used in the production of semiconductors, quantum devices and advanced electronic systems.

Those curbs are set to take effect from November 8, just a day before the current truce expires. Xi and Trump are expected to meet on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit prior to that. China, the world's largest rare earths producer, has been tightening its control over these critical minerals, used in everything from lithium-ion batteries and semiconductors to aircraft engines, LED TVs, camera lenses, and much more.

Earlier controls announced in April caused shortages around the world, before a series of deals with Europe and the US eased the supply crunch.

Semiconductors

One reason China has tightened its control over critical minerals is the US has sought to limit its access to advanced semiconductors, critical for powering artificial intelligence models and applications.

US lawmakers say that without these restrictions, China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies faster than the US, enabling China to not only dominate the industry but also gain a military edge.

China has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to remove such curbs, accusing Washington of trying to contain its legitimate economic development.

Taiwan

Sensing that the Trump administration might be open to a deal that goes beyond traditional trade talks, there are reports that Beijing has renewed efforts to push Washington to alter the language the United States uses when discussing its position on Taiwanese independence.

China for a while now has wanted the US to say "we oppose Taiwan independence," rather than the current version, which is that the US "does not support" the independence of Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory.

Balanced trade

Beijing also demands that the Trump administration remove the additional tariffs and ease restrictions limiting Chinese firms' ability to invest in the world's No.1 economy - a major source of friction that has not been resolved.

Chinese companies' investments in the US face intense scrutiny over concerns about technology transfer, cybersecurity, and dual-use military application, particularly in AI, aerospace, biotech, semiconductors and telecommunications. On the flip side, US politicians have talked up a deal that would see China commit to buy more Boeing jets and raised the fact that the world's biggest buyer of soybeans has yet to book any US soybean cargoes.

But agricultural traders said China's announcement it would start collecting additional port fees from US ships from October 14 - a countermeasure against upcoming US port fees on Chinese ships - suggested the world's top buyer was not going to allow US agricultural imports anytime soon.

Fentanyl

Despite Trump's 20% fentanyl tariffs imposed in early 2025 to pressure China into curbing the flow of chemicals driving America's deadly opioid crisis, Beijing has yet to publicly unveil any dramatic move to meet his demands. But China in June did announce that it had added two precursors to its list of controlled chemicals and arrested or prosecuted some 2,000 people for drug-related money laundering.

The Trump administration has not budged.

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:
[TEXT]
Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defence, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world’s lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60-70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union — long-term trading partners with African nations — have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa’s resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa’s position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasise local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa’s critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another “resource curse.”

The emerging ‘New World Order’

A Chinese-led ‘New World Order’ is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organisations. The initiative has expanded China’s access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent

[TITLE]Orange lands first Medusa subsea cable in Marseille:
[TEXT]
Telco Orange has revealed the first landing on European soil of the Medusa undersea cable system, designed to transform infrastructure in the Mediterranean region.

Owned by African infrastructure and telecoms operator AFR-IX Telecom, the Medusa Submarine Cable System is 8,760km long, and will be the first and longest subsea cable to connect the main Mediterranean countries, providing access to telecommunications infrastructure and 16 landing points around the Mediterranean Sea.

The cable will have segments with up to 24 fibre pairs, with a capacity of 20Tbs per fibre pair. Its festoon architecture is said to offer a unique design.

Designed as an open-access system, Medusa will look to offer telecom providers across the region with access to advanced connectivity services, supporting the roll-out of 5G, the growth of cloud infrastructure, and the increasing bandwidth demands of artificial intelligence (AI) and future technologies.

Operationally, Medusa will have two main regions: Europe and North Africa. In Europe, it has local operational branches in Ireland, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Cyprus. These branches hold licenses and permits. The Network Operations Centre is based in Europe. In North Africa, Medusa has agreements with local licensed operators for landing parties.

Medusa is seen as being crucial for developing the digital ecosystem of populations in North African countries, taking a significant step towards closing the digital divide between Europe and North Africa, connecting countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria and Egypt with high-capacity fibre-optic links to six European Union (EU) member states: Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Cyprus.

The investment is expected to have a positive impact on the economy of these countries, which will lead to inclusive and sustainable economic growth. It is also backed financially by the EU.

With the arrival of the 1,050km-long submarine cable segment, Orange says it is reaffirming its commitment to international connectivity and digital dynamism in the Mediterranean through the continued development of its infrastructure in Marseille.

The cable is part of the ongoing development of submarine networks connecting both sides of the Mediterranean, from Marseille to Bizerte in Tunisia, meeting growing needs for bandwidth in the region.

With the fully redundant fibre optic infrastructure, Orange says it will provide its Marseille customers with simple, secure and direct access to all of the city’s datacentres, which are now interconnected and also have direct links to major European hubs such as Paris, London and Frankfurt, as well as the rest of the world. All aspects of the cable are fully managed by Orange, including from a technical, regulatory, security and environmental point of view.

The Marseille-Bizerte segment also benefits from co-financing by the EU through the Connecting Europe Facility. Three pairs of fibre belonging to Orange are supported in the framework of the European Global Gateway strategy, aimed at strengthening connections between Europe and Africa, supporting digital transition and reducing the digital divide.

The Medusa cable provider is Alcatel Submarine Networks. Elettra, a subsidiary of Orange and the project coordinator, managed the operation. Orange Marine’s cable ship, Sophie Germain, was tasked with the cable landing operations in Marseille.

“We are proud to bring our leadership and expertise to the Medusa cable, hosted within our secure infrastructure in Marseille, with laying operations carried out by our cable ships, Teliri and Sophie Germain,” said Michael Trabbia, CEO of Orange Wholesale.

“Our infrastructure offers a key link in Mediterranean basin connectivity, ensuring digital resilience and supporting socio-economic development,” he added. “With this landing, Orange enhances Europe’s digital sovereignty and positions Marseille as a global digital hub, now hosting the arrival of 17 submarine cables connected worldwide.”

[TITLE]The launch of IBM Quantum System Two is Europe’s quantum moment:
[TEXT]
When Europe looks to the East and the West, one question stands out: how can our countries come together to lead in tomorrow’s technological landscape—and in which domains should we focus our expertise? What is needed to prepare for the future?

This month, IBM will launch Europe’s first IBM Quantum System Two, our most advanced quantum computer, at the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center in San Sebastian, Spain.

While artificial Intelligence reaches a fever pitch, quantum computing is emerging as the next great technological transformation, with an estimated value of $850 billion by 2040. UNESCO even named 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. If Europe seizes this opportunity, quantum computing has the power to be a genuine differentiator for the continent, and shape our economy, and world, for the better.

Getting there will require a policy strategy that favors technological neutrality, harnesses open-source software, prioritizes funding for algorithm and application development research, and has a low barrier of access. Thankfully, Europe’s strong leadership in the physical sciences and technical expertise provides the perfect springboard.

You may ask, in a world of AI-accelerated computing capacity, why do we need quantum computers? Simply put, there are complex problems that cannot be solved by classical computers, such as simulating molecules for drug discovery and materials science and optimizing large-scale systems in finance and logistics.

This year, UK financial services group HSBC published research that demonstrated what is believed to be the world’s first-known empirical evidence of the potential value of quantum computers for solving real-world problems in algorithmic bond trading. And E.ON, one of Europe’s largest energy companies, is exploring how quantum can improve energy pricing amid volatile weather or different usage patterns from newly electrified sectors.

In addition to unlocking the maximum efficiency of energy grids and financial services, other opportunities are being explored in how quantum could optimize global shipping, and to help understand the complex chemical reactions that could lead to the discovery of new materials and medicines.

Quantum Infrastructure for Europe’s Quantum Ecosystem

The launch of Quantum System Two follows the deployment last year of our first European quantum data center with multiple installations of our best quantum computers in Germany.

Efforts in the Basque Country represent a microcosm of what could happen across all of Europe. The quantum computer at the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center in San Sebastian expands the region’s embrace of the technology that started years ago—one that has also served to unite scientists across the continent.

These rapid deployments to meet the increasing user demand are exactly what Europe needs to ensure its industries, research institutions, and governments play a leading role in the successful use of the technology. Most importantly, they will further the European Commission’s Quantum Europe Strategy, which seeks to position Europe as a global leader in quantum by 2030.

One hundred years ago, IBM got its start in Spain setting up tabulating machines for the country’s national telephone and telegraph company—peak technology at the time that was key in connecting people and enterprises. A century later, IBM offers Europe’s industries, research institutions, and governments a data center of quantum computers, and the continent’s first IBM Quantum System Two, as important pieces in an equally transformative moment. Taking action together now, the continent’s ecosystem can lead in the development of these quantum applications with advantages never before possible.

[TITLE]TechIreland’s National AI Meet sets up Irish sector for future success:
[TEXT]
Partner Content

As artificial intelligence continues to transform business and society at breath-taking speed, innovative Irish companies are leading the way both in adoption of AI tools and in developing new AI-powered products and services.

In fact, Ireland has a unique opportunity to be a global frontrunner in ethical and human-centric AI adoption, as set out in the refreshed national strategy AI: Here for Good.

According to TechIreland, Ireland is home to a vibrant indigenous ecosystem of more than 4,500 technology start-ups. Our world-class universities offer cutting-edge programmes in the field, while at the same time, almost all leading AI multinationals have a presence here.

More than 300 businesses from multiple sectors across Ireland gathered recently for the recent TechIreland National AI Meet, which Enterprise Ireland has been supporting since its inaugural edition in 2023.

Attendees heard from thought leaders and panellists who addressed topics ranging from AI agents and manufacturing automation, to future skills needs.

Enterprise Ireland’s sponsorship reflects our new strategy to 2030, Delivering for Ireland, Leading Globally, which prioritises innovation, competitiveness and sustainable growth.

The TechIreland National AI Meet took place in Galway in September and was officially opened by junior minister Niamh Smyth.

Key speakers included senior executives from CeADAR, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Iarnród Éireann, along with representatives from multinationals such as customer experience leader Genesys and tech start-ups such as Jentic.

​The event is a key initiative that reflects Enterprise Ireland’s strategy to accelerate sustainable Irish exporting business as the primary driver of the economy. By connecting start-ups, scale-ups and global leaders, the event fosters innovation, competitiveness and collaboration.

In turn, that drives AI adoption, which helps Irish firms start, scale and lead globally.

On September 5, nationwide presentations were held under the TechIreland National AI Challenge. Enterprise Ireland, as a proud partner of the AI Challenge, also hosted several teams to pitch their solutions at the EI offices at East Point. The Challenge included pitch sessions and networking opportunities, providing a platform for emerging talent to showcase their work to peers, mentors and judges.

Over 80 people had completed a six-week programme of development, mentorship, and collaboration ahead of the Challenge. The winners, AIMA Opex, Launchloop and Success.co, were also announced at the Meet in Galway.

Along with Enterprise Ireland, the National AI Meet is also supported by IDA Ireland, InterTradeIreland, Data2Sustain, European Digital Innovation Hubs, and global AI leaders including Google and OpenAI.

It is co-sponsored by ITAG, Bank of Ireland, Technology Ireland ICT Skillnet and Code Institute. This extensive backing reinforces Ireland’s impressive standing in AI talent, research and innovation.​
