[TITLE]Trump Announces “TrumpRx” Website and Pfizer Deal to Slash Drug Prices, Boost U.S. Manufacturing:
[TEXT]
This article was originally published by Kevin Huges at Natural News.

President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with Pfizer to implement “most-favored-nation” pricing for Medicaid, ensuring the U.S. pays no more than the lowest prices offered to other developed nations.

The new TrumpRx direct-to-consumer platform, launching in 2026, will allow Americans to purchase prescription drugs at steep discounts (averaging 50 percent off retail prices), bypassing traditional pharmacy markups.

Pfizer committed to investing $70 billion in domestic research, development, and manufacturing, aligning with Trump’s push to bring pharmaceutical production back to America.

While the deal marks progress, experts caution that discounts may still leave expensive drugs unaffordable for many, and the full impact remains unclear due to Pfizer’s confidential terms.

The administration leveraged tariff threats to secure the deal and hinted at similar agreements with other drugmakers. Critics argue systemic affordability issues persist, while Democrats and Republicans remain divided on broader healthcare reforms.

In a major move aimed at lowering prescription drug costs, President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. that includes deep discounts for Medicaid, a new direct-to-consumer drug purchasing website called “TrumpRx,” and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing.

Speaking alongside Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the White House, Trump declared the deal a “historic” step toward ending America’s role in subsidizing global pharmaceutical research while paying the highest prices for medications. Under the agreement, Pfizer will adopt “most-favored-nation” pricing for Medicaid, ensuring that the U.S. government pays no more than the lowest price offered to other developed nations. As stated by Brighteon.AI‘s Enoch engine, Medicaid is a government-run health insurance program primarily for low-income individuals, disabled persons, and families with dependent children, funded jointly by federal and state governments.

The decentralized engine adds that while Medicaid covers essential medical services, including dental care (as seen in cases like Isaac Gagnon’s unauthorized treatments), it disproportionately allocates two-thirds of its budget to long-term care for the elderly, blind, and disabled—raising concerns

[TITLE]Trump’s tariffs may be bringing in a lot of revenue but they’ve also been a ‘tax on capital, so far,’ top economist says:
[TEXT]
President Trump’s tariffs, highly touted as a lever to boost American industry, are now emerging as a substantial tax on business—putting pressure on corporate profits, labor markets, and prices, according to Morgan Stanley’s chief economist. Michael Gapen draws a striking conclusion in his Monday research note, US Economics Weekly: “Tariffs have been a tax on capital, so far.”

In the second quarter of 2025, U.S. corporations largely absorbed the escalating cost of tariffs, according to Gapen’s team, offsetting higher nonlabor costs with reductions in labor costs and profitability rather than passing them directly on to consumers. This is markedly different from the trends observed in 2021 and 2022, a phenomenon called “greedflation” by some, when businesses responded to rising costs by raising prices more than those costs, which led to boosted profits.

Since returning to office, President Trump has expanded “reciprocal tariffs” across major U.S. trading partners, collecting a record $25 billion in July alone—triple the amount from late last year. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) reports tariffs are on track to inject $1.3 trillion in new revenue by the end of Trump’s current term and as much as $2.8 trillion through 2034. For fiscal 2025, the take from tariffs has already doubled its typical share, accounting for 2.7% of all federal revenue with projections as high as 5% if current policies persist. This is functioning to date as a tax on capital, Gapen’s team concludes.

The mystery of the 2025 economy

Gapen is wrestling with a question that has been plaguing many other economists,

[TITLE]Offsite Construction Industry Business Report 2025-2030: Higher ROI and Faster Project Timelines Generate Investment Interest in Modular Construction Startups:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Offsite Construction - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Offsite Construction was valued at US$172.0 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$225.7 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Rapid urbanization, labor shortages in the skilled trades, and increasing project complexity are driving the global shift toward offsite methods. Countries like the UK, Sweden, Japan, and Singapore are leading adopters of offsite construction due to government incentives, housing policy reforms, and industrialized construction mandates. In the U.S., large-scale developers and general contractors are exploring prefabrication to manage rising material costs and supply chain volatility. Beyond speed and cost-efficiency, offsite construction also offers enhanced precision, structural quality, and repeatability, contributing to higher-performing buildings and reduced rework rates.

What Forces Are Powering Market Growth and Industry Transformation?

The growth in the global offsite construction market is driven by several converging trends, including rising urban density, regulatory mandates for faster housing delivery, digital innovation, and a shift toward more sustainable and resilient building practices. Governments around the world are incorporating offsite construction into national housing and infrastructure strategies. For instance, the UK's Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) policy framework and Singapore's Productivity Innovation Project (PIP) provide subsidies and fast-track approvals for offsite-based developments. Such policy support is accelerating adoption among public sector contractors and attracting private investment into modular manufacturing facilities.

Sustainability imperatives are another key growth driver. Offsite construction produces significantly less material waste, energy consumption, and on-site emissions compared to traditional methods. Modular buildings are also designed for disassembly and reuse, supporting circular economy principles. Carbon tracking via BIM tools and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) helps developers meet green building certifications such as LEED and BREEAM, making offsite construction attractive for ESG-focused real estate investors. As global pressure mounts for decarbonized construction, offsite solutions offer a practical path toward embodied carbon reduction.

The economic and operational benefits of factory-controlled environments-including consistent quality, reduced labor costs, and scalability-are drawing interest from major developers, general contractors, and venture-backed construction technology firms. Companies like Katerra (before its dissolution), Volumetric Building Companies (VBC), Sekisui House, and Laing O'Rourke are investing in high-capacity modular plants, AI-driven design software, and supply chain optimization to scale the offsite model. With continued innovation and market validation, offsite construction is emerging as a cornerstone of the global construction ecosystem, reshaping how buildings are conceived, manufactured, and delivered.

How Are Digital Tools and Materials Advancing Offsite Building Methods?

The integration of digital technologies into offsite construction is redefining the design-build process. Building Information Modeling (BIM), digital twins, and generative design algorithms are being used to model entire structures virtually before a single component is fabricated. This digital precision allows for clash detection, construction sequencing, and real-time collaboration between architects, engineers, and manufacturers, resulting in fewer site disruptions and tighter integration of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems within modular units. BIM also facilitates greater supply chain transparency and just-in-time logistics, both of which are vital for reducing inventory and optimizing production schedules.

Advanced materials are further enhancing the performance and scalability of offsite construction. Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs), Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT), and light-gauge steel framing are increasingly used for their lightweight, durable, and energy-efficient properties. These materials simplify transport and assembly, while meeting stringent structural and fire safety codes. Additive manufacturing (3D printing) is emerging as a complementary innovation, particularly for producing complex building components or custom molds in low-volume projects. Furthermore, robotics and automated machinery on factory floors are increasing the precision and throughput of framing, welding, and component assembly, further reducing dependence on manual labor.

Which End-Use Sectors Are Adopting Offsite Construction at Scale?

Residential and commercial real estate sectors remain primary adopters of offsite construction, but the technology's reach is expanding into a broader range of industries. Affordable housing, student housing, and hospitality chains are turning to modular construction to accelerate delivery timelines and control costs. Developers are now opting for pre-finished modules complete with interior fit-outs, plumbing, HVAC, and finishes-often referred to as "plug-and-play" systems-that are simply craned into position at the job site. This model supports rapid scaling of multi-unit developments in dense urban environments, particularly where construction permits and space constraints limit traditional building activity.

Healthcare and education are also high-growth sectors for offsite construction. Hospitals and school districts increasingly require fast-track expansion solutions due to population growth or emergency preparedness needs. Modular surgical centers, clinics, classrooms, and laboratories can be rapidly deployed with minimal site disruption, making them ideal for operational facilities. In the industrial sector, data centers, warehouses, and energy plants are leveraging prefabricated mechanical and electrical rooms (commonly referred to as modular utility skids) for streamlined integration into complex systems. Government agencies and military organizations are adopting prefabricated solutions for disaster relief housing, remote workforce accommodations, and mobile command centers.
