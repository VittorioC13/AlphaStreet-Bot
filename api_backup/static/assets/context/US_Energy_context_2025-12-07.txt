[TITLE]Cargill and Uzbekneftegaz Ink Deal to Boost Central Asian Energy Security:
[TEXT]
Uzbekistan’s state oil and gas firm Uzbekneftegaz has signed a cooperation agreement with U.S. corporation Cargill, under which the parties will look to attract up to $5 billion in energy investment to boost the central Asian country’s energy security.

Uzbekneftegaz’s international trade and investment subsidiary, UNG Overseas, has signed the agreement with the U.S. conglomerate, the Uzbek oil and gas firm said in a statement.

Uzbekneftegaz and Cargill have agreed to raise long-term financing of up to $3 billion, which could be gradually expanded to as much as $5 billion.

The cooperation agreement is aimed at strengthening Uzbekistan’s energy security, increase resource sustainability, and support sustainable development, Uzbekneftegaz said.

The deal is expected to open up opportunities to attract international investment in Uzbekistan’s energy and water management sectors, the Uzbek company said, without specifying timeframes or naming potential foreign investors.

Earlier this year, Uzbekistan announced energy-related deals with U.S. companies worth more than $4 billion in total.

Uzbekistan’s Energy Minister, Jurabek Mirzamakhmudov, in October announced deals with Air Products, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, and Gulf Oil.

Air Products will speed up the construction of a petrochemical complex in Bukhara and will be involved in the development of a variety of coal gasification initiatives and the refining of “clean” jet fuel, according to a report published by the government-connected UzDaily information service.

The agreements with Schlumberger and Baker Hughes cover “the implementation of modern technologies, experience and management methods.”

In addition, Uzbek officials have signed a memorandum of understanding with Gulf Oil to develop a network of gas stations across the country.

On a late September visit to New York, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced a number of deals, including an $8 billion contract to purchase Boeing passenger jets. During a brief meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, the Uzbek leader expressed an overall intention to conclude business deals with U.S. firms worth about $105 billion.

[TITLE]UK Windfall Tax Puts $20 Billion in North Sea Oil Investment at Risk:
[TEXT]
The UK government’s decision to keep the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators could wipe out as much as $20 billion (£15 billion) of potential investment in Britain’s offshore oil and gas output, according to a Wood Mackenzie estimate cited by the Financial Times.

The government last week kept the windfall tax on operators in the Budget, dealing a blow to the industry.

Keeping the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), as the windfall tax is officially known since it was first introduced by a Conservative government at the height of the 2022 energy crisis, would wipe out all non-essential investment in the UK shelf, as it would compete with friendlier tax jurisdictions, according to WoodMac.

The UK has one of the highest tax rates of all major producing basins worldwide. Together with the windfall tax, which the government kept against industry calls for reform, operators are paying a massive 78% overall tax rate.

This has prompted many companies to halt investment in the UK and move to cut workforce numbers.

The latest announcement came from one of the top independent producers, Harbour Energy, which on Monday said it expects to reduce employee numbers by another 100, on top of 600 jobs already eliminated since 2023.

The industry slammed the government’s decision, arguing that the windfall tax will eventually bury the offshore oil and gas industry and threaten Britain’s energy security.

“The future of North Sea energy depends on investment, which won’t come without urgent reform of the windfall tax,” Offshore Energies UK Chief Executive, David Whitehouse, said in a statement.

“The government turned down £50 billion of investment for the UK and the chance to protect the jobs and industries that keep this country running. Instead, they’ve chosen a path that will see 1,000 jobs continue to be lost every month, more energy imports and a contagion across supply chains and our industrial heartlands,” Whitehouse added.

The Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce said it’s “Lights out for North Sea oil and gas as Chancellor keeps windfall tax.”

The Chamber’s chief executive, Russell Borthwick, commented that instead of heeding advice from industry, “the UK Government has instead opted for a cliff-edge end to North Sea production and to tax the industry to death inside five years. Jobs will be lost in their thousands as a direct result of this government’s failure to act.”

[TITLE]Nigeria Opens 50 Oil and Gas Blocks in $10 Billion Investment Push:
[TEXT]
Nigeria has tendered 50 oil and gas blocks, eyeing $10 billion in new investments over the next ten years and 400,000 barrels daily in additional production capacity, local media report.

The blocks on offer include 15 offshore deposits, 19 frontier fields, and one deepwater block, the head of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Gbenga Komolafe, said.

“The Commission understands that in today’s volatile global energy landscape, certainty and predictability have become the true currencies of investment,” Komolafe said, adding that “Through extensive multi-client surveys, the NUPRC has reprocessed thousands of kilometres of 2D and 3D seismic data, producing sharper, higher-resolution images of our petroleum systems and reducing uncertainties that once hindered exploration decisions.”

The oil commission first announced the tender in November, when Komolafe reviewed progress already made in the investment encouragement space. Since the start of this year, 46 field development plans have been approved, the active rig count has topped 60, and crude output has climbed to 1.71 million barrels per day, peaking at 1.83 million. The official also said recent final investment decisions—including $5 billion for Bonga North, $500 million for Ubeta Gas, and $2 billion for Shell’s HI Gas project—reflect renewed investor confidence in Nigeria’s oil and gas industry.

Lately, oil majors have been boosting their presence in Nigeria, in further evidence of progress on the part of the country’s government. Last week, Shell completed the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in Nigeria’s OML 118 Production Sharing Contract, raising its stake in the deep-water Bonga field from 55% to 65% and reinforcing its commitment to growing upstream output.

TotalEnergies, meanwhile, sold a 40% stake in two exploration licenses offshore Nigeria to Chevron, retaining another 40% in the acreage, remaining operator of the projects. A senior TotalEnergies executive said the tie-up with Chevron would derisk and develop new opportunities in the West African oil producer.

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]ZenaTech Expands Drone as a Service to Australia with Offer to Acquire a Survey Firm Serving Government and Natural Resources and Commercial Sectors:
[TEXT]
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology business solution provider specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone as a Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS, and Quantum Computing solutions, today announces it has signed an offer to acquire a long-established, multi-office Queensland, Australia-based surveying and spatial services firm, marking a significant step in the company’s global expansion strategy. This targeted acquisition represents ZenaTech’s first entry into Australia and provides a strategic gateway for expanding the Drone as a Service platform throughout the broader Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, strengthening the company’s position in one of the world’s most active mining and industrial ecosystems.

“Australia is a globally significant market for mining, infrastructure, and high-precision spatial data, and this opportunity aligns directly with ZenaTech’s long-term vision for international DaaS expansion,” said Shaun Passley, Ph.D., ZenaTech CEO. “This acquisition provides a strategic entry point into the APAC region and positions ZenaTech to deliver advanced drone-enabled solutions to government and commercial clients across key sectors.”

The target firm is a long-established, multi-office Australian surveying and spatial services firm with a proven history of delivering high-quality outcomes across a range of public and private sector projects. It is an early adopter of leading survey technologies with advanced reality-capture and geospatial capabilities, including drone-enabled survey workflows, LiDAR, and mobile mapping, applied consistently across its service offerings.

This acquisition would extend Drone as a Service into a new vertical within the natural resources sector. By integrating the target company’s advanced spatial capabilities with ZenaTech’s drone solutions, the company anticipates a more comprehensive and sector-diverse offering to one of Australia’s most data-intensive and resource-driven markets.

ZenaTech’s Drone as a Service (DaaS) offering is designed to provide business and government clients with flexible and on-demand or subscription-based access to drone services for surveying, inspection, maintenance, power washing, inventory management, precision agriculture, and other services, without the capital costs or operational burdens of ownership. By acquiring established, profitable service companies ready for drone innovation, ZenaTech is building a global, multi-service DaaS network anchored by existing customers and recurring revenue.

[TITLE]Claim: “lack of long-term revenue certainty” is Crashing Aussie Renewable Investment.:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

Are renewables investors worried the subsidies could cease?

Australia could miss clean energy target as solar and wind investment slumps, investors warn Expert cautions large pipeline of potential projects will not deliver required energy capacity unless companies make final investments Graham Readfearn and Adam Morton

Mon 1 Dec 2025 19.22 AEDT … Clean Energy Regulator data shows the government agency expects 2.5GW of industry-scale renewable energy capacity to reach a final investment decision this year, down from 4GW last year. The 12-month average for investment commitments on new developments is at its lowest since early 2017.

… … chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, Richie Merzian, said the lower financial investment decisions were a “symptom of deep structural issues, not just a blip”. “The structural issues include state planning delays, grid connection uncertainty, transmission constraints, rising project costs and lack of long-term revenue certainty,” he said. Merzian said the underwriting program had helped to develop a large pipeline of potential projects, but that they would not deliver the new energy capacity needed unless companies made final investments. “The contrast between the large pipeline and the limited number reaching [financial investment decision] indicates a system that is not functioning as intended,” he said. … Read more: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/01/australia-could-miss-clean-energy-target-as-solar-and-wind-investment-slumps-investors-warn

[TITLE]Shareholder Frustration Kills Massive UK Renewable Infrastructure Fund Merger:
[TEXT]
HICL's portfolio includes UK infrastructure like the High Speed 1 rail link, while TRIG specializes in renewable assets across Britain and Europe, with both boards remaining convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination.

The deal was called off because HICL's board determined it could not proceed without substantial support from its own investors, who were reportedly frustrated with the terms.

HICL Infrastructure and The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) have abandoned their planned merger, which would have created the UK's largest infrastructure investment firm.

A plan to merge two FTSE-listed funds to form the UK’s largest infrastructure investment firm has been abandoned after shareholders expressed frustration with the terms of the deal.

HICL Infrastructure said it will no longer be proceeding with its planned merger with The Renewables Infrastructure Group (TRIG) after its board “determined that it cannot progress the transaction without a substantial majority of support from its own investors”.

“Both boards remain convinced of the strategic rationale for the combination,” HICL added.

As part of the terms of the deal, TRIG shareholders would have had the option of a partial cash exit of up to £250m in aggregate, representing approximately 11 per cent of TRIG’s share capital.

Assuming full take-up of the partial cash option, HICL shareholders were expected to hold 56 per cent, and TRIG shareholders 44 per cent, of the combined company.

But the deal, first announced on 17 November, attracted significant pushback from shareholders.

“We see multiple reasons for TRIG shareholders to be excited by the proposal, but fewer for HICL shareholders, where a liquidity opportunity is lacking despite a material shift in strategy and portfolio,” analysts at Peel Hunt said.

“Whilst we applaud the boards of both companies for working on a transformative transaction, we are concerned by the balance of incentives for each set of shareholders.”

TRIG shares fell 3.8 per cent to 71p following the announcement, while HICL shares rose 4.2 per cent to 118p.

Government and energy assets

HICL was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange in 2006 and was originally set up to invest in infrastructure projects developed under the UK’s private finance initiative (PFI).

HICL’s portfolio includes a host of UK infrastructure assets such as the High Speed 1 rail link, the Westminster headquarters of the Home Office, The Northwood headquarters of the Ministry of Defence and Lewisham hospital.

TRIG, which was formed in 2013 to specialise in renewable infrastructure, operates a portfolio comprising stakes in several dozen wind and solar projects across Britain as well as further afield in Germany, France and Spain.

[TITLE]EU, FG Partner to Close Nigeria's Power Sector Skills Gap:
[TEXT]
The Federal Government has warned that Nigeria’s power sector reforms risk stalling unless urgent steps are taken to close the widening skills gap across the electricity value chain, even as the European Union announced fresh support for renewable energy deployment and workforce development in the country.

The union also stated that it has invested more than €200m in grants since 2008 to support Nigeria’s power sector, including policy reforms, capacity building, and market development.

It added that under its current 2021–2027 programme, the target is to support Nigeria in adding 4,00 megawatts of renewable energy capacity, a move expected to supply cleaner electricity to

[TITLE]Talen Energy (TLN) Falls Following a Decline in Utilities:

The share price of Talen Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:TLN) fell by 6.87% between November 26 and December 3, 2025, putting it among the Energy Stocks that Lost the Most This Week.

Talen Energy (TLN) Falls Following a Decline in Utilities

Photo by Matthew Henry on Unsplash

Talen Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:TLN) is a leading independent power producer and energy infrastructure company with 10.7 GW of generation assets.

Talen Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:TLN) gained over 7% in the last week of November after the company announced that it had completed the acquisitions of two power stations in Ohio in a deal valued at around $3.5 billion, after adjusting for estimated tax benefits. The acquisitions added nearly 2.9 GW of baseload generation to Talen’s portfolio, offering additional reliable capacity to hyperscale data centers and large commercial offtakers. So the recent dip in share price could be due to profit-taking by investors.

Moreover, there has been a decline in the overall utilities sector over the last week, possibly due to investors flocking to higher-risk sectors, betting that weak jobs data would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. In addition, the recent earnings season has also sparked investor concerns that the mega data-center deals that had driven the utility sector’s explosive growth over the last year may be much slower than originally expected.

While we acknowledge the potential of TLN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you’re looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]4 questions utilities need to ask to drive grid modernization efforts:
[TEXT]
The need for the grid to change and evolve on both a technical and fundamental level has been recognized by utilities across the nation. While most fully understand the need for greater resilience, the challenge lies in defining the specific path forward when it comes to specifics like the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) or the overhaul of established processes and workflows. Answers to solve these challenges will always be contingent on the questions that are being asked to solve them, and there’s no better place to find those than DTECH, taking place February 2-5 in San Diego. The event features a comprehensive program that includes numerous sessions exploring the most pressing issues in the energy industry.

How does a utility practically define and prioritize asset health data requirements across functions? What factors will most impact the performance, reliability, and security of DER communications? Where is the best place to start to lay the right foundation for scalable, insight-driven asset strategies?

John McDonald, Founder & CEO of JDM Associates, LLC., has been supporting the effort to define those answers for decades. With over fifty years of experience, five co-authored books, and a U.S. patent, he’s a member of the DTECH planning committee that helps program the event. His insights have helped utilities ask the right questions in countless ways, some of which have little to do with the technology itself.
