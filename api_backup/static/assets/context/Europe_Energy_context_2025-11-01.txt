[TITLE]Saudi Arabia, UAE Pour Over $130 B Into AI To Offset Oil Price Risks:
[TEXT]
Previously, we reported that Saudi Arabia is digging in for a "long and shallow" oil price war as it looks to regain market share from rivals like U.S. shale producers and OPEC+ members who have been exceeding their production quotas. This comes after Saudi Arabia made significant production sacrifices to support prices for over three years, which allowed competitors to increase their output. Saudi Arabia has also been hedging its oil price bets by rapidly diversifying its economy away from fossil fuels in recent years, expanding into areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), sports and tourism. Indeed, Saudi Arabia's Minister for Investment Khalid Al Falih has revealed that non-oil activities now drive more than half the country’s GDP, with that percentage growing.

And, the battle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for Middle East AI supremacy is quickly heating up. The two countries are not only spending heavily to beef up their AI infrastructure, including building some of the world’s largest data center clusters, but are also forming strategic alliances with U.S. tech giants. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 strategy has singled out AI as vital to the country’s economic transformation, with 70% of its goals involving data and AI.

Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence company Humain has launched a $10 billion venture capital fund called Humain Ventures dedicated to investing in AI startups across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Humain Ventures is a key part of Saudi Arabia's larger strategy to become a global hub for AI, and a key part of its Vision 2030 plan for economic diversification. Launched earlier in the current year, Humain has already begun deploying capital into AI infrastructure projects. In pursuit of its AI ambitions, Humain also entered into significant partnerships with major U.S. technology companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud service AWS, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and giant data center REIT Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX).

Back in May, Oracle announced a $14 billion investment in Saudi Arabia's digital cloud and AI infrastructure over 10 years, as part of its commitment to the Kingdom's Vision 2030. This investment will expand the company's cloud and AI presence by building a comprehensive network of data centers, including existing regions in Riyadh and Jeddah and planned expansions in NEOM and Dammam. AWS and Humain have announced a joint $5 billion investment to build an AI zone in the Kingdom. Meanwhile, Equinix has announced plans to build a $1 billion data center in Saudi Arabia to meet surging demand for AI, cloud and enterprise workloads.

The UAE has also launched a slew of AI investments. Last year, the Abu Dhabi government launched MGX, a technology investment company specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced technologies. The fund was founded as a partnership between Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, and the AI and cloud computing company G42. MGX focuses on AI infrastructure (data centers and connectivity), Semiconductors (chip design and manufacturing)

Core AI technologies and applications (software, data, and robotics). At its launch, MGX had a target of managing over $100 billion in assets, making it one of the largest funds in the world dedicated to AI.

Since its March 2024 launch, MGX has made several high-profile moves, showcasing its ambition to become a major player in the global AI industry. In September 2024, MGX formed a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) dubbed the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to invest up to $100 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure. Nvidia is a key partner of GAIIP, offering its expertise in AI factories and data centers. Meanwhile, Stargate UAE is a massive AI data center cluster in Abu Dhabi, developed in partnership between the Emirati AI firm G42 and US tech giants like OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Stargate UAE is the first international deployment of OpenAI's ambitious global AI infrastructure initiative, also named "Stargate". Positioned as a "national infrastructure," Stargate UAE will provide the country with its own powerful and secure AI capabilities as part of the UAE's broader strategy to diversify its economy and reduce reliance on external technology infrastructure. The project's central feature is a 1-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster, with an initial 200-megawatt phase planned to be operational by 2026. This facility will be equipped with advanced Nvidia hardware to meet the massive computational demands of training and running large AI models.

Further, Abu Dhabi has unveiled plans to invest AED 13 billion (equivalent to $3.54 billion) in its Digital Strategy 2025–2027, with the goal of becoming the world's first fully "AI-native" government by 2027. The strategy aims to automate 100% of all government processes and integrate AI into all digital services.

[TITLE]$110 Billion Hydrogen Boom Meets Bureaucratic Bottlenecks in Europe:
[TEXT]
The global hydrogen industry came into view, specifically from importing countries’ perspective, at European Hydrogen Week earlier this month in Brussels.

There was a palpable sense of frustration with what many consider an overbearing regulatory framework causing delays. But also a sense of inevitability, with hydrogen mandates in place and pipeline construction now underway. Europe is set to be the world’s largest demand center for low-carbon hydrogen.

There was also a sense of determination in the face of a growing number of project cancelations.

“The tourists are gone,” said Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, CEO, Hydrogen Europe, an industry group based in Brussels. As weaker projects have fallen by the wayside, he emphasized the need for realism with policies such as mandatory minimum offtake requirements for large industries.

Hydrogen, he said, is now at a crossroads and there is a need to relax regulations to allow the clean hydrogen market to take shape.

Projects and progress

Progress on a few big projects was highlighted, such as the recent offtake agreement between the German energy company RWE AG and the French oil major TotalEnergies. Some 30,000 metric tons green hydrogen, produced at RWE's 300-megawatt electrolysis plant in Lingen, will move annually by pipeline 600km to Total’s refinery in Saxony-Anhalt beginning in 2030.

Progress was also reported at Port of Rotterdam, where Shell is building electrolyzer capacity of 200 MW to produce some 22,000 metric tons green hydrogen annually. This will move from the production site on Maasvlakte

[TEXT]
Crippled refineries in Russia and the advancing winter in Europe are expected to pump up demand for Indian petro-products till the end of March. The Indian refineries may be in prime position to tap the demand, given that they have expanded their crude oil sourcing over the years, and completed scheduled annual maintenance.

[TITLE]Supermajors Bet Big on Long-Term Oil Demand:
[TEXT]
Oil companies are confident in their long-term strategy, even as they slash costs and workforce numbers to protect shareholder payouts amidst the current market conditions.

European and U.S. supermajors are investing in new oil and gas field developments and exploration, with companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron achieving record production volumes.

Major international oil firms are increasing production despite weakening crude prices and a global supply surplus, anticipating sustained demand until at least the mid-2030s.

The world’s largest international oil firms are ramping up production even as crude prices have weakened this year and global supply growth continues to outpace the demand increase, setting the stage for a glut in the coming months.

The European majors are back to investing in exploration and new oil and gas field developments after years of trying – and mostly failing – to generate profits and good returns from low-carbon energy projects, including renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and biofuels.

Big Oil Output Hits Record Highs

The U.S. supermajors, ExxonMobil and Chevron, are pumping record oil volumes in the top shale region, the Permian, while betting on international project expansions in Guyana and Kazakhstan, for example. The U.S. giants both reported in the second quarter record-high production in the Permian and worldwide, following Exxon’s acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron’s buying of Hess.

France’s TotalEnergies expects higher oil and gas production to have boosted earnings for the third quarter, despite a $10 per barrel decline in oil prices since last year.

Production at the other European supermajors, Shell and BP, is also rising as the European giants shifted focus back to their core oil and gas business. The pivot took place after the energy crisis made energy security and affordability more important than sustainability, while high interest rates and supply chain issues further reduced already meager returns from clean energy projects and made many new energy ventures uncompetitive.

Big Oil Bets on Solid Demand

The supermajors are confident they can withstand the current weaker prices and the surplus on the market, to which they have contributed, alongside the national oil companies of the OPEC+ producers, which have been reversing the production cuts this year.

Big Oil is looking beyond the short-term fundamentals and glut noise, having decided to invest more in oil and gas to meet solid demand until at least the mid-2030s.

Unlike the International Energy Agency (IEA), which earlier this year doubled down on its forecast of peak oil demand by the end of this decade, Big Oil companies don’t see any peak by 2030.

BP, which said last year that global oil demand would peak as early as this year, ditched this view in its new annual Energy Outlook last month, in which it now expects oil demand to rise through 2030 amid weaker-than-expected efficiency gains.

Most majors have put the peak at some point in the 2030s, but none expect a rapid decline afterwards, and all say that oil and gas will remain essential for global economic growth and development in 2050.

“Oil and natural gas are essential. There’s no other viable way to meet the world’s energy needs,” ExxonMobil said in its 2025 Global Outlook.

Set OilPrice.com as a preferred source in Google here

“Our Global Outlook projects that oil and natural gas will make up more than half of the world’s energy supply in 2050. We project that oil demand will stabilize after 2030, remaining above 100 million barrels per day through 2050,” the U.S. supermajor reckons.

“All major credible scenarios include oil and natural gas as a dominant energy source in 2050.”

All three scenarios analyzed in Shell’s 2025 Energy Security Scenarios found that upstream investment of around $600 billion a year “will be required for decades to come as the rate of depletion of oil and gas fields is two to three times the potential future annual declines in demand.”

Exxon and now the European majors are playing the long game—invest in new oil and gas supply, at the expense of renewables, to offset with new production the accelerating natural decline of producing oil and gas fields.

Even the IEA admitted last month that the world needs to develop new oil and gas resources just to keep output flat amid faster declining rates at existing fields, in a major shift in its narrative from 2021 that ‘no new investment’ is needed in a net-zero by 2050 scenario.

Exploration is also back at the top of the agenda for Big Oil, as the companies appear confident their product will be in demand for decades to come.

The expected massive overhang later this year and early next year is not putting off the supermajors’ plans to increase production. They are slashing costs via cutting thousands of workforce numbers to protect shareholder payouts at $60 per barrel oil. Companies have pledged billions of U.S. dollars in cost savings and slimmer corporate structures. That’s to eliminate inefficiencies and excessive costs while keeping payouts to shareholders at much lower prices compared to the 2022 highs.

This year, higher oil and gas production is partly offsetting the weaker prices.

Increased output also positions the world’s biggest companies for rising profits when the glut clears within a year or so, analysts say.

“All the supply coming to the market is shrinking OPEC’s spare capacity — so there’s a light at end of the tunnel,” Barclays analyst Betty Jiang told Bloomberg this week.

“Whether that’s second half of 2026 or 2027, the balance is going to tighten. It’s just a matter of when.”

[TITLE]Analysts Eye Big Oil's Spending and Acquisition Plans:
[TEXT]
Despite lower international oil prices and predictions of a supply overhang, Big Oil is expected to increase oil and gas output in both the current and coming year, indicating a belief in demand resilience that contrasts with some other forecasts.

Natural gas, particularly LNG, is a major focus for these companies, with Shell, BP, TotalEnergies, Exxon, and Chevron all making significant investments and plans for expansion in response to rising global electricity demand.

Big Oil is reporting third-quarter results this week and next. No surprises are expected—Big Oil has been having an eventful year featuring tariffs, sanctions, and glut predictions—and these events will be reflected in financial reports. Yet analysts are already looking ahead to 2036 and what Big Oil plans to do next.

So far, two big oil companies have reported third-quarter figures: Norway’s Equinor and Italy’s Eni. Both demonstrated the dominant trends in the industry, likely to be seen in the reports of BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon, and Chevron in the coming days. Equinor missed analyst expectations because of lower prices, despite higher oil and gas production, while Eni enjoyed better revenues and profits thanks to higher oil and gas production, despite lower prices. Shell and TotalEnergies today reported strong performance on higher oil and gas production.

What analysts appear to be interested in, according to a preliminary earnings season overview by Reuters, is what Big Oil plans to do in 2026 in terms of spending, production, and maybe acquisitions. They would want to hear how Chevron’s merger with Hess Corp. is going, what Exxon’s next acquisition target is going to be, and how European Big Oil will handle its share buybacks and dividends in a lower-price environment. Last but by no means least, analysts would want to hear

[TITLE]Gran Tierra Energy Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results and Announces Further Exploration Success in Ecuador:
[TEXT]
Gran Tierra Secures $200 Million Prepayment Facility Highlighting Strength of Portfolio

Increase and Extension of Canadian Credit Facility

Three Major Ecuador Discoveries Add to the Existing Success in Country

Colombia’s Southern Putumayo Cohembi Field Achieves Highest Production in a Decade

CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:GTE) (TSX:GTE) (LSE: GTE) announced the Company’s financial and operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 (the “Quarter”) and provided an operational update. All dollar amounts are in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and all production volumes are on an average working interest before royalties (“WI”) basis unless otherwise indicated. Production is expressed in barrels (“bbl”) of oil equivalent (“boe”) per day (“boepd” or “boe/d”) and are based on WI sales before royalties. For per boe amounts based on net after royalty (“NAR”) production, see Gran Tierra’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed October 30, 2025.

Message to Shareholders

“The Third Quarter showcased continued operational success across our portfolio. In Ecuador, we achieved further exploration success with the Conejo A-1 and A-2 wells and confirmed a new discovery at Chanangue-1, all of which highlight the significant potential of our acreage position. We also recently cased and cemented the Conejo A-2 well, targeting multiple prospective reservoirs including the Basal Tena and Hollin. The well discovered 41 feet of net reservoir with an average porosity of 13.8% in the Hollin formation suggesting well-connected reservoir quality over the full Conejo structural trap.

In Colombia, new wells at Costayaco continued to perform well, and the Cohembi field delivered a strong waterflood response, with production reaching levels not seen in over a decade. In Canada, we successfully drilled and brought two additional Lower Montney wells onstream, both meeting or exceeding expectations.

Production during the Quarter was temporarily impacted primarily by externally driven events, including a landslide in Ecuador that required the shut in of all Ecuador production for several weeks and trunk line repairs at the Moqueta field which resulted in the field being shut in for the Quarter. These volumes represent deferred bbls rather than lost production, and we are already seeing a strong recovery, with current production(2) averaging approximately 45,200 boepd. Based on the deferrals, we are forecasting the lower end of our production guidance range. The underlying assets continue to perform well, and our teams remain focused on ongoing optimization and maximizing production efficiency and cash flow with an expected exit rate of 47,000 to 50,000 boepd. We completed a number of initiatives to enhance liquidity and will be releasing our 2026 budget in mid December which will focus on free cash flow generation. The 2025 capital program was focused on fulfilling exploration commitments, which resulted in numerous material discoveries, and facility construction primarily in the Suroriente Block. With substantially all commitments behind us, the focus turns to free cash flow generation from our substantial, diversified resource base and deleveraging,” commented Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra Energy.

Operational Update:

Ecuador Another successful exploration well, Conejo A-1 was drilled during the Quarter on budget. The well was subsequently completed and tested the Hollin and Basal Tena sands. The Basal Tena and Hollin oil zones perforated over 19 feet (“ ft ”) and 40 ft of reservoir, respectively. Under natural flow conditions, the well has produced at stabilized rates over 308 hours at 1,328 bbls of oil per day (“ bopd ”), 26.9-degree API gravity oil, a 23.7% water cut, and a gas-oil ratio of 289 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel. During the fourth quarter, the Company plans to re-enter the well to install the final completion and conduct selective testing of each zone to optimize total well production. The Conejo A-2 well was spud on October 4, 2025, targeting multiple prospective reservoirs including the Basal Tena and Hollin. The well included coring of key intervals to further evaluate reservoir characteristics and potential. The Conejo A-2 well discovered 41 ft of net reservoir with an average porosity of 13.8% in the Hollin formation. Of particular interest is the outstanding reservoir quality suggesting high deliverability over the full Conejo structural trap. With the delivery of the Conejo A-2 well, Gran Tierra has completed all of the Exploration commitments in Ecuador and we are now well-positioned to continue to increase production into the development phase and establish our long-term growth position in Ecuador. A new oil discovery was made in the legacy Chanangue-1 well drilled in 1990 and suspended in 1992 on the Chanangue Block. The well was re-entered to test the previously bypassed Basal Tena formation, which was subsequently perforated and brought online. The well is currently producing approximately 600 bopd on jet pump. This discovery highlights significant reserve potential and is expected to generate additional future drilling opportunities on the eastern side of the Chanangue Block.

Colombia During the Quarter, Gran Tierra’s development program in the northern area of the Costayaco field continued to perform well, with all three new wells contributing to production growth. The Costayaco-63, -64, and -65 wells were drilled and brought onstream between late June to mid-August, achieving average initial 30-day oil rates ranging from approximately 600 to 1,100 bopd with water cuts between 25% and 70%. Combined production from these wells during the Quarter averaged approximately 1,700 bopd with an average water cut of around 60%, helping sustain stable field output. We are currently changing the artificial lift system from jet pump to electronic submersible pumps which is expected to add an incremental 1,000 - 1,500 bopd. Cohembi continues to deliver a strong waterflood response, with the five development wells drilled during the first half of 2025. Output from the northern area has increased by approximately 135%, rising from 2,800 to 6,700 gross bopd, with additional gains anticipated. Total field production has now exceeded 9,000 gross bopd – levels not achieved since 2014. Drilling has commenced a 6-well program which includes the Raju-1 exploration well, the 2nd well in the program, which is expected to spud in early November. The Raju-1 exploration well will be targeting a large prospective area north of the current development. We expect to have initial results from this well prior to year end 2025.

Canada Two additional Lower Montney wells were drilled, completed, and brought on stream in September, bringing total 2025 activity in Simonette to 4.0 gross (2.0 net) wells. Initial production performance has been very encouraging, with one well exceeding high-case expectations and another tracking closely to the base case and still cleaning up.

Capital Structure Optimization:

Executed Oriente Crude Oil Agreements providing for an initial advance of up to $150 million and an additional $50 million, to be repaid through scheduled deliveries of Ecuadorian Oriente crude oil; proceeds are expected to be used to repay debt and fund select capital initiatives.

Amended Colombian credit facility to align with the new prepayment structure, enhancing financial flexibility, reducing standby costs, and optimizing Gran Tierra’s overall capital structure.

Subsequent to the Quarter, the Company amended and restated the existing credit agreement of Gran Tierra Canada Ltd. (“ GT Canada ”) pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement dated October 30, 2025 to, among other things, increase the total available borrowing capacity available under its credit facilities (the “Canadian Credit Facilities”) from C$50.0 million to C$75.0 million. Other key amendments to the Canadian Credit Facilities as a result of such amendment and restatement are summarized as follows: The tenor of the Canadian Credit Facilities was extended by one year and converted from a “one year revolving facility with a one year term-out period” into a “two year revolving facility” with a maturity date of October 31, 2027; GT Canada’s lender completed its semi-annual borrowing base review, which resulted in the borrowing base remaining at C$100.0 million; and The existing uncommitted accordion feature (which contemplates a further increase of the Canadian Credit Facilities) was reduced from C$50.0 million to C$25.0 million.

Key Highlights of the Quarter:

Production: Gran Tierra’s total average WI production was 42,685 boepd, which was 30% higher than the third quarter of 2024 due to the production from the Canadian operations acquired on October 31, 2024 and positive exploration well drilling results in Ecuador. Total average WI production was 10% lower than the quarter ended June 30, 2025 (the “ Prior Quarter ”) primarily as a result of a landslide in Ecuador that required the shut in of all Ecuador production for several weeks and trunk line repairs at the Moqueta field which resulted in the field being shut in for the Quarter. Working interest sales in the Quarter were 44,077 boepd primarily due to the recognition of 143,730 bbls of Ecuador oil production, which were held in inventory at the end of June and subsequently sold in July.

[TITLE]British Businesses to Save over £400m a Year as Government Slashes Electricity Costs:
[TEXT]
Government slashes electricity costs to save British businesses over £400m a year from April 2026 through landmark support under the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy.

UK industry including steel, chemicals, cement, glass and paper employing around 400,000 people to benefit from 90% discount on their electricity network charges.

Unprecedented support brings UK industrial energy costs in line with European competitors to protect jobs and attract new investment, helping drive growth and deliver Plan for Change.

Around 500 of the UK’s most energy-intensive businesses are set to save up to £420 million per year on their electricity bills from next April, as the Government takes decisive action to slash industrial energy costs.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle has today (31 October) announced that government will power ahead with plans to increase the discount on electricity network charges for businesses in sectors like steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, which employ around 400,000 people in total across the UK, from 60 percent to 90 percent.

Some of these businesses currently pay the highest industrial electricity prices in the G7, making it harder to stay competitive on the international stage, which is why the Government has taken decisive action to deliver this relief and level the playing field for industry.

The landmark support, which is being delivered at no extra cost to taxpayers, fulfils a crucial promise in the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy launched in June, and follows a four-week consultation on the plans for the increased discount which ran between July and August this year.

The increased discount will also slash costs for a range of businesses across Scotland and Wales to help them support local jobs and deliver growth, including Tata Steel at Port Talbot and INEOS in Grangemouth, ensuring the benefits are felt right across the country.

It comes on top of the Government’s landmark British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme announced in the modern Industrial Strategy, which will slash energy costs by 25 percent for over 7,000 businesses from 2027 in sectors like aerospace, automotive and chemicals, supporting hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs in these industries.

The Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will be funded through reforms to the energy system. The Government is reducing costs within the system to free up funding without raising household bills or taxes.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

British industry deserves a level playing field – and this government is delivering it. We’ve heard businesses loud and clear, and this landmark support will help them stay competitive on the global stage so they can invest and grow here in the UK. This is our Modern Industrial Strategy in action: practical, targeted support that secures jobs, attracts investment and drives our economy forward, as part of our Plan for Change.

Encirc Glass Managing Director Sean Murphy said:

This will be a major boost for our industry and will help British glass manufacturers compete with cheaper imports from regions that do not bear the same level of cost and regulation. By cutting the costs of energy in this way, the government is helping our industry to support thousands of jobs across the country whilst we make the transition to renewable sources of power. We welcomed the opportunity to engage with the Minister on the pressing challenges facing our sector. Continued government support for vital industries like glass manufacturing is essential to safeguarding jobs and unlocking investment across all regions of the UK.

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce said:

Our research shows energy costs remain a major concern, forcing many businesses who are struggling to pay their bills to raise prices. Energy is a business essential not a luxury. The promise of cheaper bills for hundreds of energy-intensive firms through increasing the discount on electricity network charges is welcome.

Community Union Assistant General Secretary Alasdair McDiarmid said:

We welcome the government’s determination to reduce the industrial energy costs which are such a huge burden on energy-intensive industries like steel. Whilst there is still more to do, the decision to increase the level of compensation for network charging costs from 60% to 90% is a huge step in the right direction. This will help avert carbon leakage, and will go some way towards boosting the competitiveness of our steel producers in line with European counterparts. After long years of neglect, our members in the steel sector know that they now have a government which is on their side.

The increased discount under the Network Charging Compensation (NCC) Scheme will bring down electricity bills for businesses by slashing the prices they pay to access the UK’s electricity network.

This will help bring industrial energy prices in line with other major European economies to keep the UK competitive on the global stage, protect local jobs in the UK’s foundational industries, and attract new investment, delivering on the Government’s Plan for Change.

The Government is also driving forward plans to have a new Connections Accelerator Service in force by the end of 2025, which will streamline access to the UK’s electricity grid.

This will make it easier for major investment projects to speed up delivery, bringing new high-quality jobs and growth to local communities and boosting the UK’s investment attractiveness further.

[TITLE]Supermajors Bet Big on Long-Term Oil Demand:
[TEXT]
Oil companies are confident in their long-term strategy, even as they slash costs and workforce numbers to protect shareholder payouts amidst the current market conditions.

European and U.S. supermajors are investing in new oil and gas field developments and exploration, with companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron achieving record production volumes.

Major international oil firms are increasing production despite weakening crude prices and a global supply surplus, anticipating sustained demand until at least the mid-2030s.

The world’s largest international oil firms are ramping up production even as crude prices have weakened this year and global supply growth continues to outpace the demand increase, setting the stage for a glut in the coming months.

The European majors are back to investing in exploration and new oil and gas field developments after years of trying – and mostly failing – to generate profits and good returns from low-carbon energy projects, including renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and biofuels.

Big Oil Output Hits Record Highs

The U.S. supermajors, ExxonMobil and Chevron, are pumping record oil volumes in the top shale region, the Permian, while betting on international project expansions in Guyana and Kazakhstan, for example. The U.S. giants both reported in the second quarter record-high production in the Permian and worldwide, following Exxon’s acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron’s buying of Hess.

France’s TotalEnergies expects higher oil and gas production to have boosted earnings for the third quarter, despite a $10 per barrel decline in oil prices since last year.

Production at the other European supermajors, Shell and BP, is also rising as the European giants shifted focus back to their core oil and gas business. The pivot took place after the energy crisis made energy security and affordability more important than sustainability, while high interest rates and supply chain issues further reduced already meager returns from clean energy projects and made many new energy ventures uncompetitive.

Big Oil Bets on Solid Demand

The supermajors are confident they can withstand the current weaker prices and the surplus on the market, to which they have contributed, alongside the national oil companies of the OPEC+ producers, which have been reversing the production cuts this year.

Big Oil is looking beyond the short-term fundamentals and glut noise, having decided to invest more in oil and gas to meet solid demand until at least the mid-2030s.

Unlike the International Energy Agency (IEA), which earlier this year doubled down on its forecast of peak oil demand by the end of this decade, Big Oil companies don’t see any peak by 2030.

BP, which said last year that global oil demand would peak as early as this year, ditched this view in its new annual Energy Outlook last month, in which it now expects oil demand to rise through 2030 amid weaker-than-expected efficiency gains.

Most majors have put the peak at some point in the 2030s, but none expect a rapid decline afterwards, and all say that oil and gas will remain essential for global economic growth and development in 2050.

“Oil and natural gas are essential. There’s no other viable way to meet the world’s energy needs,” ExxonMobil said in its 2025 Global Outlook.

“Our Global Outlook projects that oil and natural gas will make up more than half of the world’s energy supply in 2050. We project that oil demand will stabilize after 2030, remaining above 100 million barrels per day through 2050,” the U.S. supermajor reckons.

“All major credible scenarios include oil and natural gas as a dominant energy source in 2050.”

All three scenarios analyzed in Shell’s 2025 Energy Security Scenarios found that upstream investment of around $600 billion a year “will be required for decades to come as the rate of depletion of oil and gas fields is two to three times the potential future annual declines in demand.”

Exxon and now the European majors are playing the long game—invest in new oil and gas supply, at the expense of renewables, to offset with new production the accelerating natural decline of producing oil and gas fields.

Even the IEA admitted last month that the world needs to develop new oil and gas resources just to keep output flat amid faster declining rates at existing fields, in a major shift in its narrative from 2021 that ‘no new investment’ is needed in a net-zero by 2050 scenario.

Exploration is also back at the top of the agenda for Big Oil, as the companies appear confident their product will be in demand for decades to come.

The expected massive overhang later this year and early next year is not putting off the supermajors’ plans to increase production. They are slashing costs via cutting thousands of workforce numbers to protect shareholder payouts at $60 per barrel oil. Companies have pledged billions of U.S. dollars in cost savings and slimmer corporate structures. That’s to eliminate inefficiencies and excessive costs while keeping payouts to shareholders at much lower prices compared to the 2022 highs.

This year, higher oil and gas production is partly offsetting the weaker prices.

Increased output also positions the world’s biggest companies for rising profits when the glut clears within a year or so, analysts say.

“All the supply coming to the market is shrinking OPEC’s spare capacity — so there’s a light at end of the tunnel,” Barclays analyst Betty Jiang told Bloomberg this week.

“Whether that’s second half of 2026 or 2027, the balance is going to tighten. It’s just a matter of when.”

[TITLE]$110 Billion Hydrogen Boom Meets Bureaucratic Bottlenecks in Europe:
[TEXT]
The global hydrogen industry came into view, specifically from importing countries’ perspective, at European Hydrogen Week earlier this month in Brussels.

There was a palpable sense of frustration with what many consider an overbearing regulatory framework causing delays. But also a sense of inevitability, with hydrogen mandates in place and pipeline construction now underway. Europe is set to be the world’s largest demand center for low-carbon hydrogen.

There was also a sense of determination in the face of a growing number of project cancelations.

“The tourists are gone,” said Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, CEO, Hydrogen Europe, an industry group based in Brussels. As weaker projects have fallen by the wayside, he emphasized the need for realism with policies such as mandatory minimum offtake requirements for large industries.

Hydrogen, he said, is now at a crossroads and there is a need to relax regulations to allow the clean hydrogen market to take shape.

Projects and progress

Progress on a few big projects was highlighted, such as the recent offtake agreement between the German energy company RWE AG and the French oil major TotalEnergies. Some 30,000 metric tons green hydrogen, produced at RWE's 300-megawatt electrolysis plant in Lingen, will move annually by pipeline 600km to Total’s refinery in Saxony-Anhalt beginning in 2030.

Progress was also reported at Port of Rotterdam, where Shell is building electrolyzer capacity of 200 MW to produce some 22,000 metric tons green hydrogen annually. This will move from the production site on Maasvlakte

[TITLE]Wells Fargo Says These 2 Utility Stocks Are Among Its ‘Best Ideas’ for the Rest of 2025:
[TEXT]
The first energy stock we’ll look at here, Sempra Energy, is an electric and natural gas utility operating in California and Texas. The San Diego-based company was founded in 1998 and today is one of the largest utility-scale energy networks in North America, with approximately 40 million customers. Sempra has some 20,000 employees and boasted nearly $100 billion in total assets at the end of last year.

With that bullish setup in mind, Pourreza isn’t just speaking in general terms – he pinpoints two utility stocks as his ‘best ideas’ for the rest of the year. But do his top picks align with the broader Wall Street consensus? We turned to the TipRanks database to find out. Let’s dive in.

“We continue to see the sector as discounted vs. its emerging growth attributes/opportunities, including data centers, reshoring, electrification of the system, and other economically driven load growth opportunities. In short, this is one of the strongest backdrops we have seen in the sector, which is not only leveraged to perpetual infrastructure needs, but is now further buoyed by one of the healthiest load growth environments we have seen in more than 20 years of covering this space… The defensive characteristics for the group merely create a floor, limiting downside, but the perfect storm of tailwinds creates materially higher upside opportunities,” the 5-star analyst opined.

Wells Fargo’s Shar Pourreza, who is rated by TipRanks in the top 2% of Wall Street’s analysts, has been giving this sector a long, hard look as 2025 winds toward its close, and he sees utility stocks as sound options for the remainder of the year.

In addition, most utility firms operate in tightly regulated markets and effectively hold monopolies within their regions. For investors, that means a key determinant of performance isn’t the going rate for services, but rather the company’s relationship with its regulatory authority. Maintain that relationship on solid footing, and the firm will remain well-positioned to appeal to investors.

Utility stocks have long attracted investors for several reasons. They provide essential services – we can’t get along in the modern world without running water, reliable electricity, or safe supplies of natural gas. These necessities give the companies that provide them a secure and often predictable business foundation.

Story Continues

Sempra has three main operating divisions: Sempra California, Sempra Texas, and Sempra Infrastructure. In the first, the company’s two utilities, SD&E and SoCalGas, serve some 25 million customers in the southern and central parts of the state, providing electricity and natural gas. The company takes a proactive stance on grid resiliency, understanding that power supplies must be reliable. In addition, Sempra is a leader in bringing renewable energy sources into the distribution network.

Looking at Sempra Texas, we find that the company operates through Oncor Electric Delivery Company. Oncor, headquartered in Dallas, is a regulated electric transmission and distribution company, with more than 143,000 miles of total electric lines in commission. Oncor is one of the largest transmission and distribution companies operating in Texas and serves some 13 million customers across 120 counties.

The Sempra Infrastructure division has a more global focus and includes a portfolio of liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets with approximately 40 million tons capacity per year under construction on the Pacific and Gulf coasts. This division focuses on bringing LNG into the North American utility network and includes more than 4,500 miles of natural gas transport and distribution pipelines. The division’s other work involves operating cross-border projects between the US and Mexico. These include solar and wind power projects, as well as battery storage.

In September of this year, Sempra announced several strategic actions designed to advance the company’s corporate strategy and to bring cash reserves into its coffers. At the center of these actions is the sale of 45% of Sempra Infrastructure Partners to the global investment firm KKR for $10 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in the middle of next year, with the full cash balance to be paid seven years after the closing.

Turning to the company’s financial results, we find that Sempra’s last report, covering 2Q25, showed revenue of $3 billion. This figure was relatively flat year-over-year but missed the forecast by nearly $124 million. At the bottom line, Sempra’s non-GAAP EPS of 89 cents was also the same as the prior-year quarter – and it beat the forecast by 4 cents per share.

Pourreza, in his comments on Sempra, notes the company’s potential earnings strengths and its bullish catalysts in the making.

“Best Idea Regulated Utility… We would be buyers ahead of a key reset in February, especially given current valuation levels, with 7-9% EPS growth unlikely to step back down to 6-8% (i.e., the long-term EPS trajectory is to exceed prior 6-8% guidance),” Pourreza said. “We are very bullish on the outlook for Oncor, especially on the heels of key legislative initiatives that passed, have very little concerns around the CA utilities and believe the recent deal with KKR was banner, as it not only supports growth (still with 25% exposure with SIP) and the balance sheet, but it mitigates risk, which all investors were seeking, by deconsolidating SIP from SRE,”.

The analyst goes on to put an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, with a $115 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential of 24%. (To watch Pourreza’s track record, click here)

The Moderate Buy consensus rating on Sempra is based on 13 recent analyst recommendations that include 9 Buys and 4 Holds. The shares are currently priced at $92.55, and their $96.92 average target price implies a 5% gain in the coming year. (See SRE stock forecast)

Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG)

The next stock we’ll look at is a leader in the US carbon-free power market. Constellation Energy is well-known for its portfolio of electric power generation assets, which includes nuclear, wind, solar, and hydroelectric sources, as well as natural gas sources. The company has been an independent operator since 1999, and from its Baltimore headquarters it oversees a network that extends to 48 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, and the UK.

At its core, Constellation is an electricity provider, with more than 32,400 megawatts of capacity – of which some 90% is carbon-free. The company is the nation’s largest operator of nuclear power plants, and is closely involved in the restart operations of the Crane Clean Energy Center, the Three Mile Island facility formerly known as Unit 1. As of this past September, Constellation is ahead of schedule on the facility restart, which is now targeted for 2027.

In addition to its nuclear work, Constellation is expanding through strategic acquisitions. In January of this year, the company announced its intent to acquire the Texas-based power utility Calpine. The transaction, valued at approximately $16.4 billion and to be conducted in cash and stock, was approved by regulatory authorities in July of this year. The deal is expected to close by year’s end, and to be immediately accretive in terms of revenue.

In another strategic move, Constellation is looking to co-locate its power generation facilities with data centers. This move piggybacks on the hardware aspect of the AI boom; data centers are notorious for their high power consumption. One good example of this co-location strategy is the Crane project on Three Mile Island; that nuclear plant restart includes a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft.

Constellation saw $6.1 billion in revenue during 2Q25, its last reported quarter. This total was up 11.5% from the prior year and beat expectations by $1.19 billion. The company’s earnings, reported as $1.91 per share in non-GAAP terms, were 8 cents per share ahead of the forecast.

According to Wells Fargo’s Shar Pourreza, Constellation’s strong fundamentals, disciplined expansion strategy, and multiple growth catalysts make it one of the most compelling utility plays in the market today.

“Best IPP [Independent Power Producer] idea on a number of near-term catalysts. Incremental DC announcement expected by YE25, constructive datapoints on Crane Clean Energy repowering and opportunities with Calpine acquisition closing (i.e. run rates, DC deals),” Pourreza said. “CEG is becoming the premier nuclear and gas operator in the US with clear tailwinds both new volumes of data center deals (i.e. availability of resources up for contractual arrangements) and the broader commodity upside on power prices in the US as load growth starts to chip at the gap between near term prices and long-term new build economics.”

To this end, Pourreza puts an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on CEG, and his $478 price target implies a gain for the next year of 24%.

Overall, Constellation’s stock gets a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 14 reviews that break down to 11 Buys and 3 Holds. The shares are trading for $384.95 and their average target price of $397.36 offers modest 12-month upside of 3%. (See CEG stock forecast)

[TITLE]Asia-Pacific Smart Metering Report 2025: China, Japan, South Korea Lead; India to Become Fastest-Growing Smart Metering Market Through 2030:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Smart Metering in Asia-Pacific, 7th Edition" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Smart Metering in Asia-Pacific is the seventh consecutive market report analyzes the latest smart metering developments in this dynamic region covering both electricity and gas. The countries covered in-depth include China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Bangladesh, India, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand.

This strategic research report provides you with 240 pages of unique business intelligence, including 5-year industry forecasts, expert commentary and real-life case studies on which to base your business decisions.

Asia-Pacific now home to nearly 1.1 billion connected energy meters

Smart metering is widely regarded as the cornerstone for future smart grids and is currently being deployed all over the developed world, with a growing number of large-scale initiatives now also being launched in developing countries. Asia-Pacific constitutes the world's largest metering market by far with more than 1.8 billion electricity and gas customers - more than North America and Europe combined. Annual demand for electricity meters in the region is in the range of 130-180 million units, of which China accounts for roughly half. The region saw a wave of massive smart metering projects being launched during the first half of the past decade and several utilities in the region are now preparing for rollouts of second-generation meters to take off, driven by new smart meter functionalities and smart energy use cases. Other markets in South and Southeast Asia are on the other hand just beginning their smart metering journeys, following in the footsteps of the leading markets in East Asia.

The analyst forecasts that the installed base of smart electricity meters in Asia-Pacific - defined as China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Bangladesh, India, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand - will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8% throughout the forecast period, from 857.6 million in 2024 to nearly 1.3 billion in 2030. Shipments will to a large extent be driven by firstwave installations in India as well as by replacements of first-generation meters in China and Japan, while emerging markets in South and Southeast Asia will contribute with increasing volumes throughout the forecast period. In total, the analyst forecasts that around 924.7 million smart electricity meters will be shipped in Asia Pacific during 2025-2030.

The installed base of smart gas metering endpoints in the region is at the same time expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.9% throughout the forecast period, from 237.1 million in 2024 to 442.2 million in 2030. China accounts for the vast majority of the market, both in terms of installed base and annual shipment volumes, although emerging markets are expected to account for a significant increase in annual shipments throughout the forecast period. India for example aims to increase the number of piped natural gas connections more than ninefold - from around 14 million in 2024 to more than 125 million in 2034.

East Asia - defined as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - has led the adoption of smart metering technology in Asia-Pacific with ambitious national rollouts and today accounts for around 91% of the installed base of smart electricity meters in the region. The rollouts of smart electricity meters in China and Japan are now complete. The nationwide rollout in South Korea has suffered a number of delays and the national utility KEPCO now aims to complete the rollout by the end of 2025. Taiwan is the least mature market in East Asia and boasts an installed base of just 3.4 million smart meters. In China and Japan, replacements of first-generation smart meters have already begun and will dominate shipment volumes in the region in the coming years. East Asia also constitutes the leading adopter of smart gas metering technology in Asia-Pacific, accounting for nearly all installed devices and forecasted shipment volumes in the coming years.

South Asia - defined as India and Bangladesh - will constitute the fastest growing smart electricity metering market in Asia-Pacific throughout the forecast period with ambitious governmental initiatives now in place in both India and Bangladesh. The former has for example set a highly ambitious target of reaching 250 million installed smart prepayment meters by 2026 - a target that will however not be met. The analyst anticipates that the installed base of smart electricity meters in South Asia will grow at a CAGR of 52.4% throughout the forecast period, reaching 324.5 million units installed in 2030.

Southeast Asia - defined as Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam and the Philippines - on the other hand remains the most nascent smart metering market in Asia-Pacific, although some countries have made notable progress with major projects now underway. Singapore is on track to complete its nationwide rollout within the next year, while the main utility in Malayasia is in the midst of a largescale deployment. The small country of Brunei is at the same time rolling out smart prepayment meters for all electricity customers. The main utilities in Indonesia and Thailand are by contrast at the very beginning of their large-scale smart metering implementation plans while the leading utilities in the Philippines have similar ambitions.

In Vietnam, the national utility has rolled out basic remote metering technologies for years with a vision to eventually transition to more advanced technologies. Australasia - defined as Australia and New Zealand - is characterised by a market-driven and retailer-led approach to smart metering. In the case of Australia, however, recent changes to the regulatory framework have strengthened the role of mandated deployment over market forces. More than half of all smart meters in Australia are now smart while New Zealand has reached a natural saturation of more than 90% with second-generation installations now about to take off.

The markets in Asia-Pacific are largely dominated by local or regional players and only a few companies such as Landis+Gyr, Itron, EDMI (Osaki Electric) and Trilliant have managed to establish a notable presence in multiple markets across the region. In terms of smart meter communications, domestic PLC technologies dominate the electricity markets in China and South Korea while RF mesh is the main option in Japan, Singapore and Malaysia. Cellular communications has meanwhile emerged as the dominant technology in Australasia as well as in India, where RF mesh also has a significant market share. The LPWA technologies NB-IoT, LTE-M, LoRa and Sigfox have at the same time emerged as the favoured options for smart gas metering projects across Asia-Pacific, although major regional differences exist.

Paris, Thursday, October 30, 2025. Technip Energies (the “Company”), a global technology & engineering powerhouse leading in energy and decarbonization infrastructure, today announces its unaudited financial results for the first nine months of 2025.

Arnaud Pieton, Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies, commented:

“I am pleased to report that Technip Energies (T.EN) has delivered a solid financial performance for the first nine months of 2025. We achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 9%, maintaining strong profitability, and significantly increased free cash flow generation. These results reflect our disciplined execution, the strength of our asset-light business model and the commitment of our teams worldwide. Based on these results, we confirm our full year guidance.”

“We are extending our global leadership in LNG and modularization. Notably, we have been awarded another major LNG contract in the US - Commonwealth LNG - which leverages our modular SnapLNG by T.EN™ solution, as well as a contract to perform preliminary activities on the Coral Norte floating LNG unit in Mozambique. Although the full value of these awards is not yet reflected in our order book, once confirmed, they will contribute significantly to the Company’s backlog.”

“Our robust operating model, which combines complementary shorter-cycle activities with the longer-term certainty of major projects, enables T.EN to navigate the current environment effectively. Moreover, the global megatrends underpinning economic growth continue to create opportunities across the energy sector, not only in traditional markets but also in areas such as decarbonization and sustainable fuels. T.EN benefits from a diverse, high quality portfolio of technologies and solutions, equipping us to support any energy scenario.”

“Consistent with our strategy to enhance our Technology, Products & Services segment, in September we announced the acquisition of Ecovyst’s Advanced Materials & Catalysts (AM&C) business. The transaction strengthens our capabilities across the catalyst value chain, secures leading positions in markets offering long-term visibility, and broadens our customer value proposition. Upon completion, the acquisition will be immediately accretive to T.EN’s financial profile, delivering cash flow benefits and improved quality of earnings. We look forward to welcoming the AM&C team as we continue to build a more integrated and technology-driven portfolio.”

“As we pursue further growth, we remain disciplined in capital allocation and cost management. Supported by our robust balance sheet, we are focused on building for the long-term, investing to enhance our differentiation, and driving value creation for all our stakeholders.”

1 The transaction is anticipated to close by the first quarter of 2026, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.
