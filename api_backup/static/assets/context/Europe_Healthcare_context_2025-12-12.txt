[TITLE]JPMorgan Downgrades Sanofi (SNY) to EUR 95 from EUR 105:
[TEXT]
Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is one of the best pharma stocks to invest in. Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) was downgraded to Neutral from Overweight by JPMorgan on December 8, with the firm also bringing the price target down to EUR 95 from EUR 105.

Is Sanofi (SNY)the Best Gene-Editing Stock to Buy?

The firm told investors that it is adjusting its ratings in the European pharma group to take into account its 2026 outlook. It anticipates pipeline readouts to drive sector performance, albeit if a considerable amount of the concern surrounding the effect of US price pressure on sector earnings dissipates in Q4. The firm thus downgraded the companies in the sector that did not have pipeline readouts in 2026.

In a separate development, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) announced the completion of its acquisition of Vicebio Ltd on December 4, bringing an early-stage combination vaccine candidate for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), both of which are respiratory viruses.

With Vicebio’s ‘Molecular Clamp’ technology, the acquisition would support the company’s capabilities in vaccine development and design, complementing Sanofi’s (NASDAQ:SNY) position in respiratory vaccines with the acquired vaccine candidate. It allows the company to provide increased patient and physician choice in RSV and HMPV through the addition of a non-mRNA vaccine to its pipeline.

Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) researches, produces, and distributes pharmaceutical products. The company’s operations are divided into the Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare, and Vaccines segments.

While we acknowledge the potential of SNY as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]New Hypertension publication underscores aprocitentan’s potential in managing hypertension patients with CKD:
[TEXT]
New analysis from landmark Phase 3 PRECISION trial published in Hypertension highlights the renal-protective benefits of aprocitentan in addition to the marked reduction in blood pressure in a high-risk CKD population with difficult-to-control hypertension

Allschwil, Switzerland – December 10, 2025

Idorsia Ltd (SIX: IDIA) announced the publication of a new analysis from the landmark Phase 3 PRECISION study in Hypertension titled “Aprocitentan in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and Resistant Hypertension”.1 The analysis examined the efficacy and safety of aprocitentan (TRYVIO™/JERAYGO™) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and confirmed resistant hypertension – a population with very limited treatment options and high cardiovascular and renal risk.

Aprocitentan, the first approved antihypertensive targeting the endothelin pathway, was well tolerated. It significantly reduced both office and nighttime ambulatory blood pressure (BP), as well as markedly lowered albuminuria – a key marker of kidney damage – without increasing the risk of hyperkalemia.

Patrick Rossignol, MD, PhD, nephrologist, Head of the Medical Specialties and nephrology departments at the Princess Grace Hospital, Monaco, commented:

“Hypertension is both a cause and consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and managing it in these patients is particularly challenging. Blood pressure is often difficult to control, and many antihypertensive agents carry risks of worsening renal function or causing hypo or hyperkalemia, which are all associated with dismal outcomes. The data presented in this manuscript are truly transformative for our patients: aprocitentan not only markedly lowered blood pressure but also reduced proteinuria by up to 60% on top of standardized background triple therapy including valsartan and a thiazide-like diuretic – without inducing dyskalemia or worsening renal function. Its favorable safety profile and exceptionally low discontinuation rate after nearly one year of treatment position aprocitentan as a fundamental advancement for patients with CKD and treatment resistant hypertension.”

Martine Clozel, MD, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research at Idorsia, commented:

“The PRECISION study included patients with confirmed resistant hypertension without excluding patients with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), as these patients are particularly underserved. The endothelin pathway plays a clear role in both kidney dysfunction and hypertension, yet until aprocitentan, no antihypertensive therapy targeted this pathway – explaining why many patients were not responding to treatment. TRYVIO/JERAYGO blocks the two endothelin receptor subtypes fundamental in its actions. In patients who had often tried more than four antihypertensive drugs, aprocitentan delivered significant blood pressure reductions alongside a major antiproteinuric effect, suggesting meaningful renal protection.”

There are 1.4 billion people worldwide living with hypertension.2 Hypertension remains a leading global health challenge and the number one modifiable risk factor for early morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in treatment, many patients still struggle with uncontrolled blood pressure, leaving them at significantly higher risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and premature death.3 In the US, approximately 50% of patients living with hypertension on multiple treatments do not have their blood pressure under control.4

In patients with CKD, hypertension significantly contributes to preventable morbidity and mortality and is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease.5-7 In 2019, there were more than 650 million people with CKD worldwide and 1.2 million deaths due to CKD.8 Especially nocturnal hypertension has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity.9-11 Therefore, appropriate and effective management of hypertension is a key strategy of managing patients with CKD.12,13

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that also induces neurohormonal activation, vascular hypertrophy and remodeling, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction. In hypertension, both ET A and ET B receptors mediate harmful effects of ET-1.14 As a vasoconstrictor, co-mitogenic agent, linking pulse pressure and vascular remodeling, and mediator of aldosterone and catecholamine release, endothelin is a key player in hypertension and end-organ damage.15,16

Upregulation of endothelin-1 is considered an important contributor to the pathophysiology of CKD progression, including increased blood pressure, glomerular membrane permeability, mesangial cell proliferation, podocyte dysfunction, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.17,18

[TITLE]NovaBridge Presents Positive Ragistomig Phase 1 Dose Expansion Data at ESMO-IO:
[TEXT]
Ragistomig is a 4-1BB X PD-L1 bispecific antibody, designed to treat patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including those who have relapsed or are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors, a multi-billion dollar pillar of cancer care, hampered by widespread resistance

The study achieved its objective, as the new Q6W extended dosing interval produced encouraging anti-tumor efficacy and immunological data in prior immune-oncology refractory or relapsed patients including anti-PD- (L)1 checkpoint inhibitor, with improved safety, compared to the prior Q2W schedule

The poster includes positive immunological data on CD8+ cell proliferation and memory T-cell activation

ROCKVILLE, Md., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NovaBridge Biosciences (Nasdaq: NBP) (NovaBridge or the Company) a global biotechnology platform company committed to accelerating access to innovative medicines, today announced the presentation of new data from the expanded 3mg/kg every 6 week (Q6W) Phase 1 dosing study for ragistomig, a bispecific 4-1BB X PD-L1 antibody, in a poster at the European Society for Medical Oncology – Immuno-Oncology Congress 2025 (ESMO-IO 2025) by co-developer ABL Bio. The poster (Poster 257P), presented by Gerald Falchook, MD, Director of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) at HealthONE Denver, showed the new Q6W schedule demonstrated consistent monotherapy antitumor activity with improved immunological endpoints and tolerability.

“We are very pleased by the impressive ragistomig Phase 1 dose expansion data presented today at ESMO-IO, indicating that the prior Q2W schedule demonstrated meaningful clinical activity, and that the new Q6W dosing interval provides comparable efficacy with a more favorable safety profile. The study achieved its objective by extending the therapeutic window and supports the advancement of ragistomig into combination studies. We are particularly encouraged by the improved safety profile, with only 5% of patients experiencing ≥ Grade 3 liver function elevation, while maintaining comparable immune-mediated activity. These observations, combined with comparable confirmed responses and durable immune engagement, underpins our optimism that ragistomig has the potential to make an important contribution to more effective treatment outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumor cancers,” said Phillip Dennis, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer of NovaBridge.

“Ragistomig was designed to overcome resistance in patients who relapsed after treatment with checkpoint inhibitors, a multi-billion dollar pillar of cancer treatment. The ragistomig data presented at ESMO-IO build on the promising results presented at ASCO 2024. This program aligns well with our strategy to partner with innovators around the world to advance transformative and potentially breakthrough therapies. We are enthusiastic to collaborate with our partner, ABL Bio, to initiate combination studies,” said Sean Fu, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of NovaBridge.

A copy of the poster will be available here after the session. To review an overview of the Phase 1 dose escalation data, click here.

Ragistomig Phase 1 Monotherapy Q6W Data (per October 22, 2025 data cut-off):

Ragistomig demonstrated comparable anti-tumor efficacy for the Q6W dose schedule compared to the Q2W regimen (58.8% disease control rate (DCR) at Q6W compared to 64.3% at Q2W)

Ragistomig exhibited a favorable and improved safety profile, with 1/20 Grade ≥3 liver function test elevations (LFT), no treatment discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no reported cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

Overall immune cell activity was consistent between the Q6W and Q2W dosing. Immune cell pharmacodynamics with the Q6W dosing demonstrated expansion of effector memory and CD8+ T cells, with attenuated Treg expansion, indicating durable immune engagement

The data suggest evaluation of the ongoing 5 mg/kg Q6W dosing cohort and evaluation of ragistomig in future combination studies

Patient Characteristics:

20 heavily pre-treated subjects received 3 mg/kg Q6W ragistomig. In this group, 100% were previously treated with immuno-oncology therapies and 70% had previously received ≥3 lines of systemic treatment and exhausted all available standard treatment options

Dosing is underway in 10 patients who are receiving 5 mg/kg Q6W ragistomig

Efficacy Results, based on 17 evaluable patients receiving 3 mg/kg Q6W v. 14 evaluable patients with 3 mg/kg Q2W

ABL503 monotherapy

efficacy profiile 3 mgkg Q6W

(N=17) 3 mg/kg Q2W

Safety Data, based on 20 evaluable patients receiving 3 mg/kg Q6W v. 15 evaluable patients with 3 mg/kg Q2W

An improved safety profile was observed with the 3 mg/kg Q6W regimen

The 3 mg/kg Q6W regimen was identified as an optimal potential regimen for combination strategies

1/20 subjects (5%) experienced ≥Grade 3 LFT elevation at Q6W dosing v. 40% at Q2W dosing

TEAEs ≥Grade 3 were 50% at the Q6W (10/20) v. 66.7% (10/15) at 3 mg/kg Q2W. In the Q6W dose, these TEAEs, including LFT elevations, decreased platelet count, anemia and decreased neutrophil count, were recovered within 3-14 days (with or without treatment interventions), with no discontinuations

No cases of CRS were reported with either dosing schedule

Immunology Data:

Effector and memory CD8+ T cell subsets were increased, with comparable fold-changes between dosing groups, suggesting that immune mediated pharmacodynamic activity may contribute to efficacy

CTLA+ Treg frequencies remained near baseline in the Q6W group, suggesting a more favorable effector-to-regulatory balance

[TITLE]GRI Bio Announces Positive Topline Data from its Phase 2a Study in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (“IPF”):
[TEXT]
Study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over 12 weeks of treatment, with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events and no increase in GI issues when used with existing approved treatments

Study met its secondary endpoints and demonstrated improvement in biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting a resolution of fibrosis and repair of the alveolar basement membrane

GRI-0621 demonstrated increases in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 6 and 12 weeks of treatment

39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects treated with placebo experiencing a decline in FVC at 12 weeks

LA JOLLA, CA, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GRI Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: GRI) (“GRI Bio” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company advancing an innovative pipeline of immune cell modulators for the treatment of inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune diseases, today announced positive topline data from the Phase 2a GRI-0621-IPF-02 clinical trial evaluating GRI-0621 for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (“IPF”). The study met its primary endpoint and secondary endpoints demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over a 12-week treatment period, consistent with earlier studies evaluating over 1,700 subjects treated for up to a year. Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism.

“Treatment of patients with IPF in the GRI-0621 Phase 2a trial was observed to be safe and well tolerated through the completion of the 12-week study,” said Toby Maher, MD, PhD, Professor of Clinical Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, USC Los Angeles. “Secondary endpoints related to the effect of GRI-0621 on biomarkers associated with disease progression provided evidence that GRI-0621 maintains a net anti-fibrotic effect compared to standard of care. Lastly, FVC improved in patients treated with GRI-0621, with more patients experiencing an increase at 12 weeks than with standard of care. We look forward to watching the clinical advancement of GRI-0621 as a potential treatment for patients with IPF.”

Study Met Its Primary Endpoint, Demonstrating a Safety Profile Differentiated From Existing Treatment Options

No safety or tolerability concerns were observed in the subjects enrolled at 12 weeks of treatment, with dry skin, dry lips, muscle and joint pain as the most common adverse events reported. There were no increases in cough (0% in the GRI-0621-treated arm compared to 25% in the placebo arm) or gastrointestinal disorders reported in the GRI-0621 arm compared to the placebo arm (diarrhea reported in 13% versus 33%, respectively). 80% of the subjects enrolled were taking background pirfenidone or nintedanib.

Study Met Secondary Endpoints Suggestive of Disease-Modifying Activity, Reversing Fibrosis and Inducing a Lung Repair Mechanism

Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism. PRO-C6, a biomarker of type VI collagen synthesis, was observed to decrease from baseline (-3%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and increase (+12%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C6M, a biomarker of type VI collagen degradation, was observed to increase from baseline (+6%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-3%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. The type VI collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrogenic (+10%; continued worsening of fibrosis) in placebo-treated subjects to fibrolytic (-7%; resolution of fibrosis), suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing resolution of fibrosis in treated subjects compared to continued worsening of fibrosis in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care.

Destruction of the alveolar basement membrane is a hallmark of IPF, and type IV collagen synthesis, and repair of the basement membrane, is a crucial step in lung tissue repair. PRO-C4, a biomarker of type IV collagen synthesis, was observed to increase from baseline (+9%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-2%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C4Ma3, a biomarker of type IV collagen degradation, was observed to decrease in GRI-0621 treated subjects compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard of care (10% vs 24%, respectively). The type IV collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrolytic (-16%; continued destruction of the basement membrane) in placebo-treated subjects to neutral (0%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects, suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing a lung tissue repair mechanism and repair of the alveolar basement membrane compared to placebo-treated subjects.

Interestingly, the alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism is supported by differential gene expression data of AT1 cell re-epithelialization of the basement membrane. GRI-0621 was observed to significantly reduce DLK1 (-6.46 LogFC; FDR 0.0003), a gene involved in lung epithelial AT2 cell fate plasticity and regeneration of alveolar AT1 cells (Sawhney, et al. (2025) Nat Commun 16, 8924; Li, et al. (2025) Resp Res 26 188), another critical step in alveolar basement membrane repair, compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard.

Reductions in neutrophil and macrophage activity (immune cell biomarkers upregulated in IPF and associated with disease progression) and downregulation of genes associated with fibrosis, disease progression and mortality were also observed in patients treated with GRI-0621 compared to placebo-treated subjects.

“The positive Phase 2a results represent an important milestone for our IPF program and a compelling early signal of GRI-0621’s disease-modifying potential. IPF remains one of the most devastating respiratory diseases, with limited treatment options and a significant need for therapies that can do more than slow decline and address the underlying biology of the disease,” commented Marc Hertz, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of GRI Bio. “In addition to a favorable safety and tolerability profile, GRI-0621 demonstrated meaningful improvement in biomarkers suggesting fibrosis resolution and repair of the alveolar basement membrane. These results reinforce our belief in GRI-0621’s differentiated mechanism and support its potential to go beyond slowing disease progression by directly impacting core drivers of IPF. With this mechanistic proof-of-biology in hand, we are well-positioned to advance toward the next stage of development. We believe GRI-0621 could represent a truly meaningful advance in the IPF treatment landscape, with the potential to create significant value for patients and shareholders alike.”

Study Met Exploratory Endpoints Demonstrating Increased Forced Vital Capacity, With Twice as Many Subjects Observed to Have No Decline in FVC Compared to Standard of Care at 12 Weeks

Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in FVC increased by 99 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and a 139 ml increase in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care. Spirometry is subject to large visit-to-visit variability and is dependent on the individual’s effort, often resulting in data outliers. To minimize the impact of outliers in the dataset, a post hoc data analysis was performed excluding the datapoints with the largest gain or loss in FVC over 12 weeks from both arms. The results of this analysis demonstrated an increase in placebo-adjusted change from baseline in FVC of 54 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and an increase of 81 ml in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care. Overall, 39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects who experienced a decline in FVC at 12 weeks in the placebo-treated arm.

The Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, multinational, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, 2-arm study enrolled 35 subjects with IPF who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio for GRI-0621 4.5mg or a placebo. GRI-0621 dose of 4.5mg was compared with a dose of placebo following once daily oral administration for 12 weeks. Concurrently, a sub-study examined the number and activity of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (“BAL”) fluid in 8 subjects (across various centers). The primary endpoint for the Phase 2a study was safety and tolerability of oral GRI-0621 as assessed by clinical labs, vital signs and adverse events after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints were baseline changes in serum biomarkers collected at week 6 and week 12; an assessment of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GRI-0621 at the week 12 visit of treatment (steady state); and a determination of the pharmacodynamic activity of oral GRI-0621 as measured by inhibition of immune cell activation in blood after 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and from BAL fluid after 12 weeks of treatment in the sub-study. Additional exploratory endpoints for the study included assessment of the effect of GRI-0621 on pulmonary function at baseline and after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment and flow cytometry and differential gene expression at various time points. These results show that GRI-0621’s receptor selectivity is consistent with the toxicity profile observed in earlier studies evaluating oral tazarotene in over 1,700 patients treated for up to 52 weeks.

[TITLE]MediWound Reports New Clinical Data Demonstrating NexoBrid®’s Effectiveness in Preventing Traumatic Tattoos After Abrasion and Blast Injuries:

MediWound Reports New Clinical Data Demonstrating NexoBrid®’s Effectiveness in Preventing Traumatic Tattoos After Abrasion and Blast Injuries

Prospective clinical data show NexoBrid® removes embedded particles in friction and blast wounds, reducing pigmented wound surface by >90%

Traumatic tattoos form when dirt, metal, or explosive residue becomes permanently embedded in the skin; findings support further evaluation in acute trauma settings

YAVNE, Israel, December 10, 2025 -- MediWound Ltd. (Nasdaq: MDWD), a global leader in next-generation enzymatic therapeutics for tissue repair, today announced the peer-reviewed publication of new prospective clinical data showing that NexoBrid® substantially reduces embedded particles associated with traumatic tattoos following abrasion and blast injuries.

Traumatic tattoos occur when high-velocity accidents or blasts drive materials such as asphalt, dirt, glass, or metallic particles (shrapnel) into the skin, often leaving not only permanent dark discoloration but also causing aesthetic deformities, functional impairment, and increased risk of inflammation or infection. Current standard of care relies on aggressive non-selective mechanical scrubbing, which may leave embedded particles behind and may risk damage to viable tissue.

The study is published in the Journal of Burn Care & Research, the official journal of the American Burn Association, under the title “Enzymatic Bromelain-based Debridement with NexoBrid®: A New Treatment to Effectively Prevent Traumatic Tattoos After Abrasive Incidents and Explosive Events.”

In this prospective independent study, conducted at Sheba Medical Center’s National Burn Center, 15 patients diagnosed with traumatic tattoos resulting from friction or blast injuries underwent standard mechanical scrubbing to remove loose debris. Residual pigment load was then documented, and patients were treated with NexoBrid within 24 hours of injury under procedural sedation. Pigmentation was reassessed immediately after enzymatic debridement, using computer-based image analysis.

The mean pigmented wound area decreased from 37.5% before NexoBrid application to 2.1% afterward, a 92.5% reduction in pigmented wound surface compared with the post-scrubbing baseline, with every patient showing substantial clearance of foreign particles. In abrasive injuries, an average of 96% of visible pigments were removed, while pigment load in explosive injuries was reduced by 84%. Treatment was well tolerated, performed at bedside, and no treatment-related adverse events were reported during the early post-procedure period.

“In blast injuries and friction burns, where wound depth is highly irregular, NexoBrid provides the precision these cases demand,” said Professor Josef Haik, MD, MPH, Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Burn Center at Sheba Medical Center. “We believe the effectiveness of NexoBrid is driven by its selective enzymatic action on damaged skin layers, which helps remove many of the particles embedded within them. In high-energy explosions, some debris may remain lodged in deeper tissues, yet NexoBrid consistently reveals a clean, well-defined wound bed, enabling clinicians to determine the most appropriate next steps.”

“Our research team began work on the science of orexin and orexin receptors immediately after they were first described in 1998. Our initial work led to the understanding that antagonism of the orexin system induced a very physiological sleep. With a treatment of insomnia disorder in mind, the team set the target to design a dual orexin receptor antagonist that, among a number of criteria, would achieve a rapid onset of effect and a duration of action sufficient to cover the totality of the night at optimally effective doses, avoiding morning carry-over effects. It took us more than 10 years, and we had to synthesize and characterize more than 25,000 compounds to arrive at the molecule which has now been recognized with the Prix Galien Bridges Award – for improving not only the nights of patients with insomnia disorder, but also most importantly their daytime functioning.”

The Prix Galien Awards were created in 1970 by Roland Mehl in honor of Galien, the father of medical science and modern pharmacology, to recognize outstanding innovation and scientific advancement. With chapters in 16 countries and Africa, Prix Galien is regarded worldwide as the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for the life science industry.
