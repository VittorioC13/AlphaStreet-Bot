[TITLE]Bain Capital Real Estate, 11North Partners Close $1.6B Raise for Retail Real Estate – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners, a real estate investment firm, have secured $1.6 billion in new capital commitments for a joint venture operating platform that specializes in acquiring grocery-anchored, open-air retail centers.

The two investment firms formed the platform in April 2024 with the intention of creating a portfolio of open-air retail centers across different markets that are all supported by the shared tailwinds of population growth and income growth. The platform purchases both single assets and large portfolios of retail centers using investor capital.

The $1.6 billion capital raise is largely funded by two unnamed institutional investors, who Brian Harper, founder and managing partner of 11North, described in prepared remarks as “two of the largest and most respected investors in the world.”

“Our shared vision with Bain Capital was to build a platform that could thoughtfully invest across both core-plus and value-add opportunities,” said Harper. “This first capital raise delivers on that vision and positions us to scale with discipline.”

Altogether, by sourcing additional capital from a Bain Capital Real Estate Fund III, the open-air retail center platform managed by the joint venture has more than $2 billion of investable equity to play with going into 2026.

“[This retail platform] reflects how we invest across Bain Capital Real Estate — thematically, with advantage, and with discipline in partnership with aligned operators who bring deep domain expertise,” said Ryan Cotton, head of Bain Capital Real Estate.

Deals the joint partnership has executed in recent months include a $395 million acquisition of 10 assets across Florida and South Carolina in August 2025 and the purchase of three retail centers in Oklahoma City — Nichols Hills Plaza, The Triangle at Classen Curve and Classen Curve — for $212 million in June 2025.

Martha Kelley, managing director at Bain Capital Real Estate, said in a statement that the two firms are mutually attracted to “durable sector trends” in open-air retail, notable strong sales metrics, new consumer shopping patterns, and the rise of online omnichannel shopping, which includes buying online and picking up at a store.

“These dynamics create a supportive environment for necessity-based centers in strong, accessible locations,” said Kelley. “With the right partnership in place, we believe we are well positioned to continue assembling a best-in-class portfolio that delivers lasting value for our investors.”

[TITLE]Gen Z’s reality check: Birkin resale prices slump as aspirational luxury takes a hit:
[TEXT]
The Birkin bag resale craze may have hit its peak, serving up a dose of reality for Gen Z aspirational luxury buffs coveting the Hermès accessory as their next big investment piece.

The luxury handbag flung across the elbow of celebrities like Cardi B and Heidi Klum has appeared to have lost some of its appeal on the secondhand market, new data shows, though it continues to sell for higher than its eye-popping five-figure retail value. Birkin bags are a particularly hot commodity on the resale market because of how difficult it is to get the product new, requiring a customer to be a loyal Hermès shopper or build a relationship with a sales associate.

According to Bernstein Research’s Secondhand Pricing Tracker, the average resale premium for Birkin and Kelly bags—a metric representing the auction price compared to its retail cost—has fallen from 2.2 times its original value in 2022 to 1.4 times as of last month. That means a Birkin originally bought for $10,000 and resold in 2022 would have fetched for $22,200, while a bag originally retailing for the same price and resold at auction today would be worth about $14,000 on the resale market today.

Birkin bags, prized by many for the exclusivity associated with buying the bag, became a pandemic resale darling as wealthy shopping unaffected by COVID-related economic woes, sought out the in-demand bag on the secondhand market, as Hermès produces a limited number of the accessory each year. However, 2025 has marked the end of a “luxury supercycle” according to Berenberg analysts, as consumers face headwinds like inflation, and retailers fail to woo aspirational shoppers. A Bain & Co. report released this summer also found the luxury market contracted 3% in early 2025, losing about 50 million customers.

Simmered-down resale prices for the Birkin bag is bad news for Gen Z’s aspirational luxury dreams, perhaps quieting a trend of young big spenders scooping up luxury items in hopes of making a profit on the secondhand market.

Gen Z is besotted with Birkin

Luxury retail brands are targeting Gen Z, who have entered the luxury market earlier than generations past, but are still developing their taste for what products they seek out. Some members of this young generation—with a penchant for investing and side hustles—have channeled their love for the finer things into a lucrative entrepreneurial effort.

“Whoever says handbags aren’t an investment are lying,” one TikTok user said in a 2023 video. “What I’m holding in my hands [an Hermès Birkin bag] is undoubtedly a better investment than the S&P 500, stocks, and gold.”

James Firestein, founder of luxury resale and authentication platform OpenLuxury, said the appreciating value of a Birkin is no joke, claiming the resale value of the handbag and its Kelly counterpart, over the last decade, has outpaced gold.

“I know several instances where people have doubled their money based on buying it 10 years ago, and reselling it today in pristine condition,” Firestein told Fortune last year. “It’s similar to buying a Picasso and holding it in your home, because you can look at it, you can enjoy it. But then you ship it off in a couple of years and trade it for something else.”

Birkin’s resale value compared to more traditional assets, though still steep, is perhaps overexaggerated: $10,000 invested in the S&P 500 a decade ago would be worth about $30,000 to $40,000 today, while a Birkin bought 10 years ago for the same value would be about double its value, according to a report released last week by secondhand retailer Rebag. The analysis indicated Hermès bags appreciated an average of 92% on the secondhand market during the last decade.

Resale risks

While luxury items like a Birkin bag can soar in value during a period of high demand, most luxury goods are vulnerable to the very trends that once made them popular.

Jessica Ramírez, cofounder and managing director at retail data firm The Consumer Collective, told Fortune that beyond economic struggles, Birkin bags may be losing some resale value just because trends are slowly shifting. According to Ramírez, resellers wanting to get the most on a secondhand sale have to time their initial purchase before the item gains too much popularity and resell it at the height of its influence. That peak has likely passed.

“From a market perspective and from a brand perspective, you want to cater your trends in the early days and see how early adopters are going to take and mature them, so you can get that mass,” Ramírez said. “It works in reverse for a collector or someone who’s trying to make profit.”

The good news for resellers is despite Birkin prices cooling off at auction, the Hermès arm candy is still in rarified air: The Rebag report found Hermès was still the top brand on the secondhand market. When actress Jane Birkin’s original Hermes Birkin sold for more than $10 million at Sotheby’s in Paris earlier this year, it was record-breaking. According to the auction house, it became “the most valuable luxury item ever sold at Sotheby’s Paris.”

Silver on Wednesday touched a historical high of Rs 2 lakh per kg at the retail end, a jump of Rs 9,000 per kg from yesterday. The surge comes as weaker US labour data reignited expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, weakening the dollar and boosting demand for precious metals.A consumer now has to shell out Rs 2,06,000 per kg with a Goods & Services Tax (GST) of 3 per cent. Internationally, spot silver surged 2.8 per cent to a record $65.53 an ounce, marking the first time the white metal crossed the $65 level. The spot gold too edged 0.4 per cent higher to $4,321 per ounce, aided by continued weakness in the US dollar.The rally gained momentum after the US data showed the unemployment rate rising to 4.6 per cent in November, strengthening expectations of further monetary easing. Investor sentiment had already turned positive for non-yielding assets after the Federal Reserve delivered its final quarter-point rate cut of the year last week and struck a dovish tone in its outlook.V K Vijaykumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Investments Limited said "What sets silver apart is its wide application in industrial uses. In the modern sunrise industries like EVs, solar energy, manufacture of electronic devices and mobile phones silver is used. The impressive growth of these industries have pushed up the demand for silver. In the absence of corresponding increase in sup[ply of this scare metal, price has shot up. There might be some profit booking, but silver prices are likely to remain resilient."“In the Indian context, silver is no longer just a tactical trade. With rising industrial usage and increasing retail participation through exchange traded funds and digital platforms, silver is emerging as a strategic portfolio diversifier—offering higher volatility than gold but also higher upside during commodity upcycles,” said Rajkumar Subramanian, head of Product & Family Office at PL Wealth.Silver’s strength is being driven not just by its role as a precious metal, but increasingly by its industrial relevance, he said. “From solar manufacturing and EVs to electronics, India’s clean energy and manufacturing push is structurally raising silver demand, making it a hybrid asset that benefits from both economic growth and periods of global uncertainty.”

[TITLE]CNBC's The China Connection newsletter: Why Sam’s Club is in a sweet spot as China faces consumption worries:
[TEXT]
This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Sam's Club, the membership-based warehouse retail arm of Walmart, opened its new store in Beijing last month, followed by another one in Shanghai on Tuesday. They drew large crowds, snarling traffic for hours and keeping consumers in long queues.

American membership warehouse clubs are telling something more nuanced: they are finding success in drawing consumers who are willing to pay a hefty membership fee in exchange for premium goods at reasonable prices. On top of that, those stores provide no-frill "treasure-hunt" shopping experiences to sweeten the deal.

Latest data from China showed a key gauge on consumption falling to its weakest level in nearly three years. But it does not capture the full story.

YANGZHOU, CHINA - NOVEMBER 12, 2025 - Citizens shop at the first Sam's Club in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China on November 12, 2025.

Such warehouse stores have long been known as places to buy large quantities of household staples at cheaper prices.

Even though it's less typical in China, where grocery habits have historically skewed toward high-frequency, smaller-basket shopping, this retail model is starting to find its customers.

"Here they do buy it because of the value and niche products," said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidal Wave Solutions. He said residents in his compound often ask in group chats whether others want to split oversized packs.

Sam's Club has leaned into that proposition: a shopping experience and product lineup distinct from conventional supermarkets and online retailers, paired with annual membership fees ranging from 260 yuan to 680 yuan ($37-$97). Shoppers get modest discounts — but the bigger draw is access to curated merchandise that they can't find elsewhere.

"It's a membership model that consumers pay the membership fee upfront, and as a result, they get a full set of services," said Weiwen Han, a Hong Kong-based partner at Bain & Company.

Walmart's success

Walmart entered China in 1996 with its first hypermarket and Sam's Club warehouse chain in Shenzhen.

But the hypermarket format — which combines a supermarket and department store — has lost momentum as digital retail took off. Sprawling online marketplaces, such as Alibaba and JD.com , with their aggressive discounts and convenience, have squeezed out traditional grocers and foreign players such as France-based Carrefour.

Walmart has closed almost 150 hypermarkets in China since 2020, with just 279 stores operational as of July, down from 412 in 2020.

But Sam's Club has proven an enduring strength for the company. The chain has turned warehouses into both shopping destinations and e-commerce delivery hubs, while filling shelves with products consumers can't easily comparison-shop elsewhere, including exclusive items under its house brand Member's Mark and Marketside.

Beyond online grocery ordering and delivery, the clubs offer an offline experience where shoppers can browse and "treasure hunt" — something local e-commerce players struggle to replicate, Han said.

The bet is paying off. Sam's Club has become one of the China's fastest-growing foreign retailers, with 56 outlets nationwide, compared to Costco's seven stores in the country. The market also helped fuel Walmart's strongest net sales growth globally. In the third quarter, Walmart's net sales in China surged 21.9% year on year to $6.1 billion, exceeding the broader Walmart International segment's average growth rate of 10.8%.

'Let's go to Disney'

That blend of curated products and digital convenience helps explain why the model has gained traction with affluent shoppers — and why one store visit can translate into multiple online orders.

Many shoppers won't return often in person. They'll make one trip to browse, then rely on the mobile app for five to 10 deliveries from the same store, said Curtis Alan Ferguson, former president of Coca-Cola Greater China and Korea and now managing partner at Ventech China, a venture capital firm focused on consumer startups.

For some, the appeal is the outing itself — a well-designed, predictable version of discovery shopping. "It's more of a … 'let's go to Disney' here," Ferguson said.

Aside from the physical shopping experience, Walmart says speed is part of the stickiness. "Our team in China delivers extremely fast, with nearly 80% of digital orders delivered within one hour," Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.

Ferguson said suppliers also like working with Sam's Club because the volumes can justify unique packaging or sizes. "People bend over backwards to give [Sam's Club] the quality they desire," he said. "If you have … Sam's or Costco pulling your brand … that gives you some other cachet."

Hard to copy — even with local muscle

Few local rivals have managed to seriously challenge Sam's Club and Costco in membership retail — and not for lack of trying.

Alibaba's Freshippo, the Chinese tech giant's grocery business, shuttered its last members-only store in August.

However, regional chain Pangdonglai, which started in Xuchang, a city in the heartland of Henan, is widely viewed as a standout success.

Pangdonglai's appeal is that it operates on a "people-first philosophy" where emotional value and trust matter more than scale, said Olivia Plotnick, founder of Shanghai-based marketing agency Wai Social.

But the Henan store has struggled to scale beyond its home base. Its distinctive culture and high operational standards can be difficult to replicate — and to defend — in larger, more competitive cities, said Plotnick.

"Consumers with real demand for premium value are still willing to pay, but those seeking rational, low-price essentials are shifting toward discount formats," Plotnick said.

As China's consumer slump drags on, the warehouse clubs that offer quality goods at reasonable prices, and provide a store experience that online competitors can't easily rival, are emerging as rare bright spots in the sector.

[TITLE]Capital One Lounge DFW: Grab n Go Now On Request, Hot Food Weaker — Maintenance Cited:
[TEXT]
Has the food at the Capital One lounge at DFW decline a lot? I’ve noticed on several visits that the food isn’t as good as it was when they first opened. And across lounges I’ve seen strategies to cut back on grab ‘n go as well.

There doesn’t seem to be as much as there used to be. At the outset they had these large bags – which just served to encourage guests to fill the bags. Their most recent lounge, JFK, has staff getting guests the food items – this discourages anyone that experiences shame from asking for scores of items. My most recent visit to DFW had less than ever before. The hot items were also pretty mid.

Irregular operations meant that I had nearly a 2.5 hour connection at the Dallas A gates.

My Austin to Dallas flight was delayed, and I was going to misconnect.

So I first got backed up both on a later Austin – Dallas flight and a later connecting flight. And then I confirmed the later connection.

All that was available was a non-extra legroom middle seat in economy and I took it. Fortunately the guy next to me at the aisle got an upgrade after boarding, and nobody was brought on to replace him even though the flight was full. So I shifted over to the window and had an empty middle. That made for a perfectly fine flight, even though it’s still a tight space for working on my laptop.

In the air I checked the wait time for the Capital One lounge and it surprisingly said just ‘5-10 minutes’. So I didn’t join the wait list then. Instead, I waited until I landed and joined through the app as I walked off the aircraft – for both the American Express lounge and for the Capital One lounge (and figured if both took a long time I’d use my Royal Jordanian status for American’s Flagship lounge). I headed over to the D concourse.

Capital One came back in one minute . I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case.

. I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case. American Express took 27 minutes. I didn’t remove myself from the list because they don’t give you a wait time estimate, and I wanted to compare how long it would take (plus I considered that I might want to switch for variety’s sake0.

When I checked in at Capital One, the woman at the desk seemed a bit bored, and was terse in checking me in. In the past, large tables were reserved for larger parties, but that didn’t seem to be the case today and staff weren’t proactively seating people as I’d seen in the past.

The only open spot in the lounge was a larger table that hadn’t been cleared. I took it, but I felt badly, because I was solo and it could have accommodated a party of four. I needed to use the bathroom but there was an 8-person deep line for that, so I waited and managed to return once the line had dwindled.

What was striking, though, was the food service on this visit.

The grab ‘n go section was closed.

Grab ‘n go items replaced at least half the hot food.

Pastries were simpler.

The ice machine by the self-serve soda was gone.

A sppkesperson shared,

We are working to resolve a small temporary maintenance issue at our grab-and-go station. During this time, some of those offerings have been temporarily relocated to the hot food service area however the entire grab and go menu is available upon request. This is not our standard operating procedure, and we anticipate the station will be operational soon.

I was there for a pass by the ‘rituals cart’ which in this case was jasmine tea and a macaron cookie. It seems like the cookie might have been a bit more nicely presented than in a shrink-wrapped package? And maybe some options for teas? Still, having some personal service rather than just buffet is a really nice experience.

National airport’s ‘Landing’ which is really a complimentary sit-down restaurant remains my favorite in the Capital One portfolio. JFK is the best lounge – based on size, experiences and offerings. DFW was first, and is now four years old. Recent visits haven’t been as good as earlier ones, and like Denver it is frequently very very busy. I want to see it getting a little love.

Prosol’s portfolio of retail brands also includes La Boulangerie du Marché, mon-marché.fr, BioFrais, and Banco Fresco in Italy.

Alex van Hoek, Lead Partner for European Private Equity at Apollo, said, “Prosol is a clear category leader in fresh food retail, with a powerful customer proposition and outstanding sourcing model. Under the leadership of Jean-Paul, the Company has demonstrated consistent organic growth over time, providing shoppers with exceptional quality products, breadth of assortment and strong value for money.

[TITLE]Down Arrow Button Icon:
[TEXT]
For the first time in a year-and-a-half, the growth engine of America’s small business economy has sputtered, with profitability growth slipping into negative territory in November. According to the December edition of the Small Business Checkpoint from the Bank of America Institute, rising costs associated with tariffs and inflation are forcing Main Street merchants to raise prices at historic rates, even as the holiday shopping season offers a critical lifeline.

While small business bank accounts remain in the black overall, the trajectory is concerning. Year-over-year profitability growth fell below zero (-0.02%) last month, marking the first negative reading for this metric in 18 months. BofA sees two real reasons this is likely related to tariffs, with the net percent of owners raising average selling prices jumping 13 points from October to a net 34%, the highest reading since March 2023 and the largest monthly jump in the history of the definitive small business survey from the National Federation of Independent Business.

This is also evident in small-business profitability growth by sector tracked across BofA small-business account data, where wholesale trade has declined the most over the year, down 1% in November. Within wholesale, durables such as the tariff-exposed electronics and furniture have driven most of the decline in the second half of the year, although non-durables like apparel are also down so far this quarter. This contraction signals that while revenues are still coming in, the cost of doing business is eating away at margins faster than sales can compensate. The data suggests that for many owners, absorbing tariff-related costs is no longer an option; they must charge more to survive.

Holiday hopes and hiring freezes

Despite the profitability squeeze, total profits remained positive in November, buoyed by the holiday calendar. Small Business Saturday, which fell on November 29, has evolved into a critical event, with owners estimating the day generates 20% of their annual sales. However, the BofA report notes that consumer momentum appeared to wane over the Black Friday weekend, suggesting holiday spending might not be the panacea retailers had hoped for.

The economic pressure is also cooling the jobs market. Payments to hiring firms plummeted 4.6% year-over-year, confirming a weaker job market for small enterprises. BofA noted support on the thesis of collapsing small-business hiring from other research, namely the Institute’s November Employment Report and data from payroll-service provider ADP, which both revealed a decline led by losses in small businesses. “With nearly half of the US workforce employed by such firms, this underscores the importance of the small business bedrock.”

However, the labor picture remains nuanced. While general hiring has cooled, sectors facing chronic labor shortages, such as construction and restaurants, actually increased payroll growth as they scrambled to fill open positions. Still, BofA notes that small businesses are generally both planning to increase employment and unable to fill job openings at higher rates than the average of the last two decades. Speaking to Fortune‘s Eva Roytburg earlier this week on the revelation of disappointing economywide jobs data, Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi said “there’s just no forward motion,” with the labor market “stuck in the mud.”

Looking toward 2026

Despite the current profit squeeze, business sentiment is not entirely gloomy. Optimism regarding the coming year has ticked upward, and hiring plans for the next three months are actually at their highest point of the year.

Looking further ahead, owners are betting on technology to restore efficiency. According to the 2025 Bank of America Business Owner Report, 50% plan to implement artificial intelligence (AI) over the next five years. Spending on tech services, including AI, rose 6.2% in November, indicating that businesses are investing in digital transformation to navigate a high-cost environment.

For now, however, the small business sector finds itself in a precarious position—like a ship taking on water while still moving forward. The profits are there, but the drag from tariffs and inflation is heavier than it has been in nearly two years.

[TITLE]From Farming to Fashion, the Trends Shaping the Cotton Industry for 2026:
[TEXT]
A year drawing to a close marks a time of reflection for many. And for two of the industry’s relentlessly hopeful sectors—farming and retail—it’s also a time to take stock and consider the outlook for next year.

In the farming branch, cotton prices have been stable but low, which has made it a tough time for growers. But this stability could benefit apparel makers and retailers that take advantage of the lower pricing.

“This stability in raw material pricing may be one bright point in the sea of uncertainty that has been facing the industry over the past year,” said Cotton Incorporated’s Jon Devine, senior economist, in an interview with the Lifestyle Monitor™.

By working with cotton instead of synthetic apparel, brands can both win over consumers and help their bottom lines after facing a host of challenges in 2025. Consider that nearly three-quarters of shoppers (74 percent) say their favorite fiber or fabric to wear is cotton, denim or a cotton blend, according to Cotton Incorporated’s 2025 Lifestyle MonitorTM Survey. The survey completes 500 interviews per month with U.S. consumers between the ages of 13 and 70. Further, nearly six in 10 consumers (59 percent) say they would pay more for natural fibers such as cotton.

Devine explains that crop prices declined after surging during the pandemic and are now as low as they were pre-Covid. This puts growers in a bind though, since the cost of inputs have increased with inflation. The USDA estimates that costs have risen

[TITLE]Cyber 5 2025: What worked, what changed and how to win Q5:
[TEXT]
The 2025 festive season has already proven to be unlike any other. Cyber 5, the critical five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, didn't just break records. It fundamentally shifted how consumers shop and how successful advertisers compete.

For large brands and retail advertisers, the implications are significant. The tactics that drove performance this year look different than last year. The channels that matter most have evolved. And perhaps most importantly, the biggest opportunity of the season isn't behind us, it's directly ahead.

The Cyber 5 numbers that matter

Let's start with what happened. Cyber 5 2025 generated $44.2 billion in online sales, up 7.7% year over year1. But the growth story runs deeper than top-line revenue.

Black Friday outpaced Cyber Monday for the first time in recent memory, driven by aggressive early promotions and the continued democratization of deals across the entire weekend. Average order value jumped to $215, a 30% increase over last year, signalling that consumers are spending more per transaction when the value proposition is right2.

Mobile dominated in a way that we haven't seen before. Mobile accounted for 57.5% of Cyber Monday sales and crossed 60% on Thanksgiving, confirming that mobile-first creative and seamless mobile checkout aren't optional, they're essential1.

The AI inflection point

The most transformative shift in Cyber 5 was the mainstream emergence of AI shopping assistants. Traffic from generative AI platforms surged 670% year over year and AI was involved in 20% of all online orders during the period3.

Here's the insight that matters most: shoppers arriving from AI platforms were 38% more likely to convert than those from traditional sources3. This isn't a novelty any more. AI-assisted shopping is a material channel that drives real performance and it's reshaping product discovery in real time.

For advertisers, this means that optimising your product data, structured information and brand presence across AI platforms needs to be a 2026 priority, but the brands testing and learning now will have the advantage.

The efficiency paradox: Higher CPMs, lower CPAs

One of Cyber 5's most counterintuitive lessons is what we're calling the efficiency paradox. Yes, CPMs rose in November as auction pressure intensified. But conversion rates spiked even faster, driving down overall cost per acquisition.

The data tells the story clearly:

Black Friday: CVR up 74%, CPA down 14% vs early October 4

CVR up 74%, CPA down 14% vs early October Cyber Monday: CVR up 43%, CPA down 15% vs early October4

The brands that won didn't just outspend competitors; they outperformed on conversion efficiency. They prepared creative in advance, leaned into automation and optimised for the moment when traffic quality was highest. In crowded auctions, the brands with the best conversion infrastructure won at lower costs.

The takeaway: auction dynamics reward preparation and conversion excellence, not just budget size.

Creative and automation: The twin performance levers

If Cyber 5 taught us anything, it's that creative diversity and automation are no longer advanced tactics, they're baseline requirements for efficiency.

Creative performance insights:

Ad sets featuring at least an image, video and vertical video with audio delivered 7.3% lower CPA 4

Advantage+ creative and Advantage+ sales campaigns consistently outperformed standard setups, driving 9% better cost per conversion 5

and consistently outperformed standard setups, driving Partnership ads with creators were standouts, generating 19% lower acquisition costs and 71% higher brand intent6

The static, single-asset approach is dead. High-performing advertisers tested multiple formats, let automation optimise delivery and collaborated with creators to build authentic connections at scale.

Omnichannel isn't optional any more

The gap between omnichannel advertisers and single-channel advertisers widened dramatically this Cyber 5. Brands that connected online engagement with offline experiences, particularly through in-store messaging, location-based targeting and unified checkout options, saw outsized returns.

The numbers are striking: Omnichannel campaigns delivered 35% lower CPA and 30% higher ROAS compared to October.4

The insight: consumers don't think in channels any more and your campaigns shouldn't either. The brands that treated online and offline as one seamless journey, using real-time inventory, shop locators and point-of-sale integration, captured both the digital browser and the in-store shopper.

Q5: The season's most underestimated opportunity

Cyber 5 is not the finale – in reality, the weeks between Cyber Monday and New Year's, often called Q5, represent the single most efficient period of the entire festive season.

After Cyber 5, CPMs drop to their lowest levels while purchase intent remains high. Consumers are still actively shopping, redeeming gift cards, self-gifting, handling returns and beginning New Year purchases. In fact, 85% of Gen Z and millennials plan to continue shopping until the end of the year.7

This is where efficiency and opportunity converge. While competitors pull back budgets and pause campaigns, the smartest advertisers lean in.

Your Q5 guide: Four moves to make now

To capture the Q5 opportunity, shift your approach:

Differentiate ad creative and offer messaging Highlight offer urgency i.e. "last chance" and clearly message festive season delivery cut-offs. Leverage Advantage+ creative to unlock performance enhancements. Introduce gift cards into holiday messaging to reach last-minute shoppers.

Build remarketing pools and retarget during and after Cyber 5 Users who saw Meta ads had higher mid-funnel actions in early Q4 were primed for Black Friday and Cyber Monday retargeting. Re-engage Cyber 5 browsers and basket abandoners to showcase bestsellers and build Lookalike Audiences from Cyber 5 converters. Optimise for value to drive higher average order value.

Scale creator collaborations via partnership ads Maximise the impact of creator partnerships by pairing partnership ads with Advantage sales campaigns. Implement Reels trending ads to maximise alignment with creator content.

Optimise for omnichannel outcomes Leverage Meta's omnichannel ad suite to optimise for in-store and web conversions. Unlock localised features to promote items that are available in a store nearest a user via local inventory ads.

Use omnichannel features such as conversion location value rules or store-only mode to manage channel strategies across online and in store as consumer behaviour shifts during this time frame.

Above all, keep your promotions consistent across every touchpoint and double down on creative refresh and automation.

The bottom line

Cyber 5 2025 revealed a new guidebook for festive season advertising: mobile-first, AI-aware, omnichannel by default and automation-driven. The brands that embraced these shifts didn't just survive the most competitive shopping period of the year, they thrived, often at lower costs than their competitors.

But the story isn't over. Q5 is the most efficient, high-impact window of the entire season. While others scale back, you have a golden opportunity to capture lingering demand, convert late-stage shoppers and finish the year with momentum.

The winners of festive 2025 will be the brands that met shoppers where they were and turned seasonal moments into lasting customer relationships throughout the festive season.

Q5 is live right now – take advantage of the most efficient moment of the festive season.

[TITLE]Black Friday 2025 in Review: What Retailers Need to Know About This Year’s Holiday Shopping Season:
[TEXT]
Holiday shopping season is in full swing, and Black Friday 2025 continued to demonstrate that consumer demand and attacker activity shows no signs of slowing. According to Adobe Analytics, U.S. consumers spent $11.8 billion online on Black Friday, setting a new record and highlighting sustained strength in online shopping. Yet behind this surge in legitimate traffic, retailers also faced a sharp rise in automated abuse, account takeover attempts, and reconnaissance across their digital storefronts.

This post breaks down what we saw across our network during the Black Friday period, including traffic trends, attack behavior, targeted geographies, and insights retailers can apply to strengthen their defenses ahead of the holiday home stretch.

What We Saw

Massive Traffic Surges Extending Past Black Friday

Retail traffic surged 37% above November averages, peaking on Black Friday but continuing into the weekend of November 29–30. Traditionally, traffic dips slightly on Saturday before building again on Cyber Monday, but this year showed a clear shift: shoppers kept buying throughout the weekend. This aligns with broader retail trends showing consumers taking advantage of longer promotional windows rather than concentrating purchases on a single day.

For retailers, this means the “peak” period is expanding- and with it, the window of exposure to cyber threats.

Bot Attacks Rose 50%, Focused on High-Value Workflows

Alongside legitimate traffic, bot attacks on retail sites spiked 50% over the November average. The timing closely tracked promotional activity, suggesting attackers were attempting to exploit increased consumer volume to blend in and avoid detection.

Broadly, these bots targeted:

Authentication and account flows (e.g., /login)

(e.g., /login) Inventory and product data endpoints (e.g., /datastore, /event/)

(e.g., /datastore, /event/) Transaction and application paths (e.g., credit-card application flows, lottery/promotion services, and user log endpoints)

This behavior reflects typical seasonal abuse campaigns: credential stuffing to hijack accounts, automated scraping to gain pricing or inventory intelligence, and attempts to manipulate promotions or loyalty flows.

Attacks Concentrated on the US, UK, and Australia

Malicious traffic during Black Friday was heavily concentrated in three markets: the US (46%), Australia (12%), and the UK (11%). These regions represent some of the world’s most active e-commerce ecosystems, and attackers mirrored legitimate consumer behavior by focusing on markets with the highest transaction volumes and promotional activity.

The US, in particular, drew nearly half of all observed attacks, consistent with its dominant share of global Black Friday spending. Australia and the UK followed, reflecting strong regional participation in holiday sales events and an attacker strategy aimed at exploiting high-demand markets where automated activity can more easily blend in with legitimate traffic.

For retailers operating in these geographies, the data underscores the importance of region-aware threat monitoring and the need to maintain heightened vigilance throughout the extended holiday weekend.

Attack Patterns Reveal Automation, ATO Prep, and Abuse at Scale

Based on attacker activity observed over the holiday shopping weekend, several clear patterns emerged, showing a mix of high-volume automation, credential-based attacks, and spam and proxy abuse. Overall, the attack data suggests that adversaries were focused on the following behaviors:

1. Heavy Use of Known Bad Bots and Automated Browsers

A significant portion of malicious traffic came from known automated frameworks, including headless browsers and scripted tools designed to mimic real users. This type of activity typically supports:

Large-scale login attempts

Price, inventory, or content scraping

Testing of checkout, promotion, and product pages for weaknesses

Attackers were industrializing their activity using automation that can rapidly adapt during peak events.

2. Preparing and Executing Account Takeover (ATO)

We observed high levels of activity associated with login reconnaissance and credential-testing behavior, indicating attempts to stage or execute ATO. Attackers were:

Testing large volumes of username/password combinations

Probing login endpoints to identify which attempts were blocked, challenged, or allowed

Taking advantage of elevated holiday traffic to blend their activity into normal user patterns

This aligns with typical seasonal fraud behavior, where attackers target stored payment methods, loyalty balances, and customer identities.

3. Evading Detection Through Proxies and Client Impersonation

A large volume of traffic originated from anonymous proxies, VPNs, and other anonymization services, combined with indicators of client spoofing meant to disguise automation. Attackers were:

Rapidly rotating IP addresses

Using advanced bots, attempting to masquerade as legitimate browsers

Using more simple bots, which use fingerprints or user agents that fell outside normal human patterns

In response, much of this traffic triggered JavaScript challenges or CAPTCHA enforcement, forcing suspicious clients to prove they were human.

4. Abusing Forms and Content Channels for Spam

We also observed activity consistent with comment spam, referrer manipulation, and other low-effort abuse aimed at exploiting retail sites as platforms for unwanted advertising or redirection. This typically includes:

Submitting spam content through comment or feedback forms

Inserting malicious or low-quality URLs via referrer fields

Attempting to poison analytics or direct traffic elsewhere

While not as immediately damaging as ATO, these campaigns can harm site performance, customer trust, and brand analytics.

What This Means for Retailers

Black Friday 2025 reinforced several themes:

The peak holiday season is widening.

High traffic persisted later into the weekend than in prior years. Retailers should consider extending peak staffing and monitoring coverage accordingly. Attackers are increasingly using shopper traffic as camouflage.

Surges in human activity closely mirror surges in automated abuse. Retailers need strong bot detection, fingerprinting, and behavioral analysis—not just rate limiting. API security is now as important as web application security.

Many of the top targeted URLs were APIs tied to data, personalization, or analytics. These endpoints often sit behind the UI and may not receive the same scrutiny as consumer-facing pages. Geographic targeting is aligned with opportunity.

The US, Australia, and UK remain prime markets for both legitimate and malicious traffic. Retailers serving these regions must expect elevated attack pressure during every promotional period.

Conclusion

This year’s Black Friday illustrated both consumer resilience and the evolving sophistication of attackers. Retailers saw new sales records, and attackers took advantage of the same moment to blend in, scale operations, and probe for weaknesses.

As the holiday season continues, retailers should ensure that defenses are calibrated for:

Sustained high traffic (not just one peak day)

Increased bot sophistication

ATO protection

Region-specific targeting aligned with revenue hotspots

By understanding the patterns we saw during Black Friday, retailers can prepare for the continued wave of holiday traffic and ensure a safer, smoother experience for their customers through the end of the year.
