"The five-year plan is expected to reset investment themes and the valuation system on the capital market," said Wang Jun, a strategist at BOC International in Shanghai. "The new productive force represented by tech self-reliance, the green transition and an upgrade of domestic demand may run through the policy front and investment themes in the next five years. We expect long-term capital such as mutual funds and insurance funds to further tilt towards those industries of strategic value."

MANILA, Philippines -- Asian shares are mixed after the U.S. stock market sank from record heights as Wall Street sifted through various developments such as trade relations with China and profits of Big Tech giants.

U.S. futures advanced and oil prices fell.

President Donald Trump hailed his talk Thursday with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, but major tensions remain between the world’s two largest economies.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.7% to 52,201.05, touching fresh records after data showed industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in September, beating market expectations and rebounding from a 1.5% drop the previous month.

In Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.9% to 26,050.08 and the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.6% to 3,963.01.

Data released Friday showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month. The official NBS Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.0 from 49.8 in September.

South Korea's Kospi rose 0.4% to 4,105.81, while Australia's S & P/ASX 200 added 0.2% to 8,903.50. Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.5%.

On Thursday, the S & P 500 fell 1% to 6,822.34, pulling further from its all-time high set on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% to 47,522.12. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.6% from its record set the day before, closing at 23,581.14.

Stock markets elsewhere in the world were mixed, coming off a highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies. Trump rated his meeting with Xi as a “12” on a scale of zero to 10, saying he would cut tariffs.

But stocks had already run to records on expectations for potentially bigger improvements in trade friction between Beijing and Washington.

Earnings of Big Tech companies were also feeling the pressure of high hopes. Meta Platforms dropped 11.3%, cutting into what had been a 28.4% jump for the year so far. It was the heaviest weight on the S & P 500. Analysts said investors were likely perturbed by how much Facebook’s parent company said it’s planning to spend in 2026. Companies across the industry have been on an investment spree to build out their artificial-intelligence capabilities, and the concern is whether it will all pay off.

“There are moments in market history when capital stops behaving like money and starts acting like obsession — when spending becomes the strategy, not the consequence. That’s exactly where we are now with artificial intelligence,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Microsoft sank 2.9% even though it reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Analysts pointed to how it also expects to spend more on investments in 2026 than in 2025, while growth for its Azure business may have fallen a bit short of some investors’ expectations.

On the winning side of Big Tech was Alphabet. Shares of Google’s parent company climbed 2.5% after its profit and revenue for the latest quarter easily topped analysts’ expectations.

How such companies do matters incredibly for investors. The trio of Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft alone account for 14.5% of the total value of all the companies in the S & P 500 index, which dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts. That means movements for them and a handful of other Big Tech companies can easily overshadow what hundreds of other stocks are doing.

In other dealings early Friday, benchmark U.S. crude oil shed 42 cents to $60.15 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 42 cents to $63.95.

The U.S. dollar fell to 153.95 Japanese yen from 154.14 yen. The euro rose to $1.1573 from $1.1566.

[TITLE]China asks U.S. to protect ‘hard-won’ results before Xi-Trump meeting:
[TEXT]
The Chinese Communist Party’s official mouthpiece called on the world’s biggest economies to “jointly safeguard hard-won achievements” from their latest trade talks, ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.

Trade negotiators from China and the U.S. announced Sunday that they’d struck a slew of agreements on issues spanning tariffs, shipping fees, fentanyl and export controls over two days in Malaysia. That marked a significant cooling of tensions, after a recent volley of tariff threats and fresh export curbs threatened to derail the bilateral relationship.

Striking a conciliatory tone, the People’s Daily said Monday the progress showed Beijing and Washington were capable of handling their differences. “Neither side was blindsided by these issues, instead they focused on solving the problems,” according to the commentary penned by Zhong Sheng, a Chinese homonym for “Voice of China” that’s often used to set out Beijing’s foreign policy views.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose as much as 1.3% on Monday, while the broader MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.5% to a new intraday record. China’s 10-year government bond yields edged up, as demand for safety assets ebbed following the positive results of trade talks.

Xi and Trump are expected to sign off on the terms this week in South Korea when they sit down in person for the first time since the U.S. president returned to power. That meeting could reveal details around issues such as China’s purchases of U.S. soybeans, Washington’s plans for shipping fees on Chinese vessels and Beijing’s rare earth export controls.

“We expect the leaders to approve the deal, but whether it will bring lasting relief to markets is less clear—the new reality for U.S.-China ties appears to be one of frequent ruptures and short-term fixes,” Chang Shu, David Qu and Jennifer Welch of Bloomberg Economics wrote in a note.

From Beijing’s perspective, fewer external uncertainties will buy policymakers’ time to focus on supporting the domestic economy and enhancing its tech sufficiency, they added. While Chinese industrial companies saw their earnings surge the most in nearly two years last month, the job market remains gloomy and a years long housing crash is lingering.

The People’s Daily commentary called on the U.S. to stick to the trade and economic consultation mechanism led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Export curbs announced by U.S. officials outside that framework have derailed the system several times in recent months, prompting Beijing to jam its rare earth supply chain that’s critical to American manufacturing.

Bessent said he believed China would delay its latest rare-earth restrictions “for a year while they reexamine it” after the latest talks. It had been unclear how Beijing would enforce its proposed curbs asserting control over any global shipment containing even a trace of certain rare metals from China, a move that had sparked outcry in Europe, too.

Another potential area for a quick win is the 20% fentanyl tariff the U.S. has imposed on Beijing to pressure authorities into halting the flow of precursor chemicals used to make the deadly drug. Relief on that levy—which stacks on top of Liberation Day tariffs—could be a boon for the Asian nation at a time when domestic demand is weak.

China and the U.S. have held five rounds of talks since Trump unveiled the highest U.S. tariffs since the 1930s in April, which ended with Chinese exports to America facing a 55% levy. The People’s Daily piece said those talks were proof that neither nation wanted to decouple.

“The two sides should meet each other halfway, cherish outcomes of every dialogue and continuously build mutual trust and manage differences,” the publication said.

Despite the latest dovish language from both sides, global investors are learning to embrace the new normal of “tension, escalation and truce,” Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. wrote in a Monday note.

“It’s good for the world’s top two largest economies to dial down tensions,” he added, “but we believe the superpower rivalry will likely escalate in the future.”

[TITLE]HSBC third-quarter profit slides on Madoff charges:
[TEXT]
HSBC Holdings has today reported a 14% decline in third-quarter pretax profit, hurt by a $1.1 billion charge after losing part of an appeal in a lawsuit tied to Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, history's biggest-ever such fraud.

But the bank also upgraded its income forecast for the year, reflecting the view that rate cuts in key markets such as Hong Kong and Britain will be slower than initially thought.

It now expects to make $43 billion in net interest income in 2025, up from a forecast of around $42 billion in June.

"The intent with which we are executing our strategy is reflected in our performance this quarter, despite taking legal provisions related to historical matters," chief executive Georges Elhedery said in a statement.

HSBC posted a pretax profit of $7.3 billion for the third quarter. Before the surprise news of the provision, expectations were for a pretax profit of $7.66 billion, according to a consensus estimate from analysts compiled by the bank.

In addition to the Madoff provision, the bank also logged an additional $300m in legal charges relating to historical trading activities in HSBC Bank plc.

The bank also lifted its return on equity target to the mid-teens or better, from an earlier estimate of mid-teens.

That said, the results show how Elhedery's drive to improve profit continues to be hampered by major litigation, ongoing restructuring, and property sector-related charges.

HSBC has booked $5 billion in writedowns on its China bank holding over the last few quarters and losses from deteriorating Hong Kong commercial real estate loans have climbed.

The worsening commercial real estate market in Hong Kong has prompted HSBC to upgrade its credit loss model, it said in the statement.

In the first nine months of this year, it logged an increase of $900m in charges for non-performing loans compared to the same period last year, with two-thirds of that amount arising from exposure to Hong Kong property.

The losses reflected "higher allowances for new defaulted exposures, the impact of an over-supply of non-residential properties that has put continued downward pressure on rental and capital values", HSBC said.

A career HSBC insider, Elhedery has shaken up the bank since assuming the chief executive role a year ago by reorganising operating divisions along East-West lines, shedding sub-scale investment banking units and slashing the ranks of senior managers.

As well as announcing exits from 11 underperforming markets and businesses so far this year, Elhedery has signalled a willingness to invest where he thinks the bank can further grow.

HSBC, which has a market value of $226 billion, announced in October it has offered $13.6 billion to buy out other shareholders in its majority-owned Hang Seng Bank, a Hong Kong lender hit hard by its local property exposure.

It has decided to pause share buybacks for about three quarters to build up the capital required for the deal.

The bank said it would pay an interim dividend of 10 cents a share - its third payment in 2025 following a total of 20 cents announced earlier.

HSBC to take $1.1 billion hit after Luxembourg court ruling in Madoff case

HSBC Holdings said yesterday it would book a $1.1 billion provision in its third-quarter results after losing part of an appeal in a long-running lawsuit tied to Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, history's biggest ever such fraud.

HSBC acted as a service provider to several funds that invested with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. Herald Fund SPC sued HSBC's Luxembourg unit in 2009 seeking restitution of assets it said were lost in the fraud.

Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme was the biggest-ever such fraud

Last Friday, the Luxembourg Court of Cassation rejected an appeal by HSBC's unit over the restitution of securities claimed by Herald, although it accepted its appeal on a separate cash restitution claim, the bank said.

Herald had alleged that HSBC failed in its duties as a custodian to protect it from the fraud, previous court documents from the case show.

HSBC now plans to lodge a second appeal with the Luxembourg Court of Appeal and, if unsuccessful, the bank said it would contest the amount to be paid.

It added that the eventual financial impact could differ significantly from its current estimate.

Europe's largest bank by assets said in July that Herald, which is in liquidation, was seeking the restitution of securities and cash worth $2.5 billion plus interest or damages of $5.6 billion plus interest.

The bank estimated that the provision would have an impact of around 15 basis points (or 0.15 of a percentage point) on its common equity tier 1 capital ratio, meaning little lasting impact on the key measure of financial strength, which stands at 14.6%.

That would come on top of a 125 basis points impact arising from its $13.6 billion deal to take its majority-owned Hong Kong unit Hang Seng Bank private.

The charge could weigh on sentiment slightly but the impact should be limited as HSBC has already suspended share buybacks for the next three quarters due to the acquisition of Hang Seng Bank, said Lorraine Tan, director of equity research (Asia) for Morningstar.

Madoff's fraud was estimated as much as $64.8 billion, making it the biggest-ever Ponzi scheme, a kind of fraud whereby old investors are paid off with funds from newer ones while the organiser siphons off some of the money for themselves.

It went undiscovered for years until Madoff confessed to his sons in December 2008, one day after his firm's Christmas party. Madoff eventually pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts. He died aged 82 in April 2021 while serving a 150-year prison sentence.

HSBC in 2012 settled with Kalix Fund for an undisclosed amount, also over losses the fund had suffered during the collapse of Madoff's financial empire. The fund had sued the bank for $35.6m.

Comments from the U.S. treasury Secretary Scot Bessent that there is a 'substantial framework for trade negotiations with China' indicate that a U.S.-China trade deal is on the cards."For India, the fundamentals are also turning positive with brisk festival season sales and reports of a smart pick up in capital spending by the private sector, Vijayakumar said, adding that this long awaited trend has significant positive implications for India’s growth and stock market."Conditions are favourable for the Nifty and Sensex to climb to record highs. An important feature of the ongoing rally in the market is its correlation with short covering.
