[TITLE]ACA subsidies will be extended by 1–2 yrs: Healthcare strategist:
[TEXT]
00:00 Speaker A

What do you think the prospects are for an extension of the ACA subsidies, you know, either by the end of the year or or at all?

00:09 Speaker B

It seems like it's sort of, um, self-fulfilling. I I just can't see politicians wiping out the subsidies in, you know, with the with the mid-terms coming up and how important it is to so much of the um electorate. I mean, when when we talk about this group, a lot of it has always hinged on what is the senior population going to do. In this case, they're they're younger patients, um stripping away insurance and having them go go get it on their own.

00:44 Speaker B

At this point, um, you know, with a bigger out of pocket component seems unlikely. I know that the administration has talked about maybe curtailing the subsidies and instead, you know, giving some of these, um giving some of the population, you know, some sort of payment in the form of a a check or otherwise that basically bridges the gap between what they would have gotten and the the subsidies going away.

01:07 Speaker B

But I think too many politicians have their careers on the line. I would I would doubt that the subsidies get uh derailed completely. So I think we're looking at at least a year, maybe two of an extension.

[TITLE]MOH DEADLINE NOTICE: ROSEN, NATIONAL TRIAL ATTORNEYS, Encourages Molina Healthcare, Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important December 2 Deadline in Securities Class Action – MOH:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) between February 5, 2025 and July 23, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important December 2, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Molina securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 2, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period failed to disclose to investors: (1) material, adverse facts concerning Molina’s “medical cost trend assumptions;” (2) that Molina was experiencing a “dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend;” (3) that Molina’s near term growth was dependent on a lack of “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services;” (4) as a result of the foregoing, Molina’s financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 was substantially likely to be cut; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Molina’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

The Global Pharmaceutical Bags Aseptic Filling Market, valued at USD 62.28 Billion in 2024, is projected to experience a CAGR of 7.40% to reach USD 95.58 Billion by 2030

The Global Pharmaceutical Bags Aseptic Filling Market encompasses the sterile packaging of drug products, particularly liquids and suspensions, into pre-sterilized flexible bags within a controlled aseptic environment to prevent microbial contamination. Market expansion is driven by the increasing demand for parenteral drugs, a heightened global emphasis on patient safety, the expanding adoption of single-use technologies in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, and stringent regulatory requirements ensuring product sterility.

The Global Pharmaceutical Bags Aseptic Filling Market is significantly influenced by the escalating demand for sterile pharmaceutical products and the increasingly stringent regulatory standards governing aseptic manufacturing. The need for sterile drug products, particularly for parenteral administration, vaccines, and advanced biologic therapies, continues to rise globally due to demographic shifts and the expanding scope of treatable chronic and complex diseases. This necessitates robust and scalable aseptic filling solutions to ensure product safety and efficacy.

Key Market Challenges

The substantial capital investment required for establishing and maintaining aseptic filling infrastructure presents a significant barrier to the expansion of the Global Pharmaceutical Bags Aseptic Filling Market. This challenge directly impacts both new entrants and existing manufacturers considering facility upgrades or expansions. The initial outlay for specialized equipment, cleanroom environments, and advanced monitoring systems is considerable, creating a high threshold for participation.

Furthermore, the continuous operational expenses for maintaining sterility, including energy consumption for stringent environmental controls, specialized filtration, and routine validation, add to the financial burden. This high cost of ownership limits the number of companies able to adopt or scale up aseptic filling capabilities, thereby restricting overall market growth.

[TITLE]BioNexus Gene Lab Corp. (Nasdaq: BGLC) Secures $500 Million Equity Facility From ARC Group International to Support Expansion of Precision Diagnostics, CDMO Operations, and Therapeutic Commercializati:
[TEXT]
SHERIDAN, Wyo., Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioNexus Gene Lab Corp. (“BGLC” or the “Company”), an emerging provider of precision oncology diagnostics with expanding operations across Southeast Asia, today announced it has entered into a $500,000,000 Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Facility”) with ARC Group International Ltd. (“ARC”), a global investment bank and the parent of ARC Group Securities, a FINRA registered broker dealer. The Company believes this facility will provide it with long-term, discretionary access to capital to advance its strategic initiatives, including the commercialization of the VitaGuard™ minimal residual disease (MRD) platform, the addition of contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) services to its business regionally, and building the Company’s therapeutic development and commercialization programs.

Under the terms of the Agreement, BGLC, at its sole discretion, may issue and sell registered shares of its common stock to ARC over the commitment period of 36 months. In consideration for ARC’s commitment, BGLC issued 175,000 shares of common stock as a one-time fee, priced at the closing price on Nov 26, 2025 - $4.32. ARC is prohibited from owning more than 9.99% of BGLC’s outstanding shares at any time and is restricted from short-selling or hedging the Company’s securities. The Company will file a registration statement to register the resale of shares issued under the Facility, and no shares may be sold prior to registration.

The Facility complements BGLC’s previously announced $20 million At-The-Market program, enhancing the Company’s financial flexibility while preserving strategic control over the timing and scale of capital deployment.

“This commitment from ARC strengthens our capital position at a pivotal time for BGLC,” said Sam Tan, Chief Executive Officer of BioNexus Gene Lab Corp. “Following our recently executed exclusive licensing agreement for the VitaGuard MRD platform in Southeast Asia, and with the ongoing transformation of our business into a CDMO capable of supporting high-value bioprocessing and manufacturing, we are building a diversified biotechnology platform with multiple growth pathways.”

“Importantly, this Facility is entirely at our discretion and is intended to support milestone-driven initiatives rather than routine financing,” Tan added. “We intend to draw from this resource selectively and responsibly as we advance our diagnostics, CDMO, and therapeutic commercialization programs.”

Please refer to the Company’s Form 8-K filed on December 2, 2025 regarding this transaction for more pertinent details concerning the Facility.

On November 28, 2025, BGLC executed a definitive licensing agreement with Fidelion Diagnostics Pte. Ltd. to commercialize the VitaGuard™ MRD assay, a next-generation liquid biopsy platform for early cancer detection, recurrence monitoring, and precision-treatment decision making. The ARC Facility enhances BGLC’s ability to support clinical adoption, regulatory pathways, and infrastructure development necessary to bring MRD testing to broader populations across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand.

BGLC continues to expand its business to include contract development and manufacturing organization services, enabling the Company to participate in biologics production, assay manufacturing, and high-performance diagnostic supply chains. The Facility strengthens BGLC’s ability to invest in quality-systems upgrades, manufacturing capacity, technical capabilities, and strategic partnerships aligned with global CDMO standards.

Advancing Therapeutic Opportunities

The Company also continues to progress the strategic partnership initiative with BirchBioMed Inc., the subject of a recently announced non-binding term sheet, including regional regulatory planning for FS2, a topical therapeutic candidate targeting fibrosis, hypertrophic scarring, and skin regeneration. The Facility provides capital optionality to support clinical, regulatory, and commercial preparations as the term sheet potentially moves into a definitive partnership.

[TITLE]ACA subsidies will be extended by 1–2 yrs: Healthcare strategist:
[TEXT]
00:00 Speaker A

What do you think the prospects are for an extension of the ACA subsidies, you know, either by the end of the year or or at all?

00:09 Speaker B

It seems like it's sort of, um, self-fulfilling. I I just can't see politicians wiping out the subsidies in, you know, with the with the mid-terms coming up and how important it is to so much of the um electorate. I mean, when when we talk about this group, a lot of it has always hinged on what is the senior population going to do. In this case, they're they're younger patients, um stripping away insurance and having them go go get it on their own.

00:44 Speaker B

At this point, um, you know, with a bigger out of pocket component seems unlikely. I know that the administration has talked about maybe curtailing the subsidies and instead, you know, giving some of these, um giving some of the population, you know, some sort of payment in the form of a a check or otherwise that basically bridges the gap between what they would have gotten and the the subsidies going away.

01:07 Speaker B

But I think too many politicians have their careers on the line. I would I would doubt that the subsidies get uh derailed completely. So I think we're looking at at least a year, maybe two of an extension.

[TITLE]MOH DEADLINE NOTICE: ROSEN, NATIONAL TRIAL ATTORNEYS, Encourages Molina Healthcare, Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important December 2 Deadline in Securities Class Action – MOH:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) between February 5, 2025 and July 23, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important December 2, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Molina securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 2, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved, at that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period failed to disclose to investors: (1) material, adverse facts concerning Molina’s “medical cost trend assumptions;” (2) that Molina was experiencing a “dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend;” (3) that Molina’s near term growth was dependent on a lack of “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services;” (4) as a result of the foregoing, Molina’s financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 was substantially likely to be cut; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Molina’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Molina class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=45913 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
