[TITLE]Berkshire reveals new $4.3 billion Alphabet stake, sells more Apple:
[TEXT]
Berkshire Hathaway revealed a $4.3 billion stake in Google parent Alphabet and further reduced its stake in Apple, detailing its equity portfolio for the last time before Warren Buffett ends his 60-year run as chief executive officer.

In a filing on Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Berkshire said it owned 17.85 million Alphabet shares as of September 30.

Berkshire cut its Apple stake to 238.2 million shares from 280 million in the third quarter, and has sold nearly three-quarters of the more than 900 million shares it once held. Apple remained Berkshire's largest stock holding, at $60.7 billion.

The filing listed Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock holdings as of September 30, which comprised most of the conglomerate's $283.2 billion equity portfolio.

Berkshire's investment in Alphabet, which became its tenth-largest U.S. stock holding, is surprising given Buffett's usual value-investing style and aversion to technology companies.

Buffett considers Apple, which makes the iPhone, more of a consumer products company.

It is not clear whether Buffett, his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, or CEO-designate Greg Abel make specific purchases, though Buffett normally makes larger investments.

At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2019, Buffett and late Vice Chairman Charlie Munger lamented not investing in Google sooner.

Buffett said Google's advertising model bore similarities to what was working for Berkshire's Geico car insurance unit.

"We screwed up," Munger said.

"He's saying we blew it," Buffett responded.

Alphabet shares rose 1.7 per cent in after-hours trading. Stock prices often rise when Berkshire reveals new stakes, reflecting what investors view as Buffett's seal of approval.

BERKSHIRE SELLS MORE BANK OF AMERICA

Berkshire bought $6.4 billion of stocks and sold $12.5 billion between July and September, the twelfth straight quarter it was a net seller of stocks, while cash grew to a record $381.7 billion.

Apple may have accounted for three-quarters or more of the sales.

Berkshire also sold 6 per cent of its Bank of America shares, extending selling that began in last year's third quarter.

The bank is still Berkshire's third-largest stock holding. Berkshire also shed its stake in homebuilder DR Horton, while buying more stock in several companies including the insurer Chubb and Domino's Pizza.

Buffett has let cash swell as he prepares to turn his $1.1 trillion conglomerate over to Abel, now a vice chairman, on January 1.

Investors and analysts have said Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire has been cautious

[TITLE]Logitech confirms data breach after Clop extortion attack:
[TEXT]
Hardware accessory giant Logitech has confirmed it suffered a data breach in a cyberattack claimed by the Clop extortion gang, which conducted Oracle E-Business Suite data theft attacks in July.

Logitech International S.A. is a Swiss multinational electronics company that sells hardware and software solutions, including computer peripherals, gaming, video collaboration, music, and smart home products.

Today, Logitech filed a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, confirming that data was stolen in a breach.

"Logitech International S.A. ("Logitech") recently experienced a cybersecurity incident relating to the exfiltration of data. The cybersecurity incident has not impacted Logitech's products, business operations or manufacturing," disclosed Logitech.

"Upon detecting the incident, Logitech promptly took steps to investigate and respond to the incident with the assistance of leading external cybersecurity firms."

Logitech says the data likely includes limited information

[TITLE]ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI chatbot:
[TEXT]
ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

November 2025

OpenAI rolls out GPT‑5.1 with advanced reasoning and user-friendly tone

OpenAI has released GPT‑5.1, upgrading the GPT‑5 series with two models: Instant, which it says will be warmer and more conversational with users, and Thinking, which offers faster, simple-task handling and more persistent complex reasoning. The update also introduces improved controls for customizing ChatGPT’s tone to better match user preferences.

Munich court says ChatGPT violated music copyright laws

A Munich court ruled that ChatGPT violated German copyright law by reproducing lyrics from nine protected songs, including Herbert Grönemeyer’s hits, rejecting OpenAI’s argument that the AI only reflected learned patterns. The decision could set a European precedent on AI use of copyrighted material, amid growing global legal challenges over AI and music rights.

OpenAI is exploring the consumer health sector, developing AI tools like personal health assistants and data aggregators, according to a report by Business Insider. With new healthcare-focused hires, it aims to simplify access to fragmented medical data — an area where Big Tech has struggled — through its conversational AI approach.

Seven more families accuse OpenAI of negligence over ChatGPT-related suicides

In November 2025, seven families sued OpenAI, alleging that GPT-4o was released prematurely without safeguards, contributing to suicides and severe psychiatric harm. One case involved 23-year-old Zane Shamblin, who told ChatGPT of his suicide plans, and the AI encouraged him. The lawsuits focus on GPT-4o’s tendency to be overly agreeable, despite users expressing dangerous intentions.

OpenAI reaches 1million business clients in record time

On November 5, OpenAI announced that over 1 million businesses globally now use its products, making it the fastest-growing business platform in history. Companies across industries like finance, healthcare, and retail, including Amgen, Booking.com, Cisco, Morgan Stanley, T-Mobile, Target, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, are using ChatGPT and OpenAI’s developer tools to enhance operations and customer experiences.

October 2025

ChatGPT handles over a million suicide-related conversations weekly

OpenAI revealed that a small but significant portion of ChatGPT users, more than a million weekly, discuss mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or mania, with the AI. The company says it has improved ChatGPT’s responses by consulting more than 170 mental health experts to handle such conversations more appropriately than earlier versions.

OpenAI reportedly working on AI that create music from text and audio

OpenAI is developing a new tool that generates music from text and audio prompts, potentially for enhancing videos or adding instrumentation, and is training it using annotated scores from Juilliard students, according to The Information. The launch date and whether it will be standalone or integrated with ChatGPT and Sora remain unclear.

ChatGPT gets smarter at organizing your work and school info

OpenAI’s new “company knowledge” update for ChatGPT lets Business, Enterprise, and Education users search workplace data across tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub using GPT‑5, per a report by The Verge. The feature acts as a conversational search engine, providing more comprehensive and accurate answers by scouring multiple sources simultaneously.

OpenAI launches Atlas to make ChatGPT your main search tool

OpenAI has launched its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, starting on Mac, letting users get answers from ChatGPT instead of traditional search results. Unlike other AI browsers, Atlas is open to all users and will soon come to Windows, iOS, and Android, as OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the go-to tool for browsing the web.

ChatGPT app growth slows, but still draws millions of daily users

A new Apptopia analysis suggests ChatGPT’s mobile app growth may be leveling off, with global download growth slowing since April. While daily installs remain in the millions, October is tracking an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new downloads.

Walmart shopping comes to ChatGPT

OpenAI is partnering with Walmart to allow users to browse products, plan meals, and make purchases through ChatGPT, with support for third-party sellers expected later this fall. The partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader effort to develop AI-driven e-commerce tools, including collaborations with Etsy and Shopify.

OpenAI brings ChatGPT Go plan to 16 more Asian countries

OpenAI is expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan, priced under $5, to 16 new countries across Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. In some of these countries, users can pay in local currencies, while in others, payments are required in USD, with final costs varying due to local taxes.

ChatGPT surpasses 800 million weekly active users

ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said. This milestone comes as OpenAI accelerates efforts to expand its AI infrastructure and secure more chips to support rising demand.

Developers can now build apps inside ChatGPT

OpenAI now allows developers to build interactive apps directly inside ChatGPT, with early partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva already onboard. The ChatGPT maker is also rolling out a preview of its Apps SDK, a developer toolkit for creating these chat-based experiences.

September 2025

ChatGPT rolls out parental controls following teen suicide case

OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide.

OpenAI introduces ChatGPT Pulse for personalized morning briefs

OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users.

OpenAI moves into AI-Powered shopping, challenging tech giants

OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place.

OpenAI brings budget-friendly ChatGPT Go to Indonesian users

OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia.

OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns

CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns

[TEXT]
LAS VEGAS, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jet.AI. Inc.

(“Consensus Core”).

Recent Operational Highlights

Completed second milestone of Canadian Hyperscale Data Center Project in partnership with Consensus Core Technologies Inc.

Extended outside date of proposed merger with flyExclusive, Inc. (“flyExclusive”) to December 31, 2025 amid the government shutdown, which temporarily halted the SEC’s review of all merger proxies

Announced successful closing of AI Infrastructure Acquisition Corp.’s initial public offering, bolstering Jet.AI’s book equity by approximately $20 million from the minority ownership stake in AI Infrastructure Acquisition Corp.’s sponsor, AIIA Sponsor Ltd.

Management Commentary

Founder and Executive Chairman Mike Winston stated: “Over the past several weeks and months, we’ve made meaningful progress across our ongoing initiatives to further transition Jet.AI into a leader of high-performance GPU infrastructure and AI cloud services. The AI Infrastructure Acquisition Corp. initial public offering successfully closed and was oversubscribed, which bolstered Jet.AI’s book equity by $20 million through our ownership stake in the sponsor. We also extended the outside date for our flyExclusive merger agreement amidst the government shutdown; however, both parties remain eager and optimistic

[TITLE]Phaos Technology Announces Closing of Initial Public Offering:
[TEXT]
SINGAPORE, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Phaos Technology Holdings (Cayman) Limited, (NYSE American: POAS), (“Phaos” or “the Company”), the investment holding company of Phaos Technology Pte. Ltd., an advanced microscopy solutions Company, today announced the closing of its previously announced initial public offering of an aggregate of 2,700,000 class A ordinary shares of the Company (the “Offering”) at a public offering price of US$4.00 per share (the “Offering Price”) to the public for a total of US$10,800,000 of gross proceeds to the Company, before deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. Pursuant to the Offering, certain selling shareholders of the Company offered an aggregate of 900,090 class A ordinary shares of the Company at the Offering Price.

The Company has granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase an additional 405,000 class A ordinary shares at the Offering Price less the underwriting discounts, solely to cover over-allotments, if any, representing 15% of the class A ordinary shares sold by the Company in the Offering (excluding class A ordinary shares sold by the selling shareholders, and those subject to this over-allotment option). Assuming that the over-allotment is exercised in full, the Company is expected to receive gross proceeds amounting to approximately US$12,420,000 before deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses.

Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. (“Network 1”), a full-service broker/dealer, acted as the sole book-running manager for the Offering. Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP acted as U.S. securities counsel to the Company and Loeb & Loeb LLP acted as U.S. counsel for Network 1, in connection with the Offering.

The Offering was conducted pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form F-1 (File No. 333-284137) previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and became effective on the November 11, 2025 (the “Effective Date”) in accordance with the provisions of Section 8(a) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in a final post-effective registration statement on Form F-1 that contained the affirmative statement on the cover that such registration statement shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of section 8(a) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notice of the post-effective registration statement was filed on October 22, 2025, 20 days prior to that Effective Date. The Offering was made only by means of a prospectus, forming a part of the registration statement on Form F-1. A final prospectus relating to the Offering was filed with the SEC on November 13, 2025, and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

[TITLE]BofA: Buy these 16 cheap non-AI stocks if you're worried about bubble:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Wait, there's more to the market than just AI stocks?

You'd be forgiven for not realizing that these days. AI dominates the market narrative, and, to be fair, stocks in these sectors have driven a significant share of S&P 500 returns recently.

But pockets of opportunity do remain outside of AI, as Bank of America pointed out in a note to clients this week. Given investor concerns around how hot the AI trade has become, the bank had a team of analysts come up with a list of non-AI stocks they like most.

They picked out 16 companies, all of which are "Buy" rated by the bank.

"The market has been so focused on owning companies benefitting from AI investment — from semiconductors to power plants to hyperscalers to certain capital goods names — that the conversation may be missing other opportunities," BofA analysts said.

"We thought it would be useful to highlight companies that aren't generally considered direct AI beneficiaries but which our analysts find to be compelling," the note continued. "Some of these stocks, like Freeport-McMoRan do have indirect exposure to AI but stocks we selected are not trading like companies directly exposed and the AI exposure may be overshadowed by other concerns."

Below are the 16 stocks listed in alphabetical order. Commentary from the analysts is also included.

[TEXT]
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the company at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on April 4, 2025.

1. The Dow was headed for a lower open this morning. The 30-stock average closed above 48,000 for the first time. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq , which didn't have the same record luck yesterday, were on track to open lower, too. The new trading day kicks off after President Donald Trump signed a bill last night that ended the record 43-day government shutdown.

2. Disney reported a mixed quarter, beating on earnings but missing on revenue. The Club stock dropped more than 5.5% on the release. Entertainment segment revenue fell 6%. Streaming grew 8%, but linear TV declined 16%. In a bright spot, Disney+ added 3.8 million subscribers for a total 131.6 million, which was better than estimates. The sports segment, which includes ESPN, grew 2%; and experiences, which includes parks, rose 6%.

3. Apple has reached a deal with China-based Tencent to allow the iPhone maker to take a 15% cut of purchases made within WeChat's mini games and apps, according to Bloomberg. That commission agreement with the sprawling Chinese messaging, social media, games, and payment platform is

The big story

Rajat Mehta, scion of Mumbai-based Mehta Group, walked out of the listing ceremony of Billionbrains Garage Ventures or Groww, on Wednesday, feeling vindicated. The company he backed in 2016 as an early-stage investor, at a valuation of roughly $1.3 million, debuted at $8.6 billion on the National Stock Exchange. The 36-year-old felt a sense of pride after his father, Rakesh Mehta, told him, "Let's find the next Groww to invest." Coming from a business family whose fortunes were built on advisory, wealth management and brokerage services, the Mehtas traditionally preferred the comfort of listed companies. But it was the younger Mehta who pushed the family toward investing in unlisted assets and startups when he joined the business in 2013. "The first startup I invested in went bust within three months," he recalled. "But I learnt from that and kept on investing." He has now invested in 35 startups, including some valued at over a billion dollars and are in the process of being listed.

The millennial is part of a broader shift among wealthy Indian families who are investing in startups. India is on the cusp of an unprecedented intergenerational wealth transfer, with an estimated $1.5 trillion expected to change hands over the next decade, according to a report by Julius Baer and EY in June this year. Between 2018 and 2024, the number of family offices in India rose more than 500% to over 300 from 45, the report said, citing a separate study. Another measure of rising wealth — the number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, or families with assets above $30 million — also increased to roughly 13,000 in the same period. The true number of family offices in India could be five to 10 times higher, according to multiple wealth managers that I interviewed for this newsletter.

The next investors

The next generation of these wealthy families is typically well educated, often with international degrees, and may be reluctant to pursue the traditional family business or remain unconvinced

The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 account for 40% of the index’s market cap. Since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, AI-related stocks have registered 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital spending growth. Meanwhile, AI investments accounted for nearly 92% of the U.S. GDP growth this year. Without those AI investments, Harvard economist Jason Furman noted, growth would be flat. As Ruchir Sharma concluded in the Financial Times, “America is now one big bet on AI,” adding, “AI better deliver for the U.S., or its economy and markets will lose the one leg they are now standing on.” This concentration creates fragility, and how the end begins becomes more visible.

ICE & Wiping Grandma’s Ass

I’m especially proud of the above header, and there is a connection. The S&P, Nasdaq, and DJIA are some of the most damaging metrics in modern history as they create the illusion of prosperity, even as depravity rages on. The cloud cover for a masked, secret police terrorizing communities is these indices. As long as your 401(k) is going up, then everything must make sense and be okay, no? No. Trump could not send troops into U.S. cities if the S&P were down, vs. up, 13%. AI stocks, and the sugar high they have inspired across the entire market, numb Americans from the nagging tooth pain that we are descending into fascism. Yeah, those evil people who wipe your grandma’s ass, pick our crops, and build our homes can be treated inhumanely as long as Nvidia remains worth more than the entire German stock market.

Trillion-Dollar Question

Valuations for the Mag 10 — the original group of seven leading tech stocks, plus AMD, Broadcom, and Palantir — are high, but not yet at historic peaks. The 24-month forward P/E ratio of the Mag 10 is 35x. In 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, the top 10 stocks traded at 52x forward earnings. Implicit in these valuations, however, is an assumption that AI will help these companies cut costs, or grow revenues by $1 trillion in the next two years. I believe we’re either going to see a massive destruction in valuations, infecting all U.S. stocks and global markets. Or we’re going to see a massive destruction in employment across industries with the highest concentrations of white-collar workers. Both scenarios are ugly.

If Mag 10 valuations are cut in half, the S&P and global markets would decline by 20% and 10%, respectively. In the U.S., the immediate impact would be felt by the wealthiest 10%, who own 87% of the stocks. Those households won’t struggle to pay their bills, but they may be the tail of the whip on the economy, as wealthy households have the luxury of decreasing their spending dramatically, vs. middle-class households, who spend the majority of their income on basics. If the top 10%, who account for half the consumer spending in the U.S., hit the brakes, the nation gets whiplash. I estimate that if the wealthy see their portfolios drop by 20%, we could see a 2-3% decline in GDP. For context: From peak to trough, the Great Recession registered a 4.3% drop in GDP.

If the Mag 10 justify their valuations by delivering $1 trillion in cost-cutting (Latin for “layoffs”), the impact will hit white-collar workers first, but the contagion could spread. Assuming an average white-collar wage of $100,000 per year, that’s 10 million jobs lost and a 6% increase in unemployment. That estimate is conservative compared to the “white-collar bloodbath” predicted by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who told Axios, “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment 10%–20% in the next one to five years.” The IMF warns that 60% of jobs are already exposed to AI in advanced economies and 40% in emerging markets. According to Okun’s Law, for every 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, real GDP falls by approximately 2 percentage points. But AI could be a different story, with some experts predicting jobless growth. According to a J.P. Morgan report, AI may do to white-collar work what automation did to middle-skill jobs like sales, manufacturing, and construction in the 1980s. The canary in the coal mine may be recent college graduates. Stanford economists found that early-career workers (ages 22 to 25) in the most AI-exposed jobs have experienced a 13% relative decline in employment. If this trend accelerates, today’s challenges around wealth inequality and political volatility will seem quaint.

Past Bubbles

A 2018 study that examined 51 innovations between 1825 and 2000 found 37 were accompanied by bubbles. The destruction that followed in each bubble’s wake, however, varied greatly, depending on several factors. Bubbles inflated by political policies are more destructive than those inflated by new technologies, according to economic historians William Quinn and John Turner. The size of the capital investment is also important. British railway investment in the 1840s was 15%–20% of GDP. When that bubble burst, unemployment doubled. In the U.S., railroad capex averaged 2.4% of GDP in the 1870s. That bubble drove the financial panic of 1873. In both cases, however, those investments paid (delayed) dividends in the form of rail capacity that helped distribute the promise of the Industrial Revolution. In contrast, as The Economist noted, the capex by electronics firms in the 1980s fueled Japan’s asset price bubble, but the spending “ultimately served no useful function.” Finally, the severity of a crash depends on who takes the losses. A second British rail bubble in the 1860s hit banks hard. The recent NFT bubble was a case study in the greater fool theory, but the contagion didn’t reach the broader economy.

Bubble Trouble?

You can’t predict when/if a bubble will burst, but Azeem Azhar, founder of Exponential View, and researcher Nathan Warren, created a framework that compares historic bubbles with AI today. In their estimation, AI is a boom, but “booms can sour quickly and there are several pressure points worth watching.” If AI capex exceeds 2% of GDP, that’s cause for concern; it’s currently estimated at around 1.3%. A sustained fall in enterprise or consumer spending levels is another pressure point. A flawed, though perhaps directionally correct MIT study, rattled the AI ecosystem claiming that 95% of firms have yet to see measurable ROI from their AI pilot programs. We’re approaching a valuation redline if/when P/E ratios reach the 50x to 60x range. Finally, if internal cash covers less than 25% of capex, Azhar and Warren believe investments in data centers will come under pressure.

Dot-Com Vibes

The AI infrastructure build-out has accelerated recently with an estimated $1 trillion in new commitments. Some firms are making deals with money and assets that don’t yet exist. See: OpenAI promising Oracle $300 billion — money it doesn’t have — for infrastructure Oracle hasn’t built. In other cases, revenue comes from “circular financing,” where dollars rotate between firms, obscuring true market demand. See: Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which OpenAI will use to buy … Nvidia chips. Circular financing deals were common toward the end of the dot-com bubble, when similar deals contributed to a crash that destroyed 77% of Nasdaq market value. If we are on the precipice of a bubble popping, Nvidia and OpenAI will likely be ground zero. But the fallout would be widespread, as an ecosystem that resembles an ouroboros lives and dies by a shared narrative.

Fragile

In his book Irrational Exuberance Robert Shiller wrote, “The word ‘bubble’ creates a mental picture of an expanding soap bubble, which is destined to pop suddenly and irrevocably. But speculative bubbles are as easily ended; indeed, they may deflate somewhat, as the story changes, and then reflate.” The operative word is “story.” Entrepreneurs, aka storytellers, deploy narratives to capture imaginations and capital in order to pull the future forward. Valuations aren’t a function of balance sheets, but of the stories that give those balance sheets meaning and direction. In the case of AI, a key storyline is shifting. A Prof G analysis of ChatGPT data found that work-related prompts fell from 47% in 2022 to 27% in 2025; ChatGPT has 76% market share. As my Markets cohost Ed Elson said, “the bull case for AI is that it’s going to transform work, but what we’re learning is it’s mostly just affecting your personal life.”

The trouble isn’t the shifting narrative, but the fragility of America’s bet on AI and wealthy consumers driving growth. If McDonald’s goes out of business, the fast-food industry will continue to meet demand for cheap calories; the industry is robust (i.e., anti-fragile). J.P. Morgan, now worth more than the 10 biggest banks in the EU combined, is too big to fail. America’s bet on AI is now a bet without hedge. If companies that aren’t the Mag 10 (i.e., the S&P 490) report they’re scaling back AI investments as the adoption layer fails to launch, the connective tissue between AI, trillions in market cap, and the broader economy severs. The experts have already deemed the grid and electrons as the gating factor to our AI future. However, they’re ignoring a more glaring possibility: AI may be more like VR than GPS and just not offer the ROI built into these valuations. Also, citizens burned by tech executives writing books on gender balance as they launch products that result in teen girls cutting themselves may decide character AI and porn are disastrous for our sons.

If China’s AI program produces another “Sputnik moment” similar to DeepSeek earlier this year, valuations for U.S. AI firms could tumble. And if reports including Apple’s “The Illusion of Thinking” extinguish the hope that artificial general intelligence is near, AI, and by extension the American economy, may experience a significant correction. We’re the biggest economy in the world and the most powerful nation in history. However, concentrating wealth in so few hands, betting on so few companies, makes us fragile.

When asked what one piece of advice I’d give young people, I offer “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.” Our economy rests on the belief that AI is even better than it seems. Careful…

Life is so rich,

P.S. For Prof G Conversations I spoke with Kai Ryssdal, host and senior editor of Marketplace. We discussed the risk of stagflation, the growing divide between the top 10% and everyone else, and why America’s economic strength still depends on the health of its democratic institutions. Listen here, and watch here.

[TITLE]AI stocks at center of stormy day on Wall Street, erasing sharp 1.3% drop:
[TEXT]
An early swoon shook the U.S. stock market on Friday, as Nvidia, bitcoin, gold and other high flyers swung on what’s become an increasingly antsy Wall Street, but it quickly calmed.

After starting the day with a sharp drop of 1.3%, the S&P 500 erased all of it and was up by 0.4%, with an hour remaining in trading. The Nasdaq composite also flipped to a gain of 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed its loss to 163 points, or 0.3%, after earlier being down nearly 600 points.

AI stocks were again at the center of the action, a day after dragging Wall Street to one of its worst drops since its springtime sell-off. Nvidia, which has become the poster child of the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, began the day with a loss of 3.4%. It then stormed back to a rise of 2% and yanked the market in its wake.

Critics have been warning that the U.S. stock market could be primed for a drop because of how high prices have shot since April, leaving them looking too expensive. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the AI mania. Nvidia’s stock has more than doubled in four of the last five years, for example, and it’s still up 42% for this year so far.

Even with the S&P 500’s swings the last couple of weeks, the index that dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts remains within 2% of its record set late last month.

“Occasional market drops are the price of the ticket for the ride,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.

Outside of tech, Walmart edged down 0.2% after saying its CEO, Doug McMillon, will retire in January in a surprise move. He had helped the retailer embrace technology more. It had been down as much as 3.6% in the morning.

One way companies can tamp down criticism

[TITLE]Adclear Raises £2.1 Million To Accelerate AI Compliance For Financial Marketing:
[TEXT]
Adclear has raised £2.1 million in new seed funding to accelerate the expansion of its AI-powered financial-marketing compliance platform, marking a significant milestone for the London-based regtech startup. The round was led by Outward VC, with participation from AFG Partners, Tenity, and angel investors, including Dan Cobley, former Managing Director of Google UK and founder of ClearScore, as well as Keith Grose, Managing Director at Coinbase UK, through the a16z Scout Fund and the Ventures Together community.

Founded to address the growing complexity surrounding financial promotion (FinProm) rules, Adclear utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze marketing content, including videos, digital ads, social media posts, emails, landing pages, and product interfaces. Its technology reviews these materials in real time and flags potential regulatory issues before content goes live. The platform also maintains automatic audit trails and can monitor content after publication, including campaigns produced by affiliates and influencers. Reports indicate that the platform cuts review times by as much as 88 percent compared to traditional manual workflows, a reduction that financial institutions see as increasingly valuable as regulators tighten oversight in the UK and globally.

The new funding will enable Adclear to expand its team, further develop its product roadmap, and increase its presence across Europe, North America, the APAC region, and the Middle East. The company already works with several regulated firms in the UK and plans to expand coverage to additional jurisdictions where financial marketing rules vary widely. With marketing teams facing intense pressure to produce content quickly while remaining fully compliant, demand for automated FinProm review technology continues to rise.

The seed round positions Adclear to compete in a market where compliance failures can lead to severe regulatory consequences, including fines and consumer-protection enforcement. As the financial services sector increasingly relies on digital channels, short-form media, and influencer-driven distribution, companies face more touchpoints that require compliance review. Adclear aims to become a full-lifecycle compliance solution, covering everything from pre-approval to ongoing monitoring.

The £2.1 million investment highlights growing investor interest in tools that blend AI and regulation, at a time when balancing marketing speed, accuracy, and oversight is becoming increasingly challenging. If Adclear can maintain high accuracy in its automated assessments and continue expanding into new markets, the company will be well-positioned to become a core compliance partner for banks, fintechs, and other regulated institutions worldwide.
