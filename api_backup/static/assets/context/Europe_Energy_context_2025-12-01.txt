[TEXT]
The Enugu State Government and the European Union have renewed commitments to deepen cooperation across key sectors of the state’s economy, including education, energy, infrastructure, and youth development.

This followed a courtesy visit to Governor Peter Mbah at Government House, Enugu, by a high-powered EU delegation led by the EU Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr Gautier Mignot, according to a statement released by the governor’s media office on Saturday.

The team also included the Belgian Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Pieter Leenknegt; the Portuguese Ambassador, Mr Paulos Martins dos Santos; and several senior European diplomats.

Speaking during the meeting, Ambassador Mignot said the EU was eager to expand a partnership that aligns directly with the transformational policies of the Mbah administration.

“The purpose of our visit is to meet you, pay our respects, and discuss how to strengthen the partnership between the European Union and Enugu State. We are very interested in areas where our projects meet your administration’s expectations and long-term vision,” he said.

Mignot highlighted ongoing collaborations in the education and energy sectors, describing Enugu as one of the EU’s key beneficiary states.

“In the energy sector, the Solar for Health project is already under implementation. Under this programme, Enugu will receive technical assistance and funding for 20 solar microgrids to power 20 primary healthcare centres and 124 small and medium-sized enterprises,” he explained.

He also noted that the Small Hydro Power for Agro-industrial Sectors Project, implemented by UNIDO, and the Nigeria Energy Support Programme of GIZ were supporting electrification efforts, investment advisory services, and capacity building.

“Three interconnected minigrids of up to 1 MW capacity will also be funded to electrify at least 1,000 beneficiaries,” Mignot added.

On education, he announced that Enugu had been selected as one of the states to benefit from the Education and Youth Empowerment in Nigeria (EISS) programme implemented by UNESCO.

“The programme will train teachers in Smart Green Schools until June 2028. Building resilience and capacity among teachers is central to our goals,” the EU envoy said.

He also referenced the EU’s support for the Eastern Nigeria International Film Festival (ENIFF), describing it as a key platform for creative and cultural exchange.

“The 2025 edition in Enugu provided training for aspiring filmmakers and awarded grants for short film projects. We value this growing partnership with the creative industry,” Mignot noted.

Belgian Ambassador Pieter Leenknegt pointed to Belgium’s long-standing economic footprint in Enugu, particularly through Emenite Limited — a joint venture established in 1961.

“Emenite has over 300 employees from this region. It remains a shining example of Belgian–Nigerian cooperation. We want to continue strengthening this relationship,” he said.

Portuguese Ambassador Paulos Martins dos Santos emphasised Portugal’s wide-ranging interest in Nigeria’s energy, agricultural, and infrastructure sectors.

“The footprint of the European Union in this country is huge and multidimensional. Portugal looks forward to enhancing its contribution to this partnership, especially in areas that complement Enugu’s development plans,” he stressed.

In his remarks, Governor Mbah praised the EU for aligning its programmes with his administration’s development priorities.

“I see a strong synergy between our vision in Enugu and the EU’s programmes across Africa. Our investment of over 33 per cent of our total budget in education is deliberate. If we fail to equip our children today, we will pay ten times more in the future,” he said.

He also invited EU member states to explore emerging investment opportunities in Enugu’s aviation, natural gas, and energy sectors.

“We have launched Enugu Air, and the international wing of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport will soon become operational. We encourage you to speak to your home carriers to begin to consider direct flights to Enugu,” the governor announced.

On the state’s gas infrastructure ambitions, Mbah added: “We are working with the Federal Government to expand the gas pipeline infrastructure. This will unlock enormous economic opportunities in the gas subsector. Enugu is open for business, and we will do everything necessary to ensure investments succeed.”

The visit ended with both parties reaffirming their commitment to sustained collaboration aimed at accelerating development and improving livelihoods across Enugu State.

[TITLE]What the CEO of the world’s largest data center company—with 273 locations in 36 countries—predicts will drive the business forward:
[TEXT]
I think there’s a general trend to think of data centers as a homogeneous mass of a singular thing. But there are four distinct categories of data centers, and each one has its own nuance and characteristics. We exist in one of those categories. There’s the hyperscale category, the ones built by cloud-service providers, where you see massive investment. The second category is wholesale, where you’re usually building a facility to lease back to one tenant, maybe two, usually supporting (AI) training. The third is enterprise, where big companies like banks want to have their own center structure. And the fourth category is colocation, which is where Equinix sits.

Equinix has been a company in this segment for 27 years, so we’re one of the long-term players in this industry. And in the next five years, we’re planning to bring on as much capacity as we did in the last 27 years. That’s a big capital investment for us.

Underpinning that, we have “run simpler,” which sounds easy to say and is very hard to do. You’re taking complexity out of your business, looking at systems and processes. And the last piece is our people piece, which is to “grow together,” growing our business with our customers, linking our employee success to our customer success.

The second part of our ten-word strategy is “solve smarter.” This is

[TITLE]What’s Next for OPEC+ in the Glut Year?:
[TEXT]
OPEC+ is meeting this coming weekend to discuss the next steps in its production control plan. Early reports suggest the group will stick to a pause in the rollback of its cuts. Yet commentators say that this will not be enough—a glut is coming and OPEC+ will need something more than pausing cuts.

First, the numbers. OPEC and its partners from OPEC+ started cutting oil production in 2023 after prices fell from three-digit highs in 2022. At the peak of the cuts, the group was withholding over 5 million barrels daily in supply. In fact, it was withholding close to 6 million barrels daily: the initial OPEC+ cuts of 2 million barrels daily, the first round of voluntary cuts by eight members of the group, amounting to 1.65 million barrels daily, and the second round of voluntary cuts by the same eight members, at 2.2 million barrels daily.

Of these, the original cuts remain in place and will remain there until the end of next year. Of the two rounds of voluntary cuts, 2.2 million barrels daily have been unwound, as well as 411,000 barrels daily from the first round of those cuts. This leaves some 3.24 million barrels daily in withheld supply, per Reuters calculations. Apparently, the amount is not enough to calm markets in their anticipation of a glut.

Not that forecasters are helping. The perception of a glut is already so pervasive that there seems to be few who question it. Not only this, but the glut keeps getting revised higher and higher. Per the International Energy Agency’s latest, the supply overhang in crude oil could top the record-smashing 4 million barrels daily next year—even though the IEA has revised its demand estimates higher. Per JP Morgan, the glut will not only be severe, but it would linger, pressuring prices a lot lower than they already are.

[TITLE]America’s Fragile Grid Faces a Perfect Storm Ahead of Winter:
[TEXT]
The energy infrastructure in the United States has failed repeatedly in instances of severe weather, due to years of underinvestment and the failure of utilities to work together to strengthen larger networks. During winter storms and wildfires, a wide range of energy infrastructure has been known to fail due to the lack of preparedness by utilities and state governments. Going into the winter months, there are fears over more potential network failures across various parts of the U.S.

Texas, California, and several other states face annual power outages due to severe weather events, from winter storms to heatwaves. In February 2021, Storm Uri brought plunging temperatures to the state of Texas and left millions of people without electricity, heat, or running water, as much of the infrastructure froze. These outages turned off electricity in various parts of Texas, including parts of the natural gas network that are electrically operated, such as pumps and antifreeze injection systems. This led to the shutdown of several power plants.

During the storm, as demand increased for heating, Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 GW of rolling blackouts to prevent a total system collapse, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It was the “largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history,” with 4.5 million people losing power for several days, stated a FERC report.

The U.S. energy network is highly fragmented, with different state governments each managing parts of the grid, and a multitude of utilities responsible for different infrastructure. The fractured nature of the system makes it extremely hard to fix. For example, investment made in the transmission lines of one state may not be replicated by the neighbouring state, meaning that the network in part of a region may be more resilient than another.

In 2021, the Biden administration introduced the $2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at upgrading U.S. infrastructure. The plan earmarked $100 billion in financing to update and modernise the electric grid to make it more reliable and resilient. However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.

Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres. There has been a rapid rollout of data centres across the U.S. in recent years, as tech companies invest heavily in the infrastructure needed to power advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. This has driven up energy demand in several states, particularly in Texas. The concern now is that this will increase the risk of energy shortages, which could result in power cuts during freezing temperatures.

Requests for new data centres are on the rise in Texas, thanks to its growing renewable energy capacity and natural gas resources. In recent years, Houston has become known by many as the Silicon Valley of energy, for its strong reputation for energy production, growing cleantech sector, and welcoming business environment. This has helped attract significant investment to the state from tech companies looking to expand operations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in November that the 24/7 energy demand of data centres will make it increasingly difficult to maintain sufficient electricity supply during times of high demand, such as if the temperature drops to an extreme low.

During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW. While the state’s 92.6 GW electricity capacity would normally be enough to power this demand, the available power could decrease to roughly 69.7 GW during a severe weather event, meaning a deficit of over 15 GW.

In a recent analysis, NERC stated, “Strong load growth from new data centres and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” It went on to say that while Texas will experience elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the grid will remain stable during normal peak demand.

Over 120 GW of projects have requested to be connected to the Texas grid, marking a 170 percent increase since January requests. Approximately 73 percent of these projects are data centres, according to ERCOT. If all these data centres are built, it would equate to the average annual power consumption of almost 154 million homes. However, experts believe that it is unlikely for the massive project pipeline to be developed in its entirety, as there is simply not enough power to serve it.

Years of underinvestment in the U.S. grid, a lack of preparedness from utilities, and the rise in demand for data centres could lead to a power deficit if Texas, or another state, is hit by severe weather this winter. This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development. It also implies the need for stronger regulations to ensure that the electricity supply is sufficient and stable enough to meet demand before approving new projects.

[TITLE]Nigeria Bets Big on Renewables as Oil Troubles Deepen:
[TEXT]
For decades, Nigeria’s oil industry has faced a multitude of challenges. Despite having vast quantities of crude, the mismanagement of revenue, weak agreements with international oil companies, an underinvestment in infrastructure, and widespread oil theft have left many opposed to the ongoing production of crude. Now, Nigeria has high hopes for its renewable energy sector, as it looks to diversify its energy sources and boost energy security over the coming years.

Oil theft has long been a problem in Nigeria, affecting both the financial gain from oil projects and health and safety in the sector. A committee, established earlier this year, assessed some of the oil sector’s challenges in Nigeria, including oil theft, bunkering operations, illegal export networks, and alleged compromises within regulatory and security systems. The committee published a report on its findings, which suggested that the government could significantly mitigate the country’s oil losses.

Satellite and agency tracking revealed at least 589 oil leaks across Nigeria in 2024, most of which were due to theft and sabotage. The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative estimated that, over 12 years, Nigeria lost 619.7 million barrels of oil, with a total value of $46.2 billion. In addition, Nigeria lost approximately $1.84 billion worth of petroleum products from its refineries over nine years.

While the government seeks to make its oil industry safer and more efficient, and, importantly, more profitable, many Nigerians are calling for the government to abandon its oil ambitions in favour of clean energy sources. While the government continues to back fossil fuels, it also sees a future for Nigeria in green energy, having set a target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 during the COP26 climate summit.

Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP) led the way for the passing of the country’s Climate Change Act in 2021. The government then established the Energy Transition Office to oversee the implementation of the ETP, with a focus on six pillars – improved energy access, poverty reduction, modern energy access, job preservation, a sustainable transition, and legislation. The ETP aims to reduce emissions in several sectors, including power, transport, oil and gas, cooking, and industry. The ETP was revised and updated in 2024 to incorporate recent data and policy developments.

The government expects the ETP to support widespread job creation, with an estimated 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs by 2060. Nigeria views natural gas as a transition fuel and as key to its shift away from dirtier fossil fuels. However, to achieve its aims, the government will need to establish new green energy industries and attract investment for large-scale projects.

During the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum 2025, the government signed contracts with a value of $435 million to expand the country’s renewable energy capacity. The agreements are expected to support the creation of 1,500 direct jobs across the country. Several state governments made deals with local and international renewable energy companies to develop solar, hybrid, and recycling projects to support power generation. Vice President Kashim Shettima said that $23 billion in funding was required in the short term to provide reliable power to millions of Nigerians without access to power.

To attract higher levels of investment to the sector, the government has committed to incentivising local production, streamlining regulations, and encouraging public-private partnerships.

Nigeria has significantly expanded its solar power industry in recent years, aiming to benefit from its abundant sunlight. In October, Nigeria’s Energy Commission signed a strategic partnership with the Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi to develop a solar panel plant with up to 1 GW of production capacity. This followed a visit to the Longi headquarters earlier in the month during which Longi “expressed strong interest in investing in Nigeria and demonstrated readiness to advance concrete plans for the construction of the factory.”

This is the latest of several solar manufacturing sites announced by the government. In September, Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency (REA) partnered with the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria and the Dutch solar manufacturer Solarge BV to establish a special purpose vehicle for the construction and operation of a 1 GW solar panel manufacturing plant in Nigeria.

Meanwhile, in March, the REA signed a deal with Lagos-based renewables developer Oando Clean Energy to develop a 1.2 GW solar assembly plant. The government has also discussed the possibility of introducing a ban on solar panel imports to help encourage local production. Technology Minister Uche Nnaji stated, “We have lithium in abundance here in Nigeria, so Mr President is already taking action… We are adding value to our raw materials.”

As Nigeria’s oil industry continues to face a multitude of challenges, the government is starting to drive investment in the country’s renewable energy sector. In addition to the expansion of its renewable energy capacity, the government is also looking at how to add value to its raw materials and ramp up manufacturing activities to drive economic growth.

Exxon Mobil has a consensus rating of "Overweight" and a price target of $128.59 based on the ratings of 24 analysts. The price target implies nearly 10% potential upside from the current stock price.

The company on Oct. 31 announced its Q3 2025 earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $1.88, beating the consensus estimate of $1.82, while revenues of $85.29 billion came in below the consensus of $87.70 billion, as reported by Benzinga.

"We delivered the highest earnings per share we’ve had compared to other quarters in a similar oil-price environment. In Guyana, we broke records with quarterly production surpassing 700,000 barrels per day, and started up the Yellowtail development four months early and under budget. In the Permian, we also set another production record of nearly 1.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, while continuing to expand the use of proprietary technologies like our lightweight proppant that improves well recoveries by up to 20%," said CEO Darren Woods.

[TITLE]What’s Next for OPEC+ in the Glut Year?:
[TEXT]
OPEC+ is meeting this coming weekend to discuss the next steps in its production control plan. Early reports suggest the group will stick to a pause in the rollback of its cuts. Yet commentators say that this will not be enough—a glut is coming and OPEC+ will need something more than pausing cuts.

First, the numbers. OPEC and its partners from OPEC+ started cutting oil production in 2023 after prices fell from three-digit highs in 2022. At the peak of the cuts, the group was withholding over 5 million barrels daily in supply. In fact, it was withholding close to 6 million barrels daily: the initial OPEC+ cuts of 2 million barrels daily, the first round of voluntary cuts by eight members of the group, amounting to 1.65 million barrels daily, and the second round of voluntary cuts by the same eight members, at 2.2 million barrels daily.

Of these, the original cuts remain in place and will remain there until the end of next year. Of the two rounds of voluntary cuts, 2.2 million barrels daily have been unwound, as well as 411,000 barrels daily from the first round of those cuts. This leaves some 3.24 million barrels daily in withheld supply, per Reuters calculations. Apparently, the amount is not enough to calm markets in their anticipation of a glut.

Not that forecasters are helping. The perception of a glut is already so pervasive that there seems to be few who question it. Not only this, but the glut keeps getting revised higher and higher. Per the International Energy Agency’s latest, the supply overhang in crude oil could top the record-smashing 4 million barrels daily next year—even though the IEA has revised its demand estimates higher. Per JP Morgan, the glut will not only be severe, but it would linger, pressuring prices a lot lower than they already are.

[TITLE]America’s Fragile Grid Faces a Perfect Storm Ahead of Winter:
[TEXT]
The energy infrastructure in the United States has failed repeatedly in instances of severe weather, due to years of underinvestment and the failure of utilities to work together to strengthen larger networks. During winter storms and wildfires, a wide range of energy infrastructure has been known to fail due to the lack of preparedness by utilities and state governments. Going into the winter months, there are fears over more potential network failures across various parts of the U.S.

Texas, California, and several other states face annual power outages due to severe weather events, from winter storms to heatwaves. In February 2021, Storm Uri brought plunging temperatures to the state of Texas and left millions of people without electricity, heat, or running water, as much of the infrastructure froze. These outages turned off electricity in various parts of Texas, including parts of the natural gas network that are electrically operated, such as pumps and antifreeze injection systems. This led to the shutdown of several power plants.

During the storm, as demand increased for heating, Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 GW of rolling blackouts to prevent a total system collapse, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It was the “largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history,” with 4.5 million people losing power for several days, stated a FERC report.

The U.S. energy network is highly fragmented, with different state governments each managing parts of the grid, and a multitude of utilities responsible for different infrastructure. The fractured nature of the system makes it extremely hard to fix. For example, investment made in the transmission lines of one state may not be replicated by the neighbouring state, meaning that the network in part of a region may be more resilient than another.

In 2021, the Biden administration introduced the $2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at upgrading U.S. infrastructure. The plan earmarked $100 billion in financing to update and modernise the electric grid to make it more reliable and resilient. However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.

Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres. There has been a rapid rollout of data centres across the U.S. in recent years, as tech companies invest heavily in the infrastructure needed to power advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. This has driven up energy demand in several states, particularly in Texas. The concern now is that this will increase the risk of energy shortages, which could result in power cuts during freezing temperatures.

Requests for new data centres are on the rise in Texas, thanks to its growing renewable energy capacity and natural gas resources. In recent years, Houston has become known by many as the Silicon Valley of energy, for its strong reputation for energy production, growing cleantech sector, and welcoming business environment. This has helped attract significant investment to the state from tech companies looking to expand operations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in November that the 24/7 energy demand of data centres will make it increasingly difficult to maintain sufficient electricity supply during times of high demand, such as if the temperature drops to an extreme low.

During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW. While the state’s 92.6 GW electricity capacity would normally be enough to power this demand, the available power could decrease to roughly 69.7 GW during a severe weather event, meaning a deficit of over 15 GW.

In a recent analysis, NERC stated, “Strong load growth from new data centres and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” It went on to say that while Texas will experience elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the grid will remain stable during normal peak demand.

Over 120 GW of projects have requested to be connected to the Texas grid, marking a 170 percent increase since January requests. Approximately 73 percent of these projects are data centres, according to ERCOT. If all these data centres are built, it would equate to the average annual power consumption of almost 154 million homes. However, experts believe that it is unlikely for the massive project pipeline to be developed in its entirety, as there is simply not enough power to serve it.

Years of underinvestment in the U.S. grid, a lack of preparedness from utilities, and the rise in demand for data centres could lead to a power deficit if Texas, or another state, is hit by severe weather this winter. This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development. It also implies the need for stronger regulations to ensure that the electricity supply is sufficient and stable enough to meet demand before approving new projects.

[TITLE]Nigeria Bets Big on Renewables as Oil Troubles Deepen:
[TEXT]
For decades, Nigeria’s oil industry has faced a multitude of challenges. Despite having vast quantities of crude, the mismanagement of revenue, weak agreements with international oil companies, an underinvestment in infrastructure, and widespread oil theft have left many opposed to the ongoing production of crude. Now, Nigeria has high hopes for its renewable energy sector, as it looks to diversify its energy sources and boost energy security over the coming years.

Oil theft has long been a problem in Nigeria, affecting both the financial gain from oil projects and health and safety in the sector. A committee, established earlier this year, assessed some of the oil sector’s challenges in Nigeria, including oil theft, bunkering operations, illegal export networks, and alleged compromises within regulatory and security systems. The committee published a report on its findings, which suggested that the government could significantly mitigate the country’s oil losses.

Satellite and agency tracking revealed at least 589 oil leaks across Nigeria in 2024, most of which were due to theft and sabotage. The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative estimated that, over 12 years, Nigeria lost 619.7 million barrels of oil, with a total value of $46.2 billion. In addition, Nigeria lost approximately $1.84 billion worth of petroleum products from its refineries over nine years.

While the government seeks to make its oil industry safer and more efficient, and, importantly, more profitable, many Nigerians are calling for the government to abandon its oil ambitions in favour of clean energy sources. While the government continues to back fossil fuels, it also sees a future for Nigeria in green energy, having set a target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 during the COP26 climate summit.

Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP) led the way for the passing of the country’s Climate Change Act in 2021. The government then established the Energy Transition Office to oversee the implementation of the ETP, with a focus on six pillars – improved energy access, poverty reduction, modern energy access, job preservation, a sustainable transition, and legislation. The ETP aims to reduce emissions in several sectors, including power, transport, oil and gas, cooking, and industry. The ETP was revised and updated in 2024 to incorporate recent data and policy developments.

The government expects the ETP to support widespread job creation, with an estimated 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs by 2060. Nigeria views natural gas as a transition fuel and as key to its shift away from dirtier fossil fuels. However, to achieve its aims, the government will need to establish new green energy industries and attract investment for large-scale projects.

During the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum 2025, the government signed contracts with a value of $435 million to expand the country’s renewable energy capacity. The agreements are expected to support the creation of 1,500 direct jobs across the country. Several state governments made deals with local and international renewable energy companies to develop solar, hybrid, and recycling projects to support power generation. Vice President Kashim Shettima said that $23 billion in funding was required in the short term to provide reliable power to millions of Nigerians without access to power.

To attract higher levels of investment to the sector, the government has committed to incentivising local production, streamlining regulations, and encouraging public-private partnerships.

Nigeria has significantly expanded its solar power industry in recent years, aiming to benefit from its abundant sunlight. In October, Nigeria’s Energy Commission signed a strategic partnership with the Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi to develop a solar panel plant with up to 1 GW of production capacity. This followed a visit to the Longi headquarters earlier in the month during which Longi “expressed strong interest in investing in Nigeria and demonstrated readiness to advance concrete plans for the construction of the factory.”

This is the latest of several solar manufacturing sites announced by the government. In September, Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency (REA) partnered with the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria and the Dutch solar manufacturer Solarge BV to establish a special purpose vehicle for the construction and operation of a 1 GW solar panel manufacturing plant in Nigeria.

Meanwhile, in March, the REA signed a deal with Lagos-based renewables developer Oando Clean Energy to develop a 1.2 GW solar assembly plant. The government has also discussed the possibility of introducing a ban on solar panel imports to help encourage local production. Technology Minister Uche Nnaji stated, “We have lithium in abundance here in Nigeria, so Mr President is already taking action… We are adding value to our raw materials.”

As Nigeria’s oil industry continues to face a multitude of challenges, the government is starting to drive investment in the country’s renewable energy sector. In addition to the expansion of its renewable energy capacity, the government is also looking at how to add value to its raw materials and ramp up manufacturing activities to drive economic growth.

[TITLE]Challenges and Prospects in the Global Power Rental Market, 2025-2030: Data Centers and Grid Instability Drive Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Power Rental Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Power Rental Market, valued at USD 22.83 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.39% to reach USD 37.02 Billion by 2030. Growth is primarily driven by rapid industrialization, ongoing global infrastructure development, rising energy demand across multiple sectors, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that necessitate emergency power.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing need for continuous and reliable power supply is a crucial driver of the global power rental market, as industries rely on uninterrupted energy to maintain productivity and prevent financial losses. Data centers, for example, require consistent power beyond what traditional grids can reliably provide. The International Energy Agency's March 2024 Electricity 2024 report indicates that global electricity consumption from data centers is expected to more than double, rising from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh by 2026.

Simultaneously, grid instability caused by aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and integration challenges with renewable energy sources drives demand for temporary power solutions. According to NERC's June 2024 State of Reliability report, wind resources experienced forced outage rates of 18.9% in 2023, up from 18.1% in 2022, contributing to grid unreliability. Strong industry performance reflects this demand: Aggreko reported annual sales of USD 2.85 billion for the year ending December 28, 2024, a 14% increase over 2023, as noted by International Rental News in April 2025.

Key Market Challenges

A major challenge to the global power rental market lies in the substantial capital expenditure required to procure, maintain, and upgrade fleets of power generation and distribution assets. These investments significantly strain profitability and can restrict the competitive capabilities of smaller firms. The high capital intensity creates barriers to entry and inherently favors large, established players with stronger financial capacity.

According to the European Rental Association, equipment investment across the European rental market was expected to remain flat in 2023 following a 4.2% increase in 2022, illustrating the constraining financial environment. These conditions limit innovation and expansion opportunities, ultimately slowing broader market growth.

Key Market Trends

Growing Adoption of Hybrid and Renewable Energy Solutions is a pivotal trend shaping the global power rental market. Companies increasingly deploy hybrid systems that combine conventional generators with battery storage or solar power, driven by stricter environmental regulations and rising corporate sustainability goals.

Aggreko invested over USD 140 million across 2023 and 2024 to expand its Greener Upgrades fleet, including battery systems designed to reduce emissions and optimize fuel consumption. This shift is reinforced by declining renewable energy costs; according to IRENA's 2025 Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2024 report, total installed costs for most renewable power technologies fell by more than 10% from 2023 to 2024.

[TITLE]Demulsifier Industry Worth Over $3 Billion by 2030: Pronounced Shift Towards Bio-Based and Sustainable Demulsifier Solutions:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Demulsifier Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Demulsifier Market, valued at USD 2.49 Billion in 2024, is projected to experience a CAGR of 3.52% to reach USD 3.06 Billion by 2030. The market's expansion is fundamentally driven by increasing global crude oil production to fulfill energy demands, coupled with the imperative for efficient water removal to prevent equipment corrosion and reduce transportation costs. The growing adoption of enhanced oil recovery techniques further amplifies the need for these specialized chemicals.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing global crude oil production and ongoing exploration activities represent a primary driver for the demulsifier market. As upstream operations intensify to meet the escalating worldwide energy demand, the volume of crude oil extracted, often in the form of water-in-oil emulsions, also rises significantly.

Demulsifiers are essential in separating water from crude oil, a critical step to prevent pipeline corrosion, reduce transportation costs, and meet crude oil quality specifications for refining. Without efficient demulsification, the presence of water can lead to severe operational inefficiencies and damage to infrastructure throughout the value chain.

Key Market Challenges

Stringent environmental regulations governing the toxicity and biodegradability of demulsifier formulations represent a significant impediment to the growth of the Global Demulsifier Market. These regulations mandate extensive research and development to create compliant products, directly increasing operational costs for manufacturers. Such requirements necessitate investment in new formulations and testing protocols, driving up the cost of bringing new demulsifier technologies to market.

The escalating regulatory burden directly hampers market expansion by elevating expenditures for both producers and end-users. According to the American Chemistry Council, in the fourth quarter of 2023, 43% of chemical manufacturers indicated their regulatory burden had increased. This trend continued, with 38% of manufacturers reporting an increased regulatory burden in the second quarter of 2024, and over half expecting a further rise in the subsequent six months. This consistent upward pressure on compliance costs can constrain profitability, slow down the adoption of new demulsifier solutions, and limit overall investment within the demulsifier segment.

Key Market Trends

The global demulsifier market is significantly influenced by a pronounced shift towards bio-based and sustainable demulsifier solutions. This trend is driven by increasing environmental regulations and a broader industry commitment to reducing the ecological footprint of chemical processes. Manufacturers are investing in research and development to create products derived from renewable resources that offer improved biodegradability profiles.

For example, research published in April 2025 highlighted that natural demulsifiers, sourced from plant extracts, waste oils, and biopolymers, are emerging as sustainable alternatives for crude oil demulsification, with studies in 2023 specifically evaluating the effectiveness of green demulsifiers on Nigerian crude oils. This indicates a move away from conventional petroleum-derived chemicals to more environmentally benign options.

[TITLE]America’s Fragile Grid Faces a Perfect Storm Ahead of Winter:
[TEXT]
The energy infrastructure in the United States has failed repeatedly in instances of severe weather, due to years of underinvestment and the failure of utilities to work together to strengthen larger networks. During winter storms and wildfires, a wide range of energy infrastructure has been known to fail due to the lack of preparedness by utilities and state governments. Going into the winter months, there are fears over more potential network failures across various parts of the U.S.

Texas, California, and several other states face annual power outages due to severe weather events, from winter storms to heatwaves. In February 2021, Storm Uri brought plunging temperatures to the state of Texas and left millions of people without electricity, heat, or running water, as much of the infrastructure froze. These outages turned off electricity in various parts of Texas, including parts of the natural gas network that are electrically operated, such as pumps and antifreeze injection systems. This led to the shutdown of several power plants.

During the storm, as demand increased for heating, Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 GW of rolling blackouts to prevent a total system collapse, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It was the “largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history,” with 4.5 million people losing power for several days, stated a FERC report.

The U.S. energy network is highly fragmented, with different state governments each managing parts of the grid, and a multitude of utilities responsible for different infrastructure. The fractured nature of the system makes it extremely hard to fix. For example, investment made in the transmission lines of one state may not be replicated by the neighbouring state, meaning that the network in part of a region may be more resilient than another.

In 2021, the Biden administration introduced the $2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at upgrading U.S. infrastructure. The plan earmarked $100 billion in financing to update and modernise the electric grid to make it more reliable and resilient. However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.

Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres. There has been a rapid rollout of data centres across the U.S. in recent years, as tech companies invest heavily in the infrastructure needed to power advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. This has driven up energy demand in several states, particularly in Texas. The concern now is that this will increase the risk of energy shortages, which could result in power cuts during freezing temperatures.

Requests for new data centres are on the rise in Texas, thanks to its growing renewable energy capacity and natural gas resources. In recent years, Houston has become known by many as the Silicon Valley of energy, for its strong reputation for energy production, growing cleantech sector, and welcoming business environment. This has helped attract significant investment to the state from tech companies looking to expand operations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in November that the 24/7 energy demand of data centres will make it increasingly difficult to maintain sufficient electricity supply during times of high demand, such as if the temperature drops to an extreme low.

During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW. While the state’s 92.6 GW electricity capacity would normally be enough to power this demand, the available power could decrease to roughly 69.7 GW during a severe weather event, meaning a deficit of over 15 GW.

In a recent analysis, NERC stated, “Strong load growth from new data centres and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” It went on to say that while Texas will experience elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the grid will remain stable during normal peak demand.

Over 120 GW of projects have requested to be connected to the Texas grid, marking a 170 percent increase since January requests. Approximately 73 percent of these projects are data centres, according to ERCOT. If all these data centres are built, it would equate to the average annual power consumption of almost 154 million homes. However, experts believe that it is unlikely for the massive project pipeline to be developed in its entirety, as there is simply not enough power to serve it.

Years of underinvestment in the U.S. grid, a lack of preparedness from utilities, and the rise in demand for data centres could lead to a power deficit if Texas, or another state, is hit by severe weather this winter. This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development. It also implies the need for stronger regulations to ensure that the electricity supply is sufficient and stable enough to meet demand before approving new projects.

Dublin, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Power Rental Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Power Rental Market, valued at USD 22.83 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.39% to reach USD 37.02 Billion by 2030. Growth is primarily driven by rapid industrialization, ongoing global infrastructure development, rising energy demand across multiple sectors, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that necessitate emergency power.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing need for continuous and reliable power supply is a crucial driver of the global power rental market, as industries rely on uninterrupted energy to maintain productivity and prevent financial losses. Data centers, for example, require consistent power beyond what traditional grids can reliably provide. The International Energy Agency's March 2024 Electricity 2024 report indicates that global electricity consumption from data centers is expected to more than double, rising from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh by 2026.

Simultaneously, grid instability caused by aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and integration challenges with renewable energy sources drives demand for temporary power solutions. According to NERC's June 2024 State of Reliability report, wind resources experienced forced outage rates of 18.9% in 2023, up from 18.1% in 2022, contributing to grid unreliability. Strong industry performance reflects this demand: Aggreko reported annual sales of USD 2.85 billion for the year ending December 28, 2024, a 14% increase over 2023, as noted by International Rental News in April 2025.
