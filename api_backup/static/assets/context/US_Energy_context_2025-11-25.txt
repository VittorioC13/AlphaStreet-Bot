[TITLE]Oil Slides on Peace Deal Pressure:

[TITLE]Oil Prices Sink 2.6% After Zelenskyy Agrees to Work on Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices dropped again on Friday morning, bogged down by fresh news that Ukraine's Zelenskyy agreed to work with Washington on a peace plan, a development that could ultimately add fresh barrels into an already fragile market.

At the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate for December delivery had slipped by 2.51% to $57.52 per barrel...

Brent crude, for its part, had fallen 2.19% to $61.99...

A continued pullback would mark the third consecutive daily decline for WTI, putting the U.S. benchmark on track for a weekly loss of over 4%, a reflection of broader concerns over global supply growth and a weakening demand outlook

News of Zelenskyy considering the peace proposal comes on the same day that new U.S. sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil officially take effect, targeting key subsidiaries in an effort to restrict Kremlin revenue from fossil-fuel sales. While those sanctions should tighten supply, that has largely been baked into markets at this point.

Russian Urals crude, already discounted due to sanctions, has been trading as much as $23 per barrel below other global grades, evidence that sanctions are having an effect.

In the U.S., crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell by 3.4 million barrels last week on the back of strong refinery activity. But the bullish inventory surprise failed to lift prices as traders remained focused on the geopolitical picture.

Energy markets also faced macro-driven pressure, with Asian stocks declining sharply after Thursday’s U.S. employment data clouded expectations for imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts, boosting the dollar and intensifying risk-off sentiment.

A stronger greenback, the currency hit a broad rally against major and commodity-linked currencies, further weighed on dollar-priced crude.

OPEC+ remains a fundamental force in the overall bearishness of oil markets, with the group committed to boosting production in December before halting output increases in early 2026. If oil prices continue to tumble, then markets will look to the group to rein in its output.

In the short term, markets will remain fixated on Kyiv and Washington for the next major signal, one that could determine the trajectory of crude heading into December.

[TITLE]Norwegian billionaire left to rue Mainstream Renewable deal as losses hit €1.2bn:
[TEXT]
Mainstream has racked up huge losses amid turbulence in its main market Chile and challenges in the green energy development sector

For Aker ASA, the Norwegian industrial powerhouse that began life as a boat builder, a deal to buy Eddie O’Connor’s Mainstream Renewable Power in January 2021 was a springboard to float one of its portfolio companies weeks later.

“Combining Mainstream’s global organisation and renewable assets with Aker’s 180-year track record of building and developing industrial companies is another step in line with our long-term strategy for value creation,” said Øyvind Eriksen, chief executive of Aker ASA.

Aker Horizons, the unit going through the initial public offering (IPO), was handed Mainstream, after the group agreed to buy a 75 per cent stake, in a deal that valued the Irish business at €900 million.

A 20 per cent spike in Aker ASA’s own shares within days of the Mainstream deal suggested investors in Oslo thought it had snapped up a bargain in the wind and solar energy developer, with projects spanning Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific.

But it was a moment many of the 600 wealthy Irish individuals who backed O’Connor when he set up the company in 2008 – with hopes he could replicate the stunning €1.8 billion achieved for Airtricity, his previous venture – had long doubted would ever arrive.

Theirs had been a hair-raising ride. The financial crisis battered initial plans, and for a decade the company survived by selling developments early – and on the cheap – to keep the lights on. Things finally turned with the transformational sale of a large wind farm project off the coast of Scotland for more than €600 million in 2018.

For O’Connor, who died early last year, the 2021 deal delivered a fifteenfold gain on the €30 million he had put into Mainstream. He and a handful of others rolled over a 25 per cent stake.

However, 60 cent of the small Irish investors opted to sell out entirely in 2021, rather than reinvest some money in the Aker Horizons deal – walking away with

[TITLE]Permian Gas Wave Sparks Biggest Pipeline Buildout Since the Shale Boom:
[TEXT]
Growing domestic and export demand for Permian’s natural gas is pushing pipeline developers to invest in new pipeline capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Chemical and manufacturing industries and data centers looking for reliable energy supply drive increased domestic consumption, while the booming LNG exports from the Texas and Louisiana coasts, and at least half a dozen new export plants expected to start up by the end of the decade, are prompting new-built or expanded links to feed gas to the LNG facilities.

With a favorable in-state regulatory landscape in both Texas and Louisiana, and with the Trump Administration supporting the U.S. energy dominance, it’s no surprise that many projects for new or expanded pipelines are on track to enter into service in the coming months.

Next year, a total of 12 projects for new or expanded gas pipelines are set to be completed in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. These projects are set to boost the U.S. Gulf Coast region’s capacity to transport natural gas by 13%, per data compiled by Bloomberg on the basis of EIA estimates.

Related: Equinor Secures Major 10-Year Gas Deal With Czech Republic

That would be the biggest expansion of pipeline capacity in one year since the dawn of the shale gas boom in 2008.

There has never been a better time to be in the business of building natural gas pipelines in the United States, executives at pipeline giants say.

U.S. natural gas supply is rising, domestic and export demand is soaring, and the U.S. federal regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically in favor of new oil and gas infrastructure projects.

Companies have committed $50 billion worth of investments in new gas pipelines that would add 8,800 miles of new pipeline in the United States, energy consultants Wood Mackenzie say.

Unlike in previous cycles of massive gas pipeline expansions, when producers led pipeline investment to reach demand markets, this time the buildout is being led by LNG exporters, utilities, and data centers, WoodMac noted.

In the past, “Pipeline development was the unsung hero connecting low-cost resources to markets,” the energy consulting firm says.

“Now we're seeing a fundamental shift: demand pull from LNG exporters and power companies is driving new pipeline investment, moving away from the traditional producer-led model.”

U.S. LNG exports are surging to record highs, with more export projects expected to start up by the end of the decade.

America’s electricity demand is also soaring, thanks to the onshoring of manufacturing and the sky-high energy consumption of data centers.

U.S. LNG exports are surging to record highs, with more export projects expected to start up by the end of the decade.

America’s electricity demand is also soaring, thanks to the onshoring of manufacturing and the sky-high energy consumption of data centers.

At the same time, the booming oil production in the Permian is boosting the supply of natural gas as a by-product, too. And producers struggle to make use of the gas with limited available spare pipeline capacity.

In recent months, prices at the Waha gas hub in West Texas have crashed into negative territory multiple times, and flaring has soared as producers have been forced to pay offtakers to get rid of the natural gas. All because operational pipelines are not enough to ship the gas to places where it’s needed—power plants and LNG export facilities.

New pipelines are set to address part of the bottleneck problem and send the gas to demand centers—be it data centers, manufacturing, chemicals production, or LNG exports.

Earlier this week, ExxonMobil agreed to buy 40% in the new Bahia natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline from Enterprise Products Partners as producers and pipeline operators expand gas takeaway capacity in the Permian basin.

The expanded pipeline, Cowboy Connector Pipeline, will connect Exxon’s growing production in the Permian to U.S. Gulf Coast refining and chemical facilities and enable access to export logistics to serve markets around the world, the supermajor said.

Canada-based pipeline giant TC Energy early this month said it expects North American natural gas demand to surge in the medium to long term, thanks to soaring U.S. LNG exports and “unprecedented power demand” from data centers and coal-to-gas conversions.

TC Energy has 58,100 miles of network of natural gas pipelines, which supplies more than 30% of the natural gas consumed daily across North America’s markets.

“Our latest forecast expects North American natural gas demand to increase by 45 Bcf/d by 2035, primarily driven by a tripling of LNG exports and unprecedented power demand from data centres and coal-to-gas conversions,” TC Energy’s president and CEO, François Poirier, said in a statement accompanying the third-quarter results.

[TITLE]Trump Pushes to Reopen California Coast to Offshore Drilling:
[TEXT]
New oil and gas drilling could commence in California if President Donald Trump gets his way, as the U.S. federal government continues to support a “Drill, baby, drill” approach to fossil fuel production.

In November, the Trump administration plans to allow new oil and gas drilling off the California coast, according to a draft plan shared with the Washington Post. This would be the first time in several decades that new exploration operations were permitted. The document outlines a plan for six offshore lease sales along the California coastline, as well as the expansion of drilling into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, between 2027 and 2030.

It is thought that the Interior Department could announce a formal proposal as early as this week. Any new drilling is expected to be centred around the Santa Barbara County region, where limited drilling is already taking place.

A major oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969 prompted the government to bring an end to new leasing off the Pacific Coast, as well as limit existing drilling operations. Previous governments have continued to restrict drilling in the Californian waters, which extend three miles from the shoreline, due to concerns over beach pollution and the potential negative impact on tourism.

Pete Stauffer, the ocean protection manager of the Surfrider Foundation, stated, “Offshore drilling is highly unpopular across the country and will increase the likelihood of yet another destructive oil spill off our coasts. Surfrider Foundation’s chapter network will fight this proposal vigorously to protect all US coastlines from the unnecessary risks involved with new offshore drilling.”

The plan would also require Trump to approve new oil and gas leasing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a body of water that the President renamed the Gulf of America in January. This would likely lead to pushback from Republicans in Florida who have been opposed to new drilling since the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster of 2010.

Meanwhile, in June, South Carolina governor Henry McMaster wrote a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in which he stated that South Carolina’s coastline was “one of the most pristine in the country, and offshore drilling is simply not in its best interest.”

Despite efforts by the Trump administration to open nearly all U.S. coastal waters to drilling earlier this year, the Interior Department ultimately decided to introduce a moratorium on drilling off Florida, Georgia and South Carolina through 2032 following pressure from Republicans in the southeast of the country.

The position of oil and gas companies on conducting drilling in California waters is not yet clear, although developing new projects in the state would require a significant investment in supporting infrastructure, compared to other already developed regions of the United States. Analysts do not expect oil and gas companies to have much interest in the area due to the lack of infrastructure, as well as the widespread regional opposition to new drilling.

During this month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil, California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, told reporters that any plan to carry out new drilling in the region would be “dead on arrival” in California. Newsom also said that the state would “absolutely” challenge the plan in court once it was finalised. This reflects his historic stance on new drilling. In June, Newsom addressed the Interior Department in a letter stressing California’s “continued opposition” to additional fossil fuel development.

Newsom, a long-time supporter of the U.S. green transition, attended the climate summit in Trump’s absence, after the Trump administration said that no high-level U.S. representatives would go to UN climate talks. During a ministerial meeting, Newsom said, I’m very mindful that the Trump administration has abandoned any sense of duty, responsibility, or leadership as it relates to the issues that bring us all here together… It’s an abomination. It’s a disgrace."

In response to news of the anticipated drilling proposal, Newsom said that it was “remarkable” that Trump did not call for drilling near his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. “He didn’t promote it off the coast of Florida,” stated Newsom. “That says everything

[TITLE]Trump’s Vendetta Against Wind Is Gutting Jobs and Raising Prices:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump’s bizarre war on offshore wind is getting worse — and it’s screwing workers and anyone who uses electricity. In the past year, Trump’s policies have resulted in the loss of more than half of the planned power set to come from offshore wind, according to a new report by the Energy Industries Council released last week. People all across the country are facing relentlessly skyrocketing energy prices, with average electricity bills in July up 9.5 percent from just one year ago. Rising energy costs were a key issue influencing voters in elections this month and are expected to again play an outsized role in the crucial 2026 midterms.
