RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURES TRADING

Futures transactions involve high risk. The amount of the initial margin is low compared to the value of the futures contract, so that transactions are "leveraged" or "geared". A relatively small market movement has a proportionately larger impact on the funds that you have deposited or have to pay: this can work both for you and against you. You may experience the total loss of the initial margin funds as well as any additional funds deposited in the system. If the market develops in a way that is contrary to your position or if margins are increased, you may be asked to pay significant additional funds at short notice to maintain your position. In this case it may also happen that your broker account is in the red and you thus have to make payments beyond the initial investment.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRONIC TRADING

Before you begin carrying out transactions with an electronic system, you should carefully review the rules and provisions of the stock exchange offering the system, or of the financial instruments listed that you intend to trade, as well as your broker's conditions. Online trading has inherent risks due to system responses/reaction times and access times that may vary due to market conditions, system performance and other factors, and on which you have no influence. You should be aware of these additional risks in electronic trading before you carry out investment transactions.

[TITLE]The Destruction in Gaza Is What the Future of AI Warfare Looks Like:
[TEXT]
In 2021, Israel used “the Gospel” for the first time. That was the codename for an AI tool deployed in the 11-day war against Gaza that the IDF has since deemed the first artificial intelligence war. The conclusion of that war didn’t end the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but it was a sign of things to come.

The Gospel rapidly spews out a mounting list of potential buildings to target in military strikes by reviewing data from surveillance, satellite imagery, and social networks. That was four years ago, and the field of artificial intelligence has since experienced one of the most rapid periods of advancement in the history of technology.

Marking two years on Tuesday, Israel’s latest offensive on Gaza has been called an “AI Human Laboratory” where the weapons of the future are tested on live subjects.

Over the last two years, the conflict has claimed the lives of more than 67,000 Palestinians, upwards of 20,000 of whom were children. As of March 2025, more than 1,200 families were completely wiped out, according to a Reuters examination. Since October 2024, the number of casualties provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health has only included identified bodies, so the real death toll is likely even higher.

Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to a genocide, a UN Commission concluded last month.

Hamas and Israel agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal that was announced on Wednesday, but Israeli strikes on Gaza were still continuing as of Thursday morning, according to Reuters. The agreed-upon plan involves the release of Israeli hostages by Hamas in exchange for 1,950 Palestinians taken by Israel and the long-awaited aid convoys. But it does not involve the creation of a Palestinian state, which Israel strictly opposes. On Friday afternoon, Israel said that the ceasefire agreement is now in effect, and President Trump has said there will be a hostage release next week. There have been at least three ceasefire agreements since October 7, 2023.

Aiding Israel’s destruction in Gaza is an unprecedented reliance on artificial intelligence that is, at least partially, supplied by American tech giants. Israel’s use of AI in surveillance and wartime decisions has been documented and criticized time and again by various media and advocacy organizations over the years.

“AI systems, and generative AI models in particular, are notoriously flawed with high error rates for any application that requires precision, accuracy, and safety-criticality,” Dr. Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute, told Gizmodo. “AI outputs are not facts; they’re predictions. The stakes are higher in the case of military activity, as you’re now dealing with lethal targeting that impacts the life and death of individuals.”

AI that generates kill lists

Although Israel has not disclosed its intelligence software fully and denied some of the AI usage claims, numerous media and non-profit investigations paint a different picture.

Also used in Israel’s 2021 campaign were two other programs called “Alchemist,” which sends real-time alerts for “suspicious movement,” and “Depth of Wisdom” to map out Gaza’s tunnel network. Both are reportedly in use this time around, as well.

On top of the three programs Israel has previously openly owned up to using, the IDF also utilizes Lavender, an AI system that essentially generates a kill list of Palestinians. The AI calculates a percentage score for how likely a Palestinian is to be a member of a militant group. If the score is high, the person becomes the target of missile attacks.

According to a report from Israeli magazine +972, the army “almost completely relied” on the system at least in the early weeks of the war, with full knowledge of the fact that it misidentified civilians as terrorists.

The IDF required officers to approve any of the recommendations made by the AI systems, but according to +972, that approval process just checked whether or not the target was male.

Many other AI systems that are in use by the IDF are still in the shadows. One of the few programs also unveiled is “Where’s Daddy?” which was built to strike targets inside their family homes, according to +972.

“The IDF bombed [Hamas operatives] in homes without hesitation, as a first option. It’s much easier to bomb a family’s home. The system is built to look for them in these situations,” an anonymous Israeli intelligence officer told +972.

AI in surveillance

The Israeli army also uses AI in its mass surveillance efforts. Yossi Sariel, who led the IDF’s surveillance unit until late last year when he resigned, citing failure to prevent the Oct 7. Hamas attack, spent a sabbatical year training at a Pentagon-funded defense institution in Washington, D.C., where he shared radical visions of AI on the battlefield, according to a professor at the institute who spoke to the Washington Post last year.

A Guardian report from August found that Israel was storing and processing mobile phone calls made by Palestinians via Microsoft’s Azure Cloud Platform. After months of protests, Microsoft announced last month that it is cutting off access to some of its services provided to an IDF unit after an internal review found evidence that supported some of the claims in the Guardian article.

Microsoft denies prior knowledge, but the Guardian report paints a different picture. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella met with IDF’s spying operations head Sariel in late 2021 to discuss hosting intelligence material on the Microsoft cloud, the Guardian reported.

“The vast majority of Microsoft’s contract with the Israeli military remains intact,” Hossam Nasr, an organizer with No Azure for Apartheid and a former Microsoft worker, told Gizmodo last month.

When asked for comment, Microsoft directed Gizmodo to a previous statement the tech giant made on the ongoing internal investigation into how its products are used by Israel’s Ministry of Defense.

On top of storing and combing through data, AI was used in translating and transcribing the gathered surveillance. But an internal Israeli audit, according to the Washington Post, found that some of the AI models that the IDF used to translate communications from Arabic had inaccuracies.

An Associated Press investigation from earlier this year found that advanced AI models by OpenAI, purchased via Microsoft’s Azure, were used to transcribe and translate the intercepted communications. The investigation also found that the Israeli military’s use of OpenAI and Microsoft technology skyrocketed after Oct 7, 2023.

AI-driven surveillance efforts don’t just target residents of Gaza and the West Bank, but they have also been used against pro-Palestinian protestors in the United States. An Amnesty International report from August found that AI products by American companies like Palantir were used by the Department of Homeland Security to target non-citizens who speak out for Palestinian rights.

“Palantir has had federal contracts with DHS for fourteen years. DHS’s current engagement with Palantir is through Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where the company provides solutions for investigative case management and enforcement operations,” a DHS spokesperson told Gizmodo. “At the Department level, DHS looks holistically at technology and data solutions that can meet operational and mission demands.”

Palantir has not yet responded to a request for comment.

AI-driven accusations

The proliferation of AI-generated video and images has done more than just flood the internet with slop. It has also caused widespread confusion for social media users over just what’s real and what’s fake. The confusion is understandable, but it has been co-opted to discredit the voices of the oppressed. In this case, too, Gazans have been at the receiving end of the attacks.

The videos and photos coming out of Gaza are referred to in Israel as “Gazawood”, with many claiming that the images are staged or completely AI-generated. Since Israel has not allowed foreign journalists into Gaza and not only discredits but also disproportionately targets the enclave’s journalists in air strikes, the truth becomes harder to validate.

[TITLE]The Destruction in Gaza Is What the Future of AI Warfare Looks Like:
[TEXT]
In 2021, Israel used “the Gospel” for the first time. That was the codename for an AI tool deployed in the 11-day war against Gaza that the IDF has since deemed the first artificial intelligence war. The conclusion of that war didn’t end the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but it was a sign of things to come.

The Gospel rapidly spews out a mounting list of potential buildings to target in military strikes by reviewing data from surveillance, satellite imagery, and social networks. That was four years ago, and the field of artificial intelligence has since experienced one of the most rapid periods of advancement in the history of technology.

Marking two years on Tuesday, Israel’s latest offensive on Gaza has been called an “AI Human Laboratory” where the weapons of the future are tested on live subjects.

Over the last two years, the conflict has claimed the lives of more than 67,000 Palestinians, upwards of 20,000 of whom were children. As of March 2025, more than 1,200 families were completely wiped out, according to a Reuters examination. Since October 2024, the number of casualties provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health has only included identified bodies, so the real death toll is likely even higher.

Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to a genocide, a UN Commission concluded last month.

Hamas and Israel agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal that was announced on Wednesday, but Israeli strikes on Gaza were still continuing as of Thursday morning, according to Reuters. The agreed-upon plan involves the release of Israeli hostages by Hamas in exchange for 1,950 Palestinians taken by Israel and the long-awaited aid convoys. But it does not involve the creation of a Palestinian state, which Israel strictly opposes. On Friday afternoon, Israel said that the ceasefire agreement is now in effect, and President Trump has said there will be a hostage release next week. There have been at least three ceasefire agreements since October 7, 2023.

Aiding Israel’s destruction in Gaza is an unprecedented reliance on artificial intelligence that is, at least partially, supplied by American tech giants. Israel’s use of AI in surveillance and wartime decisions has been documented and criticized time and again by various media and advocacy organizations over the years.

“AI systems, and generative AI models in particular, are notoriously flawed with high error rates for any application that requires precision, accuracy, and safety-criticality,” Dr. Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute, told Gizmodo. “AI outputs are not facts; they’re predictions. The stakes are higher in the case of military activity, as you’re now dealing with lethal targeting that impacts the life and death of individuals.”

AI that generates kill lists

Although Israel has not disclosed its intelligence software fully and denied some of the AI usage claims, numerous media and non-profit investigations paint a different picture.

Also used in Israel’s 2021 campaign were two other programs called “Alchemist,” which sends real-time alerts for “suspicious movement,” and “Depth of Wisdom” to map out Gaza’s tunnel network. Both are reportedly in use this time around, as well.

On top of the three programs Israel has previously openly owned up to using, the IDF also utilizes Lavender, an AI system that essentially generates a kill list of Palestinians. The AI calculates a percentage score for how likely a Palestinian is to be a member of a militant group. If the score is high, the person becomes the target of missile attacks.

According to a report from Israeli magazine +972, the army “almost completely relied” on the system at least in the early weeks of the war, with full knowledge of the fact that it misidentified civilians as terrorists.

The IDF required officers to approve any of the recommendations made by the AI systems, but according to +972, that approval process just checked whether or not the target was male.

Many other AI systems that are in use by the IDF are still in the shadows. One of the few programs also unveiled is “Where’s Daddy?” which was built to strike targets inside their family homes, according to +972.

“The IDF bombed [Hamas operatives] in homes without hesitation, as a first option. It’s much easier to bomb a family’s home. The system is built to look for them in these situations,” an anonymous Israeli intelligence officer told +972.

AI in surveillance

The Israeli army also uses AI in its mass surveillance efforts. Yossi Sariel, who led the IDF’s surveillance unit until late last year when he resigned, citing failure to prevent the Oct 7. Hamas attack, spent a sabbatical year training at a Pentagon-funded defense institution in Washington, D.C., where he shared radical visions of AI on the battlefield, according to a professor at the institute who spoke to the Washington Post last year.

A Guardian report from August found that Israel was storing and processing mobile phone calls made by Palestinians via Microsoft’s Azure Cloud Platform. After months of protests, Microsoft announced last month that it is cutting off access to some of its services provided to an IDF unit after an internal review found evidence that supported some of the claims in the Guardian article.

Microsoft denies prior knowledge, but the Guardian report paints a different picture. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella met with IDF’s spying operations head Sariel in late 2021 to discuss hosting intelligence material on the Microsoft cloud, the Guardian reported.

“The vast majority of Microsoft’s contract with the Israeli military remains intact,” Hossam Nasr, an organizer with No Azure for Apartheid and a former Microsoft worker, told Gizmodo last month.

When asked for comment, Microsoft directed Gizmodo to a previous statement the tech giant made on the ongoing internal investigation into how its products are used by Israel’s Ministry of Defense.

On top of storing and combing through data, AI was used in translating and transcribing the gathered surveillance. But an internal Israeli audit, according to the Washington Post, found that some of the AI models that the IDF used to translate communications from Arabic had inaccuracies.

An Associated Press investigation from earlier this year found that advanced AI models by OpenAI, purchased via Microsoft’s Azure, were used to transcribe and translate the intercepted communications. The investigation also found that the Israeli military’s use of OpenAI and Microsoft technology skyrocketed after Oct 7, 2023.

AI-driven surveillance efforts don’t just target residents of Gaza and the West Bank, but they have also been used against pro-Palestinian protestors in the United States. An Amnesty International report from August found that AI products by American companies like Palantir were used by the Department of Homeland Security to target non-citizens who speak out for Palestinian rights.

“Palantir has had federal contracts with DHS for fourteen years. DHS’s current engagement with Palantir is through Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where the company provides solutions for investigative case management and enforcement operations,” a DHS spokesperson told Gizmodo. “At the Department level, DHS looks holistically at technology and data solutions that can meet operational and mission demands.”

Palantir has not yet responded to a request for comment.

AI-driven accusations

The proliferation of AI-generated video and images has done more than just flood the internet with slop. It has also caused widespread confusion for social media users over just what’s real and what’s fake. The confusion is understandable, but it has been co-opted to discredit the voices of the oppressed. In this case, too, Gazans have been at the receiving end of the attacks.

The videos and photos coming out of Gaza are referred to in Israel as “Gazawood”, with many claiming that the images are staged or completely AI-generated. Since Israel has not allowed foreign journalists into Gaza and not only discredits but also disproportionately targets the enclave’s journalists in air strikes, the truth becomes harder to validate.

In one instance, Saeed Ismail, a real 22-year-old Gazan who had been raising money online to feed his family, was accused of being AI-generated due to misspelled words on his blanket featured in one video. Gizmodo verified his existence in July.

[TITLE]The world’s chip supply chain is bracing for fallout from China’s rare-earth curbs:
[TEXT]
Businesses across the global semiconductor supply chain are bracing themselves for disruptions from China’s most targeted move yet to limit their supplies of rare-earth materials as part of an escalating trade war between the Asian nation and the U.S.

The restrictions may lead to weekslong delays in shipments for ASML Holding NV, the only manufacturer in the world of machines that make the most advanced semiconductors, a person familiar with the company said. The company is preparing for disruptions, particularly due to a clause that requires foreign firms to seek China’s approval for re-exports of products containing its rare earths, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters and noted that ASML is lobbying Dutch and U.S. allies for alternatives. The company declined to comment.

A senior manager at a major U.S. chip company said the firm is still assessing potential impacts. But the clearest risk the company is facing now is an increase in the prices of rare earths-dependent magnets that are critical to the chip supply chain, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing operations. An official at another U.S. chip company said the business is rushing to identify which of its products contain rare earths from China and is worried that the country’s requirement for licenses will grind its supply chain to a halt.

The restrictions represent the first major attempt by Beijing to exercise long-arm jurisdiction over foreign companies to target the semiconductor industry, threatening to stall the chips powering the AI boom. They prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to announce on Friday that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China and export controls on "any and all critical software.”

China’s new rules require overseas firms to seek approval for shipping any material containing even trace amounts of Chinese rare earths — and explicitly call out parts used to make certain computer chips and advance AI research with military applications.

"These are the strictest export controls that China has utilized,” said Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals-focused director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It’s quite clear that they have the sticks and the leverage to make, not just U.S. firms, but firms worldwide comply.”

Chip-making machines, like those sold by ASML and Applied Materials, are especially dependent on rare earths because they contain extremely precise lasers, magnets and other equipment that use these elements.

"Within the semiconductor value chain, China’s new export controls will likely most impact chipmakers that use rare-earth-based chemicals during the chip fabrication process and toolmakers that integrate rare-earth magnets into their equipment,” said Jacob Feldgoise, senior data research analyst at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.

Some have questioned how long the restrictions will last, viewing them as potential posturing ahead of a trip to Asia Trump had planned that was expected to include a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month. It’s unclear how China would even track rare earths at such discreet levels to enforce the rules.

But China’s move has instead escalated tensions with the U.S. Trump’s announced tariffs would raise import taxes on many Chinese goods to 130% starting next month. That would be just below the 145% level imposed earlier this year, before both countries ratcheted down the levies in a truce to advance trade talks. On Friday, Trump also threatened to call off his meeting with Xi altogether, describing the new rare-earth controls as a "hostile” action.

"I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

This isn’t the first time that rare earths have landed in the center of U.S.-China trade wars. After Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese imports earlier this year, China’s government responded by cutting off mineral exports to U.S. companies. Officials from both sides had agreed to a truce in the spring, under which Trump lowered duties and Xi’s officials agreed to resume the flow of the minerals.

The world’s biggest chipmakers, including Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics, rely on ASML to produce semiconductors. Samsung and Intel declined to comment. TSMC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A White House official said the government and relevant agencies are assessing any impact from the new rules, which were announced without notice and imposed in an apparent effort to exert control over the entire world’s technology supply chains.

The U.S. House Select Committee on China panned the Asian nation for the move, describing the restrictions as "an economic declaration of war against the U.S.” Committee Chairman John Moolenaar, a Republican, said in a statement on Thursday that China has "fired a loaded gun at the American economy.”

Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, has already introduced measures to diversify its supply of raw materials, and its economic ministry called China’s curbs a "great concern” on Friday. The government said it’s in close contact with affected companies and the European Commission to respond.

Taiwan relies mainly on Europe, the U.S. and Japan for rare-earth supplies. "We still need further assessment before deciding on the impact on our overall (chip) industry,” the nation’s economic affairs ministry said in a statement. "We will continue to monitor indirect impact from fluctuations in the pricing of raw materials and supply chain adjustments.”

[TITLE]Trump Says U.S. Will Hit China With 100% Additional Tariff Over Rare Earth Restrictions:
[TEXT]
President Trump said Friday he would impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports and new export controls on critical software, responding to China’s announcement of stringent new restrictions on rare earth minerals.

The measures would take effect Nov. 1, Trump said on Truth Social, potentially raising the average U.S. tariffs on many Chinese goods above 150 percent. Trump also said he saw no reason to proceed with a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.

“It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them,” Trump wrote.

Trump’s tariff move came one day after China’s Ministry of Commerce announced new export restrictions on rare earth elements, lithium batteries, and related technologies. The rules, which would reportedly take effect in early November, require foreign entities to obtain licenses to export products containing Chinese rare earths comprising as little as 0.1 percent of a product’s value or items manufactured with Chinese rare earth processing technology.

China processes approximately 90 percent of the world’s rare earths, minerals critical for manufacturing semiconductors, electric vehicles, and military equipment. Its dominance in processing gives Beijing significant leverage over global technology supply chains.

China’s rare earth restrictions have upended months of negotiations between Washington and Beijing. The two countries agreed to a tariff truce earlier this year that reduced U.S. duties on Chinese goods from a peak above 140 percent in April. Average U.S. tariffs on China currently stand at 57.6 percent, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods average 32.6 percent.

Trump said other countries had contacted him expressing anger over China’s actions. “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,” he wrote.

China also imposed new port fees on U.S. ships this week and launched an antitrust investigation into U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm.

The dispute over rare earths marks a repeat of tensions that erupted earlier this year. In April, China tightened export controls on the minerals, prompting warnings of supply chain disruptions in autos and defense. The two sides eventually relaxed most restrictions after a series of meetings in the U.K. and Europe.

The latest Chinese restrictions could prove more disruptive. Many global technology companies will struggle to demonstrate their products fall below the 0.1 percent threshold, potentially requiring them to seek Chinese government approval for exports.

A cancellation of the APEC meeting would represent a setback for Xi, who has sought continued engagement with Trump to manage bilateral relations.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that China’s decision to tighten its export controls stemmed from a belief among Chinese officials that they had gained leverage over the U.S. economy and President Trump in advance of the APEC meeting. Officials view recent U.S. responses to Chinese trade threats as “feeble,” the Wall Street Journal reported. Chinese officials sought to force the U.S. to remove tariffs and export controls on technology, especially related to artificial intelligence.

One analyst described China’s restrictions as “an economic equivalent of nuclear war—an intent to destroy the American AI industry,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

The shutdown of the federal government over budgetary disputes may also have emboldened the Chinese regime, which appears to have interpreted it as a sign of governmental disarray.

Trump’s reaction to the export controls suggests that the Chinese miscalculated Trump’s eagerness to make a deal.

Trump said the U.S. would impose export controls on “any and all critical software” starting Nov. 1, though he didn’t specify which products would be affected.

The U.S. maintains significant leverage in advanced semiconductor technology and manufacturing equipment. American companies and their allies control more than 90 percent of global semiconductor equipment manufacturing, and China remains heavily dependent on foreign sources for advanced chips essential to artificial intelligence and military applications.

China’s moves are emboldening trade hawks in the Trump administration, contributing to their arguments that the U.S. may eventually have to decouple its economy from China’s.

[TITLE]Trump tariff threat against China causes Bitcoin to crash 7%, $9B in liquidations:
[TEXT]
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 7% amid a broader market rout after President Donald Trump announced that the US is considering escalating tariffs against China in response to newly imposed rare-earth export controls.

Total liquidations reached $9 billion over the past 24 hours, as BTC fell to as low as $105k in the drop.

On a lengthy statement on Oct. 10 via Truth Social, Trump accused China of attempting to monopolize rare-earth elements and announced plans for “a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America.”

Bitcoin traded as low as as of press time, down 2.8% and briefly losing the $118,000 support level. Long positions absorbed nearly $600 million in liquidations over the past four hours following Trump’s post, per Coinglass data.

The president canceled a scheduled meeting with Xi Jinping at APEC in South Korea and stated he would “financially counter their move” depending on China’s response.

Supply chain shocks

China tightened its rare-earth export controls between Oct. 9 and Oct. 10, expanding its licensing requirements to cover additional elements and technologies.

Beijing extended restrictions to foreign-made products containing Chinese rare-earth or processed using Chinese technology, asserting regulatory authority beyond its borders. Officials signaled rejections for defense applications while flagging semiconductor and AI uses for heightened scrutiny.

Markets interpreted the controls as a supply chain shock. Rare-earth miners outside China rallied on tighter supply expectations, while tech and industrial equities faced pressure from potential input bottlenecks.

European officials called the move a “great concern,” while Washington weighs potential countermeasures.

Risk assets sold off across the board. The S&P 500 fell 2% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7% as traders reduced risk in portfolios. Bitcoin’s correlation with tech equities pulled the crypto market lower alongside broader risk-off sentiment.

Potential US response

China controls roughly 70% of global rare-earth production and 90% of processing capacity. The elements power electric vehicle batteries, semiconductors, defense systems, and renewable energy technologies.

Trump’s statement framed the export controls as “sinister and hostile,” claiming China seeks to hold other nations “captive” through resource dominance.

Trump noted the US holds “monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far-reaching than China’s” but had not deployed them until the Chinese letter prompted retaliation.

Trump wrote that the timing coincided with a Middle East peace announcement, questioning whether China coordinated the export restrictions with the geopolitical development.

[TITLE]Orange lands first Medusa subsea cable in Marseille:
[TEXT]
Telco Orange has revealed the first landing on European soil of the Medusa undersea cable system, designed to transform infrastructure in the Mediterranean region.

Owned by African infrastructure and telecoms operator AFR-IX Telecom, the Medusa Submarine Cable System is 8,760km long, and will be the first and longest subsea cable to connect the main Mediterranean countries, providing access to telecommunications infrastructure and 16 landing points around the Mediterranean Sea.

The cable will have segments with up to 24 fibre pairs, with a capacity of 20Tbs per fibre pair. Its festoon architecture is said to offer a unique design.

Designed as an open-access system, Medusa will look to offer telecom providers across the region with access to advanced connectivity services, supporting the roll-out of 5G, the growth of cloud infrastructure, and the increasing bandwidth demands of artificial intelligence (AI) and future technologies.

Operationally, Medusa will have two main regions: Europe and North Africa. In Europe, it has local operational branches in Ireland, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Cyprus. These branches hold licenses and permits. The Network Operations Centre is based in Europe. In North Africa, Medusa has agreements with local licensed operators for landing parties.

Medusa is seen as being crucial for developing the digital ecosystem of populations in North African countries, taking a significant step towards closing the digital divide between Europe and North Africa, connecting countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria and Egypt with high-capacity fibre-optic links to six European Union (EU) member states: Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Cyprus.

The investment is expected to have a positive impact on the economy of these countries, which will lead to inclusive and sustainable economic growth. It is also backed financially by the EU.

With the arrival of the 1,050km-long submarine cable segment, Orange says it is reaffirming its commitment to international connectivity and digital dynamism in the Mediterranean through the continued development of its infrastructure in Marseille.

The cable is part of the ongoing development of submarine networks connecting both sides of the Mediterranean, from Marseille to Bizerte in Tunisia, meeting growing needs for bandwidth in the region.

With the fully redundant fibre optic infrastructure, Orange says it will provide its Marseille customers with simple, secure and direct access to all of the city’s datacentres, which are now interconnected and also have direct links to major European hubs such as Paris, London and Frankfurt, as well as the rest of the world. All aspects of the cable are fully managed by Orange, including from a technical, regulatory, security and environmental point of view.

The Marseille-Bizerte segment also benefits from co-financing by the EU through the Connecting Europe Facility. Three pairs of fibre belonging to Orange are supported in the framework of the European Global Gateway strategy, aimed at strengthening connections between Europe and Africa, supporting digital transition and reducing the digital divide.

The Medusa cable provider is Alcatel Submarine Networks. Elettra, a subsidiary of Orange and the project coordinator, managed the operation. Orange Marine’s cable ship, Sophie Germain, was tasked with the cable landing operations in Marseille.

“We are proud to bring our leadership and expertise to the Medusa cable, hosted within our secure infrastructure in Marseille, with laying operations carried out by our cable ships, Teliri and Sophie Germain,” said Michael Trabbia, CEO of Orange Wholesale.

“Our infrastructure offers a key link in Mediterranean basin connectivity, ensuring digital resilience and supporting socio-economic development,” he added. “With this landing, Orange enhances Europe’s digital sovereignty and positions Marseille as a global digital hub, now hosting the arrival of 17 submarine cables connected worldwide.”

For starters, the event was inaugurated by one of the most powerful and influential politicians in the world, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who clearly believes India can play as much of a key role in the global telecom sector as China, the US and Europe. That aspiration is underpinned by government initiatives, such as Made in India (promoting and supporting domestic production since 2014) and Bharat 6G Vision, that have been underway for years already.

During his speech, which officially launched the congress, Modi noted that “the nation that once struggled with 2G now has 5G coverage in nearly every district.”

India’s communications ministry reported in this Press Information Bureau (PIB) announcement that Modi noted: “India’s success in the telecom sector, exemplified by its sixfold growth in electronics production and 28-fold increase in mobile manufacturing since 2014, reflects the strength of the Atmanirbhar Bharat [self-reliant India] vision.”

In a separate PIB announcement the government pointed out that the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for telecom manufacturing, which was established to encourage the development and production of technology in India, “has witnessed remarkable success,” achieving 910bn rupees ($10.25bn) in sales, 178bn rupees ($2bn) in exports and creating more than 20,000 jobs.

Modi also “emphasised the significance of India’s Made-in-India 4G stack, marking the nation’s technological self-reliance and its export readiness,” as well as its contribution to India’s plan to be a global 6G leader (more on that later).

That home-grown ‘4G stack’ refers to the mobile core and radio access network (RAN) technology that has been deployed by state-owned telco BSNL, which after years of neglect and decline, is being revived with state funding so that it can better compete with India’s privately owned telco giants and play a role in proving the capabilities of India’s telecom R&D sector, as we reported earlier this week – see Indigenous tech fuels BSNL’s revival.

That the Indian government’s efforts to regenerate BSNL are having a real impact was highlighted not only in its improving financial performance (it has recorded an operating profit so far this financial year) but also in the most recent market statistics published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), which also serve as a reminder of the scale of India’s mobile sector.

At the end of August, the country’s network operators reported 1,178 million mobile connections and 46.5 million fixed line connections to give a total of 1,224.5 million connections.

The mobile market leader, as it has been for many years, is Reliance Jio, which ended August with 479.5 million cellular connections for a market share of just over 41%, followed by Bharti Airtel with almost 392 million cellular connections (33.6% market share), Vodafone Idea with 203.6 million (17.4% market share) and BSNL with 91.7 million for a market share of almost 7.9%.

What’s most notable from the August statistics, though, is that BSNL’s subscriber base increased by almost 1.4 million, a significant number and more than the 496,000 gains recorded by Bharti Airtel (though less than the 1.95 million added by Jio). Vodafone Idea continued to experience customer base erosion, losing almost 309,000 mobile connections during August.

While BSNL did record some customer gains last year following price increases by the market leaders, this new uptick appears to be driven by BSNL’s 4G rollout and more aggressive marketing – it’ll be interesting to see if consecutive gains can be achieved and if the operator can reach the 100 million customer mark in the coming months as it expands its 4G coverage.

6G aspirations

While BSNL is by far the smallest of India’s mobile operators, it will play a key role in India’s 6G plans, which include the development of indigenous mobile network technology that can be deployed by the country’s operators as they adopt the next generation of cellular standards-based tech.

As part of the opening ceremony, India’s telecom minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, stated that India is aiming to secure 10% of global 6G patents and that 6G economic activity is “expected to contribute $1.2tn to India’s GDP [gross domestic product] by 2035,” according to the ministry’s announcement.

Scindia also helped to open the International 6G Symposium 2025, which is part of the congress programming, during which the Bharat 6G Alliance (which was formed in July 2023 and now has more than 80 members) signed memorandum of understandings (MoU) with Indian IT trade association NASSCOM and the European Space Agency “for fostering joint participation in the field of technology development”. The Bharat 6G Alliance also released four whitepapers: Spectrum Roadmap for 6G in India; Powering Next-Gen Telecom; AI and Network Evolution to 5G; and 6G Architecture, Security and Exposure Framework for RF Sensing.

Scindia noted: “India is no longer a mere consumer of technology. We strive to be the architects of the future of technology. India is here not to follow but to co-lead the 6G revolution.”

The minister was also present as India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT), National Communications Academy (NCA) and global industry association the GSMA signed an MoU to establish “a broad framework for cooperation between NCA and GSMA in the areas of policy development, research, training, and capacity building in the telecommunications sector.”

[TITLE]VVDN applies for Centre incentives, eyeing $100 mn local PCB, display bets:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: Electronics manufacturer VVDN Technologies is gearing up to make multiple $100 million bets on component manufacturing in India and has applied for the Centre’s newly announced incentive scheme for the same, a senior company executive told Mint .

The 18-year-old company sees exponential growth opportunity due to the scale of India’s electronics market, as a result of which it hopes to ramp up its portfolio in the country, Vivek Bansal, cofounder and president of VVDN Technologies, said in an interview on the sidelines of the India Mobile Congress on Wednesday,

Bansal said the company has already applied for the Centre’s electronics component manufacturing scheme (ECMS) for component subsidies, which will make a significant difference in terms of the returns to capital expenditure that it plans to make.

“We have full-fledged plans to commence bare printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing in India as well as display manufacturing locally. In the long run, we also plan to manufacture capacitors, resistors and other such components—for which India still relies on imports. Eventually, our goal is to achieve backward integration, or locally manufacturing the full value chain of electronics instead of just low-margin, low-value assemblies," Bansal told Mint.

Classified as an original design manufacturer, Manesar, Haryana-based VVDN Technologies currently assembles telecommunications and enterprise technology infrastructure such as networking switches, radio access networks, routers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices—and also manufactures some components locally.

On 18 April, the company unveiled a new assembly line to locally put together enterprise-grade laptops for Taiwanese brand, Asus, expanding into a new category.

The company loosely counts contract manufacturers Dixon Technologies, Syrma SGS and Kaynes Technology as its closest competitors. It is eyeing a public listing in the near future, Bansal said.

Need for scale

“Each of the component manufacturing plans that we have will need considerable capital investment to ramp up to scale. Without scale, there is no profitability or impact across the market," he said. “For instance, a bare PCB manufacturing facility will need us to invest at least $10 million upfront and $100 million—minus incentives—to bring them up to scale. This is what we need the capital for, and once we are sanctioned for the Centre’s incentives, we will… accelerate our plans for a public listing in the next 18-24 months."

India’s $2.7 billion ECMS outlay, notified in April, has received a warm response from the industry. On 2 October, union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that within the scheme’s first deadline of 30 September, the Centre received 249 applications with total proposed investments of $13 billion—up from the government’s initial projection of $6.7 billion. Vaishnaw affirmed that

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURES TRADING

Futures transactions involve high risk. The amount of the initial margin is low compared to the value of the futures contract, so that transactions are "leveraged" or "geared". A relatively small market movement has a proportionately larger impact on the funds that you have deposited or have to pay: this can work both for you and against you. You may experience the total loss of the initial margin funds as well as any additional funds deposited in the system. If the market develops in a way that is contrary to your position or if margins are increased, you may be asked to pay significant additional funds at short notice to maintain your position. In this case it may also happen that your broker account is in the red and you thus have to make payments beyond the initial investment.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRONIC TRADING

Before you begin carrying out transactions with an electronic system, you should carefully review the rules and provisions of the stock exchange offering the system, or of the financial instruments listed that you intend to trade, as well as your broker's conditions. Online trading has inherent risks due to system responses/reaction times and access times that may vary due to market conditions, system performance and other factors, and on which you have no influence. You should be aware of these additional risks in electronic trading before you carry out investment transactions.

[TITLE]Tariffs and AI Spending in Focus as Traders Brace for Earnings:
[TEXT]
And while investors gave companies a “hall pass” on deferred tariff guidance in previous quarters, they are unlikely to be as generous this time around, said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank.

Many on Wall Street are convinced that months of elevated tariffs are already taking a toll that will be seen in third-quarter earnings: Deutsche Bank AG, for example, said S&P 500 earnings growth would have been a percentage-point higher in the quarter without the effects of tariffs.

After upending markets earlier this year, worries over global trade were again front and center on Friday, with President Donald Trump saying he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China and export controls on “any and all critical software” beginning November 1.

Here’s a look at five key themes to watch as the results roll in.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other big US banks are scheduled to kick off the third-quarter reporting cycle next week while the spotlight will fall on tech-focused megacaps later this month.

[TITLE]One of the world's biggest AI companies wants a deal with Canada. Is sovereignty the trade-off?:
[TEXT]
One of the world's biggest artificial intelligence companies is knocking on Canada's door, potentially armed with an offer that — under normal circumstances — would be hard to refuse.

OpenAI is building a global network of data centres to store the massive amounts of information collected by its services, including ChatGPT — and Canada's cheap energy could help with that.

The company believes AI and its associated infrastructure will be the base of future economic development, and it says it wants to help spread what it calls "democratic AI." It recently launched "OpenAI for countries" to pounce on the opportunity.

Meanwhile, Canada, wary of an increasingly protectionist U.S. government and the powerful American tech companies subject to its laws, is trying to distance itself from foreign players by building AI models domestically. And paradoxically, OpenAI says it can contribute to that — by building those centres on Canadian soil.

The company is currently looking at building data centre infrastructure in Canada, building on its $500-billion US Stargate initiative in the United States and similar projects around the world.

"There are so many different elements that go into building an AI model that Canada has in abundance, whether it's the power and the resources — and frankly, the wherewithal and the desire — to really be a leader in the technology," said Chan Park, OpenAI's head of U.S. and Canada public policy and partnerships, during a recent interview with CBC News at Toronto's Elevate Fest.

Park has met with key officials, including Artificial Intelligence Minister Evan Solomon, to discuss a potential partnership.

Canadian politicians, public policy experts and business leaders have been increasingly vocal
