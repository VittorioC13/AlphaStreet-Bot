[TITLE]Rare Earth Boom: Defense Heavyweight Joins Critical Mineral Effort:
[TEXT]
The escalating geopolitical competition over critical mineral supply chains has driven a major corporate maneuver, as REalloys Inc., a company focused on establishing a North American mine-to-magnet rare earth pipeline, announced it has appointed Stephen S. duMont, president of GM Defense, as its non-executive chairman of the board of directors.

The move links one of North America’s leading defense industry figures directly to the effort to secure the materials essential for advanced military and green energy technologies. REalloys, which is in the process of merging with Blackboxstocks Inc. (NASDAQ: BLBX) is seeking to build a supply chain free of dependency on Chinese processing capacity, a strategic goal increasingly prioritized by Washington and Ottawa.

Tying Industrial Capacity to National Security

Mr. duMont brings three decades of experience in defense, aerospace, and national security, including senior executive roles at Raytheon Technologies, BAE Systems, and Boeing, in addition to his distinguished service as a U.S. Army attack helicopter pilot. His appointment signals a clear intent by REalloys to align its commercial growth directly with allied defense modernization efforts.

The company is focused on the vertical integration of rare earth elements, which are vital components in high-performance magnets used across the defense industrial base—from precision-guided missiles to radar systems—as well as in commercial products like electric vehicle motors and wind turbines. The announcement follows REalloys' recent commitment of a 10-year, 6.75 million ton offtake agreement with Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML) and a strategic supply commitment with St George Mining Limited (ASX: SGQ).

“REalloys stands at the heart of an effort critical to freedom, prosperity, and autonomy across the Western world,” said Stephen S. duMont, non-executive chairman of REalloys. He noted that the company is actively "driving a coordinated effort under Title 50 authorities, to ensure allied defense modernization, and broader U.S.–Canadian defense alignment to reinforce the supply chains that underpin both national and economic security."

The North American Imperative

The global critical minerals market remains overwhelmingly dominated by China, which processes the vast majority of rare earth elements into usable metal and magnet forms. This concentration has spurred the United States and Canada to invest heavily in creating resilient, Western-aligned alternatives.

REalloys is promoting a framework defined by its “no Chinese nexus” supply chain, aiming to keep processing, separation, refining, and magnet manufacturing entirely within North America or allied nations. This continental strategy is intended to be synergistic with major U.S.-Canadian initiatives, including NORAD modernization and the deepening of defense-industrial integration through cooperative agreements.

REalloys CEO Lipi Sternheim, the company’s founder and former executive chairman, stated that Mr. duMont’s defense background provides a unique perspective.

“His depth of experience with global defense systems and government relations will strengthen our ability to advance North America’s security and industrial resilience,” Sternheim said, adding that Mr. duMont’s guidance would help position REalloys “as a bridge between national defense priorities and the manufacturing capacity that underpins them.”

The new chairman joins an already robust board that includes former Canadian Ambassador to the United States David MacNaughton and former Premier of Saskatchewan Brad Wall, further cementing the company’s focus on policy, diplomacy, and industrial competitiveness within the U.S.-Canadian economic framework.

Executive Transition

In conjunction with the appointment, REalloys announced a change in its executive suite, with David Argyle resigning as Chief Executive Officer and director. Founder Lipi Sternheim stepped into the CEO role, a transition the company attributes to its goal of rapidly scaling its vertically integrated operation to meet the demand for secure rare earth magnet capacity.

The strategic leadership changes underscore the high-stakes environment in which critical mineral companies now operate, where corporate growth is increasingly inseparable from national security objectives. The confluence of defense leadership and industrial supply chain efforts reflects the West's broader push for self-reliance in the materials that power both its economy and its military capabilities.

Other companies to keep an eye on in the critical mineral race

General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) is one of the world’s largest automakers and a pivotal force in America’s industrial base, bridging the commercial and defense sectors through cutting-edge mobility innovation. The company’s role in the energy transition is underscored by its massive investment in electric vehicles, battery technology, and domestic manufacturing. Through its Ultium battery platform, GM has built a vertically integrated EV supply chain spanning battery cells, modules, and packs — and has partnered with key material suppliers such as MP Materials and Lithium Americas to secure critical mineral inputs within North America.

Beyond its consumer operations, GM Defense, a wholly owned subsidiary, has become a cornerstone of the company’s diversification strategy. It designs and delivers advanced, electrified, and autonomous defense and government mobility solutions for the U.S. military and allied partners. Recent projects include the Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) based on Chevrolet’s Colorado ZR2 platform, and the development of electric tactical vehicles using Ultium battery technology — efforts that directly align with the Pentagon’s modernization and energy resilience goals.

This dual commercial-defense strategy positions GM as far more than a traditional automaker. By combining industrial scale, advanced manufacturing, and proprietary energy technologies, GM is re-establishing the United States as a global leader in both clean transportation and next-generation defense mobility. The company’s ability to merge innovation across its automotive and defense divisions makes it a strategic asset in the broader context of national security, supply chain resilience, and technological sovereignty.

MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP) is the operator of the Mountain Pass mine in California, the only rare earth mining and processing facility of scale in North America. The company is primarily focused on producing neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr), which is essential for manufacturing the high-strength permanent magnets that power electric vehicle traction motors, wind turbines, and robotics. Its operation at Mountain Pass, one of the world's richest rare earth deposits, represents a crucial step in re-establishing a domestic supply chain for these strategic elements, a capability that had been largely lost to foreign competitors over the past few decades.

The company's existence is a key strategic advantage for the U.S. and its allies, as rare earth elements are non-substitutable in many high-tech and military applications. By localizing the production of raw materials, MP Materials addresses a significant point of vulnerability in the Western manufacturing base, providing a secure alternative to offshore supply. This effort is seen as vital for the ongoing energy transition and for maintaining technological superiority in the global arena.

MP Materials is aggressively moving toward full vertical integration by advancing its Stage III plan to manufacture finished magnets in the United States. It has begun NdPr metal production at its new facility in Fort Worth, Texas, which is a major step toward creating a complete mine-to-magnet supply chain. Furthermore, the company has secured high-profile commercial agreements, including a long-term supply contract with General Motors for its electric vehicle magnets, cementing its role as a fundamental supplier to America's industrial future.

Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) is the world's largest producer of lithium, a material foundational to the lithium-ion batteries that power nearly all modern electric transportation and energy storage systems. The company operates a globally diversified portfolio that includes hard rock mines in Australia, brine operations in Chile, and the Silver Peak brine operation in Nevada—the only active lithium-producing resource in the U.S.

The global transition away from fossil fuels places Albemarle in a uniquely significant position, as the energy storage industry cannot meet its goals without a massive and reliable supply of lithium. By controlling a substantial portion of the world’s output and possessing advanced processing capabilities, the company is a primary enabler of the electric vehicle revolution.

The company is significantly investing in expanding its operational footprint across its global segments to keep pace with soaring demand. In North Carolina, Albemarle is working to reopen its historic Kings Mountain hard rock mine, and it is also expanding its conversion capacities in the U.S. and abroad. These investments are driven by a strategy to increase resource diversity and production volumes, signaling a clear commitment to maintaining its leadership role as a foundational supplier to the Western battery supply chain for the foreseeable future.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) is a major international mining company with world-class assets primarily focused on the production of copper, gold, and molybdenum. While it is often viewed through the lens of traditional mining, its massive copper output is what places it squarely in the critical minerals discussion. Copper is arguably the most essential metal for electrification, vital for every part of the energy transition, from electrical wiring and transmission lines to wind turbines and electric vehicle components.

The company's importance stems from copper's unmatched electrical conductivity and the sheer volume of the metal required to support a modern, electrified economy. Every electric vehicle uses approximately four times more copper than a conventional car, and the buildout of renewable energy infrastructure requires vast quantities of the metal.

Freeport-McMoRan is focusing its capital and operational efforts on maximizing output from its significant, long-lived copper operations, such as the Grasberg complex in Indonesia and its assets in the Americas. The company is particularly focused on expanding its underground mining operations to access deeper, high-grade ore, ensuring a long-term supply pipeline.

BHP Group (NYSE: BHP) is a globally diversified resource company with a portfolio that spans iron ore, coal, and petroleum, but its strategic focus has increasingly shifted toward "future-facing commodities" like copper and nickel. The company's massive operational scale and access to long-life assets make it a critical player in securing the raw materials for a lower-carbon future.

The sheer size and stability of BHP's operations provide a necessary bulwark against the supply volatility inherent in smaller, riskier projects. Its established presence in key mining jurisdictions, particularly Chile and Australia, helps ensure that the massive amounts of copper and nickel needed to support global decarbonization efforts can be brought to market reliably.

In line with its strategic push, the company has been actively seeking out opportunities to expand its copper and nickel footprint. It is a co-owner in the massive Resolution Copper project in Arizona, which, if fully developed, could become a significant source of U.S. copper. BHP is also investing in its Nickel West operations in Australia, with the goal of producing materials suitable for the battery supply chain, cementing its role in powering next-generation technologies.

Rio Tinto Group (NYSE: RIO) is a multinational mining giant that produces a wide range of materials, including aluminum, iron ore, and diamonds, but it is aggressively developing its portfolio of battery and critical minerals.

Rio Tinto holds one of the world's largest undeveloped lithium projects, Jadar, in Serbia, which underscores its potential to significantly influence the global lithium market should it come to fruition. Moreover, the company’s efforts to recover critical minerals like scandium from waste streams at its existing facilities in Canada demonstrate a commitment to innovative, responsible sourcing. This diversification of supply is crucial for reducing the Western world’s reliance on concentrated supply chains.

Beyond its major new lithium project, the company is expanding its copper production, a necessity for global electrification. Rio Tinto is investing $55 million in its Kennecott operations in Utah to start underground mining and significantly expand the production of high-quality copper. In addition, its Resolution Copper joint venture with BHP in Arizona, if approved, has the potential to supply a quarter of the U.S. demand for the metal over a multi-decade span.

Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM) is primarily recognized as the world's leading gold company, but it also produces significant quantities of copper as a byproduct and through dedicated operations. Copper is the core critical mineral in Newmont's portfolio, with its output coming from world-class assets across the Americas and Australia. This exposure ensures the company remains relevant to the broader critical minerals discourse, despite its focus on precious metals.

The copper produced by a major, established miner like Newmont is vital because of the scale and certainty of its supply. In the race to electrify, every ounce of new copper is crucial, and Newmont’s operations provide a stable, long-term source from politically favorable jurisdictions.

The company is leveraging its global presence and technical expertise to maintain and enhance its copper production profile. Newmont has actively acquired and developed operations like the Boddington mine in Australia, which produces both gold and copper, and it continues to invest in projects that will prolong the life and increase the output of its copper assets. Its strategy aims to maximize value from all metals discovered, positioning it to benefit from the soaring demand for both gold and base metals.

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE: LAC) is a pure-play lithium resource developer, centered on its flagship Thacker Pass project in Nevada, which represents one of the largest known lithium resources in the United States. The company's business model is focused on bringing this massive clay-based lithium resource into commercial production to serve the burgeoning North American electric vehicle and battery manufacturing sector.

The strategic significance of Lithium Americas is immense, as the Thacker Pass project is a foundational piece of the U.S. effort to establish a comprehensive domestic electric vehicle supply chain. The sheer scale of the resource, coupled with its location within the U.S., directly addresses the critical need for regional supply security and resource independence from foreign nations. This project is seen as a key component of the nation's energy future and a recipient of significant government support.

The company has been actively securing the financing and partnerships necessary to move Thacker Pass toward full-scale construction and operation. This includes a significant loan from the Department of Energy, a move that underscores the project's national importance.

Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML) is a development-stage mining company focused on advancing a portfolio of strategic assets that contain key critical minerals, notably lithium and rare earth elements. Its primary assets include the Wolfsberg Lithium Project in Austria and the massive Tanbreez rare earth deposit in Greenland. This dual focus positions the company to supply materials crucial for both Europe's electric vehicle manufacturing base and global high-tech industries.

The company holds a vital position in European supply chain security, as its Wolfsberg project represents Europe's first fully permitted lithium mine. Having a domestic source of lithium metal is paramount for the European Union's battery manufacturing ambitions and its push for energy independence. Furthermore, the sheer size and heavy rare earth profile of its Tanbreez project are strategically significant, as heavy rare earths are particularly scarce outside of Asia and are vital for advanced defense technologies.

The company has been making significant corporate moves to fund and advance its key projects. It recently announced a $50 million PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) transaction to support the development of its Tanbreez deposit. Simultaneously, it has been securing long-term offtake agreements with U.S. and European processors, ensuring that a significant portion of its future output is already committed to Western supply chains.

[TITLE]China’s Battery Giants Flood Overseas Markets As Exports Surge 220%:
[TEXT]
Last year, China's battery industry average utilization rate cratered to just a third of maximum capacity amid severe overcapacity following years of massive investment and expansion. This put smaller manufacturers under severe pressure and fueled further industry consolidation, while also forcing producers to increasingly seek overseas markets. Luckily, these efforts appear to be paying off: China Energy Storage Alliance has reported that Chinese battery storage forms secured ~200 overseas orders totalling 186 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the first half of this year, good for a more than 220% year-over-year surge. Not surprisingly, just 5.34 GWh– less than 3% of the total--came from the United States amid hefty tariffs by the Trump administration compared to nearly 60% that came from the Middle East, Europe and Australia.

Back in April, the Trump administration imposed duties of up to 3,521% on solar imports from Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand, with the finalized tariffs applying to shipments from China’s solar heavyweights, including JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) and Trina Solar. Further, Chinese firms are increasingly diversifying their production bases in a bid to mitigate growing tariff risks from Washington. Currently, Chinese solar manufacturers have installed ~80% of overseas capacity including solar wafers, solar cells and modules in Southeast Asia.

“The industry used to say that you either go overseas or exit the game,” said Gao Jifan, chairman of Trina Solar. “Now, due to tariffs, simply exporting isn’t enough; you must also localise production abroad.”

China’s battery storage sector is also benefiting from a rebound by the local markets thanks to policy support by Beijing. China’s National Energy Administration recently unveiled a plan to mobilize 250 billion yuan (~$32 billion) in new investment to build 180 gigawatts of new energy storage capacity by 2027. Lately, Chinese companies that operate in the energy storage space have been posting robust growth as fundamentals continue to improve. During the first half of 2025, 47 of 55 listed companies in the Chinese energy storage sector were profitable. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (OTCMKTS:CATL), one of the largest li-ion battery manufacturers in the world, reported H1 2025 operating revenue of RMB178.886 billion ($25.15 billion), good for a 7.3% increase year over year while net profit attributable to shareholders clocked in at RMB30.485 billion, up 33.33%. In its interim report, CATL revealed that sustained rapid growth in demand for energy storage cells driven by the global clean energy transition has been driving its impressive performance.

That said, battery storage expansion is expected to be a global trend: energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie has projected that global investment in battery storage will reach approximately $1.2 trillion by 2034. This investment will be needed to support the installation of over 5,900 GW of new wind and solar capacity during that period. The report emphasizes that advanced, grid-forming battery technology is crucial for maintaining grid stability as renewable energy sources become more prevalent.

U.S. Battery Storage Explodes

For years, battery systems have only played a marginal role in U.S. electricity networks, with power utilities focusing more on building out capacity from natural gas plants and renewable energy sources. According to energy data portal Cleanview, five years ago, the United States had 74 times more wind farm capacity and 30 times more solar capacity than battery capacity within its power generation system.

However, steady cost declines coupled with rising energy density levels have encouraged utilities to ramp up their battery installations, with battery storage output now exceeding other power sources in certain power markets. And, it’s boom time for the U.S. utility-scale battery storage market: currently, there are only around 5 times more solar and wind capacity in the country compared to battery capacity, thanks in large part to a 40% decline in battery prices since 2022. Currently, 19 states have installed 100 MW or more of utility-scale battery storage. According to Cleanview, there are just under 30,000 megawatts (MW) of utility battery capacity across the U.S., good for a massive 15-fold increase since 2020. For some context, the U.S. solar sector has added 84,200 MW over the timeframe, while the wind sector has increased its capacity by just 7,000 MW. Falling costs is the biggest reason for the surge in U.S. battery deployments: according to financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility-scale solar farms paired with batteries ranges from $50-$131 per megawatt hour (MWh). This makes the pair competitive with new natural gas peaking plants (LCOE of $47 to $170 per MWh) and even new coal-fired plants with LCOE of $114 per MWh.

According to Lazard's 2025 LCOE+ report, new-build renewable energy power plants are the most competitive form of power generation on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies). This is highly significant in the current era of unprecedented power demand growth in large part due to the AI boom and clean energy manufacturing. Renewables also stand out as the quickest-to-deploy generation resource, with the solar plus battery combination often boasting far shorter deployment times compared to constructing new natural gas power plants. California is, by far, the national leader in utility-scale battery storage, accounting for ~13,000 MW or about 42% of the national total. According to the California Energy Commission, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has installed ~21,000 MW of solar capacity and ~12,400 MW of battery capacity, allowing the state to rely heavily on batteries during peak demand periods.

[TITLE]U.S. Energy Shift Offers Economic Hope to Global South:
[TEXT]
Guest essay by Vijay Jayaraj

For decades growth strategies in poorer countries of the Global South – Asia, Africa and South America – leaned heavily on energy-intensive industries powered by fossil fuels and, in a handful of cases, by nuclear power. Cities grew, factories rose, exports surged, poverty declined.

This growth slowed under the weight of decarbonization dogma and financial restrictions. However, just as the region faces the choice of either asserting its energy sovereignty or resigning itself to stagnation, an unexpected force from the U.S. has risen to potentially beat back the climate cult.

In the early 2000s, nations like China and India doubled down on coal to industrialize, achieving annual growth of over 7%. Sub-Saharan Africa followed suit, with oil and gas exports funding infrastructure.

But decarbonization agendas, driven by wealthier nations through bodies like the United Nations, imposed restrictions on this model. International financial institutions and donor nations increasingly attached conditions on financing arrangements – among them bans or limits on fossil fuel development while expressing an aversion to nuclear power.

These measures sought to force a shift to intermittent wind and solar energy, which fail to provide the scale and reliability needed for round-the-clock factories. Result? Growth forecasts dipped, and the World Bank lowered growth projection to less than 4% for many African economies.

Africans currently dependent on subsistence agriculture and raw material exports need manufacturing to create wealth and raise living standards. Industrialization requires electricity measured in megawatts and gigawatts, not the trickle of electrons that solar panels and wind turbines provide.

They need energy prices low enough to compete with manufacturers in China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, all of which prioritize energy affordability over “green” purity.

Natural resource-rich nations that should be climbing the value chain by developing processing and manufacturing facilities find themselves stuck as exporters of raw material. They ship iron ore to China where it is turned into steel and soybeans to Europe where they are transformed to processed foods. The value addition happens elsewhere because the energy infrastructure needed for manufacturing faces persistent opposition from climate activists and their allies in government.

Every dollar wasted by the developing world on impractical “green energy” projects is a dollar not spent on the natural gas pipelines, power plants and high-voltage transmission lines that would enable long-term economic progress.

The recent shift in U.S. energy policy offers a glimmer of hope. For the first time in years, a major Western power has acknowledged that imposing “green” energy preferences on developing nations is economic sabotage.

The Trump administration has signaled that it will no longer support bans on financing of fossil fuel projects. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been particularly forthright in stating that developing nations should have the freedom to use their own resources to power their growth.

Vijaya Ramachandran, a respected voice on the economics of African energy, captured the importance of this policy shift. She notes that the message from the current U.S. administration represents a fundamental break from previous approaches. Rather than dictating energy choices to sub-Saharan Africa, Washington now recognizes that African nations must exploit their hydrocarbon reserves to meet industrial needs.

The continent’s manufacturing sector cannot develop without reliable power for factories and private enterprises. Large-scale industrialization, which has yet to occur across much of Africa, requires exactly the kind of infrastructure that previous U.S. leadership discouraged.

Across sub-Saharan Africa, over 600 million people still lack access to reliable electricity. Every child who grows up without electricity, every worker denied a factory job, every family trapped in poverty because industrial development was blocked represents lost opportunity for better lives.

The Global South is not asking for a handout but for a level playing field. It is asking for the same opportunity that the West has had for centuries – the chance to use its own resources to build a bright future for its people.

[TITLE]Industry Leaders Warn: 2040 Climate Ambition and CO2 Standards for cars and vans must align with Europe’s economic and industrial reality:
[TEXT]
Brussels, 21 October 2025 : Ahead of the European Council meeting on 23 October, the European Fuel Manufacturing Industry calls on EU leaders to ensure that Europe’s climate and energy policies remain grounded in economic and industrial realities.

In a letter addressed to the EU Member States’ Ambassadors, FuelsEurope and its 40 Member Companies set out two urgent priorities: the upcoming 2040 climate target and the CO2 regulation for cars and vans.

A balanced and achievable 2040 target

The industry warns that the 2040 target must be based on realism, measurable progress, and enabling conditions such as competitiveness, affordable energy, secure supply chains, and investor confidence. It also calls for a transparent review mechanism grounded in clear indicators like industrial output, job balance, trade flows, and EU investment levels.

Liana Gouta, Director General of FuelsEurope, stressed: “To ensure Europe’s ambition remains achievable, the 2040 climate target must not be detached from reality,”. She added, “We need a framework that safeguards competitiveness, attracts investment, and keeps jobs in Europe. A technology-neutral and predictable regulatory environment is essential to secure both climate progress and Europe’s economic strength.”

FuelsEurope also highlights the need to strengthen the EU’s carbon market through greater flexibility and integration of international credits beyond the current 3% cap, starting from the post-2030 framework. These credits, together with carbon removals, should be accessible to all ETS sectors and can play a valuable role in achieving net zero. At the same time, enhanced transparency on residual emissions will help identify where further efforts and new policy instruments are needed.

Technology neutrality for clean mobility

On the 2035 ICE ban, FuelsEurope argues for restoring technology neutrality within EU CO₂ standards for cars and vans. Renewable and low- carbon fuels, alongside electrification, should be recognised as valid compliance options to ensure a resilient and inclusive transition.

Liana Gouta stated “the EU’s transport decarbonisation will succeed only if it harnesses every technology available, including electrification, renewable and low-carbon fuels, and more, not by closing doors to viable solutions.” “By recognising renewable and low- carbon fuels, the EU can decarbonise faster, protect industrial competitiveness, and offer affordable choices to citizens, leaving no one behind.”

FuelsEurope urges the European Council to steer the EU towards a climate policy that combines ambition with realism, ensuring that Europe’s decarbonisation remains achievable, competitive, and socially fair.

[TITLE]Chief Financial Credit Union Partners with On the Wings of Angels to Launch Innovative "Pay It Forward" Micro Loan Program for Abuse Survivors:
[TEXT]
Rochester Hills, Michigan, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chief Financial Federal Credit Union has launched an innovative micro loan program in partnership with nonprofit organization On the Wings of Angels (OTWOA) that breaks traditional banking barriers to provide financial support for survivors of abuse and trauma. The mission-driven program creates a powerful "pay it forward" cycle where each survivor's successful loan repayment directly enables funding for the next person in need.

Unlike conventional lending that relies on credit scores and income verification, the program uses personalized evaluations conducted by OTWOA's dedicated committee to determine eligibility based solely on survivor need and potential for rebuilding their lives.

"This program is deeply personal for me because I know firsthand how financial barriers can keep survivors from rebuilding their lives — and how just a little help at the right moment can change everything," said Cheryl Boodram, Executive Vice President and CFO at Chief Financial. "Our mission-driven loan program with On the Wings of Angels is a true lifeline, giving survivors the financial freedom to take their next step toward safety and stability. Every repayment opens the door for the next survivor, creating a cycle of hope that's at the heart of who we are at Chief Financial — more than a credit union, we're a partner in people's lives."

The program addresses immediate financial needs that often prevent survivors from escaping dangerous situations or rebuilding their independence, including housing deposits, transportation, healthcare, legal services, and other recovery-related expenses. Loans are unsecured, require no collateral or co-signers, and feature flexible repayment terms designed around each survivor's circumstances.

"We've seen too many survivors trapped not by their abuser, but by the financial barriers that make leaving seem impossible," said JoJo Dries, founder On the Wings of Angels. "This partnership with Chief Financial removes those barriers and creates something beautiful – a community of survivors supporting each other through their repayments. When someone successfully pays back their loan, they're literally opening the door for another person to find their freedom."

The revolving loan structure ensures sustainability while maximizing impact. As survivors repay their loans, those funds immediately become available to help the next person in need, creating an ongoing cycle of support within the survivor community.

Chief Financial's values-based banking approach prioritizes community impact over traditional profit metrics, aligning business operations with core values of resilience, spirit, unity, and creativity. The credit union's mission to "inspire, empower, enrich communities" drives initiatives like this partnership that address real social challenges through innovative financial solutions.

Program highlights:

Eligibility determined by survivor need, not credit history

Flexible loan terms up to 60 months

No collateral or co-signers required

Revolving fund structure creates sustainable support

In-person loan closings with OTWOA representative present

Built-in support system through nonprofit partnership

The program launched July 1, 2025, and represents Chief Financial's commitment to using banking as a force for positive social change. By partnering with specialized nonprofits like OTWOA, the credit union can extend its community impact beyond traditional financial services.

[TEXT]
UDHAY MATHIALAGAN: The amount of data that’s being used in the world is growing at such a fast rate that the pieces of infrastructure that need to support it haven’t just been assembled at the scale and at the level of complexity that’s required. So we see an enormous opportunity.

ERIC JANSON: Huge amount of capital is needed. It’s needed all over the world in all different countries. And I think, by the sheer nature of that, you’re going to see more formalized blended models of financing, where public and private capital figure out ways to work together.

UDHAY: Data centers are not islands of infrastructure. They’re actually only effective if they are interconnected with other data centers. So there is an ecosystem of connectedness that creates almost a flywheel of economic activity that comes from a particular start, if you will, of infrastructure in a new area.

FEMI OKE: In this series, we’ve been exploring new opportunities for business and society when we do things differently—and how industries will meet to solve complex needs. But without enough money to pay for it all, businesses will miss out. So how can the way projects are funded drive a real change across industries?

LIZZIE O’LEARY: This is a time for new, creative financing models to develop—and an opportunity for the financial services sector, and beyond. I’m Lizzie O’Leary, a podcaster and journalist.

[TITLE]Failure 'not an option,' Gloria says after court deals blow to Midway Rising development:
[TEXT]
Despite a Court of Appeals ruling once again denying the city of San Diego the ability to lift a 30-foot height limit in the Midway District, Mayor Todd Gloria said Monday the fight wasn't over.

In a ruling issued Friday, the 4th District Court of Appeal determined the city hadn't done its due diligence in completing an environmental study on the plan to raise the height limit in the neighborhood — part of an effort to greenlight the nearly $4 billion Midway Rising project.

This is the second time a court has overturned a voter-approved ballot measure to lift the coastal 30-foot limit for new construction in the area on a procedural technicality. San Diego's voters approved "Measure E" to raise the limit in 2020 by a 13-point margin, 56.6% to 43.4%.

"The city attorney and I disagree strongly with this ruling and will be asking the City Council to appeal it to the California Supreme Court," Gloria said Monday in a statement. "In addition to the appeal, city staff have identified multiple paths to keep the redevelopment of the city's sports arena property moving forward.

"I will not allow San Diego to miss out on an opportunity that holds massive benefits for San Diegans, including thousands of permanent new jobs, affordable homes, a new entertainment center and billions in economic activity. Failure is simply not an option, and we will get this done."

As a result of the ruling, Gloria on Monday also extended the exclusive negotiating agreement with Midway Rising project leaders to give more time for council review of the project. That review had been scheduled for later this year, but the extended deadline is now Dec. 4, 2026.

The ruling comes just weeks after the project cleared a major hurdle by getting San Diego Planning Commission approval.

As proposed, Midway Rising would allow the developers — housing developer Chelsea Investment Corporation, sports venue developer and operator Legends, market-rate housing developer Zephyr and equity investor The Kroenke Group — to construct 4,254 housing units, including 2,000 affordable units, 8.12 acres of public parks and 6.42 acres of public space, a 16,000 seat, multi- purpose Entertainment Center, and 130,000 square feet of commercial space.

The affordable apartments would be dedicated to households earning 80% of the area median income or below. A family of four with an annual household income of up to $132,400 would qualify to rent an affordable home for 30% of their annual income.

As for the legendary but 59-year-old Sports Arena, now known as Pechanga Arena, it would be replaced with the entertainment center and seat 2,000 more people than the current structure, according to the developers.

Additionally, sustainable features for all buildings are part of the proposal, as well as infrastructure improvements on- and off-site, including roadways, bike paths and transit facilities.

"The economic potential of redeveloping this site is tremendous," said Economic Development Director Christina Bibler in September. "This project will generate thousands of jobs, significantly boost local revenue and unlock the value of underutilized city-owned land. By creating such a large volume of new housing opportunities — especially affordable homes — we're not only addressing a critical need but also laying the foundation for long-term neighborhood economic vitality.

"Revitalizing this area, which hasn't seen major investment since the 1960s, will create a sustainable economic engine for generations to come."

The road to this point started in 2021, when the city council declared the site surplus land and requested proposals to redevelop the area. A total of five proposals deemed good faith came in, and a competitive selection process began. Those five were shortlisted to three by the city in agreement with the state's Department of Housing and Community Development. In 2022, the council selected Midway Rising, which offered the highest total number of affordable housing units.

Cleantech Solar has a 1.2 giga watt (GW) portfolio of solar and wind assets in operations, construction and development stages in India, Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam; of which 1 GW is operational.

Spokespersons for Shell and Cleantech Solar confirmed the sale.

“Shell Singapore Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell plc, has agreed to sell its 49% stake in Cleantech Renewable Assets Pte Ltd to an affiliate of Keppel Ltd. This decision is consistent with Shell’s business strategy and enhanced focus on performance, discipline, and simplification," a Shell spokesperson said in an emailed response.

“Keppel Ltd. and its managed fund, Keppel Asia Infrastructure Fund, have agreed to acquire Shell Singapore Pte Ltd.’s 49% stake in Cleantech Renewable Assets Pte Ltd. This is an exciting new chapter for Cleantech Solar. The company is well-positioned for growth and success, with support from committed shareholders and partners, and more importantly, a strong and dedicated team," a Cleantech Solar spokesperson said on email.

Queries emailed to a Keppel spokesperson on Thursday evening remained unanswered.

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
