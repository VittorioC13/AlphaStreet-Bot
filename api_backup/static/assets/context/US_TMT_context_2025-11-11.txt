[TITLE]Diginex Announces Non-Binding MOU for the Acquisition of Kindred OS and entering the Edge AI Technology market:
[TEXT]
LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diginex Limited (“Diginex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DGNX), a recognized provider of Sustainability RegTech announces the execution of a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) to acquire Kindred OS (“Kindred”), an innovator in Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), a technology that enables AI models to run locally, securely, and independently of the cloud.

While much of the AI industry is racing toward large, cloud-based AI models, Diginex hopes to chart a different path, one centered on privacy, energy efficiency, and regulatory trust. Edge AI empowers organizations to perform complex data analysis within their own infrastructure, without transferring sensitive information externally. This privacy-first architecture is particularly relevant for regulated sectors such as financial services, healthcare, and the public sector, where data sovereignty, transparency, and auditability are critical.

“Compliance and reporting are evolving from static checklists into living and evolving intelligent systems” stated Miles Pelham, Founder and Executive Chairman of Diginex. “Edge AI allows us to place trusted intelligence within an organization’s own secure IT ecosystem, which is perfectly aligned with Diginex’s mission to make compliance transparent, efficient, and responsible.”

By integrating Kindred’s Edge AI framework into its platform, Diginex aims to enable clients to automate compliance and generate AI-driven insights directly within secure environments, minimizing data risk, cost, and latency.

“Edge AI bridges the gap between innovation and regulatory integrity,” stated Lorenzo Romano, Head of M&A and Strategic Development at Diginex. “By combining Diginex’s regulatory expertise with Kindred’s local AI architecture, we aim to set a new benchmark for how AI will enhance both performance and compliance in the years ahead.”

A Strategic Milestone in Diginex’s Growth Journey

The proposed acquisition of Kindred underscores Diginex’s vision to become the global platform for Regulatory Technology powered by responsible AI, helping organizations capture, verify, and act on any data with confidence.

Kindred’s “H1 Edge AI platform” , which is designed for predictive learning, healthcare, and industrial automation, will be integrated into Diginex’s product suite to create an intelligent, privacy-preserving operating layer across Diginex’s compliance and ESG solutions.

Once Kindred’s H1 Edge AI technology is integrated, the Diginex platform will empower organizations to:

Run AI models locally to analyze ESG, risk, and any operational data without exposing sensitive information to external third party platforms or data centers

Unlock real-time compliance intelligence that continuously evolves with changing regulations on data privacy

Advance sustainability goals by reducing dependence on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures.

Why it Matters

This proposed acquisition of Kindred will strengthen Diginex’s innovation capacity and broadens its access to new markets and customer segments. By incorporating Kindred H1 Edge AI technology into its platform, Diginex aims to enhance its ability to scale responsibly and deliver long-term value to clients and shareholders, while strengthening trust and transparency with regulators.

The global Edge AI market size was estimated at USD 20.78 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 66.47 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 21.7% from 2025 to 2030. Accordingly, we believe Diginex is positioning itself to capture future opportunities as regulated industries increasingly demand privacy-first, AI-enabled compliance and ESG solutions.

The transaction contemplated by the MOU reflects Diginex’s continued commitment to advancing responsible innovation and long-term value creation.

[TITLE]UK's Starling signs software deal with Canada's Tangerine, plans 100 hires:
[TEXT]
LONDON :Starling Group has signed a 10-year agreement to upgrade core software at Tangerine, a Canadian digital bank owned by Bank of Nova Scotia, as the British-based bank continues its global expansion, Starling said on Tuesday.

The deal is the biggest yet for the British digital bank's Engine by Starling software services subsidiary, and will see Tangerine migrate its digital banking operations to Engine's cloud-based Software-as-a-Service platform.

The partnership follows Engine’s expansion into North America earlier this year, with new offices in Toronto and New York, and marks Engine's first North American client. The unit, separated from Starling Bank in 2022, already provides services to Salt Bank in Romania and AMP Bank GO in Australia.

As part of its latest expansion, Engine will hire more than 100 staff, a spokesperson told Reuters.

Starling, which has grown its customer base to 4.6 million in 2025 from 43,000 in 2017, is one of several British-based digital banks that saw explosive growth in the last decade but have battled to sustain revenue growth from traditional account services amid cut-throat competition.

Starling has focused in recent years on expanding its provision of software services to other banks around the world, diversifying its revenues in the process.

The lender's rapid rise has not come without setbacks, as Britain's financial watchdog last year fined Starling Bank 29 million pounds ($39 million) for lax financial crime controls.

Starling says it has since rectified the issues and invested in its governance.

Tangerine, previously known as ING Direct, was started in 1997 and has more than 2 million clients. It was rebranded after Scotiabank bought the business from Netherlands-based ING Groep in 2012 for C$3.1 billion ($2.2 billion).

Industry lobby CII on Sunday urged the government to establish a professionally managed India Development and Strategic Fund to finance the country's long-term growth , resilience, and secure critical economic interests abroad.India needs a twin-armed India Development and Strategic Fund (IDSF) to power growth and secure the country's strategic future, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said.Conceived as a national fund, IDSF would mobilise patient, long-horizon capital to build India's productive capacity at home and secure critical economic interests abroad, it added.CII believes that with disciplined design and funding, IDSF could, over the next two decades, build a managed corpus in the range of USD 1.3 to 2.6 trillion by 2047, comparable in ambition and credibility to the world's leading sovereign investors.The proposed capitalisation roadmap includes a modest initial budgetary allocation to establish credibility, followed by systematic channelling of a share of asset monetisation proceeds, from roads, transmission lines, ports, and spectrum, into the fund instead of one-time deficit reduction.Over time, a portion of the government's equity in select public sector enterprises could be transferred to the fund, turning these enterprises into instruments for India's global expansion rather than mere disinvestment candidates, it suggested.In addition, the fund could issue thematic instruments, such as infrastructure, green and diaspora bonds to mobilise long-term domestic and international savings, while co-investing with multilateral and bilateral partners.Once macroeconomic buffers are adequate, a calibrated allocation of a small portion of India's foreign exchange reserves could also be considered for overseas strategic acquisitions in areas like critical minerals and energy, CII stressed.Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, said the time has come for India to build its own enduring financial engine for development."India is entering a decisive window of opportunity. We are already among the world's largest economies, but to reach developed-economy status by 2047, we need structural, perpetual sources of long-term capital that go beyond the annual budget cycle."The India Development and Strategic Fund would be a sovereign-anchored, professionally managed instrument that invests in both national capacity and strategic security," he said.The CII's proposal is based on the recognition that India's growth ambitions in infrastructure, energy transition, manufacturing, technology, and human development will require funding at a scale that cannot be met by annual budgetary allocations alone.It believes the fund would help mobilise domestic and global savings and recycle national capital from mature assets into new productive capacity.Banerjee explained, "This is not

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Highlights High Demand for Blackwell Chips

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated on Saturday that his company is experiencing “tremendously high demand” for its latest Blackwell chips and is increasing its request for wafers from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to meet this need.

Huang told reporters at an event organized by TSMC in Hsinchu, “Nvidia doesn’t just make GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), we also make CPUs (Central Processing Units), networking, switches, so there are many chips associated with Blackwell.” TSMC CEO C.C. Wei confirmed that Huang had “asked for wafers,” but kept the exact number confidential.

“TSMC has been incredibly supportive on wafers,” Huang said during his fourth visit to Taiwan this year. He added, “Without TSMC, Nvidia would not be possible.” This emphasizes the vital partnership in the semiconductor supply chain.

According to Reuters, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization last October, prompting TSMC‘s Wei to call Huang the “$5 Trillion Man.” This milestone demonstrates Nvidia‘s impressive growth and market dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) and GPU industries. Investing in Nvidia has proven to be a lucrative choice for many.

[TITLE]Before spectrum goes under the hammer, telcos make an urgent plea:
[TEXT]
Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have called for sharply lowering the base price for the next spectrum auctions and extending the spectrum usage period to as long as 40 years. In submissions made to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the telecom operators said this is needed to ensure robust network expansion and accelerate 5G deployment.

The request, which comes ahead of the next spectrum auction likely early next year, reflects persistent concerns among operators that steep reserve prices are stifling investment, leaving valuable airwaves unsold, and ultimately undermining the government’s Digital India vision. Having cheaper airwaves is necessary to free up capital for network infrastructure, the telecom companies said.

“Excessively high reserve prices keep valuable spectrum idle and result in operators facing capacity and capital constraints," Rahul Vatts, chief regulatory officer of Bharti Airtel, stated in a submission to Trai. He said spectrum that remains unsold or underutilized due to inflated pricing is a "direct loss to the country," delaying network expansion and degrading service quality. By reducing costs, operators could redirect capital toward “network densification, faster 5G rollout, and wider rural coverage."

Spectrum represents a critical revenue stream for the government, which sets a base price and expects companies to bid higher. A premium over the reserve price translates into higher government revenue. However, aggressive bidding has eased since 2021, with most of the airwaves sold near reserve prices—a shift driven by industry consolidation, high base prices, and the financial burden of recent 5G rollouts.

Reliance Jio, India's largest telco by market share, urged Trai to recommend a reserve price set at 50% of the spectrum valuation, arguing that the current valuation of 70% is "too steep and not conducive of wider participation." Jio contended that this aggressive pricing prevents genuine price discovery and competition, leading instead to sales at or near the reserve floor.

Validity

Beyond pricing, operators have also called for extending the duration of using spectrum to 30 or 40 years from the current 20 years. They argue that a longer term provides greater policy stability, enhances business viability, and enables the sustained investments required for next-generation network technologies. The Union cabinet had previously approved increasing the tenure to 30 years in 2021 to infuse liquidity, but this was never implemented, with Jio noting that Trai's valuation had simply multiplied the 20-year price by 1.5, negating the intended financial benefit.

The industry's request runs contrary to the public stance of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal recently pushed back on the necessity of lower prices.

“I have not seen any TSP come to me saying that they are not using a respective spectrum because its pricing is high," Mittal told reporters last month, questioning how data prices remain low if spectrum acquisition costs are supposedly prohibitive. Mittal maintained that the timing of the next auction would be determined by the "appetite and the demand" among stakeholders. If the reserve prices are so high, how could data prices be so low, Mittal questioned.

Bharti Airtel also said that in future auctions, telcos should be allowed a payment moratorium of six years, followed by 14 equal annual installments. This is because any new network takes a time period of at least 4-5 years to monetize and huge upfront payments combined with short moratorium periods could cause significant financial strain on operators, according to Airtel.

Currently, operators can make full or part upfront payment for the spectrum within 10 days from issuing spectrum. They can also make an upfront payment equal to the installments of at least two years, with the balance payable in equal installments with applicable interest, within the 20-year spectrum holding period. Operators are also allowed to make payment for spectrum in 20 equal annual instalments.

Unsold spectrum

Trai is also looking into concerns raised by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), which flagged a lack of effective competition in previous auctions due to industry consolidation and the oversupply of unsold airwaves. The DoT data shows over 12,000 MHz of traditional band spectrum remains unsold. In an effort to mitigate this issue, Trai has sought comments on potentially allowing other entities—such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or large connected device network operators—to bid for spectrum alongside wireless carriers.

The telecom carriers uniformly opposed this proposal. Vodafone Idea stated that allowing non-traditional bidders would "impact the robustness of the licensing framework" and create "huge complications related to valuation," arguing it runs counter to the structure of the new Telecommunications Act 2023.

Operators also said that referring to the currently available spectrum inventory as an “over-supply" may not accurately reflect market realities. “Rather, this spectrum should be viewed as strategic reserve capacity intended to address future growth requirements and regional variations in demand," Bharti Airtel said.

A recent analysis by V.J. Christopher, wireless advisor at DoT, flagged that nearly 36% of the spectrum on auction since 2010 was cleared at the base price, and only 15.5% was sold at a premium.

Another grouse relates to the duration of using the spectrum.

Currently, spectrum is issued for a period of 20 years. The Union cabinet in 2021 recommended increasing it to 30 to ensure long-term policy stability, improve business viability, and facilitate sustained investment in advanced technologies. However, the move did not take off. Jio said this should have been implemented in 2022 itself but wasn't, due to what it called Trai’s "aggressive valuation".

While the three carriers agree on the need for cheaper spectrum, they are divided on auctioning some new bands.

Reliance Jio is advocating for a comprehensive release strategy, urging that all nationally and globally identified International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) bands be auctioned immediately to ensure policy predictability and accelerate 6G readiness. Specifically, Jio wants the entire 6 GHz band to be auctioned now, with payment obligations kicking in only when the full band becomes available in 2030.

Bharti Airtel, is opposed to the plan. The company wants the auction of new bands like 600 MHz and parts of 6 GHz to be deferred for approximately two years. Airtel cited unresolved technical conflicts and the current "early stage" of the device and network ecosystem for both bands, suggesting that a premature auction would lead to underutilization.

The operators also requested the government to relax minimum rollout obligations, designed to ensure the swift deployment of purchased spectrum. Airtel highlighted the difficulty in meeting these commitments for the 26 GHz band, citing limited device compatibility and chipset constraints, and requested an extension to avoid financial penalties. The debate underscores a critical tension between the government’s desire for revenue maximization and the industry’s need for capital efficiency to fund the massive investment required for a true, nationwide 5G transformation.

[TITLE]Underwater cables are a vital piece of the AI buildout and internet — investment is booming:
[TEXT]
Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables. These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world. The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850. The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it. "
