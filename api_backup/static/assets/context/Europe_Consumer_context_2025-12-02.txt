[TITLE]The $50 billion burgeoning sector betting on your nostalgia for classic American brands:
[TEXT]
Also under the ABG umbrella are investments in the name, image, and likeness rights of various boldface names, including soccer superstar David Beckham and basketball great Shaquille O’Neal. ABG also owns the names and likenesses of long-deceased icons including Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, and Muhammad Ali.

The cherished American retail names now owned by these companies make a long list: WHP owns Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us, Anne Klein, Express, Bonobos, and Rag & Bone. Marquee owns the revamped Martha Stewart brand, BCBG, Laura Ashley, and Isotoner. ABG, the largest player in this space, owns a vast empire of more than 50 brands, including Eddie Bauer, Champion, and Reebok.

Dockers followed a well-trodden path, and one that many iconic brands have taken in recent years. Brand management companies including ABG, WHP Global, and Marquee Brands have assembled portfolios that include dozens of household-name brands. These companies have emerged as the new power brokers in fashion and retail, raking in some $50 billion in sales globally each year.

The Dockers pocket predicament—which some dismiss as an imagined problem—predates ABG’s ownership. But it shows the peril of a 1.5-inch difference—that razor’s edge between a loyal customer and one who abandons a product or company. Even the most beloved brands can become vulnerable following perceived changes or quality erosion that upset passionate consumers—and when heritage brands are purchased by holding companies like ABG, which seek to optimize and grow the brands globally, that passion can be a double-edged sword.

Levi Strauss is actually no longer the parent company of Dockers; in May it sold the label to brand ownership giant Authentic Brands Group (ABG) for an initial value of $311 million, with the potential to reach $391 million based on performance under Authentic’s ownership. (ABG declined to comment on the Dockers brand or its pocket measurements.)

By IwearPants’ measurement, the pockets on his new Dockers are 1.5 inches less deep than his old pair. And he made a plea: “If Dockers (or parent Levi Strauss) needs to raise the price by a couple of bucks per pair, so be it. Just give me back deep pants pockets on my Dockers.”

[TITLE]Khaite and Yagi Tsusho Form Joint Venture for Japan:
[TEXT]
LAND OF THE RISING SUN: Khaite is headed to Japan. The New York designer brand has teamed with Yagi Tsusho Ltd. to form Khaite Japan Corp., a joint venture that marks the beginning of a long-term strategic partnership.

Yagi Tsusho will formally launch Khaite in the Japanese market for the fall season next year.

“Japan represents both a pivotal and natural progression for Khaite,” said Brigitte Kleine, chief executive officer of the company. “In Yagi Tsusho, we have found a partner whose heritage, expertise, and deep relationships within the Japanese market align seamlessly with our commitment to unique storytelling, craftsmanship and quality.”

Yagi Tsusho, who founded the Japanese company in 1946, called Khaite “one of the most promising fashion brands.”

Yagi Tsusho started off in Osaka and Tokyo, but has built a global presence with offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia. It also has a joint venture with Moncler and owns the European fashion brand Mackintosh. Through the joint venture, Yagi Tsusho will use its local operational expertise and relationships to introduce Khaite in key retail and digital channels in Japan.

Creative director Catherine Holstein founded Khaite in 2016 and quickly carved out a niche — gaining recognition with luxe shoppers, as well as awards and investment.

Holstein won the CFDA’s American Womenswear Designer of the Year award in both 2022 and 2023.

In 2023, Khaite sold a stake to New York growth equity firm Stripes, where Kleine — who helped take Tory Burch from one store to $1.2 billion in sales as president — is an operating partner.

[TITLE]U.K. Retail Industry Finds Little Cheer in Labour Government’s Latest Budget:
[TEXT]
LONDON — Retail, beauty and luxury organizations reacted with dismay to the 2025 budget delivered by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves on Wednesday and accused the government of failing, once again, to support business.

Although Reeves kept the Labour party’s electoral promise of not raising income tax, she instead offered a package laden with loads of other taxes that will hit middle-earners, homeowners, businesses, employees and tourist-dependent industries such as retail and hospitality.

The government announced plans to freeze income tax thresholds, meaning that more people will be dragged into higher brackets as their salaries increase.

It will also slap extra taxes on employees’ pension contributions, and the funds that employers pay into pension pots, and jack up the National Living Wage for workers, and the minimum wage for teenagers, putting further pressure on employers.

Selfridges is among the larger stores that will continue to be impacted by soaring business taxes in the U.K. David Parry/Courtesy

Reeves is also giving local mayors across the country powers to impose a “tourist tax” on overnight stays. She has largely preserved the stiff taxes that companies pay on their physical stores, hotels and other brick-and-mortar properties, especially in the big cities.

That “business rates” tax has long been a bone of contention here, with companies accusing government of de facto favoring online retailers over physical stores. Under Reeves’ new proposals, some businesses with smaller premises will be eligible for lower tax rates.

Helen Brocklebank, chief executive officer of U.K. luxury lobby Walpole, called the budget “a missed opportunity. Instead of introducing measures that would boost growth and help businesses thrive, the Chancellor chose the opposite.”

She said Britain’s 81 billion pound luxury sector “remains a resilient driver of growth for the U.K. economy and supports 454,000 jobs across the country. Luxury businesses want to invest and grow, but this budget missed its chance to support this agenda. Large luxury retailers now face higher business rates, while hospitality faces a double whammy of business rates and a tourist tax.”

[TITLE]Top consumer watchdog fines JioMart over risky walkie-talkie listings:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India's top consumer watchdog has held Reliance JioMart guilty of misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices by allowing the sale of uncertified walkie-talkies on its platform, government officials aware of the matter said, in a first such action against an e-commerce portal.

Accordingly, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹100,000 and directed JioMart to ensure that no walkie-talkies or any product requiring statutory approval is listed without full compliance with applicable laws. A compliance report has to be filed within 15 days.

The CCPA order of 21 November, reviewed by Mint, follows a months-long inquiry that began in May, when the regulator issued notices to several e-commerce platforms over illegal sales of wireless devices operating in restricted frequency bands - or radio frequencies that are reserved for emergency services like police, or ambulance communication, defence services, or aviation. Any interference with these airwaves can disrupt essential services, and also potentially raise national security concerns.

During its inquiry, the authority found that JioMart had listed walkie-talkie models without disclosing crucial information such as operating frequency, licensing requirements or proof of Equipment Type Approval (ETA) from the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing of the Department of Telecommunications.

The ETA certifies that a wireless device uses only those radio frequencies that are legally permissible in India and follows the technical standards set by the government.

May mislead buyers

The omission by JioMart could mislead buyers into assuming the devices were legal for unrestricted use, violating consumer rights under the Consumer Protection Act, particularly the right to be informed

[TITLE]Prices increase as Americans prepare for Thanksgiving:
[TEXT]
Despite White House claims, prices on key staples are on the rise, including cranberry sauce and potatoes.

It’s a Thanksgiving tradition for many families in the United States: heading to retailers like Walmart to stock up on cranberries, sweet potatoes and – la piece de resistance – a cult classic, the Butterball turkey.

But this year, Walmart’s annual Thanksgiving meal kit has become a flashpoint over questions of inflation and economic stability under US President Donald Trump.

The Trump administration has pointed to the cost of the Walmart kit as a sign that its economic policies are taming inflation. But experts say the story is more complicated than what packages of stuffing and tinned pumpkin can tell.

The retailer is advertising a lower price this year at $4 per person for 10 people compared with $7 per person for 8 people in 2024, a talking point the White House has embraced.

On Friday, Trump once again pointed that out: “We’ve got [prices] way down from last year,” Trump said while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. “Walmart said that Thanksgiving this year is exactly 25 percent less than last year.”

But the Bentonville, Arkansas–based retailer’s offer comes with caveats. The kit contains fewer items – 20 compared with 29 last year – and uses more generic products rather than name brands, a switch that typically lowers costs.

Companies like Walmart, Amazon and Kroger that offer Thanksgiving meal kits can shape what goes into their bundles and choose to absorb costs.

But official data actually suggests that prices are going up. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasts suggest turkey prices will be

[TEXT]
Is it possible to live comfortably in retirement on Social Security income alone?

Yes and no.

Alden and Dena Swartz draw nearly $4,000 a month from Social Security, the government program designed to support Americans in retirement. And they are struggling.

Gail Randle and her partner, Mike DellaVolpe, collect only $2,400 a month in Social Security benefits: Not quite $30,000 a year. And they are doing all right.

“We are frugal people,” said Randle, 73. “Almost everything in our house is recycled. Used, you know? Thrifted. But it looks nice. Everything works.”

[TITLE]Venezuelan leader Maduro may seem desperate. But his loyalty vs punishment strategy is hard to crack:
[TEXT]
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — English phrases once bothered Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro so much that he urged his State of the Union address audience to phase out words like skatepark and fashion.

But as the White House now ponders whether the U.S. military should strike Venezuela, Maduro is embracing English, singing John Lennon’s Imagine, advocating for peace and dancing to a remix of his latest English catchphrase, “No War, Yes Peace.”

While his turnaround is seen as a sign of desperation by supporters of Venezuela’s political opposition, whose leaders have repeatedly told their backers in Washington that the threat of military action would crack Maduro’s inner circle, months of pressure have yet to produce defections or a government transition.

Loyalty vs. punishment

Behind this knack for staying in power is a system that punishes disloyal associates harshly and allows loyal ministers, justices, military leaders and other officials to enrich themselves.

“The Bolivarian Revolution possesses a remarkable ability: the capacity for cohesion in the face of external pressure,” Ronal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuela Observatory in Colombia’s Universidad del Rosario, said referring to the political movement, also known as Chavismo, that Maduro inherited from the late President Hugo Chávez. “When pressure comes from abroad, they manage to unite, defend and protect themselves."

Underpinning the loyalty-or-punishment principle are corruption networks blessed by Chávez and Maduro that give the loyal permission to get richer. The policy has vexed previous efforts to unseat Maduro and has helped him and his close associates to skirt economic sanctions, obtain U.S. presidential pardons and claim an electoral victory they resoundingly lost.

Rodríguez explained that prison and torture can be part of the punishment, which is usually harsher for accused wrongdoers with military affiliation. The strategy has been crucial for an authoritarian Maduro to keep control of the military, which he lets traffic drugs, oil, wildlife and myriad goods in exchange for coup-proof barracks.

“This has been a very effective tool because Chavismo has always been able to eliminate those actors who at some point try to rise up, and it has been able to expose corrupt practices from all sorts of actors,” Rodríguez said.

Military stands by Maduro

Venezuela’s political opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, had banked on the military’s support to dislodge Maduro after credible evidence showed that he lost the 2024 presidential election. But Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López and other military leaders stood by Maduro, just like they did in 2019 during a barracks revolt by a cadre of soldiers who swore loyalty to Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognized at the time by the first Trump administration as Venezuela’s rightful leader.

Since returning to office, U.S. President Donald Trump has increased the pressure on Maduro and his allies, including by doubling to $50 million the reward for information that leads to his arrest on narcoterrorism charges. A 2020 indictment accused Maduro of leading the Cartel de los Soles, which the U.S. State Department on Monday designated as a foreign terrorist organization.

Maduro denies the accusations.

On Saturday, Trump said that the airspace “above and surrounding” the South American country should be considered as “closed in its entirety." Maduro's government responded by accusing Trump of making a ”colonial threat,” rallying supporters behind what it called an assault on national sovereignty.

Suspected drug boats bombed

In early September, the U.S. military began blowing up boats that the Trump administration has accused of transporting drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing more than 80 people.

Many, including Maduro himself, see the U.S. military moves as an effort to end Chavismo’s hold on power. The opposition only added to this perception by reigniting its promise to remove Maduro from office.

Two weeks after the first boat strike, Chavismo’s loyalty was tested directly when Maduro’s pilot rebuffed efforts from the U.S. to join a plot to capture the Venezuelan leader and deliver him into custody to face the charges.

“We Venezuelans are cut from a different cloth,” Bitner Villegas, a member of the elite presidential honor guard, wrote to a retired U.S. officer trying to recruit him. “The last thing we are is traitors.”

On Tuesday, ruling party supporters marched in Caracas to demonstrate what they described as the “anti-imperialist spirit” of Chavismo. The march ended in a ceremony in which Maduro raised a jeweled sword that belonged to South American independence hero Simón Bolívar and guided attendees, including Cabinet ministers, to swear in God’s name to defend peace and freedom.

Susan Shirk, a research professor at the University of California, San Diego, said authoritarian leaders have a “fetish for unity” and like public displays of loyalty to prevent splits among leadership and social upheaval. She explained that division can lead people to believe that the risk of protesting has lessened.

‘We have to remain united’

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the designation of Cartel de los Soles provides Trump with additional options for dealing with Maduro. Hegseth hasn't provided details on those options, but administration officials have signaled that they have trouble seeing a situation in which Maduro is still in power as an acceptable endgame.

Advertisement Advertisement

David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for more than three decades, said that only people who don't understand Chavismo would think that a show of force will cause a government change.

“This is exactly the type of thing that unifies them,” Smilde said of the deployment of U.S. military forces. “They also talk

[TITLE]Do your research before giving in to ‘Travel Tuesday’ temptations:
[TEXT]
Chain stores have Black Friday. Online marketplaces have Cyber Monday. For local businesses, it’s Small Business Saturday.

In the last 20 years, more segments of the retail industry have vied for their own piece of the holiday shopping season. The travel trade has firmly joined the trend with another post-Thanksgiving sales push: Travel Tuesday.

On the same day as the nonprofit world’s Giving Tuesday, airlines, hotels, cruise ship companies, travel booking platforms and tour operators get in on the annual spirit to spend by promoting one-day deals. Consumer advocates say there are legitimate savings to be had but also chances to be misled by marketing that conveys a false sense of urgency.

“People see ‘40 percent off’ and assume it’s a once-in-a-lifetime steal, without recognizing that the underlying price may have been inflated or that the same itinerary was cheaper last month.” Sally French, a travel expert at personal finance site NerdWallet, said.

She and other seasoned travelers advised consumers who want to see if they can save money by booking trips on Travel Tuesday to do research in advance and to pay especially close attention to the fine print attached to offers.

People hoping to score last-minute deals for Christmas or New Year’s should double-check for blackout dates or other restrictions, recommended Lindsay Schwimer, a consumer expert for the online travel site Hopper.

It’s also wise to to keep an eye out for nonrefundable fares, resort fees, double occupancy requirements or upgrade conditions that may be hidden within advertised discounts, according to French.

Shoppers should be wary of travel packages with extra transportation options or add-on offers, French said. Instead of lowering fares or room rates, some companies use statement credits, extra points, included amenities and bundled extras as a way to tempt potential customers, she said.

“Many travel brands want to keep sticker prices high to maintain an aura of luxury, but they still need to fill planes, ships and hotel rooms,” French said. “Add-on perks are their workaround.”

Consumers who are prepared rather than impulsive and on the lookout for the up-sell are in a much better position to identify authentic bargains, consumer experts stressed. Knowing what a specific trip would typically cost and comparison shopping can help expose offers based on inflated underlying costs and whether the same itinerary might have been cheaper at other times, they said.

“Compare prices, check your calendar and make sure the trip you’re booking is something you genuinely want, not something you bought because a countdown timer pressured you,” French said. “What gets glossed over is that the best deal might be not booking anything at all if it doesn’t align with your plans.”
