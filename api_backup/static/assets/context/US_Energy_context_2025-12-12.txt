[TITLE]TotalEnergies in deal for Namibia offshore oil field:
[TEXT]
TotalEnergies will join Portuguese firm Galp to operate Namibia's Mopane oil field, which could contain at least 10 billion barrels, according to estimates - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP Andrew Harnik

TotalEnergies said Tuesday it had reached a deal to become a partner in the Mopane oil field off the coast of Namibia, where exploration remains underway.

The deal with Galp will see TotalEnergies joining the Portuguese firm as an operator as more exploration wells are drilled in view to develop the field for production.

“The transaction positions TotalEnergies as the operator of the two largest oil discoveries in Namibia and opens the way for the development of a major producing hub, generating long-term value for the country and partners,” the French firm said in a statement.

Galp said last year it estimated the Mopane field could contain at least 10 billion barrels of oil.

The deal will see TotalEnergies take a 40 percent stake in the petroleum exploration licence that includes Mopane. Galp will retain a 40 percent stake, alongside the Namibian national oil company Namcor and private firm Custos, which each hold 10 percent stakes.

In exchange, TotalEnergies will finance half of Galp’s capital expenditures for exploration and appraisal of the Mopane field, as well as initial development, with repayment to come from future cash flows from the project.

Galp will also get a 10 percent stake in the nearby Venus exploration zone, where TotalEnergies has discovered oil.

TotalEnergies said it hopes to make a final investment decision on whether to develop production at Venus next year.

TotalEnergies shares were up 0.4 percent in afternoon trading on the Paris stock exchange, where the blue-chip CAC 40 index was down 0.6 percent.

[TITLE]Atlantica Closes the Acquisition of Statkraft's Renewable Energy Platform in Canada:
[TEXT]
December 10, 2025 – Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure today announced it completed the previously announced acquisition of a Canadian renewable energy platform, marking an important milestone in the Company’s growth strategy in North America.

The platform includes 236 MW in operation and a 0.6 GW pipeline of renewable and storage projects and a small team of experienced employees who have joined Atlantica. This acquisition expands Atlantica’s presence in the Canadian market and strengthens its position in the broader North American renewables sector.

The operating portfolio includes a 51% stake in l’Érable, a 100 MW wind facility in Quebec, in operation since 2013, and a 136 MW wind asset in Alberta that began operations in early 2025. Both assets are backed by long-term PPAs with investment-grade counterparties, with an average remaining contract life of approximately 13 years. The platform also adds approximately 0.6 GW of solar, wind, and storage projects under development across several Canadian provinces, further strengthening Atlantica’s position in Canada.

In addition, Atlantica successfully closed the project financing of Winnifred with National Bank of Canada.

Santiago Seage, Atlantica’s CEO, said: “This transaction is a key step in our North American growth strategy. We are pleased to welcome the new team members to Atlantica. The integration of this experienced local team will complement our existing Canadian operations and enhance our capabilities to capture future growth opportunities across the region”. Santiago added: “This acquisition significantly expands our presence in a core market with attractive growth prospects.”

Atlantica previously announced in August 2025 that it had signed an agreement to acquire this platform. Following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the transaction has now successfully closed.

About Atlantica

Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure Ltd. is a sustainable infrastructure company that owns a diversified portfolio of contracted renewable energy, storage, efficient natural gas, electric transmission, and water assets in North America, Europe, and South America (www.atlantica.com).

[TITLE]NextEra Is Doubling Down on Data Centers for Big Tech. Should You Buy NEE Stock Here?:
[TEXT]
Trust the Trump administration and the current AI megatrend to compel the largest developer of renewable energy in the United States to base its future capex plans around nuclear, fossil fuels, and data centers. That is precisely what is happening with NextEra Energy (NEE). The Florida-based renewable energy major is looking to develop 15 gigawatts of new power generation capabilities for data centers by 2035. And CEO John Ketchum deems it to be just a “conservative” target, commenting, “Quite frankly, based on what we’re seeing today, we’ll be disappointed if we don’t do more,” as he outlined ambitions to build 30 gigawatts of capacity by 2035.

Google and Meta Partnerships

To that end, NextEra has recently penned some significant partnerships with two of the biggest hyperscalers in the world: Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META).

While in the partnership with Alphabet, NextEra and the former's unit, Google Cloud, have agreed to collaborate to build multiple new gigawatt-scale data center campuses across the U.S., and NextEra has secured

[TITLE]Shocked by your electric bill? 3 reasons costs are rising:
[TEXT]
Electricity prices have been on a roller coaster in the last few years, and at the moment they’re climbing — just in time for the start of winter.

Nationally, residential electricity prices rose 10.5% between January and August of this year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). That’s more than three times the annual rate of overall inflation.

But the national average hides a lot of regional variation. While three states actually saw electricity prices drop in that nine-month period, nine states saw an increase of more than 20% — topped by Missouri at 37.4% and North Dakota at 30.3%. Another 19 states saw increases between 10% and 20%.

The chance that prices are going to level out soon is slim, even as energy affordability becomes a hot-button political issue.

U.S. electricity providers are for-profit companies that are tightly regulated by state public utility commissions. In the first nine months of this year, utilities proposed and received authorization for $34 billion in rate increases — more than double the $16 billion during the same period last year, according to Powerlines, a nonprofit that focuses on regulatory and other issues affecting the U.S. power grid.

What’s causing the rise in electricity prices?

In an interview with NerdWallet, Charles Hua, founder and executive director of Powerlines, listed some of the primary causes of electricity inflation.

1. An aging power grid

“Our poles and wires are aging. It costs a lot of money to just replace that infrastructure,” Hua says. “And some of that is just because the poles and wires in your backyard are just reaching the end of their useful life.”

At the same time, energy demand is rising thanks to the AI boom and other factors. Hua notes that there are proven ways to make our current energy grid more efficient without going on a building spree — but that’s not how utilities are incentivized.

[TITLE]More data centers are coming to Colorado, demanding more power than they’ll need. Will customers foot the bill?:
[TEXT]
The data centers are coming. The question is how many will there be and who will pay for the power and transmission they need?

In Colorado and across the country utilities are beginning to take steps — mainly through special tariffs for large-load customers — to try to answer both questions and in doing so protect consumers.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission is requiring Xcel Energy, the state’s largest electricity provider, to use a set of “principles” when negotiating with data center developers, including upfront fees, 15-year contracts, minimum bills, security deposits and early-exit fees.

The Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the wholesale power provider for electric cooperatives in four states including 15 in Colorado, is also developing a “large-load tariff” with similar protections.

The PUC also directed Xcel Energy to file a proposal for a large-load tariff in January that will be more binding than the principles, which are negotiating points.

What is happening in Colorado is part of a trend as at least 36 utilities — from Dominion Energy in Virginia to Wisconsin Electric Power to Arizona Public Service — have adopted large-load tariffs.

And while these tariffs are a start, consumer advocates and industry analysts caution that they may not completely protect residential and small commercial customers from data center-related costs.

“They do get rid of stranded costs and help with ratepayer burden,” said Sarp Ozkan, a vice president at the energy analytics firm Enverus. “They also do get rid of a lot more of the speculative projects, which we know has been a big driver of the expected volumes.”

“So, I think, these tariffs are heading in the right direction,” Ozkan said.

One basic problem is that data center projects are filing for more power than they will ultimately need and filing the same project with multiple utilities — “site shopping” — to find where they can connect to the grid most quickly.
