[TITLE]Toyota CEO goes full MAGA at NASCAR event as carmaker unveils $912M investment in US manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Toyota on Tuesday unveiled a $912 million investment in US manufacturing, days after CEO Akio Toyoda hosted a red, white and blue NASCAR event in Japan while sporting a Trump-Vance shirt and red MAGA hat.

The Sunday spectacle at Toyota’s Fuji Speedway featured top drivers, a crowd waving American flags and an appearance from US Ambassador to Japan George Glass, according to Automotive News.

The top Toyota exec nodded to recent US-Japan trade tensions during his bold display of pro-Trump sentiment.

“I’m not here to argue whether tariffs are good or bad. Every national leader wants to protect their own industry,” Toyoda said ahead of the endurance race.

“We are exploring ways to make tariffs a winner for everyone. The people we want most to be winners are our customers.”

Japan is facing a roughly 15% baseline tariff on auto imports, slashed down from 27.5% as part of a trade agreement in September.

“Start your engines!” Glass’ account tweeted Sunday alongside pics of him and Toyoda, who’s the grandson of Toyota Motors founder Kiichiro Toyoda. “Looking forward to celebrating the culture of [US] motorsports again next year” as part of America’s 250th-anniversary festivities in Japan, he added.

Toyota, the second-largest seller of new vehicles in the US behind General Motors, on Tuesday announced its nearly $1 billion investment will ramp up hybrid vehicle production across the Southern US.

It’s part of a previously announced plan by the Japanese automaker to invest up to $10 billion in the US by 2030, which President Trump revealed last month. Most of the investments are expected to be completed by 2027.

Toyota already leads hybrid vehicle production with more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data.

But the company is looking to further increase manufacturing of hybrid-compatible engines and vehicles at certain American facilities.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our US manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president of manufacturing operations, said in a statement.

“Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our US footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”

Of the investments announced Tuesday, the largest is $453 million toward Toyota’s Buffalo, W. Va., plant to ramp up the assembly of four-cylinder, hybrid-compatible engines.

Another $204.4 million is going toward the automaker’s Georgetown, Ky., plant to increase production of the same engines.

Toyota says it is also sending $125 million to expand production of Corolla vehicles and add hybrid vehicle production at its Blue Springs, Miss., factory.

The automaker is also investing $71.4 million in its Jackson, Tenn., plant and $57.1 million in its Troy, Mo., facility.

The investments are expected to create 252 new jobs, according to Toyota.

[TITLE]Trump Touts Manufacturing Jobs Created by Saudi Investment:
[TEXT]
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced that his country will increase its U.S. investment from $600 billion to almost $1 trillion.

The White House highlighted at an event Tuesday an American factory leader who thanked President Donald Trump and the crown prince for an increase in thousands of manufacturing jobs as a result of the investment.

David Broomell of Marlton, New Jersey, is the factory leader at GE Vernova for three factories critical to producing the world’s most advanced and reliable gas turbines in America. Broomell oversees facilities in Parsippany, New Jersey, and Allentown, Pennsylvania.

“David shared a powerful story of how these historic foreign investments secured by President Trump are GOOD deals for the American people that are improving lives and fueling new opportunities,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told The Daily Signal. “President Trump is putting America First by creating good-paying jobs, improving our economy, and ensuring the world’s biggest companies invest directly in our communities.”

GE Vernova announced in May during Trump’s state visit to Saudi Arabia it would export gas turbines and energy solutions worth up to $14.2 billion to Saudi Arabia.

“If you look at the landscape for GE Vernova investment, over $750 million in the U.S. focused on true manufacturing jobs here stateside,” Broomell said at the White House event. “We’re looking at tripling the output of our Greenville, South Carolina, facility, where we make the gas turbines that are supporting U.S. needs as well as the Saudi Arabia needs.”

David Broomwell, Manufacturing Technology Manager at energy equipment manufacturer GE Vernova, discusses what the Saudi investment in the United States means for American jobs:

"We're looking at tripling the output of our Greenville, South Carolina facility where we make the gas… pic.twitter.com/2SRMYMnQXd — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) November 18, 2025

Broomell said $300 million in gas investment resulted in over 500 pieces of new equipment being installed in the Greenville facility. On May 14, GE Vernova announced initiatives worth up to $14.2 billion during the state visit to accelerate Saudi Arabia’s energy transition with U.S. technology and expertise.

“That translates into roughly 1,800 jobs across the board for GE Vernova, as we try to scale capacity to be able to meet this demand,” he said. “Along with that, we’re partnering with local communities to build the skill set that’s required to meet these capacity needs. So that talent pipeline is incredibly important. So it’s real jobs in the manufacturing space.”

Thanks to Broomell, GE Vernova is on track to triple the capacity of the turbines produced in America since the inauguration, a White House official said.

[TITLE]Jim Cramer Says “Capital One Discover Has Got Really Fabulous Scale”:
[TEXT]
Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently offered insights on. Cramer showed optimism around the company’s acquisition of Discover, as he stated:

“I still like Capital One, COF, for its acquisition of Discover, a credit card company that gives them the edge at the register, because it’s cheaper for merchants to use Capital One Discover than Visa or MasterCard. The stock sells at 10 times earnings even as the company has about 160 million cards in circulation. Block, the old Square that we talked to last night, it has around 57 million Cash App users, and it sells for about 25 times earnings. That doesn’t make sense to me.

[TITLE]Capital inflow into Hong Kong continues: financial secretary:
[TEXT]
HONG KONG, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- Global investors continued to funnel capital into Hong Kong as they diversify their portfolios to hedge against geopolitical risks, Paul Chan, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, said on Sunday.

Global investors have found a safe haven in Hong Kong, said Chan, citing a 10 percent year-on-year growth of total deposits in the city's bank so far this year.

Other indications of global investors' liking to Hong Kong included world-leading total value of initial public offerings (IPOs), zippy expansion of the wealth management sector and ever-deepening financial cooperation with other markets in the world, according to Chan.

Chan also noted that Hong Kong registered an 11.3 percent growth in goods export in the first three quarters thanks to closer economic and trade ties with ASEAN countries and other countries in the Global South.

To keep up the momentum, Chan said the HKSAR government will work to upgrade the city's shipping industry and play up its strengths as a shipping center and a hub for mega events.

[TITLE]Some 42% of $200,000 Earners Avoid Checking Their Bank Accounts Due To Stress — And Half Say They'd Need Double Their Income To Feel Secure:
[TEXT]
Anyone who has ever stared at a card reader and silently begged for an approval knows that knot-in-the-stomach feeling. That reaction is usually blamed on tight budgets, but new research shows even households earning $200,000 a year are dodging their banking apps because the numbers on the screen feel stressful, not soothing.

According to new research from The Harris Poll, 40% of six-figure earners say they have avoided checking their account balance to reduce stress, and that share jumps to 42% among those earning $200,000 or more. Nearly half of people in this group also say they struggle with financial anxiety, and a majority feel guilty complaining

Ukrainian, US and European officials met in Geneva on Sunday to discuss a draft plan presented by Washington to end the war in Ukraine, after Kyiv and its allies voiced alarm over what they saw as major concessions to the aggressor Russia.

US President Donald Trump, who has championed the 28-point plan, said on Sunday that Ukraine had not been grateful for American efforts over the war, even as US weapons continue to flow to Kyiv via NATO and Europe keeps buying Russian oil.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday he had made good progress in talks discussing the draft US plan to end the war in Ukraine as he met with a Ukrainian delegation in Geneva.

"So I think the takeaway from it is, I think this is a very, very meaningful, I would say, probably best meeting and day we've had so far in this entire process, going back to when we first came to office in January," Rubio told reporters.

Talks in Geneva are continuing.

On Friday, Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had until Thursday to approve the plan, which calls on Ukraine to cede territory, accept limits on its military and renounce ambitions to join NATO.

For many Ukrainians, including soldiers fighting on the front lines, such terms would amount to capitulation after nearly four years of fighting in Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two. On Saturday, Trump said the current proposal for ending the war is not his final offer.

With the US delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the main talks between US and Ukrainian officials got under way in Geneva on Sunday afternoon in a stiff atmosphere at the US mission, soon after Trump complained in a Truth Social post that Ukraine's leadership had shown "zero gratitude" to the US for its efforts and Europe continued to buy Russian oil.

Since the US plan was announced, there has been confusion

[TITLE]Why You're Paying More (Or Less) At Certain Gas Stations:
[TEXT]
Have you ever wondered why gas prices are so much higher in some states than in others? And we're not talking about a little bit higher. At the time of this writing, according to the AAA website, a gallon of gas in California costs on average $4.65, while it only costs $2.53 in Oklahoma. That's a difference of more than $2 per gallon. Why does Oklahoma get the special treatment? And why should Californians have to pay so much? Don't they have enough to deal with, like wildfires, mudslides, earthquakes, and the Kardashians?

As if that's not bad enough, gas prices can vary within the same state, or even the same town. We've saved over 10 cents a gallon on occasion just by driving down the road a few blocks. We've also seen that kind of price difference between gas stations that are just across the street from each other. What gives?

It turns out location is very important when it comes to gas prices. For one thing, each state has its own tax rate for gas, and some are very high, while others are much lower. When federal, state, and local taxes account for about 26% of the per gallon cost of gasoline, this can result in significant differences from state to state. Then there's the distance from the nearest refinery to the gas station. The farther it is, the higher the transportation cost. What about the difference in gas prices in the same town? Lots of factors go into that, like the cost to lease property in one location versus another, whether the brand of gasoline uses additives, and what deals the gas station owner has made with wholesalers.

[TITLE]United Construction Buys Queens Property From Madison Realty Capital for $64M – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
United Construction and Development Group, a prolific developer in Queens, has acquired an office and retail building in the borough’s Flushing neighborhood.

United Construction, run by Chris Jiashu Xu, purchased the three-story, 104,292-square-foot property at 41-60 Main Street from Madison Realty Capital for $64.25 million, according to the seller’s broker, JLL.

The building on the corner of Main Street and Sanford Avenue is fully occupied and hosts office tenants Capital One Bank, Preferred Bank and MassMutual Insurance. Retail tenants at the property include Chinese bakery Fay Da Bakery and JD Drug Store.

JLL’s Ethan Stanton, Michael Mazzara, Drew Isaacson and Brendan Maddigan brokered the deal for the seller, while no brokers represented the buyer.

Spokespeople for United Construction and Madison Realty Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Crain’s New York Business first reported the news.

News of the deal comes after Madison Realty Capital acquired the Flushing property in February 2024, as Commercial Observer previously reported.

Bankrupt developer Jeffrey Wu handed off the building to Madison Realty Capital — a creditor — for $80 million after filing a Chapter 11 petition in 2020 to initiate bankruptcy proceedings for his company, Flushing Landmark Realty. Madison Realty Capital had previously provided a $66 million bridge loan for Wu to refinance two Flushing properties in 2014.

It’s unclear what Xu intends to do with his new property, but the developer already has a lineup of projects planned for Queens.

Over the summer, Xu filed plans to build a 39-story, 387-unit residential tower at 23-07 43rd Avenue in Long Island City, as well as a two-tower, 630-unit residential property at 61-06 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park, Crain’s reported.

[TITLE]Cemtrex Enters into Agreement to Acquire Invocon, Adding Proven Aerospace & Defense Engineering Capabilities:
[TEXT]
Hauppauge, NY, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- - Cemtrex, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETX), a diversified industrial and technology company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Invocon, Inc., a Texas-based systems-engineering firm with a 40-year history designing, manufacturing, and supporting mission-critical instrumentation, wireless sensing systems, and flight hardware for aerospace, defense, and advanced government programs

Invocon’s technologies have been deployed across satellites, launch vehicles, target missiles, space shuttles, and the International Space Station, including 17 shuttle systems, 10 ISS systems, and numerous next-generation flight programs for major primes and government agencies.

Invocon also holds a deep intellectual property portfolio, including multiple U.S. patents related to hypervelocity impact detection, gridless lethality assessment, acoustic and RF sensing, and advanced flight-system telemetry. Invocon’s systems have been used in over 40 shuttle flights, over 30 target missile flights, and a range of high-reliability space and defense missions requiring precise sensing in extreme environments.

This acquisition represents a significant strategic expansion for Cemtrex, bringing in capabilities in high-reliability electronics, flight instrumentation, wireless data acquisition, lethality assessment systems, and complex system design, all supported by a long-standing and experienced engineering team.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cemtrex will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Invocon for $7.06 million, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close on or around January 1, 2026.

Cemtrex Chairman and CEO Saagar Govil commented, “Invocon brings nearly four decades of experience building flight-proven hardware and advanced sensing systems for some of the most demanding aerospace and defense applications. Their technologies have supported shuttle missions, ISS systems, target missiles, and major prime-led flight programs. This is a highly specialized engineering organization with capabilities that are extremely difficult to replicate, and it fits directly with our long-term strategy of expanding into high-reliability and mission-critical technologies.”

Govil continued, “This acquisition provides the foundation for Cemtrex’s new Aerospace & Defense segment and positions us to participate in a wider range of engineering programs that require precision, durability, and deep technical expertise. Invocon’s heritage in flight hardware, wireless telemetry, impact detection, and high-reliability electronics aligns with opportunities across traditional aerospace, defense modernization efforts, and emerging commercial-space markets over the long term.”

Following the closing, Cemtrex expects to establish a new reporting segment, Aerospace & Defense, with Invocon serving as the cornerstone for expanding into advanced engineering programs for government agencies, prime contractors, and next-generation commercial-space customers.
