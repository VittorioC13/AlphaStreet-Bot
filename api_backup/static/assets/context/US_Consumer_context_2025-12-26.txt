[TITLE]DJT Shares Jump on TAE Technologies Deal as Retail Investors Call It ‘Old School Penny Stock’:
[TEXT]
This post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them.

Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) surged on December 18 after announcing a $6 billion all-stock merger with fusion energy company TAE Technologies. But retail investors aren’t buying the hype. Reddit sentiment collapsed from 78 to just 22 out of 100 immediately following the announcement, with the main discussion thread on r/stocks drawing 972 upvotes and 164 skeptical comments.

24/7 Wall St.

The disconnect is striking. While the stock posted strong single-day performance, retail traders are treating the news with deep cynicism rather than celebration.

Reddit Calls It an “Old School Penny Stock”

The tone on Reddit tells the real story. User cheddarben, whose post received overwhelming support from the community, captured the prevailing sentiment:

In the post, cheddarben wrote: “Old school penny stock with bizarro news. I am sure it will be a wild ride.” The characterization of Trump Media as operating like a penny stock resonated widely with commenters expressing similar skepticism.

Top-voted comments echoed this skepticism. Reddit user Unlucky-Clock5230 commented: “This is the most obvious pump and dump I’ve ever seen. The fundamentals are absolutely terrible.” Reddit user techgeek72 added: “TAE has been ‘five years away’ from fusion for the last 27 years. This merger is a joke.” Reddit user InvestmentGrift questioned: “How is a social media company with declining revenue suddenly worth billions by merging with a fusion company that’s never produced commercial energy?”

Retail investors have legitimate concerns:

Trump Media trades at a staggering 797x price-to-sales ratio with just $3.68 million in trailing revenue

The company posted negative EBITDA of $175.8 million and a net loss of $54.8 million last quarter

Revenue declined 3.8% year-over-year, moving in the wrong direction

Technical indicators support the skepticism, with the stock showing high volatility and overbought conditions following the announcement.

Truth Social Meets Fusion Energy

Despite recent gains, Trump Media remains down significantly year-to-date. The stock hit a 52-week low of $10.18 just days ago and trades well below its $43.46 peak. TAE Technologies, founded in 1998, has raised $1.3 billion pursuing commercial fusion energy but has yet to demonstrate a working power plant. The merged company plans to break ground on a 50-megawatt facility in 2026, with co-CEOs Devin Nunes and Michl Binderbauer leading the venture. For investors watching peers, the broader market offers a stark contrast. The S&P 500 is up 15% year-to-date, highlighting the challenging performance of Trump Media stock.

[TITLE]Forman Capital Provides $37M Construction Financing for Houston-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Ferguson Family Partners has secured $37.1 million in construction financing to build The Oaks of District West, a 10-building mixed-use center outside of Houston, Texas, Commercial Observer can first report.

Forman Capital provided the construction loan, while Daniel Eidson of Concord Summit Capital arranged the transaction.

Scott Mehlman, chief investment officer and partner at Forman Capital, noted in a statement that the Richmond submarket of Houston, where The Oak of District West will be located, has experienced a surge in residential building in recent years, but retail has failed to keep pace.

“Our client is addressing a clear market gap, and the early leasing momentum speaks to both the strength of the location and the quality of the concept,” said Mehlman.

The open-air project is already 70 percent pre-leased in its 15 tenant spaces, even though construction is expected to last until the third quarter of 2027. Tenants include Pacific Coast Tacos, Virtual Golf Bar, Pecan Jack’s Ice Cream, and Picklr, a national indoor pickleball company.

Located at 21711 FM-1093 in Richmond, Texas, directly off the Westpark Tollway and South Peak Road, The Oaks of District West will span more than 87,000 square feet across 10 buildings on a site that sits 30 miles southwest of Downtown Houston.

Brett Forman, managing partner of Forman Capital, said in a statement that the new retail center will tap into the affluent residential community within the Richmond area.

“The Oaks of District West aligns directly with Forman Capital’s retail thesis of investing in necessity-driven centers in affluent residential markets,” he said.

[TITLE]Afrinvest Projects Naira at N1,431.06:
[TEXT]
Investment house Afrinvest has projected that the naira will trade at N1,431.06/$ in the new year.

This was contained in its 2025 Macroeconomic Review and 2026 Outlook, which was obtained by our correspondent on Tuesday.

The PUNCH reports that this projection is stronger than that of the Managing Director of Financial Derivatives, Bismarck Rewane, at the recently held Parthian Economic Discourse 2025. Rewane anticipated that the exchange rate would be around N1,450–N1,500/$ in 2026.

He said, “The inflation outlook for 2026 is around 12.7 per cent, rising to 15.3 per cent in 2027, before easing again (13.8 per cent in 2028). This is influenced by money supply growth, petrol and diesel price expectations, food inflation due to insecurity, and exchange rate pressures. We project the exchange rate around N1,450–N1,500/$ with some luck.”

Afrinvest, in its outlook, considered five methodologies, including the REER Model, MZM Model, M3/FX Reserves Model, FG’s budget benchmark, and the PPP Model, to arrive at its projection of N1,431.06/$.

Providing reasons for the projection, analysts at Afrinvest said, “Our outlook for the naira’s resilience in 2026 is underpinned by the following assumptions: the FG will formally align its CGT policy change with FPI expectations (a complete reversal to 10.0 per cent or a competitive range of 20.0–25.0 per cent) before implementation in January 2026. Crude oil production volatility is expected to skew upward in 2026, supported by improved security around oil assets and continued strategic investments by major domestic operators.

“Reduced speculation on the naira (notwithstanding the risk of pre-election spending) is anchored on the success of the CBN’s EFMES since its November 2024 launch. A lower import bill is also expected due to the growing domestic supply of PMS, related products, and fertilisers, which previously gulped

[TITLE]Christmas messages: Tinubu, govs preach unity, NLC rejects unfair taxation:
[TEXT]
As the Christian faithful mark the birth of Jesus Christ today, President Bola Tinubu and state governors have admonished Nigerians to embrace peace.

The President reaffirmed his commitment to religious tolerance, declaring that no Nigerian would be made to suffer or die because of their religious beliefs, just as the Nigeria Labour Congress demanded tax justice.

In his Christmas message to Nigerians released on Wednesday, the President stressed that religious tolerance remains a core national value that binds the country together despite its diversity.

“No one, regardless of ethnicity or belief, should be made to suffer for professing and practising his faith,” Tinubu said.

“The love for God and the love for humanity are at the heart of all great faiths. These shared values must continue to bind us together as one indivisible and resilient people of our blessed country,” he added in the message personally signed by him.

The message, Tinubu’s third Christmas address since assuming office in May 2023, comes amid renewed international scrutiny of Nigeria’s religious freedom record. Two months earlier, the United States government redesignated Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” for alleged severe violations of religious freedom.

On October 31, 2025, former US President Donald Trump announced the redesignation under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, claiming that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and alleging that “radical Islamists are responsible for mass killings.”

However, Tinubu reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Nigerians to worship freely.

“That commitment remains steadfast under God and the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. All Nigerians have the right to live, worship, and pursue their aspirations in safety and dignity,” he stated.

Tinubu, a Muslim married to a Christian wife, noted that since taking office in 2023, he has consistently reassured Nigerians of the government’s “unyielding commitment to safeguarding the security, unity, and stability of our nation.”

“As your President, I remain committed to doing everything within my power to enshrine religious freedom in Nigeria and to protect people of all faiths from violence,” he said.

The President revealed that he has engaged extensively with leaders of Nigeria’s two major faiths throughout the year, especially amid concerns over religious intolerance and insecurity.

“We will build on these conversations to strengthen collaboration between government and religious institutions, prevent conflict, and promote peaceful coexistence,” he said, describing religious freedom as “a core tenet of our collective identity.”

Tinubu also paid tribute to Nigerian Christians for their contributions to national development.

“As we celebrate the birth of Jesus, let us reflect on the immense contributions Christians have made and continue to make towards the progress of our country,” he said, noting that Christ’s message has inspired many to care for the vulnerable and less privileged.

The President described Christmas as a season of hope, reminding Nigerians that “despite daunting challenges, God is with us.”

He wished Christians in Nigeria and around the world a Merry Christmas and prayed for peace, particularly among people of different faiths. Tinubu also urged Nigerians travelling during the holidays to exercise patience and discipline on the roads, wishing them safe journeys. “With confidence in divine providence and our collective strength, we will continue building a greater Nigeria that future generations will be proud of,” he added.

Govs preach love

Delta State Governor, Sheriff Oborevwori, congratulated the state’s residents on the 2025 Christmas celebration, urging them to embrace love, unity and Christ-like living as foundations for peaceful coexistence and sustainable development.

In a message issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Festus Ahon, Oborevwori called on residents to reflect on the virtues of sacrifice, compassion and selfless service exemplified by Jesus Christ.

He commended Deltans for their resilience and unity, noting that their cooperation has been instrumental to the progress recorded under his administration’s MORE Agenda.

The governor highlighted achievements in infrastructure, healthcare, education, youth empowerment, agriculture and security, citing ongoing road and flyover projects, improved healthcare facilities and investments in human capital.

Oborevwori also noted improvements in workers’ welfare, peacebuilding initiatives and social intervention programmes for widows, women and youths. He disclosed that the 2026 Delta State budget prioritises infrastructure expansion, job creation, education, healthcare and agriculture.

“The 2026 budget consolidates our gains and addresses the pressing needs of our people,” he said, assuring that no community would be left behind.

Katsina State Governor, Mallam Dikko Radda, extended Christmas greetings to Christians in the state and across Nigeria, urging them to reflect on Christ’s teachings of love, sacrifice and peace.

In a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Ibrahim Mohammed, Radda emphasised unity and tolerance as essential for national progress, assuring Christians of his administration’s commitment to protecting their rights and ensuring freedom of worship.

Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, in a Christmas message issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, urged residents to draw strength from the Word of God, especially amid grief following the death of his deputy.

Quoting 2 Corinthians 12:9, Diri said God’s grace shines brightest in moments of weakness, urging Christians to celebrate Christmas with reverence, hope and modesty.

Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, described Christmas as a symbol of hope and redemption, urging citizens to practice love, unity and generosity despite economic and security challenges.

Ondo State Governor, Dr Lucky Aiyedatiwa, urged residents to uphold love, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, expressing optimism

[TITLE]Oyo Okays ₦290bn for Major Road Infrastructure Projects:
[TEXT]
The Oyo State Government on Wednesday approved ₦235 billion for the construction of the second lot of the Rashidi Adewolu Ladoja Circular Road, covering 39 kilometres.

The approval was announced by the state Commissioner for Public Works and Transport, Abdulmojeed Mogbonjubola, during the State Executive Council briefing held at the Governor’s Office, Secretariat, Ibadan.

PUNCH Online reports that residents affected by the project have staged a series of peaceful protests in recent months across Ibadan and its environs, leading to traffic gridlock and disruptions.

The protesters are from Ido, Lagelu, Ona Ara, Akinyele, Oluyole and Egbeda local government areas.

Mogbonjubola said, “The Seyi Makinde-led administration is committed to ensuring the completion of the second phase of the circular road with the approval of a sum of ₦235 billion.

“The 2nd Lot of the Circular Road measuring 39 kilometres will be completed within the next 18 months before the completion of his administration,” he stated.

The commissioner also disclosed that the council approved the rehabilitation of inner roads in Ogbomosho at a cost of ₦55 billion.

Also speaking, the Commissioner for Energy, Dahud Shangodoyin, said the council approved the installation of solar streetlights along the Orita-Aperin to Olorunsogo corridor for night-time illumination.

He added that backup energy projects, including solar and hybrid generators, were approved for Onipepeye and Odogbo Barracks at costs of ₦348 million and ₦231 million, respectively.

In separate briefings, the Commissioner for Health, Olorunserimi Ajetumobi, and the Commissioner for Lands, Housing and Urban Development, Williams Akin-Funmilayo, said the council also approved ₦389 million for the provision of beddings across the state’s 58 secondary healthcare facilities.

They further announced approval for the commencement of operations of the Ikara Farms Special Purpose Vehicle at Ilero in the Oke-Ogun area of the state by a private investor.

Akin-Funmilayo said the project is expected to generate about 100,000 direct and indirect jobs and significantly boost food production in the state.

[TITLE]Recap: Which online retailers filed for bankruptcy in 2025?:
[TEXT]
Some of the largest online retailers and companies that own consumer retail brands filed for bankruptcy in 2025.

At least seven retailers in the Top 2000 filed for bankruptcy in 2025, unveiling trends and challenges that led to their financial struggles. The Top 2000 refers to North America’s largest online retailers based on their annual ecommerce sales. And some of the largest retailers in the Top 2000 also operate physical stores that suffered in 2025.

They cited a mix of challenges. Consumers are buying less in stores and competitors have taken market share, some said. And macroeconomic factors, such as tariffs, played a key role as well.

Below are the seven largest online retailers in North America to file for bankruptcy in 2025. Parentheses beside their names indicate their ranking in the Top 2000 Database.

1. Hudson’s Bay Co. (No. 26)

The largest retailer in the Top 2000 to file bankruptcy in 2025 was the Canadian corporation Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBC). It filed for the Canadian equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. In June, it sold its intellectual property. Hudson’s Bay had purchased the retail brand Saks Incorporated in November 2013. Then, in 2021, it established Saks Fifth Avenue’s ecommerce business as a standalone company called Saks.

First revealed in July 2024, HBC sought to purchase Neiman Marcus Group (which it did in December that year for $2.7 billion). In doing so, it created an entity called Saks Global that brought together Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. Despite the merger, each retailer continued to operate independently under its existing brand name, according to the announcement.

In December 2024, retail investor Saks Global completed a $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group. That combined two major players in luxury retail under one corporate umbrella. The deal brought together Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman under the newly formed Saks Global. Despite the merger, each retailer will continue to operate independently under its existing brand name, according to the announcement.

Now, in December 2025, Saks is reportedly considering filing for its own bankruptcy.

2. Forever 21 (No. 109)

The parent company of Forever 21, F21 OpCo, announced in March that it had filed for bankruptcy. That marked Forever 21’s second bankruptcy in six years.

F1 OpCo operates Forever 21 stores and filed for Chapter 11 in Delaware. Upon filing for bankruptcy, the retailer began liquidation sales at all of its roughly 300 stores. The chain had reported that it projected its assets to be between $100 million and $500 million, with liabilities between $1 billion and $1o billion. The filing specifically pointed to rivals Temu and Shein as being factors in their demise.

“While we have evaluated all options to best position the Company for the future, we have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin, as well as rising costs, economic challenges impacting our core customers, and evolving consumer trends,” said Brad Sell — chief financial officer at F21 OpCo, which operates Forever 21 stores — at the time.

Prior to its bankruptcy filing, Forever 21 ranked No. 111 in the Top 2000. In addition, before the retailer’s bankruptcy filing, Digital Commerce 360 had projected that Forever 21’s online sales would reach $904.84 million in 2025.

3. Rite Aid (No. 128)

Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May. That marked its second bankruptcy filing in two years. In September 2024, Rite Aid had named a post-bankruptcy CEO.

It completed the 2025 bankruptcy process in October, when it had officially closed all stores. As of December 2025, RiteAid.com redirects to a site for customers to request records, including prescription and immunization history. It also has a button to help customers find a new pharmacy.

As part of the bankruptcy process, Rite Aid looked to sell its assets. It had announced that it had closed around 1,250 stores — all its remaining locations. Retail competitors that run pharmacies acquired prescription files and other assets from more than 1,000 former Rite Aid locations.

4. Joann (No. 300)

Joann Inc. had emerged from one bankruptcy process in 2024. Then, in January 2025, the crafting supplies retailer voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 protection once again. It sought to keep stores open as it looked for a new solution.

The company announced Jan. 15 that it began the bankruptcy process anew in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

“Since becoming a private company in April, the Board and management team have continued to execute on top- and bottom-line initiatives to manage costs and drive value,” said Michael Prendergast, interim chief executive officer at Joann, in the bankruptcy announcement. “However, the last several years have presented significant and lasting challenges in the retail environment, which, coupled with our current financial position and constrained inventory levels, forced us to take this step.”

In June 2025, Michaels acquired Joann intellectual property and its private-label brands.

5. Claire’s (No. 388)

Jewelry retailer Claire’s filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it announced in early August.

The filing was less than four years after the retailer went public and marked its second bankruptcy in seven years. Claire’s cited macroeconomic conditions.

CEO Chris Cramer said at the time that the decision was difficult but necessary.

“Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire’s and its stakeholders,” Cramer said.

Prior to its bankruptcy filing, Claire’s ranked No. 390 in the Top 2000. Also, before the retailer’s bankruptcy filing, Digital Commerce 360 had projected that Claire’s online sales would reach $201.02 million in 2025.

6. iRobot (No. 459)

The maker of Roomba robotic vacuums, iRobot Corp., filed in December for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

It agreed to sell the company to its primary contract manufacturer. Under the agreement, a company called Picea will acquire 100% of iRobot’s equity through a court-supervised process. Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co. Ltd. together comprise Picea.

To support ongoing operations, iRobot said it has filed customary motions allowing it to pay employees, vendors, and other creditors in the normal course of business. The company said supply chain relationships, logistics partners and global distribution will remain in place throughout the Chapter 11 process.

CEO Gary Cohen said the company intends for the transaction to provide financial stability while maintaining continuity for customers and partners.

“The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners,” Cohen said in a statement.

7. Liberated Brands

Liberated Brands — which previously operated in-store and online retail for chains such as Billabong, Boardriders and Quiksilver — filed for bankruptcy in early February. As of Sept. 27, 2023, it has partnered with Authentic Brands Group to be the physical-store and ecommerce operator for a variety of brands.

By that point, Authentic Brands had already owned more Top 1000 retail brands than most conglomerates. Boardriders ranks No. 474 in the Top 2000.

After Liberated Brands filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, the court entered an order authorizing the debtors to discontinue operations and proceed with store closures for their brands.

“In December 2024, Liberated’s North American license rights for its wholesale operations under the Volcom, RVCA, and Billabong brands were terminated as a result of Liberated’s default under the associated licenses,” wrote Todd Hymel, CEO of Liberated Brands, in a signed court filing dated Feb. 3. “In connection with this termination, Liberated’s United States and Canadian wholesale and e-commerce license rights with respect to those brands were transitioned to new operators, with Liberated retaining a limited right to sell through prior-season branded inventory (subject to certain restrictions).”

That compounded “an already dire liquidity situation,” he wrote. Vendors began holding back in-transit inventory and pending inventory shipments that Liberated Brands intended to sell in spring 2025.

These deals will have you made in the shade.

Sunglasses make even casual outfits look chic, but designer labels can be pricey. So, when we spotted up to 40% off pairs from Tom Ford, Ray-Ban, Victoria Beckham, and more at Bloomingdale’s, it was love at first sight. Whether you prefer a wire frame, cat-ey,e or oversized, we found so many incredible styles marked down.

Stars love these labels too, but shop quickly; the sale ends Dec. 28, and stock is dwindling quickly.

Victoria Beckham

This Italian-made wire-frame pair from Victoria Beckham offers protection and style. Kate Middleton wore the label’s sunglasses to Wimbledon last year, so you’ll be in royally good company.

Tom Ford

From Jennifer Lopez to Brad Pitt, stars love Tom Ford shades, which truly give an instant glam to any outfit.

Meghan Markle and Jennifer Lawrence are among the stars who have been spotted in Ray-Bans, which are a mainstay in stylish sun protection.

Jacquemus

This on-trend Jacquemus tortoise shell frame has a logo at the temple and offers 100% UV protection.

Max Mara

If you prefer a wire frame, Max Mara’s Italian-made gradient pair might be just your style.

“Love them! They are lightweight yet sturdy,” raves one review of these retro-inspired oversized aviators.

Victoria Beckham

This Victoria Beckham style is quite posh, don’t you think?

Prada

Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber are among the celebs who wear Prada sunnies, but anyone can appreciate this silhouette. One shopper wrote that they are “the perfect everyday fit with a bit more elevated look.”

Digital marketing isn’t dying.

Bad marketing is.

And in 2026, the difference between the two will be painfully obvious in Digital marketing.

What we’re witnessing isn’t chaos—it’s a recalibration. Algorithms are stabilizing. AI search is maturing. Consumers are sharper, more skeptical, and far less patient with fluff. The experiment era is ending. Execution is now the only currency that matters in Digital marketing.
