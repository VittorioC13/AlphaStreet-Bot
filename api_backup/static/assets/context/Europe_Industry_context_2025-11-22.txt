[TITLE]Smartkem and Jericho Energy Ventures Extend Letter Of Intent for Proposed All-Stock Merger to Form U.S.-Owned, AI-Focused Infrastructure Company:
[TEXT]
Proposed all-stock transaction aims to align JEV's scalable energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor innovations to power next generation AI data centers

MANCHESTER, England, Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Smartkem, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMTK), ("Smartkem"), a company developing a new class of organic semiconductor technology, today announced that it has agreed to a 60-day extension of its non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") for a proposed all-stock business combination (the "Proposed Transaction") with Jericho Energy Ventures Inc. (TSX-V: JEV, OTC: JROOF) ("Jericho" or "JEV"), an energy innovation company. The amendment to the LOI also extends the deadline by which Smartkem is required to invest in Jericho to prevent Jericho from having the right to terminate the LOI to December 31, 2025. The other terms of the LOI remain unchanged.

As previously disclosed, if completed, the Proposed Transaction would establish a Nasdaq-listed, U.S.-owned and controlled AI infrastructure company that integrates low-cost domestic energy with advanced semiconductor packaging and materials to support the rapidly growing demand for AI compute capacity.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Ian Jenks, Chairman & CEO of Smartkem

"We are pleased to extend the LOI as both teams are committed to working towards a transaction that could unlock meaningful value across the rapidly converging energy and AI sectors. We believe the opportunity to integrate Smartkem's world-class semiconductor materials with JEV's scalable energy platform represents a compelling strategic path forward."

Brian Williamson, CEO of Jericho Energy Ventures

"Extending the LOI reflects the continued enthusiasm between JEV and Smartkem to progress with the proposed merger to create a U.S.-owned AI infrastructure company that brings together JEV's energy innovation and Smartkem's semiconductor capabilities. We look forward to discussions toward a definitive agreement."

Anthony Amato, Strategic Advisor to Smartkem

"This extension indicates the significant potential that both parties see in combining the complementary capabilities of JEV's energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor technology to meet the power and performance needs of next-generation AI infrastructure."

The LOI is non-binding, and there can be no assurance that Smartkem and Jericho will ultimately enter into a definitive agreement for the Proposed Transaction, that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated, or as to the timing or ultimate terms of any Proposed Transaction that may occur. Both Smartkem and Jericho will need significant additional capital to complete the negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, obtain any required stockholder approvals and ultimately complete the Proposed Transaction. The closing of the Proposed Transaction would be subject to significant closing conditions, including the negotiation of the definitive agreement, the satisfactory completion of due diligence, required board and stockholder approvals, and approval of continued listing by Nasdaq.

[TITLE]Aramco Redefines Oil Power in $120 Billion U.S. Tech and LNG Alliance:
[TEXT]
The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code.

Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion.

Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just

[TITLE]With $1.6 Billion in Jeopardy, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold Plug Power Stock Here?:
[TEXT]
Plug Power (PLUG) has been no stranger to volatility, but the stakes just got a lot higher. After years of ambitious expansion plans, the hydrogen fuel-cell company has decided to suspend work on six U.S. green hydrogen plants—projects that formed the backbone of its long-term growth strategy and were tied directly to a massive $1.6 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. That loan, awarded in the final days of the Biden administration, was expected to support the construction of green hydrogen facilities across multiple states and help Plug transition from aspiration to scale.

But now, as the company abruptly pauses development and shifts its focus toward data centers, investors are left wondering whether this pivot represents smart strategic realignment. Losing access to low-cost federal financing could be a major blow, especially for a company already burning substantial amounts of cash and facing pressure to prove that its business model can eventually turn profitable.

Against this backdrop, the question becomes unavoidable: with so much uncertainty hanging over Plug Power, should investors buy, hold, or sell PLUG stock here?

[TITLE]Alpha Tau Announces Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update:

- Alpha DaRT pancreatic cancer patient treatments underway in U.S. multi-center pilot study -

- Newly received radioactive material license for New Hampshire facility positions the Company for continued advancement towards commercial readiness -

- Multiple meaningful milestones targeted in the coming months, including completion of patient recruitment in the U.S. pivotal ReSTART trial -

- Cash, cash equivalents & deposits balance of $75.9 million provides runway for continued clinical advancement and commercial preparation -

JERUSALEM, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alpha Tau Medical Ltd. ("Alpha Tau", or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DRTS, DRTSW), the developer of the innovative alpha-radiation cancer therapy Alpha DaRT®, reported third quarter 2025 financial results and provided a corporate update.

"The third quarter has seen a fantastic continuation of our accelerating momentum at Alpha Tau, as the pace of patient treatments continues to rise, and we draw increased interest from our peers in the industry" said Alpha Tau Chief Executive Officer Uzi Sofer. “Receiving the radioactive license approval in New Hampshire was a significant milestone in our push for operational commercial readiness, and we are continuing to develop that facility for use in treating patients in the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere, having invested almost $2 million into the facility in Q3. We are very happy with the rate of recruitment in our U.S. multi-center pilot study in pancreatic cancer, and look forward to some potential targeted near-term milestones, including a forthcoming response from the PMDA to our request for marketing authorization in Japan in treating recurrent head & neck cancer, and treating our first patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) shortly. With four IDEs currently active for trials in the U.S., we are continuing to explore with the FDA other potential U.S. trial initiations, potentially in prostate cancer or head & neck cancers.”

Recent Corporate Highlights:

In September, Alpha Tau announced the treatment of the first patient in its U.S. multi-center pancreatic cancer clinical trial. The trial is expected to enroll up to 30 patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer, in two cohorts: 15 patients with locally advanced disease, and 15 patients with metastatic disease. Patients will receive mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy together with the Alpha DaRT treatment. Up to 87% of newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients are considered inoperable at diagnosis and face a dismal prognosis, with limited benefit from existing therapies, and the pilot study is a key part of Alpha Tau’s broader strategy to bring Alpha DaRT to cancer patients with some of the highest unmet needs.

[TITLE]Azerbaijan Bets Big on China to Power Its Green Energy Corridor:
[TEXT]
Azerbaijan is hoping China can play a big role in helping Baku fulfill its ambitions of building a “green energy corridor” to Europe.

Azerbaijani officials and representatives of China's Datang Overseas Investment Co. signed a deal on November 12 covering the construction of a 100 Megawatt solar power plant. The sides also agreed to explore the development of offshore wind power, energy storage systems, and the implementation of technical training programs.

The solar farm will be situated in the Gobustan District south of Baku, with a target completion date for the second half of 2026. China's Jinko Solar announced that it will supply solar panels for the plant, while Turkey's EPRA Energy has confirmed that it has conducted grid connection, grid code compliance, and power quality analyses for the project.

The Datang deal is an outgrowth of Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev’s April visit to Beijing, which saw the signing of six separate cooperation agreements covering the potential development of renewable energy projects in Azerbaijan.
