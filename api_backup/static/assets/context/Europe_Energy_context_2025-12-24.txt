[TITLE]What Would A Peace Deal In Ukraine Mean For The Global Oil Market?:
[TEXT]
The prospect of a peace deal in Ukraine has been gaining momentum in the global oil market over the past few days, stripping away part of the geopolitical risk premium that has kept prices elevated since Russia’s invasion on 24 February 2022. Following meetings last week in Berlin with Ukrainian and European officials, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner stated that consensus was reached on around 90% of the issues within a 20-point peace plan. Ukraine has indicated that it may drop its NATO membership bid in exchange for legally binding U.S. and European security assurances, similar to NATO’s Article 5. This states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to assist, potentially with armed force, to restore security. The U.S. has now said that it is offering ‘Article 5-like’ assurances, with President Donald Trump now reportedly willing to submit to the Senate for approval. Meanwhile, Russia has indicated it could accept Ukraine joining the European Union (E.U.) of 27 countries as part of a settlement, a major shift from its earlier stance. However, it continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from parts of Donetsk still under Kyiv’s control, while Ukraine rejects ceding territory. Talks continue, with Trump saying in the last few days that “we’re closer now [to a peace deal] than we have been,” so what would it mean if such an agreement was reached tomorrow?

Even if a full peace agreement were reached tomorrow – freely agreed by both Ukraine and Russia -- it would likely take months for any significant rolling back of U.S. sanctions on Russia to occur, and years before all such prohibitions were removed. “Literally thousands of sanctions have been imposed on Russia since [24 February] 2022, involving codification through multiple executive orders, Treasury designations, and sometimes congressional legislation, so removing them doesn’t just mean a signature,” a senior Washington-based source who works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “Removing each one will require a formal review process, inter?agency coordination, and sometimes Senate approval if treaty?level commitments are involved,” he noted. “Don’t forget that these sanctions often also feed into similar ones on third-country firms and individuals that are connected to Russia, so getting rid of those would require another level of legal process and negotiations with allies in Europe and Asia, which would be very time consuming,” he underlined. “And on top of that any major rollback could be challenged every step of the way by the lawmakers, which would take it out of the control of the executive,” he told OilPrice.com. Ultimately, sanctions are seen as the tangible sign of U.S. resolve, and any rapid removal – absent a clear milestone achieved by Russia – would risk being read by allies and adversaries alike as a reward for aggression. Given this, any substantive longer-term effects on the global oil market would likely be muted.

Even more so, as it is highly likely that such an initiative would involve a graduated process, as with Iran, according to the Washington source. Indeed, once the U.S. had agreed to the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’ (JCPOA, or colloquially ‘the nuclear deal’) on 14 July 2015, sanctions relief for Iran was phased in over years, contingent on verified compliance milestones, with Treasury and State monitoring implementation before easing restrictions, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. “It’s pretty clear that the Europeans would want to see this sort of a rollback, and Ukraine too, with [sanctions] relief charted against benchmarks, not a blanket lifting overnight,” said the Washington source. “In this case [Ukraine], we’d be looking for proof that Russia is not continuing with military support for its occupied territories, or a further build-up of Russian military in those regions, and this would require international monitoring,” he observed. Moreover, as seen in the E.U.’s recent ‘Sanctions Snapback’ on Iran, any relief programme for Russia would almost certainly contain a similar mechanism to re?impose measures if Moscow breached peace terms. Judging from the Snapback on Iran, and the likely terms for Russia of any peace deal, such a snapback for Moscow would involve a quick and broad-based reimposition of sanctions on it and third parties relating to military hardware, dual-use (civilian and military) technology, and finance as monitored through the lens of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF enforces 40 standards against money laundering and nine against terrorist financing, with sweeping powers to sanction individuals, firms, or states that fall short. Its grey? and black?list designations trigger escalating restrictions, making it an aggressive enforcement tool.

In any event, Europe – both the E.U. and other countries, including Great Britain – looks even less likely than the U.S. to start rolling back sanctions on Russia any time soon. After years of effectively bankrolling the Russian war machine through vast imports of the country’s oil and gas, the message finally appears to have sunk in: the rest of Europe is in President Vladimir Putin’s sights after Ukraine. He laid the groundwork for what was to come back in his second state?of?the?nation speech after his 2004 re?election, broadcast live on Russian television, when he said: “The demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century. As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.” Following that, his tentative first military incursion into a sovereign European country – Georgia in 2008 – showed him that he could get away with more, in the classic ‘salami slicing’ strategy of territorial advancement that he has used since. This was because of the ineffectual response from Europe to this aggression – itself a result of the fact that the continent, particularly Germany, was unwilling to jeopardise its cheap Russian gas and oil supplies, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. When the same meek response met his 2014 invasion of Ukraine, and subsequent annexation of Crimea, it was game on for the full invasion of Ukraine in 2022. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte laid it out bare for Europe just over a week ago: “We are Russia’s next target. And we are already in harm’s way.” With this view now widespread among Europe’s top leaders, the meaningful rollback of sanctions on Moscow looks unlikely, with the corollary lack of long-term follow-through in the global oil market.

President Trump has further fuelled Europe’s determination to take its own path on Russia, having made it clear early in this presidency that NATO members who did not dramatically increase their defence spending could not rely on U.S. military support in the event of attack from Russia. The last time NATO met, members agreed to increase their defence spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, up from an average of 2% last year. Against this backdrop, it would be too obscene even for Germany to advocate the resumption of oil and gas imports in size from Russia. Indeed, around two weeks ago, the E.U. fully agreed to implement its ‘REPowerEU Roadmap’, which European Commission (E.C.) President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted as enabling the continent to: “Enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia [as] Today, we are stopping these imports permanently.” She underlined: “By depleting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.” E.C. Commissioner, Dan Jørgensen, put it even more plainly: “We [the E.U.] will “never go back to our dangerous dependence on Russia, we will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation, and we will never go back to energy blackmail and economic exposure.” As such, the agreement contains bans on E.U. imports of pipelined natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and oil from Russia, as analysed fully by OilPrice.com. As one senior source in the EU’s security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week: “Regardless of what the Americans do, and regardless of any peace deal in Ukraine, we’re not rolling back anything on Russia.”

[TITLE]Zelenskyy says progress in U.S.-led peace talks is 'quite solid':
[TEXT]
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.

"Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage," the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S. officials who are trying to steer the neighboring countries toward compromises.

"There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I'm sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either," Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.

U.S. President Donald Trump has for months been pushing for a peace agreement. However, the negotiations have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv. But U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held "productive and constructive" talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives.

Zelenskyy said that "nearly 90%" of Ukraine's demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.

The backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.

Zelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a "backstop" from Washington, ensuring "Ukraine's security in the air, on land, and at sea."

"Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on," the Ukrainian president said.

Ukraine is arguing that the bilateral document with U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.

The U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.

Ukraine strikes deep inside Russia

Zelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.

"In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly," he said in a post on Telegram.

Ukrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.

The attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia's bigger army.

The strikes also seek to undermine President Vladimir Putin's attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.

The killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.

Ukrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets

Ukrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement Monday.

A pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.

It added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.

A separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.

Ukrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine's military intelligence.

Russia's Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.

Russia targets the power grid again

Meanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine's energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as "weaponizing winter."

Energy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine's Ministry of Energy said.

Russia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine's air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.

[TITLE]Ukraine's Zelenskiy says negotiations on war settlement 'close to a real result':
[TEXT]
Dec 22 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ‌said on Monday that negotiations conducted with the United States and European nations aimed at ‌ending the nearly four-year war with Russia were "very close to a real result."

Ukrainian negotiators ‌led by senior official Rustem Umerov, along with representatives from Europe, have held a series of meetings with U.S. envoys, including in recent days in Florida.

Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy, has also been holding separate talks with ‍U.S. officials in Florida.

Officials in both Ukraine and Russia said ‍their teams were returning home on Monday ‌to report on the outcome of the discussions.

"It all looks quite worthy ... And here it is ‍important ​that this is the work of both us (Ukraine) and the United States of America. This suggests that we are very close to a real result," Zelenskiy told a gathering devoted ⁠to Ukrainian diplomats.

U.S. 20-POINT PLAN ON THE TABLE

Zelenskiy said the negotiators ‌had been working on a 20-point plan, put forward by U.S. envoys, which has been under discussion for weeks after ⁠an initial draft ‍was criticised by Ukrainians and Europeans as being too slanted towards Russia.

"Not everything is ideal with this, but the plan is there," he said.

Also under discussion were security guarantees Ukraine has been seeking to guard against any ‍future Russian military action once the fighting stops, as well ‌as a plan for Ukraine's economic recovery.

"The basic block of all the documents is ready. It's basic," Zelenskiy said. "There are some matters for which we are not prepared. And I am certain that there are matters for which the Russians are not prepared."

The U.S. team has been led by President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Speaking later in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said the key issue was to determine whether the United States was able to "get a response from Russia, real ‌readiness on the part of that country to focus on something other than aggression."

He said continued pressure on the Kremlin was vital to reduce Moscow's capacity to wage war.

"Lowering the price of Russian oil, strong global sanctions and continued ​other forms of pressure are what can persuade even a stubborn person," he said.

"This year, much has already been done to reduce the money available to Russia's war machine."

[TITLE]Workers organized by a key union rally in Bolivia against scrapping fuel subsidies:

LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivian miners marched in downtown La Paz, the country's capital, and union-organized protesters took to the streets elsewhere on Monday, the first day of a strike over the government's scrapping of fuel subsidies that have been blamed for contributing to dollar shortages and economic turmoil.

The protests were called for by Bolivia’s Central Union of Workers but many trade groups, including transportation workers, did not join the rallies. Some union leaders said they would go along with the elimination of the subsidies, which had been in place for almost two decades.

Bolivia's centrist President Rodrigo Paz, who took office on Nov. 8, ended the fuel subsidy that previous left-wing governments had maintained for more than 20 years, keeping gas prices at $0.53 per liter. An emergency decree by Paz last week put the price of gasoline at around $1 per liter.

“The country is sick and must be healed,” Paz said on Sunday in a town hall meeting that was broadcast on state television.

“Every day, $10 million is spent on a subsidy that benefits smugglers” who resell the subsidized fuel in Bolivia and abroad, Paz added.

Business groups in Bolivia have backed Paz’s new economic measures, which are expected to ease dollar shortages and make it easier for companies to import goods and capital.

“We knew that at some point the subsidies would end” said Luis Paco, a union leader representing merchants in the city of El Alto. “There were no negotiations over the new adjustments, but we knew this was inevitable.”

Bus drivers unions stayed away from Monday’s protests after Bolivia’s government said they will be able to import auto parts duty-free. Paz has also mandated a 20% increase in the minimum wage.

Imports of gasoline and diesel — costing the government up to $3 billion a year — had depleted foreign currency reserves and worsened Bolivia's biggest economic crisis in four decades, following the decline of the nation’s natural gas exports.

But unions that have traditionally aligned with left-wing political leaders — including those representing miners and coca growers — went on strike on Monday, demanding that fuel subsidies be reinstated.

La Paz police sealed off access to the central square where the palace housing the government is located, to prevent demonstrators from entering.

In the neighboring city of El Alto, local councils blocked some avenues. There were also road blocks on highways in six of the country’s nine regions, according to Bolivia’s highway administration agency.

“We are in the streets in a struggle that will continue until that decree eliminating the subsidy is repealed,” mining leader Andrés Paye told reporters. “This government approves regulations to favor business owners and punish the poor.”

Unions aligned with former President Evo Morales, led a massive march in Cochabamba, the Andean country’s third-largest city, and blocked two major highways in the east of the country.

The bus drivers unions did not join the strike, after negotiating over the weekend with Paz's new government.

“We will continue to work, to serve the people” said Lucio Gomez, a leader of a transport workers union.

Carlos Cordero, a political science professor in La Paz, said the union behind the strike was trying to “show its strength” ahead of next year's elections for governors and mayors. But the relatively low turnout on Monday showed that the union has been weakened, he said.

“In many sectors of the country, there is a conviction that the adjustment was necessary” Cordero said.

LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivian miners marched in downtown La Paz, the country's capital, and union-organized protesters took to the streets elsewhere on Monday, the first day of a strike over the government's scrapping of fuel subsidies that have been blamed for contributing to dollar shortages and economic turmoil.

The protests were called for by Bolivia’s Central Union of Workers but many trade groups, including transportation workers, did not join the rallies. Some union leaders said they would go along with the elimination of the subsidies, which had been in place for almost two decades.

Bolivia's centrist President Rodrigo Paz, who took office on Nov. 8, ended the fuel subsidy that previous left-wing governments had maintained for more than 20 years, keeping gas prices at $0.53 per liter. An emergency decree by Paz last week put the price of gasoline at around $1 per liter.

“The country is sick and must be healed,” Paz said on Sunday in a town hall meeting that was broadcast on state television.

“Every day, $10 million is spent on a subsidy that benefits smugglers” who resell the subsidized fuel in Bolivia and abroad, Paz added.

Business groups in Bolivia have backed Paz’s new economic measures, which are expected to ease dollar shortages and make it easier for companies to import goods and capital.

“We knew that at some point the subsidies would end” said Luis Paco, a union leader representing merchants in the city of El Alto. “There were no negotiations over the new adjustments, but we knew this was inevitable.”

Bus drivers unions stayed away from Monday’s protests after Bolivia’s government said they will be able to import auto parts duty-free. Paz has also mandated a 20% increase in the minimum wage.

Imports of gasoline and diesel — costing the government up to $3 billion a year — had depleted foreign currency reserves and worsened Bolivia's biggest economic crisis in four decades, following the decline of the nation’s natural gas exports.

But unions that have traditionally aligned with left-wing political leaders — including those representing miners and coca growers — went on strike on Monday, demanding that fuel subsidies be reinstated.

La Paz police sealed off access to the central square where the palace housing the government is located, to prevent demonstrators from entering.

In the neighboring city of El Alto, local councils blocked some avenues. There were also road blocks on highways in six of the country’s nine regions, according to Bolivia’s highway administration agency.

“We are in the streets in a struggle that will continue until that decree eliminating the subsidy is repealed,” mining leader Andrés Paye told reporters. “This government approves regulations to favor business owners and punish the poor.”

Unions aligned with former President Evo Morales, led a massive march in Cochabamba, the Andean country’s third-largest city, and blocked two major highways in the east of the country.

The bus drivers unions did not join the strike, after negotiating over the weekend with Paz's new government.

“We will continue to work, to serve the people” said Lucio Gomez, a leader of a transport workers union.

Carlos Cordero, a political science professor in La Paz, said the union behind the strike was trying to “show its strength” ahead of next year's elections for governors and mayors. But the relatively low turnout on Monday showed that the union has been weakened, he said.

“In many sectors of the country, there is a conviction that the adjustment was necessary” Cordero said.

Dr Arun Kumar Nayak, until recently head of the Nuclear Control and Planning Wing of the Department of Atomic Energy, makes the case for the SHANTI Bill, 2025, arguing that private sector entry into nuclear power is an imperative, not a choice.Speaking to ET, Nayak said Articles 17(b) and 46 of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) created widespread ambiguity among suppliers, preventing the nuclear business from progressing. He noted that the revised framework on right to recourse and liability is now aligned with the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) and international practice.India is targeting a $35 trillion economy over the next 25 years. To achieve this, experts estimate that the country will require at least 30,000 billion units of energy annually.At present, India consumes just over 10,000 billion units a year, with nearly 90% sourced from fossil fuels. The maximum potential of renewable energy is also estimated at no more than 4,000-8,000 billion units annually. This leaves a deficit of at least 20,000 billion units of clean energy per year, which can only be bridged through nuclear power.In this context, the target of 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047 is merely a starting point; substantially higher capacity will be required to meet India's net-zero commitments.Such a nuclear energy transition is impossible under the existing legal and business framework, which restricts operations largely to central government nuclear utilities or public sector undertakings operating through joint ventures, and remains heavily dependent on government funding.Opening up the nuclear sector to private participation is therefore not a matter of choice but an imperative. Without the SHANTI Act, the goal of a decarbonised Viksit Bharat risks remaining unattainable.In the SHANTI Act, the three key controls - safety, security and safeguards - vest with the Centre, not with the operator, whether a PSU or a private entity. All nuclear facilities will be licenced only after meeting stringent requirements prescribed by the AERB and the Centre on these three aspects.Under the new Act, private entities may build nuclear plants subject to compliance with Government Quality Assurance norms. However, operation of any plant - whether private or PSU - will require safety licencing by the AERB. Security of nuclear facilities will be designed, implemented and maintained by the Centre, at the cost of the operator. Every gram of nuclear material handled by an operator will remain under the Centre's surveillance and control in accordance with IAEA requirements. Moreover, all irradiated fuel will be handed over to the central government, effectively ruling out any risk of proliferation.The conferral of statutory status on the AERB is also timely and reinforces its functional autonomy.Taken together, these provisions ensure that there is no compromise at any stage or on any aspect of nuclear governance. The apprehensions surrounding private participation are therefore misplaced and need to be dispelled.In the CLND Act, 2010, similar provisions existed; however, Articles 17(b) and 46 created significant ambiguity in the minds of suppliers. While the government sought to clarify these provisions through FAQs, suppliers remained unconvinced, as such clarifications did not carry the force of law. As a result, nuclear business could not be pursued at scale. Legal clarity was essential.On liability, there is currently only one operator- NPCIL. In the event of a serious accident causing damage to the public, NPCIL bears the liability. NPCIL also owns the PHWR technology and therefore functions as the supplier as well.However, the manufacturing and construction of nuclear power plants in the country are carried out by private utilities, not NPCIL. Do these private utilities assume supplier liability for equipment or construction in the event of a nuclear accident? They do not. NPCIL alone bears liability, both as operator and as supplier.Indirectly, even today, the Government of India is ultimately liable in the event of a nuclear accident in the country. Under the new regime, there is no change in the fundamental framework of operator liability, whether the operator is public or private.Operator liability is clearly defined, with liability amounts graded according to the type of nuclear activity and the capacity of the reactor involved. The maximum liability of the central government is also specified, along with provisions for the creation of a nuclear liability fund.Where the supplier is distinct from the operator, the operator retains a right of recourse. Accordingly, the supplier-whether domestic or foreign-is liable through contractual arrangements with the operator. In addition, the operator has a right of recourse against suppliers if a nuclear incident occurs due to an act of commission or omission involving malevolent intent. This right of recourse applies equally to Indian and foreign suppliers.These provisions are fully aligned with the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC), to which India is a signatory.In the event of an accident, affected members of the public are entitled to compensation under the law of the land. Once compensation is determined, the operator is required to pay within prescribed time limits. If the amount exceeds the operator's liability cap, the central government is obliged to compensate the balance. Should the compensation exceed the government's limit as well, the remaining amount is covered through the CSC mechanism.In this framework, there is no gap in public protection, and no basis for the concern that victims would be left uncompensated.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has allocated €8m ($9.3m) to Sparkasse Bank Skopje for the green finance facility (GFF) in North Macedonia.

The funding will be used to offer loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency.

The GFF pools resources from the Joint SDG Fund, the government of North Macedonia, the EBRD, and various local banks.

The programme is delivered through partnerships involving the United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, International Organization for Migration, EBRD, government agencies in North Macedonia, and support from the UN Resident Coordinator.

The GFF aims to make financing accessible to SMEs and under-represented groups seeking to undertake projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.

These activities align with national climate strategies and follow the EBRD’s Green Economy Transition (GET) approach.
