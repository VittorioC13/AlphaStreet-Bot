The trade agreement between India and the four-nation European bloc EFTA came into force on Wednesday, under which the country has received an investment commitment of $100 billion over 15 years, while lowering or removing duties on products like Swiss watches and chocolates as India will phase out customs duties on these goods over 10 years.Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said the pact will unlock new opportunities for trade, investment and job creation, benefiting people and businesses. "A lot of the agreement is centered around mutual trust and respect-respect for the sensitivities of each country amongst the five members" Goyal said at the Prosperity Summit here.This is India's first agreement having an investment commitment to balance and make the two sides equitable and bring fairness to the arrangement between the two set of partners. TEPA will further strengthen our exports across machinery, textiles, marine products, coffee, with wider access to the premium European markets," Goyal posted on X.India's exports to the EFTA bloc were $1.97 billion in FY25 while imports were $22.44 billion.At the event, he said there are areas in education, audiovisual services, culture and tourism which "we can capture together" and so are life sciences, clean energy, precision engineering, manufacturing and food processing."Another area where we can work together is global capability centers, supporting your companies, bringing down their costs of operation," he said.

Swiss State Secretary for Economic Affairs Helene Budliger Artieda on Wednesday pitched for a bilateral investment treaty with India , following the USD 100 billion investment commitment by EFTA nations under a new trade pact.The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.The free trade agreement between India and the four-nation European bloc EFTA came into force on Wednesday, under which the country has received an investment commitment of USD 100 billion over 15 years, while lowering or removing duties on products like Swiss watches and chocolates.It was signed on March 10, 2024."So, you heard Liechtenstein would like to have a double taxation agreement in place. If I may also wish...with this massive principle of investment, we would like to have a bilateral investment treaty in place."Last time, I was here, I had a wonderful conversation with your Minister of Finance, and I'm hearing that there is a model text in preparation," the Swiss minister said at the India EFTA business summit Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal was also present at the summit."You know, in order to get this very innovative idea of an investment pledge going, it's actually not our money, it's the money of our private sector, so we needed to convince them, but I can report here that they're all fired up," she added.India is actively negotiating bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with over a dozen countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Switzerland, Russia, Australia and the European Union These investment treaties help in protecting and promoting investments in each other's countries.With India set to become the third-largest economy and a hub for global manufacturing, the government is taking a series of measures to further improve its investment regime that encourages investors.The government in the last Budget has announced revamping the current model of BITs to make it more investor-friendly and attract foreign players.The country signed BITs with two countries in 2024.Last year, the Centre announced the implementation of these treaties with the UAE and Uzbekistan.Unlike a chapter related to investment promotion or facilitation in free trade agreements recently concluded, the investment protection element under a BIT provides a wide range of obligations and commitments bestowed upon foreign investors, which are expansive in nature.In a BIT, the provision of mandatory exhaustion of local legal remedies for a period of five years before resorting to international arbitration is beneficial for both the investor and the state involved in a dispute.India's approach of requiring local remedies aligns with its stance to protect taxpayer money and avoid prolonged and costly legal battles, while simultaneously providing arbitration as an alternate dispute resolution mechanism to investors.FDI inflows into India crossed the USD 1 trillion milestone in the April 2000-June 2025 period, firmly establishing the country's reputation as a safe and key investment destination globally.Last fiscal year, it stood at USD 80.61 billion.

[TITLE]Evantic Capital debuts with $400 million to fund B2B AI startups across Europe and beyond:
[TEXT]
Evantic Capital, a new London-based venture capital firm, has launched with over €341 million in capital to support B2B AI innovators across Europe, the United States, and Israel.

Why it matters: The substantial funding underscores the importance of investing in AI technologies that hold the promise of revolutionizing how businesses operate and deliver value, contributing to the competitiveness and dynamism of the European tech landscape.

The details:

Evantic Capital aims to identify and nurture groundbreaking AI startups that demonstrate strong potential in transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics.

The investment fund will provide financial support, strategic guidance, and industry connections to help these startups scale and achieve their transformative goals.

The firm’s launch is seen as a significant boost for the European AI startup ecosystem, which continues to garner global attention for its innovation and growth.

The firm is backed by an exclusive network of 140 seasoned founders, operators, and investors collectively known as “The Legends,” designed to create direct alignment between startup success and stakeholder involvement by allocating up to 50% of investment carry to those Legends who actively support the portfolio companies.

What they’re saying:

“Our Legends are senior leaders—experienced founders, operators, and executives—who bring a deeper level of involvement to our portfolio companies,” explains Matt Miller, Founder and Managing Partner of Evantic Capital.

“This creates a true partnership model: our Legends are not only motivated by goodwill or networking, but by a real alignment of interests. It ensures that when a founder engages with a Legend, they’re interacting with someone who is deeply invested in helping them succeed, both emotionally and economically.”

The other side: The rise of AI technologies presents a myriad of opportunities and challenges.

What’s next: Evantic Capital has already invested in five AI-focused startups and has two more commitments underway, with its current portfolio including Fireworks, Listen Labs, and Nexos.

[TITLE]DLL and Iveco Group establish new GATE Joint Venture:
[TEXT]
Eindhoven, the Netherlands / Turin, Italy, 1st October 2025. Leading global vendor finance company DLL (De Lage Landen International B.V.) and Iveco Group (EXM: IVG), a global automotive leader active in the Truck, Bus, Defence, Powertrain, and related Financial Services arenas, have obtained regulatory approvals to enter into a Joint Venture (JV) to facilitate the energy transition in Europe. Together they will amplify access to low- to zero-emission commercial vehicles. The intent to join forces was initially announced on 13th May 2025.

DLL has acquired a majority interest (51%) in GATE – formerly a fully owned subsidiary of Iveco Group – through a reserved capital increase, to support the transition to low- to zero-emission commercial vehicles in Europe, while Iveco Group retains 49% of the share capital. The new JV structure will provide GATE with strengthened financial backing and asset financing expertise, crucial for accelerating its growth strategy, driving its further development and expansion, and enabling it to achieve its ambitious objectives more efficiently and swiftly.

GATE facilitates access to more sustainable mobility through its rental solutions for low- to zero-emission vehicles. The formula is tailored to the customers’ specific needs, offering an extensive digital ecosystem and high-quality services through premium partners. GATE will continue helping customers to build more sustainable fleets under the newly formed JV structure, strengthening activities that began in Italy in 2023 and that were extended to France and Germany in 2024. The GATE JV intends to further extend its reach to additional countries where both DLL and Iveco Group are already active and, over time, to offer similar solutions for other brands beyond IVECO. The teams from Iveco Group, DLL and GATE are already working jointly on the integration process while maintaining their focus on the business expansion projects outlined in GATE's plans.

[TITLE]Steelworkers denounce Trump’s reckless lumber tariffs as devastating blow to workers and communities:
[TEXT]
TORONTO, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The United Steelworkers union (USW) is denouncing the latest escalation in Donald Trump’s trade war, following his September 29 proclamation imposing a 10% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber exports to the United States. The new tariff, taking effect October 14, comes on top of the existing 35.16% countervailing and anti-dumping duties already imposed on Canadian lumber. In total, Canadian softwood lumber shipments worth more than $7.7 billion annually will now face duties exceeding 45% at the U.S. border.

“For decades, Canadian lumber has supported the U.S. housing market, keeping construction costs down for American families while sustaining good jobs here at home,” said Marty Warren, USW National Director. “Instead of recognizing that reality, Trump has chosen to pursue reckless trade policies that will drive up housing prices in the United States and put tens of thousands of Canadian jobs at risk.”

Warren emphasized that this dispute is not only

Europe’s Stoxx 600 closed at a record high on Wednesday, with healthcare stocks leading the way after a US-Pfizer deal reduced uncertainty in the sector, while investors digested the beginning of a US government shutdown.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 surged 1.2 per cent to log its biggest one-day percentage gain since July 23rd. Most regional bourses were also trading higher, with London’s FTSE 100 at a record high.

Dublin

Shares in nutrition group Glanbia dipped on Wednesday after its largest shareholder, Tirlán Co-operative Society, sold a 6.8 per cent stake in the business. Tirlán plans to use the €230 million proceeds from the share sale to help repurchase €250 million of bonds issued in 2022. Glanbia shares closed the session 2.2 per cent down at €13.70.

AIB and Bank of Ireland enjoyed a strong session with both stocks up 2 per cent. Dublin-listed home builders Cairn and Glenveagh were also up 1.9 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively following good results in recent weeks.

Iseq heavyweight Ryanair fell marginally on the back of a general decline in leisure stocks.

Europe

European healthcare stocks jumped 5.4 per cent, marking their biggest one-day performance since November 2008. On Tuesday, Pfizer agreed to lower prescription drug prices in the US Medicaid programme in exchange for tariff relief.

“The sector generally has struggled over the last year or so and what we are hopefully beginning to see is some measure of clarity

[TITLE]Viasat Working with Skyrora on Upcoming Mission After UK Grants Launch License:
[TEXT]
Viasat will provide its InRange launch telemetry solution for Skyrora’s demonstration launches,

in a project supported by the European and UK Space Agencies.

Last month, Glasgow-based Skyrora became the first UK-based manufacturer to receive

a launch license, with up to 16 launches per year aimed by 2030.

LONDON, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ: VSAT), a global leader in satellite communications, today announced it will provide its InRange launch telemetry service for future sub-orbital demonstration of Skyrora’s Skylark L launch vehicle.

InRange ensures a continuous flow of telemetry data during rocket flight from launch to payload deployment. Unlike traditional ground networks that can only connect when a launch vehicle is within sight, InRange uses Viasat’s L-band geostationary satellites which orbit 36,500km above the Earth. This means launch operators like Skyrora can closely monitor launch missions from launch vehicle to control center with consistent and reliable connectivity from space.

The announcement follows Skyrora’s successful UK-first ground tests of InRange, completed in October 2024 in collaboration with Viasat and CGI. In August, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) granted the Scottish company a license to launch and operate its sub-orbital Skylark L rocket from the SaxaVord Spaceport in Shetland. Skyrora currently aims to launch as many as 16 times per year by 2030.

The project is funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) under its Boost! Commercial Space Transportation Services and Support Programme, with support from the UK Space Agency (UKSA). The first phase covered ground tests completed in 2024. Now in its second phase, the project will see further static tests of InRange before integrating the solution with Skylark L ahead of real-life launches.

Todd McDonell, President, International Government, Viasat, said: “As activity and interest in space grows, countries around the world are looking to develop their space industries and launch capabilities. We are delighted to be playing a key role on that journey within the UK space sector by supporting Skyrora with InRange. Through our satellite network, we can help make successful, reliable launches a reality.”

Volodymyr Levykin, CEO and Founder of Skyrora, said: “The InRange telemetry system reduces the likelihood of challenges around recording and transmitting the readings of launches. It could not only help save launch companies millions of pounds but also give them more flexibility by improving their visibility of telemetry data throughout the flight. Now we’re moving towards launch, this is an incredibly exciting time for the UK space sector.”

InRange is also part of NASA’s Communications Service Project, which will see the solution demonstrated onboard Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket on two future missions. Viasat is also working with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to develop InRange for Mitsubishi’s Heavy Industry’s H3 launch vehicle.

Viasat has also launched its new HaloNet portfolio, a group of comprehensive solutions designed to support the space-to-ground communication landscape — including a telemetry data relay solution to support the launch industry.

World markets, except for the US, inched higher on Tuesday despite concerns a US government shutdown could delay key jobs data.

Dublin

Euronext Dublin finished the day up 1.6 per cent off the back of a strong performance from budget airline Ryanair and the banks.

Ryanair climbed 3.6 per cent after it said it will not restart low-fare flights to and from Tel Aviv this winter after the city’s Ben Gurion Airport refused to confirm the airline’s summer 2026 slots or guarantee access to its low-cost terminal.

The airline said the Israeli airport had repeatedly forced Ryanair to use the more expensive Terminal 3 instead of the low-cost Terminal 1 during security concerns this summer, making tickets unprofitable. A trader suggested certainty around the issue had pleased investors.

Among the financial names, AIB and Bank of Ireland rose 0.8 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively, while PTSB was up 2.7 per cent at close of business, albeit on low trading volumes.

Elsewhere, Cavan-based insulation specialist – one of the biggest hitters on the index – finished the day up 1.5 per cent.

On the down side, food giant Kerry Group dropped 0.3 per cent, while housebuilder Cairn Homes dropped 1.6 per cent.

London

The FTSE 100 ended the quarter with a flourish, hitting an all-time high on Tuesday, as hopes grew of a peace settlement in the Middle East and as UK prime minister Keir Starmer reiterated a commitment to fiscal responsibility.

The FTSE 100 index closed up 0.5 per cent, while the FTSE 250 ended 0.7 per cent higher, and the AIM All-Share ended up 0.4 per cent.
