[TITLE]Trump plans envision major U.S. investment in Russia, restoring oil flows to Europe, WSJ says:
[TEXT]
MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies in deal for Namibia offshore oil field:
[TEXT]
TotalEnergies will join Portuguese firm Galp to operate Namibia's Mopane oil field, which could contain at least 10 billion barrels, according to estimates - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP Andrew Harnik

TotalEnergies said Tuesday it had reached a deal to become a partner in the Mopane oil field off the coast of Namibia, where exploration remains underway.

The deal with Galp will see TotalEnergies joining the Portuguese firm as an operator as more exploration wells are drilled in view to develop the field for production.

“The transaction positions TotalEnergies as the operator of the two largest oil discoveries in Namibia and opens the way for the development of a major producing hub, generating long-term value for the country and partners,” the French firm said in a statement.

Galp said last year it estimated the Mopane field could contain at least 10 billion barrels of oil.

The deal will see TotalEnergies take a 40 percent stake in the petroleum exploration licence that includes Mopane. Galp will retain a 40 percent stake, alongside the Namibian national oil company Namcor and private firm Custos, which each hold 10 percent stakes.

In exchange, TotalEnergies will finance half of Galp’s capital expenditures for exploration and appraisal of the Mopane field, as well as initial development, with repayment to come from future cash flows from the project.

Galp will also get a 10 percent stake in the nearby Venus exploration zone, where TotalEnergies has discovered oil.

TotalEnergies said it hopes to make a final investment decision on whether to develop production at Venus next year.

TotalEnergies shares were up 0.4 percent in afternoon trading on the Paris stock exchange, where the blue-chip CAC 40 index was down 0.6 percent.

[TITLE]As AI and data center power demand skyrockets, flexible load integration becomes a critical strategy for utilities:
[TEXT]

Contributed by Dr. Matt Green, Senior Vice President of Integrated Planning & Advisory at TRC Companies

For decades, demand for electrical power has remained stable. Utilities could count on highly predictable growth patterns to guide their capacity planning. However, the power requirements of AI and data are placing increasing pressure on power infrastructure, creating significant challenges for grid operators, utilities and developers alike.

While data centers aren’t the sole driver of rising load, they are a dominant factor shaping future demand forecasts. The power intensity of Artificial Intelligence/High-Performance Computing (AI/HPC) and the ever-growing power needs of cloud infrastructure are key drivers. To illustrate the power-intensity of AI, you only need to glance at NVIDIA’s product roadmap. An upcoming version of its flagship GPU solutions is projected to use 1MW – a volume of power that was the IT load of an entire data hall not long ago. Soon, that amount of power will be used by a single rack, not to mention the cooling and other supporting system power needed to support the required operating environment for these new products.

The power consumption of this equipment, combined with the overall growth in cloud-based IT, is leading to data center projects that require a volume of power previously unthinkable just a few years ago. Recent projects announced in locations such as Texas and Louisiana will utilize 1 GW, 2GW or more – equivalent to the demand from an entire city concentrated into just a few buildings. How much power does that add up to across the country? A recent research report by Goldman Sachs predicts that power demands from AI and data centers will reach 92 GW as early as 2027, driven by a volume of investment by major tech firms that is rapidly approaching $1 trillion.

How can utilities expand the capacity of the U.S. electrical grid to keep pace with this skyrocketing demand? It’s a question that comes up in every conversation I have with peers at utilities, and it dominates every industry conference I have attended recently. One thing that is certain is that this challenge will not be solved with a single solution and will require collaboration from both supply-side and demand-side stakeholders.

Building additional capacity and flexibility into the grid with renewable energy DERs, for example, will be an important part of the overall solution. However, a recent Duke University study poses a fascinating hypothesis regarding this issue: What if we don’t need to build new or expanded power plants to meet the power demands of AI and data centers?

Duke’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability recently published a report titled “Rethinking Load Growth: Assessing the Potential for Integration of Large Flexible Loads in US Power Systems” that outlines a strategy for utilities to meet the nearly 100 GW of projected power demands of AI and data centers with existing grid capacity. The key is for utilities and data center operators to work together in a collaborative way that utilizes flexible load management.

Rather than focusing capacity planning solely on total load, utilities would also need to focus on load shape and flexibility. A critical facet of flexible load management is for utilities to incorporate periodic demand curtailment as part of their collaboration with AI companies and data center operators. Duke’s research showed that if AI and cloud data center operators were willing to accept short-duration curtailments of less than 50 hours per year, utilities could accommodate a massive amount of new data center load without having to add more generation capacity. During these periods of curtailment, data center operators would shift workloads by controlling compute and storage resources– strategies that tech companies are already incorporating into their operational strategies. This approach is suitable for end-user-owned data centers but may not be as feasible for wholesale and colocation data center operators. However, utilizing onsite generation during load reduction events is an operating strategy that could be more broadly applicable to all ownership types.

According to the study:

“Flexibility allows large electricity users to temporarily reduce consumption during periods of grid stress by shifting workloads, utilizing on-site generation, or adjusting operations. By leveraging flexibility, new large loads can be interconnected more quickly while reducing the need for premature investment in additional power plants and transmission lines….”
