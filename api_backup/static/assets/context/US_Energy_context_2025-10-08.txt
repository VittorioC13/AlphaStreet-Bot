[TITLE]Apollo Funds to Acquire Eagle Creek Renewable Energy, One of the Largest U.S. Hydroelectric Power Platforms:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Oct. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced that Apollo-managed funds (the "Apollo Funds") have agreed to acquire Eagle Creek Renewable Energy ("Eagle Creek" or the "Company"), a leading independent owner and operator of hydroelectric facilities across the U.S. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Eagle Creek owns and operates 85 hydroelectric facilities across 18 states, providing renewable power to support rapidly growing energy demand from data center infrastructure and the Industrial Renaissance in the U.S. Hydropower is differentiated as a low carbon reliable energy source with baseload capabilities. The Company’s nearly 700 MW portfolio makes it one of the largest and most diversified independent hydro platforms in the country, and its facilities produce enough electricity to power over 260,000 homes.

“The Eagle Creek team have built one of the leading independent hydro portfolios in the U.S., with a strong safety and performance track record and a diversified footprint,” said Joseph Romeo, Partner at Apollo. “We see significant opportunity to support the business in its next phase—further expanding the platform and providing reliable, clean power generation to meet the growth in demand. We look forward to bringing our network and significant industry experience to bear alongside this highly experienced team as we seek to accelerate growth.”

“We’re incredibly proud of the platform our team has built to date, providing clean, reliable power to communities, utilities and businesses across the U.S.,” said Neal Simmons, Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Creek. “With the Apollo team’s support, we look forward to building on that foundation, strengthening our operations and finding new ways to serve the growing needs of our customers.”

Since 2022, Apollo-managed funds and affiliates have committed, deployed, or arranged approximately $59 billion1 of energy transition-related investments, supporting companies and projects across energy, infrastructure and industrial sectors.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.

BMO Capital Markets served as financial advisor and Vinson & Elkins served as legal counsel to Apollo Funds.

[TITLE]U.S. Backs Historic Deal to Keep Kurdish Oil Moving:
[TEXT]
The U.S. Administration wants to ensure that the just-restarted oil exports from Iraq’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan continue to flow via pipeline to Turkey in the long run, an anonymous official at the U.S. Department of State told Bloomberg on Friday.

The Trump Administration is working toward the goal of keeping Kurdistan’s crude flowing in the long term to boost the Iraqi economy, counter Iran’s influence in the region, and benefit U.S. companies operating in Iraq, according to the official.

The U.S. has played a role in the deal that allowed the resumption of the exports from Kurdistan, the official told Bloomberg.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented last week on the agreement to restart exports, saying on X “We welcome the announcement that the Government of Iraq has reached an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government and international companies to reopen the Iraq-Türkiye pipeline. This deal, facilitated by the United States, will bring tangible benefits for both Americans and Iraqis while reaffirming Iraq’s sovereignty.”

Kurdistan’s oil exports resumed on Saturday, September 27, following a two and a half year suspension of the flows via the pipeline from northern Iraq to the Turkish Mediterranean coast.

Eight foreign companies operating in Kurdistan have signed agreements with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Federal Government of Iraq to enable the restart of international crude exports from Kurdistan.

This agreement paved to way to the restart of exports, which were halted for two and a half years, after they were shut in in March 2023 due to a dispute over who should authorize the Kurdish exports.

The federal government in Baghdad and the regional Kurdish government in Erbil squabbled for more than two years over who should be responsible for the oil exports and the subsequent revenue distribution.

Under the agreement, hailed as historic by Iraq’s federal government, KRG is delivering about 190,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to Iraqi state marketing company SOMO. Kurdistan is also entitled to keep 50,000 bpd to use for local consumption.
