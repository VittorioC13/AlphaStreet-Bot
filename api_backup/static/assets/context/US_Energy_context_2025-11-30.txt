[TITLE]Federal Government Continues Investment in Fusion Sector to Establish Centre for Fusion Energy:
[TEXT]
PICKERING, Ontario, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, a federal Crown corporation, is continuing to develop a thriving fusion sector in Canada by establishing a Centre for Fusion Energy with Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, Ontario Power Generation and Stellarex. This collaboration will create a national platform for a robust and integrated Canadian fusion ecosystem, develop advanced domestic fusion energy capabilities, and advance fusion energy research and development in Canada. Advancing Canadian leadership in fusion energy is part of the federal government’s commitment to establishing Canada as an energy superpower and the strongest economy in the G7.

"Through a new Centre for Fusion Excellence, Canada and Ontario are taking another step forward to strengthen our nuclear energy sector,” said Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources. “Our new government is proud to work with the province to support Canadian investments that will broaden our clean energy research and grow our fusion energy sector."

It is expected that other partners and contributors will join the Centre for Fusion Energy and expand the reach to additional private-sector and research organizations.

“Ontario’s world-renowned researchers are driving the energy sector into a new era of clean energy,” said Nolan Quinn, Minister of Colleges, Universities, Research Excellence and Security. “Through this investment, our government is leveraging our province’s position as a nuclear powerhouse to fuel fusion energy discoveries that will advance our industries, build our energy workforce and protect Ontario.”

“Ontario is an advanced nuclear operator that embraces the first mover advantage, starting with leveraging Canadian CANDU technology over 50 years ago to building the G7's first Small Modular Reactor today,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “As fusion energy represents the next frontier in clean 24/7 power, Ontario is again leading the way with Ontario Power Generation delivering the Centre for Fusion Energy. Ontario is doubling down on our nuclear advantage by investing in the development of fusion nuclear power — an almost inexhaustible source of emission-free energy for future generations."

The federal government contribution comes from Atomic Energy of Canada Limited’s Federal Nuclear Science and Technology Work Plan, with an investment of $33 million of in-kind fusion-related research projects delivered by Canadian Nuclear Laboratories. This program connects the expansive tritium, fusion and materials research capabilities of Canadian Nuclear Laboratories with the Centre for Fusion Energy.

The province of Ontario, through Ontario Power Generation, is also investing $19.5 million, and fusion company Stellarex is contributing up to $39 million in fusion energy development and deployment activities. Ontario, through OPG, is home to almost all of the world’s commercial tritium—a by-product of OPG’s CANDU reactors—which serves as the key fusion fuel for nearly all fusion reactor designs.

“Fusion is a critical, long-term, global scientific challenge, and Canada has developed a number of unique capabilities that will allow us to play an important role in its future,” said Fred Dermarkar, President and CEO of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. “Working together, across levels of government, and between public, private, and academic institutions is essential for realizing our collective potential.”

“This agreement marks an exciting moment for fusion energy here in Canada. It speaks to the spirit of exploration, innovation, and collaboration. This new Centre better connects CNL’s deep experience and globally unique capabilities in tritium and materials research with the industrial partners seeking to move this promising clean energy technology towards deployment," noted Dr. Stephen Bushby, Vice-President, Science & Technology, CNL.

“OPG has a long history of leadership in Canada’s nuclear industry, and we recognize the role fusion may play in meeting Ontario’s – and the world’s – future clean energy needs,” said Kim Lauritsen, OPG Senior Vice President, Enterprise Strategy and Growth. “As this technology moves toward commercial implementation, OPG — through the CFE — will work to develop a domestic fusion ecosystem that positions Ontario and Canada as leaders in this rapidly-developing technology.”

“Canada's nuclear expertise and its unique global competitive advantages make it an ideal place to accelerate fusion energy development,” said Spencer Pitcher, Stellarex’s Chief Executive Officer-Designate. “With our provincial and federal government partners, Stellarex will strengthen Canada’s fusion energy know-how, build fusion energy prototypes, and prepare the fusion-ready workforce needed to deliver fusion power to the grid.”

QUICK FACTS

The Centre for Fusion Energy is a public-private partnership that will bring together leaders in the clean energy space, further scientific cooperation, and make Canada a preferred destination for fusion investment.

The federal government, through Atomic Energy of Canada and Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, is contributing $33M in research activities over three years.

The Centre for Fusion Energy is one of several investments in fusion energy that Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and the federal government are making. This includes support for General Fusion, and investing in Fusion Fuel Cycles, a joint venture between Canadian Nuclear Laboratories and Kyoto Fusioneering, which is pursuing the UNITY-2 test facility for the demonstration of the fusion fuel cycle, to be located at Atomic Energy of Canada Limited’s Chalk River Laboratories.

Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and Canadian Nuclear Laboratories have been pulling together an ecosystem in Canada and have published an initial national strategy roadmap in co-operation with industry.

[TITLE]LG Chem plans to sell LG Energy Solution stake for shareholder returns:
[TEXT]
SEOUL :South Korea's LG Chem Ltd said on Friday it plans to lower its stake in subsidiary LG Energy Solution to about 70 per cent from around 80 per cent, in a bid to improve long-term finance and boost shareholder returns, according to a company filing.

Shares of LG Chem fell 2.9 per cent in Seoul trading, while LG Energy Solution's stock plunged 6 per cent.

LG Chem maintained its earlier target of offering a 30 per cent dividend payout to shareholders in the future when the firm achieves a return-on-equity ratio of at least 10 per cent.

President Lee Jae Myung is pushing publicly listed companies to resolve the so-called "Korea Discount", which refers to a tendency for local companies to have lower valuations than global peers due to factors such as low dividend payouts, and the dominance of opaque conglomerates known as chaebols.

In October, LG Chem also faced a push from London-based hedge fund Palliser Capital in October, which blamed a heavy discount in stock valuation and "a lack of trust" in governance and poor capital allocation.

[TITLE]Price shocks force factories to dump gas for cleaner energy:
[TEXT]
Manufacturers, food processors and other industrial energy users in Australia are beginning to turn away from natural gas and adopt electric alternatives where possible to cut pollution and seize a competitive edge amid rising costs.

Factories that burn gas to create the heat and steam they need to make various products account for nearly a quarter of the nation’s overall energy use, making them major sources of planet-warming emissions. However, they are also considered among the most difficult areas of the economy to decarbonise.

As solar systems become cheaper and companies struggle with high energy prices, more businesses are adopting electric alternatives to gas. Credit: Brendon Thorne

That is slowly starting to change, a new report from the Smart Energy Council says, as solar systems, batteries and heat pumps become cheaper, and companies struggling with high fossil-fuel prices look for long-term operational savings.

While steel, cement and glass factories requiring extremely high-temperature heat still face a shortage of affordable cleaner alternatives, other gas users – from smaller manufacturers to farms and municipal facilities – are increasingly investing in technologies like heat pumps or thermal energy batteries, it says.

[TITLE]Oil Markets Lackluster Amid Russia Peace Deal, China’s Stockpiling:
[TEXT]
Sentiment in oil markets remains overwhelmingly negative, driven by perceived market oversupply and negative global demand indicators. Brent crude for January delivery was trading at $63.10 per barrel in Thursday’s intraday session, little changed from $62.97 a week ago while the corresponding WTI contract ticked up slightly to $58.70/bbl from $58.46. Meanwhile, the recent rally in oil product prices has cooled off, with ICE Gasoil-Brent crack dropping from a 35.84/bbl peak on 18 November to ~$26/bbl. This is partly due to the easing of panic over the delivery specification into the ICE gasoil futures contract.

Market focus remains firmly on the supply-side, with a view that any progress towards a ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine could lead to easing of heavy U.S. sanctions on Russian producers. The Trump administration has drafted a new 19-point peace plan that’s far more favorable to Ukraine compared to the original 28-point plan. Some of the critical amendments in the new plan include no handover of the Donbas region to Russia for free, no automatic veto on Ukraine joining NATO in the future, and provision of Article 5-style protection for Ukraine, meaning the U.S. would be bound to intervene if Russia invades in the future. A proposal for full amnesty for war crimes that was part of the first plan has also been removed.

China remains the leading buyer of Russian crude, with imports increasing by 275.6 kb/d over the past two months to ~2.15 mb/d. Overall, China’s crude imports have increased by 866 kb/d Y/Y to 11.44 mb/d as the country continues to stockpile crude. Rystad Energy estimates that China has stockpiled more than 1 million barrels of crude per day in some months, socking away nearly 160 million barrels in the first nine months of 2025. The buying spree has been triggered by strategic concerns like energy security and potential conflicts, as well as taking advantage of low oil prices. China is expected to continue stockpiling crude oil at least through 2026, supported by new laws and infrastructure development that allow for greater storage capacity, though some analysts suggest the pace might slow as storage limits are reached.

Potential U.S. intervention in Venezuela has also added to the bearish sentiment after the Trump administration designated Cartel de los Soles, which it alleges is led by President Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. The US’ Operation Southern Spear has been targeting boats suspected of trafficking drugs in the region, with the hawks linking the moves to Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the largest of any country.

Venezuelan oil production has been on a sharp decline since 2017, with a slew of sanctions prohibiting its access to financial markets. However, production has been slowly rising, from 360 kb/d in 2020 to around 1 mb/d currently, supported by black-market sales. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that it will take years before the South American country can hit peak production of around 2.5 mb/d that it achieved in the 2011-2015 period thanks to years of underinvestment in maturing oil fields as well as a lack of exploration drilling. Shortages of equipment, supplies and labour have also taken a toll on Venezuela’s energy sector. Further, the country is likely to have a hard time attracting fresh capital after the ConocoPhilips (NYSE:COP) debacle. The Venezuelan government under the late Hugo Chávez, and continued under Nicolás Maduro, expropriated ConocoPhillips' oil assets in 2007 during a wave of nationalizations of foreign oil investments. This led to ConocoPhillips receiving two major international arbitration awards totaling over $8 billion. Venezuela's attempts to annul the awards have failed, and ConocoPhillips is now pursuing legal avenues to enforce the rulings and collect the compensation from Venezuela's remaining overseas assets, such as those related to the Citgo refinery.

On the gas front, European natural gas prices have softened, with the front-month Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) contract for December delivery settling below EUR 30 per megawatt hour

(MWh) at EUR 29.5/MWh, its lowest settlement in 18 months. European natural gas inventories drew by 3.76 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 91.97bcm on 23 November, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. This marks the largest weekly fall in inventories since late February 2025. Recent cold weather has not supported prices, and there are now mild forecasts for the rest of December.

In contrast, U.S. gas prices have continued rallying, with gas futures hitting $4.6/MMBtu on falling inventories coupled with expectations of higher demand. Weather forecasts suggest temperatures will remain mostly below normal over the next two weeks, boosting demand. Further, U.S. LNG exports are rising, with flows averaging a record 18 bcfd in November, up from October’s 16.6 bcfd.

[TITLE]Carney's new Alberta oil pipeline deal already faces opposition:
[TEXT]
Carney's new Alberta oil pipeline deal already faces opposition

2 days ago Share Save Nadine Yousif Senior Canada reporter Share Save

Reuters Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and Prime Minister Mark Carney have signed a long-awaited agreement on a new pipeline

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has signed a deal with the province of Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific - a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but which faces significant hurdles. The deal marks a historic reset between Alberta and Ottawa, but is opposed by British Columbia Premier David Eby, who has called the yet-to-be-built pipeline a "distraction". The political challenges for Carney were later made clear with the resignation of a prominent cabinet minister and longtime environmentalist following the deal's announcement. The energy accord exempts Alberta's proposed pipeline from some federal climate laws.

In exchange, Alberta must increase its carbon pricing and develop the world's largest carbon capture programme in a bid to reduce its overall emissions. For Alberta, Thursday's deal is a "first step" to seeing its proposed pipeline become a reality. Premier Danielle Smith said it signalled the end of "dark times" for her province, which she argued had long been hampered from developing its resources. Carney, meanwhile, said he supports Alberta's project as being crucial for the country's economic development by helping sell more Canadian oil to Asian markets. Eby expressed his frustration that his province was not included in discussions leading up to the agreement. "It would have been good for BC to be at the table," he told reporters on Thursday. "No question about it." He noted that the project did not have a private backer or buy-in from First Nations communities - both significant challenges to it being built. Federal culture minister Steven Guilbeault announced on Thursday evening that he had resigned from Carney's cabinet, saying he is strongly opposed to the energy agreement and believed the pipeline Alberta was proposing "would have major environmental impacts". Guilbeault previously served as environment minister and had worked for the global climate advocacy group Greenpeace before entering politics. He made headlines in 2001 for scaling Toronto's CN Tower as part of a climate campaign along with British activist Chris Holden. He said on Thursday that he believed many elements of the climate action plan he implemented as environment minister "have been, or are about to be, dismantled". In response, Carney said his government shared Guilbeault's "fundamental commitment to climate ambition and climate competitiveness for Canada".

[TITLE]Challenges and Prospects in the Global Power Rental Market, 2025-2030: Data Centers and Grid Instability Drive Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Power Rental Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Power Rental Market, valued at USD 22.83 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.39% to reach USD 37.02 Billion by 2030. Growth is primarily driven by rapid industrialization, ongoing global infrastructure development, rising energy demand across multiple sectors, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that necessitate emergency power.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing need for continuous and reliable power supply is a crucial driver of the global power rental market, as industries rely on uninterrupted energy to maintain productivity and prevent financial losses. Data centers, for example, require consistent power beyond what traditional grids can reliably provide. The International Energy Agency's March 2024 Electricity 2024 report indicates that global electricity consumption from data centers is expected to more than double, rising from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh by 2026.

Simultaneously, grid instability caused by aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and integration challenges with renewable energy sources drives demand for temporary power solutions. According to NERC's June 2024 State of Reliability report, wind resources experienced forced outage rates of 18.9% in 2023, up from 18.1% in 2022, contributing to grid unreliability. Strong industry performance reflects this demand: Aggreko reported annual sales of USD 2.85 billion for the year ending December 28, 2024, a 14% increase over 2023, as noted by International Rental News in April 2025.

Key Market Challenges

A major challenge to the global power rental market lies in the substantial capital expenditure required to procure, maintain, and upgrade fleets of power generation and distribution assets. These investments significantly strain profitability and can restrict the competitive capabilities of smaller firms. The high capital intensity creates barriers to entry and inherently favors large, established players with stronger financial capacity.

According to the European Rental Association, equipment investment across the European rental market was expected to remain flat in 2023 following a 4.2% increase in 2022, illustrating the constraining financial environment. These conditions limit innovation and expansion opportunities, ultimately slowing broader market growth.

Key Market Trends

Growing Adoption of Hybrid and Renewable Energy Solutions is a pivotal trend shaping the global power rental market. Companies increasingly deploy hybrid systems that combine conventional generators with battery storage or solar power, driven by stricter environmental regulations and rising corporate sustainability goals.

Aggreko invested over USD 140 million across 2023 and 2024 to expand its Greener Upgrades fleet, including battery systems designed to reduce emissions and optimize fuel consumption. This shift is reinforced by declining renewable energy costs; according to IRENA's 2025 Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2024 report, total installed costs for most renewable power technologies fell by more than 10% from 2023 to 2024.
