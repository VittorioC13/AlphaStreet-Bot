[TITLE]The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology Publishes Long Term Results from the QALSODY Phase 3 VALOR Study and its Open-Label Extension in SOD1-ALS:
[TEXT]
Long-term data published in JAMA Neurology further illustrate the effects of Biogen’s QALSODY on function, strength, and survival in SOD1-ALS

Over 3 years, a subset of QALSODY-treated participants regained previously lost function and strength, something not previously reported in the natural history of SOD1-ALS

Biogen is committed to advancing additional ALS research, including the ongoing QALSODY ATLAS study in pre-symptomatic SOD1-ALS and a robust discovery pipeline in ALS

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) – today announced that The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology has published final results from the completed Phase 3 VALOR study and its open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating QALSODY® (tofersen) for the treatment of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with over 3.5 years of follow-up. These results show that early initiation of QALSODY was associated with numerically slower decline in measures of clinical function, breathing and strength, as well as reduction in the risk of death or permanent ventilation. Sustained reductions in neurofilament, a marker of neurodegeneration, further validate the clinical results and demonstrate QALSODY’s impact on the underlying biology of SOD1-ALS.

“The final VALOR/OLE data further emphasize that, with the right target paired with the right therapeutic approach, we have the potential to meaningfully impact the course of ALS and improve the outlook for people living with this devastating disease. Supported by these data, treatment-driven reductions in neurofilament are now being used as an early decision-making endpoint to accelerate future research,” said Stephanie Fradette, Pharm.D., Head of the Neuromuscular Development Unit at Biogen. “We are excited to share this progress which would not have been possible without the study participants and their caregivers, investigators and site staff, and all who have contributed to the development of QALSODY over many years.”

QALSODY 100 mg/15mL injection is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in adults who have a mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. In the United States, QALSODY received accelerated approval based on reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) observed in patients treated with QALSODY. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).

QALSODY has received approval in 44 countries around the world, including accelerated approval in the US and conditional or standard approval in other countries.
