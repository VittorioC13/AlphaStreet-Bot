Brussels, Belgium (AFP) Oct 23, 2025

The Netherlands' seizure of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia was not a "measure against China", Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said Thursday as trade tensions spike between Europe and Beijing.

Dutch officials invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to effectively take control of Nexperia, citing national security concerns, as chip manufacturing increasingly becomes a focus of geopolitical tensions.

The company says Beijing has, in turn, banned it from exporting certain goods from China since October 4.

Activist: Starboard Value

Ownership: Starboard Value

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 18 prior industrial companies and their average return on these situations is 50.55% versus an average of 11.73% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Starboard has taken a total of 162 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.13% versus 14.24% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Fluor and stated their intention to unlock value from the company's ~39% holding in NuScale Power , which represents more than 60% of the company's market capitalization, including through a potential separation.

Behind the scenes

Fluor delivers integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and project management services, spanning a diversified set of end markets. Historically, the EPCM market was a highly competitive landscape that led to heavy risk taking, where growth was often prioritized over discipline and profitability. For Fluor, as well as much of the industry, this led to management aggressively increasing their backlog of higher-risk lump-sum and guaranteed minimum contracts, leading to execution risks, thin margins and cost overruns. Ultimately, this industry-wide shift caused many companies to scale back their construction efforts or even enter bankruptcy, and Fluor was no exception, with the company's share price falling below $4 in March 2020.

However, this started to change when the company appointed David Constable as CEO at the start of 2021. Under his leadership, Fluor immediately pivoted to lower-risk reimbursable projects, growing from 45% of its backlog to 80%, while exposure to loss-making legacy projects have declined from $1.8 billion to $558 million today, materially reducing its risk profile.

Additionally, while largely associated with legacy energy projects, the company has levered into faster growing markets within its urban solutions segment, now 73% of its backlog compared to 37% in fiscal year 2021. As a result, even with this derisking effort, Fluor was still able to maintain a steady backlog and achieve meaningful EBITDA growth, a 14% compound annual growth rate from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal 2024, with analysts projecting a ~9% CAGR from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028.

With many of the large construction and EPCM players having exited the market, Fluor's operational turnaround has allowed it to come out the other side of this turmoil on top, now operating in a duopoly of global end-to-end EPCM players with Bechtel, while the construction market has grown rapidly, now over $918 billion.

As a result of this successful operational overhaul, the market currently values Fluor at 8.9 time its enterprise value to calendar year 2027 estimates for consensus EBITDA, in between its EPCM (13x) and legacy construction peers (6x). So, Fluor appears to be a great business with a great management team operating in a duopoly in a growing industry that is fairly valued with a $6.7 billion enterprise value. However, Fluor also owns a 39% stake in NuScale, a publicly traded small modular nuclear reactor company.

Fluor invested in NuScale more than a decade ago, and its $30 million early investment played a pivotal in NuScale becoming the first U.S.-listed SMR company, and the only company of its kind with U.S. Nuclear Reactor Commission design approval.

As global power demand continues to rise, particularly alongside the data center boom, nuclear generation will be vital, and SMRs will play an essential role in providing energy to meet this growth. As a result, Fluor's investment in NuScale has been highly lucrative – valued at approximately $4.3 billion ($3.4 billion post tax). That's more than half Fluor's current enterprise value.

If you were to back out the NuScale stake from Fluor's valuation, then Fluor's enterprise value would drop to $3.3 billion, implying an extremely depressed discount of just 4.6x, with peers trading from 6 to 13 times.

Starboard has amassed a nearly 5% position in Fluor and is urging management to unlock the value from its NuScale holdings. Starboard believes that Fluor has multiple paths to monetize its remaining NuScale stake. These options include simply selling their position through open-market sales, an exchange offer or a mandatory exchangeable bond, with proceeds potentially funding a large share buyback, which would be highly accretive to Fluor's EPS, especially at its currently depressed valuation.

Alternatively, Starboard has proposed a tax-free spinoff of Fluor's NuScale position, which could trigger a similar rerating of the core business while providing Fluor shareholders with the option to retain their exposure to NuScale's long-term potential.

Thus, assuming Fluor maintains an 8.9x EBITDA multiple, which still could be improved upon given its discount to EPCM peers, the rerating that could come from this separation could yield over 200% of upside.

Starboard is a very experienced activist and also has a history in this industry. In June 2019, Starboard engaged another construction player, AECOM, where over the ensuing multiyear engagement, AECOM refreshed its board, appointed a new CEO, exited self-perform construction, and divested management services. This became one of Starboard's most lucrative engagements in its history, returning 147% over its 13D filling versus 26% for the Russell 2000.

But more importantly, this is when they met David Constable for the first time. Constable is the executive chairman of Fluor, and until February, was its CEO. So, we expect that the mutual respect between Starboard and Constable will be conducive to an amicable, constructive relationship and beneficial to shareholders.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]European Aerospace Giants Unite to Challenge SpaceX - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
European Aerospace Giants Unite to Combat SpaceX’s Starlink in the Satellite Industry

European aerospace groups have announced a preliminary agreement to consolidate their struggling satellite manufacturing businesses. This deal, reached after months of negotiations, is aimed at countering the increasingly competitive landscape dominated by Elon Musk’s Starlink, according to reports. The move signifies a major shift in the European space industry.

The long-awaited agreement involves Airbus, Thales, and Leonardo. The new joint venture is slated to commence operations in 2027, pending approval from European regulators. These regulators have previously shown resistance to similar consolidation attempts. This merger is a critical step for European space companies to remain competitive.

In a joint statement, the companies revealed that the new entity (yet to be named) will employ 25,000 people across Europe, with an annual revenue of 6.5 billion euros (approximately $7.58 billion USD) based on 2024 figures. The European aerospace industry hopes this combined effort will bolster its position.

Airbus will hold a 35% stake, while Thales and Leonardo will each own 32.5%. The statement emphasizes that the company will operate under joint control with a “balanced administrative structure.” This distribution of ownership is a key element of the aerospace alliance.

The companies project that this consolidation will generate millions of euros in annual operating income within five years. The deal is being viewed as a strategic alliance to enhance satellite technology and space exploration capabilities.

The negotiations, codenamed “Project Bromo,” began last year and were inspired by the collaboration model of European missile manufacturer MBDA, which is jointly owned by Airbus, Leonardo, and BAE Systems. This approach aims to leverage combined resources for advanced satellite development and space missions.

Europe’s leading satellite manufacturers have long competed in building complex spacecraft for geostationary orbit. However, the rise of cheaper, smaller satellites launched into low Earth orbit has significantly impacted their businesses. The emergence of new space companies like SpaceX is changing the market dynamics.

The CEOs of the three companies stated in a joint release that this merger will help European governments “ensure Europe’s autonomy in the strategic space sector.” This highlights the importance of maintaining a strong presence in the global space market. European autonomy in space is a key strategic goal.

Under the agreement, the product and service activities of two joint ventures between Thales and Leonardo – Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio – will be integrated, along with certain space and digital businesses of Airbus, and the remaining space businesses of Thales SESO and Leonardo. The integration is expected to optimize operations and reduce redundancies in the satellite industry.

These companies have already cut approximately 3,000 jobs in the space sector. While the new agreement does not mention further reductions, the companies stated that they will consult with labor unions. The impact on European space sector jobs remains a concern.

Reports indicate that the three aerospace groups reached a preliminary agreement on the basic outline of the satellite business integration earlier this week, solidifying their commitment to the joint venture.

The deal nearly collapsed last summer due to disagreements over administrative structure and valuation. However, sources suggest that a final agreement was eventually reached, paving the way for this significant transformation in the European space industry.

Mumbai: India is proving to be a tough market to navigate for global automakers, with the exception of some Japanese and Korean car companies. To find traction in this market, the third largest in the world with plenty of room for growth, some of these automakers are exploring options that include partnerships with Indian business houses, which may be operating in a different industry but can provide support to navigate policy uncertainties and market insights. They already have a template in the MG Motor-JSW Group joint venture.Big American automakers General Motors and Ford have left India after failing to build a sustainable business here. Meanwhile, foreign companies that have built local joint ventures, such as Skoda-Volkswagen and Renault-Nissan, have yet to find sustained success in the Indian market, even after decades of presence and product renewals here.As the market tightens and technology and consumer preferences shift rapidly, industry executives and analysts said some of these companies, as well as new entrants like Vietnam’s VinFast and Chinese automakers BYD, Geely and Chery, are considering local partnerships. “India is no longer an easy market to read,” said an auto analyst with a leading brokerage. “Demand has become fragmented, regulations keep evolving and competition is cutthroat. Companies without scale or deep local understanding find it hard to sustain distribution and after-sales support. Partnering with an Indian player may be the only viable way to stay relevant.”Global automakers have long viewed India as a market of promise — high growth potential, a large young population and increasing incomes. But turning that promise into profitability has proved elusive for most. The Renault-Nissan alliance, once buoyed by models like the Kwid and Duster, has seen its market share erode. The Skoda-Volkswagen group’s ‘India 2.0’ project has brought new products like the Kushaq and Slavia, yet volumes remain modest in a market that sold nearly 4.3 million cars and utility vehicles in 2024.Unlike Japan’s Maruti Suzuki, Korea’s Hyundai and Kia, or homegrown players Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, most global automakers have yet to fully decode the Indian buyer’s mix of value, reliability and affordability. Japan’s Toyota Motor, which has a local minority partner in Kirloskar, and Honda have seen success in certain segments. “Hyundai and Kia have a strong local supply base, India-first product strategy, and aggressive market positioning. The two Korean brands now account for over a quarter of all passenger vehicle sales," said a Mumbai-based analyst. "That’s why India is now their growth engine globally."Companies like Maruti Suzuki, Tata and Mahindra have invested for the long haul and built strong supplier and dealer networks. Several global automakers have been hesitant or underinvested in these areas. Having a local partner could matter in these circumstances. For several global brands, the missing piece has been a dependable local ally, said industry experts. Beyond capital, such a partner can provide policy assurance, local market knowledge and help understand regulatory complexities — especially critical for companies from geopolitically sensitive regions such as China. “A domestic partner can lend credibility and continuity, particularly when regulatory frameworks are unpredictable,” said a senior executive of a car company. “It can also improve after-sales reach and dealer confidence, areas where most foreign OEMs lag due to low volumes.”Chinese-owned British brand MG Motor tied up with Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Group after it found bringing foreign investment to scale up difficult amid worsening India-China relations. JSW bought a 35% stake in MG Motor India from China’s SAIC Motor in late 2023, which has helped the brand gain local credibility, expansion headroom and policy comfort. French automaker Renault is reportedly in early discussions with the JSW Group for a potential joint venture in India, as it seeks to strengthen its India presence. Its market share in India remains less than 1%.JSW Motors, the SAIC-JSW Group joint venture, is also in talks with other automakers like BYD and Skoda VW for technology and platform access, as it actively seeks new partnerships to expand its presence in the electric mobility segment. Chery Automobile will provide components to the JSW Group, facilitating the launch of a new-energy vehicle brand in India by 2027. “We will have collaborations to draw upon the unique strengths of industry-leading partners from around the world like sourcing proven EV and battery technologies from China, design and safety excellence from Europe, software and connectivity from the US, and combining them with India’s manufacturing strength and digital agility,” said JSW Motors chief executive Ranjan Nayak.Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast, meanwhile, said it is always open to collaborating with potential strategic partners in India. “Several experienced local suppliers have already reached out to us with partnership proposals, which we are currently reviewing," said its India CEO Tapan Kumar Ghosh. A spokesperson for Skoda Auto Volkswagen India said India is a key market in Škoda Auto’s internationalisation plans. “To fully explore the country’s growth potential, we are always considering new business opportunities and are evaluating various options to ensure the best possible solution to implement our strategy in the highly dynamic Indian market.” Skoda Auto Volkswagen India and Mahindra had explored a partnership, but the talks have now stalled. Companies such as Renault and Geely did not comment on potential plans for a partnership. Industry sources said exploratory talks were taking place quietly.To achieve sustainable growth, automakers in India must collaborate and form strategic partnerships, said Kavan Mukhtyar, leader automotive at PwC India. “With technology becoming increasingly disruptive, the need for significant investment and profitable expansion is driving automakers to actively explore alliances and joint ventures,” he said. Ravi Bhatia, president of automobile consultancy Jato Dynamics, said local support will help foreign automakers scale operations as well as cut costs. “Renault with its underutilised Chennai plant (33% capacity) boasts modular architecture, but needs partners to scale exports and leverage India's 50% localisation mandates for duty cuts,” he said. “Strategic partnerships could bridge gaps, cutting EV costs by 15-20%.”However, experts caution that local tie-ups are no guarantee of success. Past alliances such as Mahindra-Ford and Premier Automobiles-Peugeot underscore the risks of mismatched strategies and governance issues. “Partnerships only work when both sides bring more than money; they need long-term commitment and strategic alignment,” said an auto industry veteran. “Many earlier JVs failed because the foreign partner saw India as an export base, not a domestic growth story.”For now, several global automakers are leaning on exports from their Indian plants to stay viable, even as their domestic market share remains marginal. With India’s position in the global automobile market continuing to grow, analysts believe localisation in manufacturing, products and management will determine who thrives. “India rewards long-term commitment,” said an analyst. “Without it, even the biggest global brands will remain on the fringes.”

The federal government shutdown continues and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it.

The Senate failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.

It's payday for many federal employees who will not be receiving a paycheck — the first full paycheck they've missed as part of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.

[TITLE]Carney’s Nuclear Detour: Darlington’s SMRs Will Raise Prices, Emissions, & Political Risks:
[TEXT]
In October 2025, the federal government officially designated the four-unit SMR build at Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington site as a “Major Project” and invested $2 billion through the Canada Growth Fund, alongside $1 billion from the provincial Building Ontario Fund, signalling that the federal government views the SMR programme both as a national-industrial priority and a pillar of Canada’s clean-power strategy. This upfront funding and symbolic anointment embed the SMR scheme at the core of Prime Minister Carney’s climate-industrial agenda—tying his legacy to its success and subjecting his broader ambitions to the reactor’s performance.

Ontario once led the world in nuclear engineering. The province built its grid around CANDU reactors designed, manufactured, and operated by Canadians. Those heavy-water machines provided decades of reliable electricity and created thousands of high-skill jobs. They also anchored a domestic supply chain that made Canada one of the few countries with full nuclear sovereignty. Now, as the world turns toward flexible, low-cost renewables, Ontario is making a different bet. With Mark Carney’s backing and the provincial government’s enthusiasm, it is building the first GE Hitachi small modular reactor at Darlington. It is a decision that will look visionary to some today, but in a decade it will look like a strategic error.

Carney’s ambition to build a clean, secure industrial future for Canada is genuine. His economic credibility and climate focus give him the moral authority to act. But in aligning himself with an American-owned, first-of-a-kind reactor technology, he has made a choice that will come back to haunt him. The project promises jobs, energy security, and innovation, but it delivers higher costs, greater complexity, and new dependencies. The evidence is already clear. Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington site is the province’s largest single employer, and the refurbishment program for the existing reactors is providing steady, high-paying work. The new SMRs are not needed to sustain that prosperity. What they will bring is financial exposure and an energy mix less aligned with what Ontario actually needs.

Darlington alone employs roughly 15,000 people directly and indirectly in a region with only 70,000 workers. Those jobs are secure for decades through ongoing refurbishment and operations, with the current CANDU reactors expected to be extended to 2065, an unprecedented 80+ years. Average wages are among the highest in the province. It is by far the largest and best paying employer around. Adding four small modular reactors does not create a new employment base. It diverts billions of dollars toward a first-of-a-kind nuclear experiment that will be built by foreign technology vendors and managed under unfamiliar regulatory frameworks. For the region, this is not an economic development project. It is an engineering gamble wrapped in the rhetoric of innovation.

The GE Hitachi BWRX-300 is a light-water boiling reactor that bears little resemblance to the CANDU systems Ontario’s nuclear workforce knows intimately. It requires enriched uranium, not natural fuel. It has a fixed refuelling cycle, not continuous on-power refuelling. It depends on U.S. supply chains for core components and fuel assemblies. Ontario’s nuclear professionals, from control-room operators to maintenance crews, have spent their careers mastering CANDU systems. They will have to relearn an entirely different technology under a regulatory regime still being defined. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has no operating precedent for this design, and its licensing process must be harmonized with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The result is a project that combines first-of-a-kind technical risk with first-of-its-kind regulatory uncertainty.

Bent Flyvbjerg’s megaproject database—now in the tens of thousands of cases across sectors—shows nuclear among the worst performers for cost and schedule reliability, with a dedicated nuclear new-build reference class of roughly 194 projects used in recent risk analyses. From that record, reference class forecasting (RCF) gives decision-grade uplifts: at P50, add

Activist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 18 prior industrial companies and their average return on these situations is 50.55% versus an average of 11.73% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Starboard has taken a total of 162 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.13% versus 14.24% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Fluor and stated their intention to unlock value from the company's ~39% holding in NuScale Power , which represents more than 60% of the company's market capitalization, including through a potential separation.

Behind the scenes

Fluor delivers integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and project management services, spanning a diversified set of end markets. Historically, the EPCM market was a highly competitive landscape that led to heavy risk taking, where growth was often prioritized over discipline and profitability. For Fluor, as well as much of the industry, this led to management aggressively increasing their backlog of higher-risk lump-sum and guaranteed minimum contracts, leading to execution risks, thin margins and cost overruns. Ultimately, this industry-wide shift caused many companies to scale back their construction efforts or even enter bankruptcy, and Fluor was no exception, with the company's share price falling below $4 in March 2020.

However, this started to change when the company appointed David Constable as CEO at the start of 2021. Under his leadership, Fluor immediately pivoted to lower-risk reimbursable projects, growing from 45% of its backlog to 80%, while exposure to loss-making legacy projects have declined from $1.8 billion to $558 million today, materially reducing its risk profile.

Additionally, while largely associated with legacy energy projects, the company has levered into faster growing markets within its urban solutions segment, now 73% of its backlog compared to 37% in fiscal year 2021. As a result, even with this derisking effort, Fluor was still able to maintain a steady backlog and achieve meaningful EBITDA growth, a 14% compound annual growth rate from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal 2024, with analysts projecting a ~9% CAGR from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028.

With many of the large construction and EPCM players having exited the market, Fluor's operational turnaround has allowed it to come out the other side of this turmoil on top, now operating in a duopoly of global end-to-end EPCM players with Bechtel, while the construction market has grown rapidly, now over $918 billion.

As a result of this successful operational overhaul, the market currently values Fluor at 8.9 time its enterprise value to calendar year 2027 estimates for consensus EBITDA, in between its EPCM (13x) and legacy construction peers (6x). So, Fluor appears to be a great business with a great management team operating in a duopoly in a growing industry that is fairly valued with a $6.7 billion enterprise value. However, Fluor also owns a 39% stake in NuScale, a publicly traded small modular nuclear reactor company.

Fluor invested in NuScale more than a decade ago, and its $30 million early investment played a pivotal in NuScale becoming the first U.S.-listed SMR company, and the only company of its kind with U.S. Nuclear Reactor Commission design approval.

As global power demand continues to rise, particularly alongside the data center boom, nuclear generation will be vital, and SMRs will play an essential role in providing energy to meet this growth. As a result, Fluor's investment in NuScale has been highly lucrative – valued at approximately $4.3 billion ($3.4 billion post tax). That's more than half Fluor's current enterprise value.

If you were to back out the NuScale stake from Fluor's valuation, then Fluor's enterprise value would drop to $3.3 billion, implying an extremely depressed discount of just 4.6x, with peers trading from 6 to 13 times.

Starboard has amassed a nearly 5% position in Fluor and is urging management to unlock the value from its NuScale holdings. Starboard believes that Fluor has multiple paths to monetize its remaining NuScale stake. These options include simply selling their position through open-market sales, an exchange offer or a mandatory exchangeable bond, with proceeds potentially funding a large share buyback, which would be highly accretive to Fluor's EPS, especially at its currently depressed valuation.

Alternatively, Starboard has proposed a tax-free spinoff of Fluor's NuScale position, which could trigger a similar rerating of the core business while providing Fluor shareholders with the option to retain their exposure to NuScale's long-term potential.

Thus, assuming Fluor maintains an 8.9x EBITDA multiple, which still could be improved upon given its discount to EPCM peers, the rerating that could come from this separation could yield over 200% of upside.

Starboard is a very experienced activist and also has a history in this industry. In June 2019, Starboard engaged another construction player, AECOM, where over the ensuing multiyear engagement, AECOM refreshed its board, appointed a new CEO, exited self-perform construction, and divested management services. This became one of Starboard's most lucrative engagements in its history, returning 147% over its 13D filling versus 26% for the Russell 2000.

But more importantly, this is when they met David Constable for the first time. Constable is the executive chairman of Fluor, and until February, was its CEO. So, we expect that the mutual respect between Starboard and Constable will be conducive to an amicable, constructive relationship and beneficial to shareholders.

[TITLE]Stand Secures $35 Million From Eclipse, Lowercarbon And Inspired Capital To Insure Homes Traditional Carriers Refuse To Touch:

Homeowners insurance provider for climate-exposed properties Stand on Oct. 16 announced it closed a $35 million Series B funding round. The financing was led by venture capital firm Eclipse, with participation from existing backers Inspired Capital, Lowercarbon Capital, and Equal Ventures.

San Francisco-based Stand launched over a year ago and said it has already written $1 billion in home insurance coverage across California.

According to the company, the early focus on wildfire-prone properties helped validate its risk-modeling approach and drew attention from major investors. The new capital will allow Stand to enter Florida, a market facing severe strain in homeowner policy availability.

Why Florida Represents The Nation’s Most Urgent Insurance Challenge

Florida carries more climate risk than any other state in the country. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data shows it has endured $94 billion weather disasters since 1980, with the latest seven accounting for more than $1 trillion in combined losses.

That level of exposure has strained Florida's insurance system and forced many homeowners to depend on state-run Citizens Property Insurance, which holds over $200 billion in potential liability, according to a company report. The number reflects how limited the private insurance market has become and how urgently new capacity is needed, Stand said.

According to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, U.S. weather and climate disasters have averaged nearly $150 billion in annual damages over the past several years. Stand said the mounting losses have driven several large insurers to retreat from high-risk regions, leaving many property owners struggling to maintain coverage as weather volatility intensifies.

“Insurance should play a central role in creating resilient communities,” Stand co-founder and CEO Dan Preston said in the company's statement. “The scale of risk in Florida demands a new model: One that links coverage to hardening homes against wind storms. That’s what Stand is building. By expanding into the largest catastrophe market in the country, we’re working hard to make this a reality for the world’s property owners.”

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

PROPOSED VENTURE AIMS TO COMPETE WITH ELON MUSK

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
