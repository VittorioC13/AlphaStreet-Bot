[TITLE]Karnataka eyes to attract $150 b investment in electronics manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Karnataka is targeting investments worth $150 billion in mobile and electronic product manufacturing and design over the next decade.

Industries Minister MB Patil held discussions on Thursday with a delegation led by Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), to chart a roadmap for the sector.

The Union Ministry of Electronics and IT launched an electronics components manufacturing scheme in April 2024, offering performance-linked incentives and up to 25 per cent capital subsidy.

The Centre has allocated ₹22,900 crore for the program, which prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment.

Pankaj Mohindroo said the Union scheme prioritises sub-assemblies such as displays and camera modules, bare components, and essential manufacturing equipment. He added that the programme offers performance-linked incentives and up to 25 per cent capital subsidy. The Centre has earmarked ₹22,900 crore for the scheme, he said.

Karnataka is also now exploring the possibility of introducing a parallel State-level scheme, noted Patil. “The proposal is still in the draft stage, and we welcome suggestions from ICEA,” Patil said after the meeting.

Till November 2024, the Union Government had approved 17 investment proposals worth ₹7,172 crore under the scheme. These projects are expected to create 11,800 direct jobs and generate products valued at over ₹65,000 crore, said Mohindroo.

The meeting was attended by Industries Department Principal Secretary S Selvakumar, Industries Commissioner Gunjan Krishna, and other senior officials.

[TITLE]India Invests in Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
India Approves $7 Billion Plan to Boost Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing

The Indian government has approved a significant rare earth manufacturing program worth approximately $7 billion (7 billion Rupees). This ambitious initiative, known as the ‘Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Manufacturing Promotion Scheme,’ represents a major step towards establishing a robust domestic rare earth permanent magnet (REPM) production capacity in India.

According to India’s Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the program aims to achieve an integrated annual production capacity of 6,000 metric tons of REPM. These magnets are considered among the most powerful permanent magnets available and are crucial components in various rapidly growing industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defense.

The approved plan will foster the development of integrated manufacturing facilities. These facilities will cover the entire process from converting rare earth oxides into metals, metals into alloys, and finally, alloys into finished rare earth permanent magnets. This integrated approach is expected to streamline production and reduce reliance on external suppliers.

The surge in demand for rare earth materials and rare earth magnets is primarily driven by the rapid expansion of EVs, the renewable energy sector, diverse industrial applications, and increasing consumption of consumer electronics. Currently, India heavily relies on imports to meet its demand. In the fiscal year ending March 2025, the country imported around 53,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets.

Currently, China dominates the market for these essential elements. Recently China has tightened export regulations on these magnets, especially after the US increased tariffs. Rare earth magnets are permanent magnets made from alloys of rare earth elements. Their power makes them indispensable for devices like electric motors, generators, and hard disk drives.

Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, creating a substance with enhanced properties. Rare earth magnets are known for their superior magnetic strength, high coercivity, and strong energy production capabilities. Magnetic strength defines a magnet’s power to attract or repel another magnet. Coercivity is the resistance of a magnet to demagnetization.

Energy product describes the total magnetic energy that a magnet can store. The high magnetic strength of rare earth magnets stems from the large number of unpaired electrons in their alloys, creating an exceptionally powerful magnetic field.

The high coercivity is attributed to the high magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which aligns the magnetic moments of atoms within the magnet strongly in one direction, making it difficult to demagnetize.

The high energy product of rare earth magnets is a result of the combination of their high strength and high coercivity, enabling them to store substantial amounts of energy.

Key Applications of Rare Earth Magnets:

* Electric Motors

* Generators

* Hard Disk Drives

* MRI Machines

* Headphones

* Microphones

* Magnetic Separators

* Magnetic Bearings

* Magnetic Jewelry

This initiative is poised to transform India’s manufacturing landscape, creating new opportunities in the rare earth magnets sector and contributing to the growth of various key industries.

[TITLE]Sculptor Capital Closes $4.6B Real Estate Fund, Exceeding Target by $1.6B – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Sculptor Capital Management exceeded its own expectations in its latest fundraising round, and by “exceeded” we mean by more than $1 billion in investment capital.

The global alternative asset management firm, whose real estate business has completed $27 billion worth of investments over 22 years, announced this week the final close of Sculptor Real Estate Fund V with $4.6 billion in commitments, exceeding the firm’s $3 billion target value by $1.6 billion.

The close marks a significant growth and evolution in Sculptor’s fundraising for CRE and is the firm’s largest fund to date. The firm’s previous four funds closed with totals of $408 million, $840 million, $1.5 billion, and $2.6 billion.

Moreover, Fund V’s closing comes attached with a complementary closing of $825 million of co-investment capital that will also be used for commercial real estate credit and equity deals and allow those investors to participate directly.

Steven Orbuch, founder and president of Sculptor Real Estate at Sculpture Capital, said that since the firm’s inception in 2003 it has prioritized investing in “nontraditional real estate” that provides income and total returns with “less macro correlation and lower volatility.”

“Our broad sector diversification, long-tenured team, and disciplined investment approach have uniquely positioned us to identify and capitalize on the exciting opportunities that exist and deliver consistent, risk-adjusted returns to our investors,” said Orbuch in a statement.

A spokesperson for Sculptor Capital told CO that the fund will invest predominantly in both the United States and Europe and will aim to take positions in “value-based, situationally opportunistic investments.”

The fund will be asset-class agnostic but prioritize hospitality, gaming and leisure, digital infrastructure, health care, logistics and cold storage, though it will remain open to dozens of others core classes and alternatives, according to a release.

“[We] look forward to continuing to focus on generating opportunistic returns with modest leverage and attractive current cash yields,” said Nicholas Hecker, chief investment officer of Sculptor Real Estate.

The firm did not name any specific investors or sources of the fundraising capital.

[TITLE]Rail Vision Enters the Quantum Transportation Market with Strategic Acquisition Agreement:
[TEXT]
Ra’anana, Israel, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rail Vision Ltd. (Nasdaq: RVSN) (“Rail Vision” or the “Company”), an early commercialization stage technology company seeking to revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today announced the signing of an agreement for a strategic transaction to acquire 51% ownership of Quantum Transportation Ltd. (the “Acquisition” and “Quantum Transportation”), a cutting-edge quantum computing and AI company specializing in error correction technologies. The closing of the Acquisition is expected to close in late December 2025 to early January 2026, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Quantum Transportation holds an exclusive sub license, for rail technologies and platforms, for an innovative pending patent application in quantum error correction owned by Ramot , the technology transfer company of the Tel Aviv University. This IP and additional know-how addresses critical challenges in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices by enabling efficient, real-time decoding of surface code errors, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to traditional methods and supporting scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Through this transaction, Rail Vision and Quantum Transportation aim to combine quantum-AI based intellectual property (IP) protection and innovation with Rail Vision’s advanced vision and railway-safety technologies.

This strategic combination is expected to create meaningful technological synergies, enhance Rail Vision’s current and future product lines, accelerate innovation, and support long-term value creation for stakeholders.

Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Rail Vision will issue ordinary shares representing approximately 4.99% of its issued and outstanding share capital, immediately prior to such issuance, to certain Quantum Transportation shareholders (the “Exchanging Shareholders”) in exchange for their full holdings in Quantum Transportation, representing 51% ownership of Quantum Transportation Ltd. and securing majority control post-closing.

Additionally, upon the closing of the Acquisition, Rail Vision will extend a convertible loan of up to $700,000 to Quantum Transportation at an 8% annual interest rate, disbursed in tranches to support Quantum Transportation's ongoing operations and development roadmap for the next 18 months. The loan, including principal and interest, shall be repayable in one payment within a 24-month term. Rail Vision will have the sole discretion to convert the outstanding amount into Quantum Transportation’s most senior class of shares, at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) the valuation implied by the share exchange in the current acquisition or (ii) the price per share in a future equity investment in Quantum Transportation, subject to certain conditions.

Quantum Transportation’s sub-licensed, machine learning-based universal decoder pending patent represents a potential breakthrough in quantum error correction, addressing the inherent noise in qubits that limit scalable quantum computing. This technology, developed by leading computer science experts and protected as patented IP, is code-agnostic, noise-aware, and scalable. This enables it to adapt seamlessly across various hardware platforms and code sizes and empowers quantum hardware companies and labs, particularly small- to medium-sized entities, to research and select optimal error correction schemes without in-house teams.

By utilizing this IP for transportation applications, including railway, Rail Vision aims to unlock new capabilities in anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and autonomous rail operations, capitalizing on the growing quantum computing market projected to drive exponential advancements in transportation.

Overland Park, KS and New York, NY, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Precision Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc., a high-growth aerospace & defense engineering and manufacturing firm, and FACT II Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: FACT), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement. Upon closing of the proposed business combination, the combined company will operate under the name Precision Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc. The transaction implies an enterprise value of up to $320 million for PAD (assuming a $10.00 per share price and after giving effect to certain pending acquisitions). It is expected that the combined company will continue to be led by PAD’s existing management team, with Brent Borden remaining as Chief Executive Officer.

PAD’s Platform – PAD has rapidly expanded via strategic acquisitions into a robust multi-platform business delivering mission-critical products and services across the aerospace, defense, and space sectors. PAD operates through three complementary divisions – engineering & sustainment, precision manufacturing, and advanced non-destructive testing – each possessing deep technical expertise and specialized certifications in support of critical programs. PAD’s engineering & sustainment unit provides custom design, reverse engineering, and MRO solutions to extend the life of legacy military aircraft and systems. Its precision manufacturing division efficiently produces complex aerospace and defense components to exacting specifications, leveraging advanced CNC machining and assembly capabilities. PAD’s advanced non-destructive testing division offers specialized testing services and equipment to ensure the structural integrity of high-performance aerospace parts. This diversified suite of capabilities has historically made PAD a trusted partner to blue-chip defense contractors, OEMs, and U.S. government organizations, supported by multi-year contracts and a proven track record of quality and on-time delivery. PAD’s solutions play a mission-critical role in arenas ranging from military fleet sustainment and next-generation hypersonic flight systems to commercial aviation fleets and cutting-edge space launch infrastructure. PAD operates multiple AS9100-certified and ITAR-registered facilities across the United States, reflecting its commitment to rigorous quality standards and compliance with defense regulations.

In addition, PAD intends to continue to execute on its accretive, programmatic acquisition strategy, adding highly specialized capabilities across its platform enabling it to provide a full suite of service solutions to its existing and pipeline customer base. There can be no assurance that any planned acquisitions will be completed.

Brent Borden, Chief Executive Officer of PAD, commented: “Today marks a pivotal milestone for PAD. This proposed business combination with FACT and our transition to a public company will provide significant growth capital and is a strong validation of the business we have built. Over the past few years, we have assembled a world-class engineering, manufacturing, and testing platform to address the most demanding needs of the aerospace, defense, and space industries. Our team’s relentless focus on innovation, quality, and execution has strategically positioned PAD with respect to key industry trends – from military fleet sustainment to the new space economy. We are thrilled to partner with FACT on this next chapter. We expect that the anticipated proceeds from and in connection with this transaction will allow us to accelerate product development, invest in cutting-edge equipment, and pursue strategic acquisitions already identified in our pipeline. Most importantly, it ensures we can continue to deliver exceptional value and performance to our customers and stakeholders. I am incredibly proud of what our employees have achieved to date, and I’m confident that as a public company, PAD will be even better positioned to drive innovation and growth in our sector.”

Adam Gishen, Chief Executive Officer of FACT, noted: “Our goal at FACT was to identify a high-quality, visionary company with strong fundamentals and an excellent management team – and we have found that in Precision Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc. Brent and his team have built an impressive platform with strategic end-to-end capabilities that meet the demands of their customers and the industry. PAD’s strategic positioning at the nexus of aerospace and defense modernization (including the increasing demand for efficiency and the burgeoning space sector) truly sets it apart. With a blue-chip customer base and multi-year contracts, PAD offers both stability and exciting growth prospects, coupled with strong free cash generation from operations. We believe PAD is poised for sustained expansion and value creation, and we are excited to partner with them to bring this outstanding business to the public markets. We look forward to working closely with the PAD team to support their strategic vision.”

Key Transaction Terms and Structure

Under the business combination agreement, PAD’s implied enterprise value is up to $320 million (at a $10.00 per share reference price and after giving effect to certain pending acquisitions). Key terms of the business combination include:

● Capital & Financing: In connection with the proposed business combination, PAD has entered into a non-binding indicative term sheet with BC Partners relating to a potential credit facility and equity financing of up to an anticipated aggregate amount of $80 million (the “Financing”). The Financing is subject to numerous conditions, including, without limitation, the completion of due diligence and the execution and delivery of definitive documentation. We anticipate that the Financing, together with the funds in FACT’s trust account (consisting of approximately $175 million in gross proceeds raised in FACT’s initial public offering, subject to any redemptions), would provide funding to strengthen PAD’s balance sheet, finance strategic acquisitions, and support ongoing growth. In addition, the parties may seek other sources of financing in connection with the business combination and to bolster PAD’s balance sheet and fund future growth initiatives. There can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be entered into in relation to the Financing or that the Financing or any other financing will be completed on the terms described, or at all. ● Incoming Capital: Incoming capital would permit PAD to optimize its balance sheet, consummate existing planned acquisitions and fund its future acquisition pipeline. Any additional cash to PAD’s balance sheet is expected to be used for general corporate purposes, positioning the combined company for robust growth post-closing. There can be no assurance that any planned acquisitions will be completed or additional funding will be consummated. ● Pro Forma Ownership Structure: Following the business combination, PAD’s current shareholders are expected to own approximately 59% of the combined company’s outstanding shares. ● Governance and Leadership: We anticipate that the combined company’s board of directors will include, among others, certain current directors of PAD, one designee by FACT’s sponsor, and independent directors with relevant industry experience. The combined company will remain headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, and PAD’s seasoned executive team will continue to lead day-to-day operations.
