[TITLE]American spirit exports to Canada 'plummeted' 85%, says U.S. trade group:
[TEXT]
American spirit exports to Canada "plummeted" 85 per cent in the second quarter of 2025, with the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States calling the situation "very troubling" as consumers in key international markets opt for alternatives to U.S.-made products amid trade tensions.

The numbers come as American alcohol largely remains off Canadian shelves and unavailable in bars and restaurants as a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Canadian goods in early March .

In a report issued earlier this week, the council said exports to the U.K. and Japan fell 29 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, but the largest decrease was in Canada. These countries, along with the European Union, accounted for 70 per cent of U.S. spirit exports in 2024.

The council represents producers of spirits such as whisky, vodka, rum and brandy.

"This shift may reflect a broader sentiment that U.S.-imposed tariffs are unfair, prompting consumers to support their domestic industries or seek non-U.S. products in response," the council wrote in a report, noting that sales to Canada had dropped below $10 million US in the second quarter.

In a news release, council CEO Chris Swonger said trade tensions are having an immediate and adverse effect on the export of U.S. spirits.

"We urge the President to help facilitate a lasting return to tariff-free trade with our longstanding trading partners to ensure the continued growth and vitality of this great industry,” he said.

The council did not respond to an interview request by deadline.

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canadian and American officials are negotiating terms of a deal on tariffs.

In late August, Brown-Forman, the parent company of alcohol producers such as Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve, said sales to Canada dropped 62 per cent during the first fiscal quarter of 2026, which concluded on July 31.

In an August conference call with investors, Brown-Forman CEO Lawson Whiting said the trade dispute has caused "significant headwinds."

"While our non-U.S. brands such as Diplomatico and El Jimador continued to deliver growth, they were not able to offset the decline of our brands that are produced in the U.S.," he said at the time.

Robert Huish, an associate professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax with an expertise in international affairs and tariffs, isn't surprised by the drop in U.S. spirit exports to Canada.

"Some of the biggest single purchasers of spirits from the U.S. are Canadian: the LCBO in Ontario and SAQ in Quebec," he said. "They are huge purchasers of American spirits and, of course, American wine as well, so to see the shelves bare would absolutely have an impact."

Nova Scotia sees jump in local alcohol sales

The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation, the Crown corporation that is the province's largest alcohol retailer, says the removal of American products from shelves has led to higher sales for local products.

From March 4 to Sept. 15, sales of Nova Scotia spirit products and wine increased 24.2 per cent and 15.1 per cent, respectively, compared to the same time a year ago.

Olivia Giffen, vice-president of marketing and retail at Coldstream Clear, a Nova Scotia spirits and beer producer, said its spirit sales have increased significantly.

"I do think that with everything going on, people were really looking for, 'OK, what are the products that I can now choose that are local?' and making that conscious decision to find products they still really enjoy in the taste, but a big bonus being that it is local," she told CBC's Information Morning recently.

Canadian wine and whisky see bump

The NSLC also said Canadian wine and whisky sales are up 8.9 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively, compared to a year ago.

Assuming the trade dispute gets resolved and American alcohol becomes widely available again, Huish expects some Canadian consumers will continue to buy Canadian.

"As we're hearing day after day, feelings are still hurt and many Canadians are in a position to think that that relationship with the U.S. is not going to go back," he said. "And so rather than seeking out a product for convenience, there will be a conscious choice of the national loyalty coming into the equation."

Tata Capital’s Rs 15,512 crore initial public offering (IPO), one of the most anticipated listings of the year, is set to debut on the stock exchanges on Monday, October 13. Despite the hype, grey market signals suggest a muted start, with the GMP slipping to zero, hinting the stock may open around its issue price of Rs 326 per share.The Tata Group’s flagship non-banking financial company (NBFC) saw its IPO subscribed 1.95 times, led by strong institutional participation. Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) oversubscribed their quota 3.42 times, while the non-institutional investors’ (NIIs) portion was booked 1.98 times. Retail investors were more cautious, subscribing 1.10 times.Priced between Rs 310 and Rs 326 per share, the issue was offered at a 56% discount to Tata Capital’s unlisted market value. With the latest grey market premium (GMP) dropping from Rs 8 earlier this week to Rs 0 as of Sunday morning, analysts say the listing is likely to be flat.Ahead of its IPO, Tata Capital raised Rs 4,642 crore from anchor investors, attracting interest from major domestic and global institutions. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was the largest anchor, acquiring 2.15 crore shares worth nearly Rs 700 crore. Other key domestic participants included ICICI Prudential, HDFC Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life, DSP, Axis, Kotak, and Nippon Life AMC.On the global front, investors such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Nomura, and Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global took significant allocations, reflecting strong confidence in the Tata Group’s financial arm.A wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, Tata Capital is the group’s flagship financial services arm, offering retail, SME, and corporate lending, along with wealth management and investment banking. With total assets of Rs 2.52 lakh crore and a loan book of Rs 2.33 lakh crore as of June 2025, it ranks as India’s third-largest diversified NBFC, trailing only Bajaj Finance and Shriram Finance.The company’s gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio of 2.1% is among the lowest in the industry, supported by an 80% secured book and a broad network of 1,516 branches across 27 states and union territories. Between FY23 and FY25, Tata Capital’s revenue rose 56%, while profit after tax climbed 10% to Rs 3,655 crore.“Our ambition is to strengthen our position as a leading player in the financial services sector. We see significant opportunities to expand our loan book and leverage our investments in technology,” said Rajiv Sabharwal, Tata Capital’s CEO. He added, “Our strategy has been to build a portfolio of multiple hero products rather than depend on a single offering.”At the upper end of the price band, Tata Capital is valued at 4.1 times its FY25 book value and 33 times its earnings, slightly below the sector average. Analysts believe this offers a fair entry point.“Given current market sentiment, Tata Capital’s management has wisely priced the IPO below the industry average, providing room for a healthy listing gain,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities.Brokerages including Aditya Birla Money, Anand Rathi, and Canara Bank Securities have recommended a “Subscribe – Long Term” rating.Antique Stock Broking noted that “normalization of credit costs in the vehicle finance portfolio, along with realization of business synergies, would be key to achieving higher return ratios of around 15% RoEs—similar to peers like HDB Financial, currently trading at 3.5x June 2025 BVPS.”According to ICICI Direct Research, Tata Capital’s assets under management (AUM) surged to Rs 2,33,363 crore in FY25, reflecting a 37.3% CAGR over FY23–25. The brokerage noted that while the company’s risk management framework remains strong, declining provisioning buffers are a concern, with the provision coverage ratio (PCR) falling to 58.5% in FY25.The brokerage also highlighted the rising share of unsecured loans (~20%) and new-to-credit customers (~3.5%), which could lead to more volatile performance.Canara Bank Securities noted that Tata Capital enjoys AAA domestic and BBB international credit ratings, with credit costs below 1% and net NPAs near 0.5%. “Daily return on equity and operating metrics outperform year-end figures by roughly 250 bps,” the brokerage said.Anand Rathi Research valued Tata Capital at a post-issue market capitalization of Rs 1,38,382.7 crore, terming the IPO fully priced but maintaining a long-term positive stance.Also read | Explained: Reliance Industries is India’s most valuable company but why isn’t it No.1 in Nifty50 weight? Funds raised will be used to bolster Tata Capital’s Tier-I capital and meet regulatory requirements, while supporting retail lending, digital initiatives, and infrastructure financing.Antique Stock Broking noted that the company benefits from top-tier credit ratings from CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, and India Ratings, with an average borrowing cost of 7.8%. The debt mix is evenly split between floating (45%) and fixed-rate (55%) instruments, sourced primarily from banks and non-convertible debentures.As the company readies for its market debut, all eyes will be on whether Tata Capital can match the blockbuster listing of Tata Technologies last year, or if a flat grey market is an early signal that investors are keeping expectations in check.Also read | Tata Motors demerger: Will it unlock value or more volatility for investors next week?

A race by crypto companies to sell tokens pegged to stocks is raising alarm bells among traditional financial firms and regulatory experts who warn that the fast-growing novel products pose risks to investors and market stability.Buoyed by President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance and his administration's push for friendly regulations, the crypto industry is rushing to capitalize on a global surge in enthusiasm for the sector.Robinhood, Gemini and Kraken among others have launched tokenized stocks in Europe, while Coinbase, Robinhood and startup Dinari are seeking approval to launch similar products in the United States. Nasdaq , meanwhile, last month became the first major exchange to propose offering tokenized shares The industry says tokenized shares - blockchain-based instruments that track traditional equities - could revolutionize stock markets by allowing shares to be traded 24/7 and settled instantly, boosting liquidity and reducing transaction costs. The combined value of tokenized public stocks geared toward retail investors as of September grew to $412 million, compared with just a few million dollars 12 months ago, according to tokenization tracker RWA.xyz.Although many products are marketed like stocks, they rarely offer the same rights, disclosures and protections as traditional equities. Instead, they more closely resemble riskier derivatives, according to a Reuters review of several products and interviews with a dozen industry executives and legal experts. That increases the hazards for investors, while tokenization more broadly could undermine market integrity and fragment liquidity if left unsupervised, critics say."You're buying exposures to those shares through creating some sort of synthetic instrument," said Diego Ballon Ossio, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in London. "A lot of the burden gets shifted on you to understand what exactly it is that you're buying."A few companies have issued their own experimental stock tokens on the blockchain - software that acts as a shared digital ledger - but most tokenized shares are pegged to public companies and issued by third parties like Ondo Global Markets and Dinari. Some tokens are backed 1:1 by underlying stocks, while others provide economic exposure through derivatives.The industry is divided over which regulations apply to stock tokens, and investor rights and protections vary. Often, the products provide no ownership, voting rights or traditional dividends, while creating counterparty risk exposure to the token issuer.For example, there are multiple tokens pegged to Nvidia and Tesla with a range of structures and terms and conditions."The fact that different tokenized offerings have different rights and different disclosures ... that's a real big worry," said Gabriel Otte, CEO of Dinari, which offers 1:1 collateralization.Robinhood in June launched trading in tokens pegged to public companies and said it plans to offer tokenized stocks of private companies. To promote the launch, it gave away tokens pegged to OpenAI. Those tokens are derivative contracts backed by Robinhood's ownership of fund units in a special-purpose vehicle that holds OpenAI convertible notes, according to its terms and conditions. The announcement drew pushback from OpenAI, which said it had not blessed the offering. It also prompted scrutiny from Robinhood's European regulator.Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto, said the company clearly flags that its tokens are derivatives."It's just one step forward to be able to have the benefits of no longer having multiple days to settle," he added.While Robinhood is issuing public company tokens on the blockchain, it is not yet settling the trades on the blockchain, a spokesperson said.Gemini declined to comment.In Europe, Robinhood, Kraken and others operate under the "MiFID" derivatives rules but some legal experts say that law is insufficient to oversee the novel products. Trump's crypto-friendly chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul Atkins, has indicated the agency plans to grant would-be issuers exemptions from securities rules.That plan is facing opposition from powerful Wall Street players including Citadel Securities and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which say such major structural changes should go through a formal rulemaking process."Just because a security is represented on blockchain, that doesn't change the core investor protections and other provisions that apply to securities," said Peter Ryan, head of international capital markets at SIFMA.In a July letter to the SEC, Citadel Securities raised concerns that tokenization would siphon liquidity away from public markets.Spokespeople for the SEC declined to comment, while Citadel Securities did not provide comment beyond the letter.A spokesperson for the European Securities and Markets Authority , which helps oversee MiFID, said it was aware of the potential risks of tokenization and was monitoring developments.The World Federation of Exchanges recently urged regulators to crack down on tokenization, citing insufficient investor protections and liquidity fragmentation, although the group told Reuters it supports Nasdaq's proposal because it would treat tokens like traditional stocks.Coinbase is also in talks with the SEC

[TITLE]Trump ratchets up U.S.-China trade war with new levies and export controls:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he was raising tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. to 100% and imposing export controls on "any and all critical software" in a reprisal to recently announced export limits by China on rare earth minerals critical to tech and other manufacturing.

"Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. "Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software."

An earlier post from Trump on Friday signaled new levies against Chinese goods were in the offing, and threatened to cancel a meeting with President Xi Jinping. That broadside against Beijing sent markets and relations between the world's largest economies into a spiral.

[TITLE]Stocks dip as government shutdown continues, rare earths rally: What to watch this week:
[TEXT]
The stock market will enter the second full week of the government shutdown following a tariff-driven sell-off on Friday.

At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and small-cap-focused Russell 2000 (^RUT) all saw their worst daily performances since April 10, just a week after the Trump administration released its initial "Liberation Day" tariff proposals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) notched its worst performance since May.

Gold (GC=F), on the other hand, had its eighth straight week of gains, continuing the biggest precious metals bull rally in decades.

In the week ahead, the market will continue to fly blind on several key points of economic data that would normally be published if not for the gridlock in Washington. Figures ranging from import prices and retail sales to hourly earnings and jobless claims are likely to be missing from the calendar.

Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was due to be released on Oct. 15; however, it will now come out on Oct. 24, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Given that the Federal Open Market Committee enters the blackout period for its October meeting starting on Saturday, Oct. 18, if Congress gets through Friday with no deal to reopen the government, the Fed will enter the blackout missing a ream of economic data.

Elsewhere in the corporate world, it's set to be a big week of earnings as the third quarter season gets properly underway. Results from the big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) will lead the week. Outside of the financial services sector, big names to watch include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Domino's (DPZ) on Tuesday and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) on Thursday.

'De minimis' shutdown effect

It's not always clear how news from Washington will impact stocks' direction. Friday's market rout shows that Trump's tariff threats still matter. Meanwhile, the government shutdown seems to have had a muted impact on the major indexes, with Deutsche Bank calling the shutdown's market effect "de minimis."

In the past, the major credit rating agencies have noted that a government shutdown like the one currently in effect would reflect negatively on the US government bond rating. Given that the rating agencies have already downgraded government bonds in the last few years on the basis of political instability, said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at broker-dealer LPL Financial, this outcome is essentially "off the table."

[TITLE]Stock Bubble Dread Grips Central Bankers in Washington:
[TEXT]
Statements from Group of Seven or Group of 20 ministers attending the IMF gathering will also be scrutinized, as will the cacophony of policymakers likely to share their views.

Fast forward to the coming week, and the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report — a publication that didn’t even exist back in 2000 — may draw more attention than usual on Tuesday. The latest WEO, with economic forecasts for the world, will also be released.

Such concerns have been mounting for a while. ECB officials were presented with the warning of “sudden and sharp price corrections” at their last policy meeting more than a month ago, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell observed in September that markets are “highly valued.”

Even before US President Donald Trump’s renewed China tariff threat tanked stocks on Friday, officials saw alarming parallels. The Bank of England just warned of the risk of a “sharp market correction,” European Central Bank policymakers worried aloud, and the Reserve Bank of Australia this month also noted vulnerabilities.

Her warning was arguably more forthright than the IMF’s commentary from the October 2000 meeting, when its World Economic Outlook described “still high” equity valuations and the potential for imbalances to unwind “in a disorderly fashion.” Within months, the selloff momentum was such that the Federal Reserve was forced to deliver an emergency half-point interest-rate cut.

[TITLE]‘We basically pay two mortgages’: Our readers share the impact of soaring childcare costs:
[TEXT]
RISING CHILDCARE FEES has become a hot-button political issue over the last number of years, with many parents struggling to keep up with costs.

Ahead of the general election last year, both opposition and government parties promised to reduce fees to €200 a month.

But Budget 2026 had no mention of this promise from the government, much to the dismay of parents and childcare organisations.

The Journal Investigates also revealed last week that more than 50 childcare providers have withdrawn from the government’s Core Funding scheme in the last few years.

As a result, many parents have seen their fees soar after their provider withdrew from the scheme.

Across Europe, childcare fees are also significantly cheaper than in Ireland, even with the Irish government spending millions on grants and subsidies.

[TITLE]Canada Post shifts to rotating strikes with 4 locations including 2 in B.C.:
[TEXT]
Two of the four Canada Post sites hit by strike action this weekend are in British Columbia — Dawson Creek and Fort St. John — as postal workers across the country move from a nationwide walkout to labour action on a rotating model.

The Canadian Union of Postal Workers rotating strikes started Saturday, ending more than two weeks of countrywide job action.

The union says the battle for a fair collective agreement continues, but that the downgraded labour action allows workers to resume their jobs and remind Canadians that a full postal service is worth fighting for.

CUPW declared a countrywide strike on Sept. 25, hours after the government announced changes to the postal service, including an end to door-to-door mail delivery for nearly all Canadian households within the next decade.

Stephen Gale, the regional grievance officer for the union’s B.C. and Yukon chapter, says the goal of the rotating strikes is to avoid widespread disruption.

He said the union’s national executive board will decide which locations are affected to ensure no community bears the impact for long.

“We’re maintaining our strike activity, but we’re also trying to make sure we provide service to the public.”

On Saturday, workers held strikes in Fort St. John, B.C.; Dawson Creek, B.C.; Timmins, Ont.; and St. Anthony, N.L.

[TITLE]The Formula Fueling Uniqlo’s Record-Breaking Profits:
[TEXT]
For a fourth consecutive year, Uniqlo reported record profits and is now eyeing a fifth year of breakthrough earnings with its global retail push. According to Reuters, profits increased roughly 13%, reaching $3.69 billion (564.3 billion yen) in the 12 months ending in August 2025. As the fashion industry reels from an uncertain year impacted by international trade reforms and economic instability, what is the Japanese retailer’s secret to success?

Uniqlo’s owner, Fast Retailing, saw its Japanese revenue surpass 1 trillion yen, a first-ever for the company. Meanwhile, in North America, revenue and business profit grew by 24.5% and 35.1%, respectively, despite the US’s newly enacted tariffs. The worldwide numbers overtook the company’s own fiscal 2025 forecast of 545 billion yen, and Fast Retailing expects that 2026 operating profit may once again break records, reaching up to 610 billion yen.

“As the times continue to change greatly, Uniqlo’s LifeWear concept has begun to gain broad recognition in major global markets,” said Tadashi Yanai, CEO and founder, in an official statement. “We are confident that we can fundamentally transform the very concept of clothing on a global scale and spark a movement that establishes LifeWear as a new world standard,” he added.

In an environment so highly saturated with competitors, Uniqlo’s highly curated approach to product is what differentiates the retailer. In comparison to shopping at an H&M or a Zara, where one might notice a focus on trend-forward assortments, busier patterns, and louder embellishments, Uniqlo is noticeably pared back in its presentation.

[TITLE]Uniqlo's owner sees stronger profit and sales in current fiscal year:
[TEXT]
Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing reported double-digit revenue and profit growth in North America in the current fiscal year, as its U.S. expansion defied tariff volatility sparked by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

The Japanese clothing retailer, known for its functional basics including T-shirts, sweatpants and down jackets, saw North America revenue and business profit grow 24.5% and 35.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended August 2025, according to its earnings statement on Thursday.

That performance led robust international gains across Europe, Southeast Asia and South Korea, helping offset a continued slump in China — long Fast Retailing’s largest overseas market — where consumer demand has remained weak since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Buoyed by its success abroad, Fast Retailing’s overall sales rose nearly 10%, while operating income climbed 13%, beating analyst forecasts. The company issued a bullish outlook for the next fiscal year, projecting ¥610 billion ($4 billion) in operating income and ¥3.75 trillion in sales, both above market consensus.

Fast Retailing founder and Chief Executive Officer Tadashi Yanai is seeking to eventually reach annual sales of ¥10 trillion and turn the business into a global apparel maker. To do so, the company has stepped up efforts to push deeper into the U.S., Europe and other parts of Asia to build on the success it has seen in Japan and China.

The company said revenue and profit jumped significantly in the U.S. during the June-August quarter even when the impact of U.S. tariffs set in. New store openings in both North America and Europe have been "extremely successful, and a virtuous cycle has started to emerge,” according to the earnings statement.

Fast Retailing has also been shoring up its operations in China, by adjusting its product lineup to deal with seasonal weather and local needs. Both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong markets reported sales decline and large contraction in profit in the current fiscal year, the company said.

Business at its home market saw a considerable increase, with revenue at Uniqlo Japan topping ¥1 trillion for the first time.

[TITLE]Global Resale Market Set to Grow to $360 Billion by 2030, Says BCG:
[TEXT]
PARIS — The global resale market for fashion and luxury goods is continuing to soar, projected to reach between $320 billion and $360 billion by 2030, according to a new study by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective, released Thursday.

The study, based on a survey of 7,800 Vestiaire Collective users worldwide, puts the resale market at roughly 8 percent of total fashion and luxury sales globally, with penetration expected to hit 10 percent by the end of the decade.

And with a compound annual growth rate of 10 percent, it’s expanding three times faster than primary sales and reshaping how consumers shop, especially Gen Z and U.S.-based consumers hit by inflation.

“With resale now growing three times faster than firsthand fashion and luxury, the market has gone from experimental to essential,” said BCG managing director and partner Felix Krueger. “Many brands now see it as a key channel for attracting new customers. With Gen Z and other resale-native consumers leading the shift, momentum is only growing.”

Europe currently leads this growth, fueled by regulatory support from the European Union and heightened consumer awareness around sustainability and circularity, while U.S. consumers are most concerned by value and brand accessibility.

Fifty-five percent of resale purchases occur through online multibrand platforms such as Vestiaire Collective, The RealReal and Vinted.

Aspirational Access

Resale is no longer niche, and is an escape from the one-two punch of inflation and economic uncertainty, with affordability being the key driver behind the sector’s growth. Price was the primary motivator of 78 percent of respondents, especially among aspirational buyers seeking premium labels they might not otherwise be able to afford.

“Whether seeking desirable pre-loved fashion pieces at affordable prices or pursuing the thrill of the hunt for truly unique finds, resale is now firmly embedded in how people shop and build their wardrobes. Today, it’s a deliberate choice,” said Vestiaire Collective cofounder and president Fanny Moizant.

Notably, 66 percent of respondents indicated that resale enabled them to discover or purchase a brand for the first time, up from 59 percent in 2022. This highlights resale’s growing function not just as a secondary market but as a strategic customer acquisition channel that expands brand reach and fosters long-term loyalty.

While leather goods, apparel and footwear dominate the resale market as approximately 80 percent of transactions, luxury watches and fine jewelry are growing fast. The resale of watches alone is forecasted to capture 35 to 40 percent of the global watch market by 2030, the report said, in part due to the rising prices of timepieces in the primary market.

Gen Z is leading the charge here. Resale makes up nearly one-third of their wardrobes, almost half of their handbag collections, and they’re more likely than any other demographic to discover a new brand through a secondhand buy. In a world of rising retail prices and shrinking disposable income, secondhand offers both a point of entry and a statement of values.

U.S. Consumers Value-driven, Europe Cites Sustainability

The study reveals marked regional differences, particularly between U.S. and European resale consumers. While affordability ranks as the top driver in both markets, 87 percent of U.S. respondents cited price is their top reason for shopping resale — 11 percentage points higher than in Europe.

However, sustainability is less of a priority for U.S. consumers, with only 28 percent reporting resale as supporting more sustainable fashion behaviors compared to 33 percent in Europe.

U.S. consumers also more frequently reported preferring secondhand luxury labels to more affordable new premium-level items, reflecting what the report calls a “transactional, value-led approach” as they react to economic concerns and inflation.

The Big Opp of DPPs

As resale gains momentum, so does the need for trust, transparency and traceability, particularly in the luxury segment, where authentication is a primary concern. Enter digital product passports, or DPPs, a new technology solution set to reshape how consumers and brands interact with products over time.

Structured data that follows a product through its lifecycle, DPPs promise to streamline verification, improve resale efficiency, and offer richer product histories — from production details to ownership changes. They’re seen by some industry players as the missing infrastructure needed to scale resale securely, as well as add storytelling capabilities.

“The next wave of value in resale lies in how we digitize a product’s provenance,” said BCG managing director Catharina Martinez-Pardo. “DPPs are a strategic tool that builds trust with consumers and opens up new ways for brands to remain involved beyond the initial sale.”

But for now, awareness lags. According to the survey, two-thirds of consumers had never heard of DPPs, and another 15 percent were unfamiliar with what it actually does. But those who do understand DPPs believe they have value to authenticate, as well as understand product detailed specs. That ranked particularly important for the handbag category, where nearly 80 percent of respondents said they would want access to DPPs and additional information.

The stakes are especially high in Europe, where legislation mandating DPPs for textiles is expected to take effect in 2027. Early movers would have an advantage and build brand loyalty, the report said, as well as support authentication services.

BCG believes that the evolution of resale is an opportunity for brands not only to rethink their product pipelines, but also their long-term engagement strategies. If brands once thought of secondhand as a threat to full-price sales, it can be positioned as a discovery channel and promote customer loyalty and retention among aspirational and younger customers.

[TITLE]ED offers Flipkart to close FEMA violation case by paying penalty, admitting mistake:
[TEXT]
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is learnt to have offered the option of closing a FEMA violation case against e-commerce major Flipkart if the Walmart group firm admits its mistake and pays a penalty, sources aware of the development said.

The option was given by the Enforcement Directorate to Flipkart last week under the compounding rules of FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act).

"ED has given the option of compounding to Flipkart. ED has asked Flipkart to admit its mistake, pay a penalty and dismantle the seller network associated with it," a source told PTI.

An email query sent to Flipkart elicited no reply.

The ED had also summoned Amazon India to check the status of the company.

When contacted, an Amazon India spokesperson said, "We do not comment on ongoing investigations..

A query sent to ED in this matter also received no response.

An official of one of the e-commerce firms, on condition of anonymity, said that the compounding option given by ED is to strengthen India's negotiating power during the ongoing bilateral trade negotiation with the US.

The compounding rules allow companies to voluntarily admit breach of the provision under the FEMA and settle the case by paying a penalty for the contraventions without undergoing lengthy enforcement actions.

Flipkart and Amazon India have been under ED scrutiny for alleged breach of FEMA provisions.

There have been allegations that these companies are pushing discounts on their platform to garner sales.

The ED had first issued a show cause notice to Flipkart, related firms and individuals in July 2021, seeking its reply as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015.

The notice was related to the period between 2009 and 2015, before the majority stake in Flipkart was acquired by the US major Walmart.

Walmart had acquired a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018.

ED has also served notice to Flipkart even after acquisition by Walmart for investigation in its business after 2016 as well.

The most recent notice was served to the company in April this year.

The Competition Commission of India is also conducting an investigation against Flipkart regarding alleged competition law violations by certain subsidiaries of Flipkart in India and other parties.

In September 2024, a non-confidential version of the CCI DG's Investigation Report was received by one of the Flipkart subsidiaries that alleged certain competition law violations.

[TITLE]This startup wants to make your iPhone 17 and S25 Ultra affordable with a new ‘smart ‘ownership’ model:
[TEXT]
Before buying a new flagship smartphone, one of the first things consumers in India look for is whether the device can be purchased through easy monthly installments (EMIs) spread over 12 months or more. This strategy has worked in favour of phone brands and the ecosystem players contributing to the rise in the adoption of high-end, premium smartphones in the world’s most populous country. In the recent quarters, the share of premium smartphones has registered the highest growth of 96.4 per cent in India, as per the data from International Data Corporation (IDC).

While it is already possible to buy flagship smartphones through accessibility schemes, a startup called BytePe, founded by a former Flipkart executive, aims to reduce the cost of EMIs even further by offering options to upgrade or retain smartphones, drastically cutting the cost of EMIs compared to standard EMIs.

“If you are buying a product today, you typically pay 100 per cent of its value upfront. Now, maybe a year or two down the line, if you stop using it, there’s still a left out value in that product. What we have done is build a proprietary model that predicts the lifecycle value of a product. This model works seamlessly with existing financing instruments, whether it’s a credit card or our own lending ecosystem,” said Jayant Jha, Founder & CEO of BytePe, explaining the rationale behind India’s first subscription-based smartphone service.
