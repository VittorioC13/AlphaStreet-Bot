[TITLE]Natural Killer Cell Therapies Lead $254B Immunotherapy Market Transformation:
[TEXT]
Equity Insider News Commentary

Issued on behalf of GT Biopharma, Inc.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity InsiderNews Commentary – MIT and Harvard scientists recently created engineered CAR-NK cells that hide from the immune system and more effectively destroy cancer, opening doors to off-the-shelf treatments doctors can administer immediately after diagnosis instead of waiting weeks for personalized cell production[1]. Eight new oncology approvals between July and September 2025 demonstrate how cellular immunotherapy platforms are solving manufacturing challenges while expanding from blood cancers into solid tumors, with researchers discovering ways to reprogram immune cells to fight cancer for days without fatiguing[2]. This convergence of natural killer cell activation, T-cell engagers, personalized vaccines, and precision delivery systems positions GT Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GTBP), Evaxion A/S (NASDAQ: EVAX), RenovoRX, Inc. (NASDAQ:RNXT), EDAP TMS S.A. (NASDAQ: EDAP), and Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR).

The global cancer immunotherapy market stood at $105.7 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $254.6 billion by 2033, driven by increasing cancer incidence and rapid developments creating better tailored therapies[3]. Biomarker-driven drug development accelerates across oncology as companies advance novel mechanisms targeting previously difficult populations, with recent clinical data demonstrating high response rates in molecularly defined patient subgroups creating favorable conditions for immune-activating therapies offering reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy.

GT Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GTBP) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company headquartered in San Francisco that's focused on harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer. The firm is currently advancing innovative immunotherapy treatments designed to combat some of the most challenging cancer types, with recent progress showing promise in its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of GTB-3650. The company has successfully enrolled both patients in the trial's third dosing group (Cohort 3), with neither patient experiencing concerning side effects or dose-limiting toxicities thus far. GT Biopharma expects to commence treatment for Cohort 4 patients before the end of 2025, with further data releases planned for early 2026.

The Phase 1 study is testing GTB-3650 in patients battling relapsed or refractory blood cancers that express the CD33 protein, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These represent some of the most difficult cancer cases to treat, involving patients whose disease either came back after initial therapy or never responded to conventional treatment options.

GTB-3650 works by stimulating the patient's natural killer cells, a type of immune cell that naturally hunts down and destroys abnormal cells, to specifically target cancer cells. Patients receive the therapy through continuous infusions following a structured schedule: two weeks of treatment followed by two weeks of rest, repeating this cycle for up to four months based on how they respond.

After thorough safety assessments, the company successfully advanced into Cohort 3 following formal reviews of the initial two patient cohorts that found no safety or tolerability issues. The early results are particularly encouraging based on biomarker data, objective biological measurements that indicate whether the drug is working as designed. Blood analysis from the first four patients revealed measurable increases in both natural killer cell activity and proliferation.

The initial patient in Cohort 3 has shown encouraging signs of immune activation at levels comparable to those seen in patients from the earlier, lower-dose cohorts. This biological response suggests GTB-3650 is functioning precisely as intended: activating the immune system and directing it to attack cancer cells.

The Phase 1 design calls for testing GTB-3650 in approximately 14 patients across seven cohorts, with two patients per cohort receiving progressively higher doses from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 up to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7. The trial will continue escalating doses into higher ranges expected to translate immune activation into meaningful clinical benefits.

"We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule," said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO of GT Biopharma. "Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650. We look forward to sharing more data later this year to reinforce the ability of our TriKE constructs to activate endogenous NK cells, and the potential for broader utility with other targets to treat solid tumors (GTB-5550) and autoimmune indications (GTB-7550)."

Beyond blood cancers, the company is developing GTB-5550, which targets B7H3, a protein commonly found across various solid tumor types including breast, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancers. GT Biopharma plans to file its regulatory application to begin human trials of GTB-5550 in the fourth quarter of 2025. GTB-5550 is being designed as a subcutaneous injection that patients might eventually self-administer at home.

Both candidates utilize GT Biopharma's proprietary TriKE platform technology, which employs specialized antibody fragments originally found in camels and llamas. These molecules offer advantages over conventional antibodies due to their smaller size and greater stability. The company holds an exclusive worldwide license from the University of Minnesota for this technology.

As of June 30, 2025, GT Biopharmareported approximately $5.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, with management projecting this capital would support operations through the first quarter of 2026.
