[TITLE]Marvell Technology buys Celestial AI in $3.25 billion deal, shares jump nearly 8% — Inside the acquisition:
[TEXT]
Marvell Technology is set to acquire artificial intelligence startup Celestial AI in a deal worth $3.25 billion, the chipmaker said on Tuesday.

The news came as Marvell announced its third quarter results for the current financial year, and gave bullish forecast for its next fiscal year.

The acquisition of Celestial AI is part of the company's strategy to capture more of the runaway spending on artificial intelligence computing.

Shares of Marvell Technology were up by 8.73% to $101 apiece at extended trading, according to MarketWatch. Marvell Technology stock price was $92.89 at Tuesday's close.

Marvell-Celestial AI deal: What's inside? The $3.25 billion Celestial AI acquisition of Marvell includes a $1 billion cash payment, and Marvell shares valued at $2.25 billion, the chipmaker said in its statement. Celestial AI will receive 27.2 million shares of Marvell common stock.

Celestial AI, a Santa Clara, California-based startup founded in 2020, offers a technology called photonic fabric that connects components within AI infrastructure.

The Celestial deal would allow Marvell to tap into the startup's work on photonics, which uses light rather than electrical signals to create connections between AI chips and memory chips, an area in which it competes with Broadcom and the world's most valuable company, Nvidia.

Marvell CEO Matt Murphy told Reuters that the Celestial AI technology will be used in Marvell's next-generation photonics-related infrastructure products, which will contribute to a new market for the company at the tune of

[TITLE]Proprietary Vending Management Software Acquisition Evolves Under Executive Leadership:
[TEXT]
SAVANNAH, Ga., Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Since acquiring VendingOps vending management system and EndevorPay card readers, announced with Naturals2Go at The NAMA Show 2025 last May, VendTech International has rigorously field-tested and evolved these proprietary solutions. Now they are available under new names – VendXONE and VendXpay – and under a new corporate brand – VendTech Technology.

VendXONE – Vending Management Software by VendTech Technology Evolves

VendTech is known as the engineering, technology and solution parent brand of Naturals2Go, which launches new entrepreneurs into vending. VendTech Technology follows the same strategic vision of providing excellence for vending and unattended retail entrepreneurs – available to the company’s existing customers and any unattended retail operation.

Poised to disrupt the industry once again, VendXONE has been developed by operators, for operators to be the most reliable and supportive suite of solutions on the market for unattended retail businesses – vending management software, card readers, kiosks, and more.

The intuitive and robust technology delivers exactly what vending operators have been demanding from the vending management software market – the ability to scale and move their business operations to the next level of productivity and revenue.

UK’s Nayax Financial Services GM and CEO – Lewis Zimbler – Joins VendTech as SVP of Payments & Technology

To help steward this evolution, VendTech International is proud to announce that Lewis Zimbler, founding executive at Nayax UK, has joined the company as Senior Vice President of Payments and Technology, and will lead a bold expansion for the VendTech Technology brand.

Zimbler brings over 20 years of global leadership in unattended payments, systems, and business leadership. During his tenure at Nayax, he ran Nayax UK and Ireland as well as helped scale the company into one of the most recognized cashless payment platforms globally.

In his new role, Zimbler will lead technology development across VendTech’s growing ecosystem of unattended retail solutions – including VendXONE, smart technologies, remote monitoring tools, payment processing systems, and micro market innovations.

“Lewis joining our team is a major step forward,” said Heath Falzarano, President of VendTech International (Naturals2Go/ VendTech). “He brings the kind of industry vision, technical credibility, and global perspective that will strengthen our ability to serve operators, expand our platform ecosystem, and deliver proven solutions at scale.”

VendTech Technology – For Operators, By Operators

No other company globally has the ability to develop and then field test technology, engineering, and business solutions in the same manner as VendTech. By installing then testing hardware and software first – on staff-owned vending solutions and the company’s own corporate routes across regional operations centers – the company knows what works best for unattended retail operators.

From Zimbler, “The technology that can truly say it’s the best in class serves people first. What’s most exciting is VendTech’s focus on real solutions coupled with the best in class support, helping business operations and real business owners thrive. We’re blending proprietary solutions with smart, integrated technology systems that support everyone from single-machine operators to full-scale enterprise programs.”

VendXONE vending management software solution is now included with the Naturals2Go business opportunity bundle of equipment, support, and services; available to distribution partners; and directly to other vending operators.

This marks the first field tested software solution in vending history of this size and scale, ensuring that VendTech Technology’s VendXONE is the very best solution to run efficient, successful business operations.

On December 3, Goldman Sachs raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $90 from $80 and kept a “Neutral” rating on the shares. The price target raise follows Marvell’s third quarter fiscal year 2026 financial results.

“Marvell delivered record third-quarter revenue of $2.075 billion, exceeding the midpoint of guidance, driven by strong demand for our data center products. We are guiding for robust growth in the fourth quarter and are on track for a strong finish to the fiscal year, with full-year revenue growth forecasted to exceed 40%."

"Looking ahead, we see demand for our products continuing to accelerate, and as a result, our data center revenue growth forecast for next year is now higher than prior expectations.” - Matt Murphy, Marvell’s Chairman and CEO, in a statement.

Goldman Sachs has highlighted improved visibility into Marvell’s data center momentum heading into 2026, particularly the custom compute segment. The company projects datacenter revenue to grow 40% year-over-year in CY27, with custom compute revenue projected to double in the same period.

Marvell’s acquisition of Celestial AI was also discussed in the investor note, broadening its product portfolio in the expanding datacenter market.

Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) engages in the development and production of semiconductors, focusing heavily on data centers.

[TITLE]SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son wants to build ‘Trump Industrial Parks’ across the nation, report claims — project proposes using federal land to build manufacturing sites for data center infrastructure:
[TEXT]
SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has been in talks with the Trump administration to build Project Crystal Land, Son’s grand vision for a U.S. competitor to Shenzhen, China’s electronics manufacturing hub, with a population of over 17.5 million people, often dubbed as China’s Silicon Valley or the Silicon Valley of Hardware. According to the Wall Street Journal, the plan was originally for a single $1 trillion high-tech industrial city that encompasses the size of Los Angeles and will be built to the north of Phoenix, Arizona. This was supposed to house chip fabs, packaging plants, and processing facilities — basically, an entire semiconductor supply chain — while also providing housing to all the people working within it.

However, the administration’s plan has reportedly since changed from one mega site into several “Trump Industrial Parks” that will be built on federal land across the nation. Son then revised his proposal and said that the funding for the first phase of the plan would be part of Japan’s investment commitment to the U.S. as part of the trade deal the country struck with President Donald Trump in July. This updated plan tracks closely with Washington’s list of potential investments that Japan can fund, including nuclear power plants, energy infrastructure, and AI projects.

Despite Son’s enthusiasm, there is still no clear answer from the U.S. government on whether it would proceed with SoftBank’s proposals. The WSJ says that the required investment on the various sites would likely exceed Japan’s $550 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing, plus it would also have to go through a lot of hoops to use federal land.

There’s also the complicated planning process to determine what kind of industries will be built on them, as well as which companies will be allowed to do so. Taiwan is set to help the U.S. build its own industrial parks, including assisting it with “science park management, attracting companies, integrating academic research with industry,” Taiwan National Science and Technology Council Minister Wu Cheng-wen to the Financial Times. “No other country has done what we have done.”

However, TSMC has already declined to work with SoftBank on its Project Crystal Land, so unless the U.S. government compels it to work with the Japanese investor, Son would have to find another partner to help him build his industrial parks. Aside from that, he has also been in talks with other Japanese tech companies like Toshiba, Murata Manufacturing, and Fujikara, discussing projects that would support Washington’s push to develop local semiconductor manufacturing.

SoftBank has been betting big on semiconductors, investing billions of dollars in Arm, OpenAI, and, more recently, Intel. The U.S.’s push for AI supremacy thus would go well with the company’s strategy of going all-in on AI after it missed out in the early years of the LLM boom.

[TITLE]UK Finance Calls on Tech Firms to Help Combat Financial Crime, Protect Vulnerable Consumers:
[TEXT]
UK Finance Chief Executive David Postings shared key insights at the Economic Crime Congress 2025. The session included key perspectives from Lord Hanson and have viewpoints shared during sessions involving Marcus Wogart, Rachel Herbert, James Babbage, Mike Regnier, Michelle Haslem and Tracy Paradise.

David Postings of UK Finance stated that the fight against Economic Crime is a team effort “across industry, government, regulators, the media, civil society, and law enforcement.”

He added that the industry invests a huge amount in “protecting the public from Economic Crime in all its forms.”

Postings also mentioned that protecting customers has “always been one of our highest priorities, and it always will be.”

They further explained that UK Finance undertakes “a very broad range of Economic Crime work, across anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, sanctions, intelligence, and fraud.”

They work in partnership with “members, and other partners, to protect the public, society and economy from harms caused by Economic Crime.”

Postings also shared that together, they have “made progress in key areas over the past twelve months.”

He continued:

“We estimate that our members spend £38 billion on compliance each year. So, we strongly welcomed the Treasury’s commitment to make changes to the Money Laundering Regulations. These regulations are the largest driver of that spend. We approach advocacy by using data and building strong arguments. “

He further commented:

“An example of the government’s commitment to improve how we fight crime is the recent increase in threshold for reporting Suspicious Activity Reports. This will allow firms to focus their efforts on higher value activity and will really help us all tackle crime much more effectively. However, we continue to see new burdens placed on banks, such as the Public Authorities Fraud, Error, and Recovery Act. Whilst the intention behind the Act may be understandable, it introduces more complexity and work.“

Postings also shared that using banks to police fraud and error in the benefits system is “a matter for public debate, but what is certain is that it distracts from the industry’s work to tackle the big issue of serious organised crime.”

He pointed out that a risk-based approach to economic crime prevention is entirely “consistent with the Chancellor’s Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy.”

When Labour took up office in 2024, they shared views on how a balanced approach to risk would “allow the sector to refocus on key activities, including innovation and growth, for the benefit of UK consumers and businesses.”

He added:

“We seek a system that is focused on the largest risks and threats, rebalancing the industry’s annual compliance spend towards high-impact activity. Supporting a properly resourced public sector with the intelligence, tools and capabilities needed to deal with criminals and terrorists.”

He further stated that there are currently “3,750 individuals, 968 entities, and 15 ships on the consolidated sanctions list.”

In the last year OFSI focused on “enhancing compliance, capability, and enforcement to uphold the effectiveness of UK financial sanctions.”

The impact of this work is demonstrated by the “£37 billion worth of assets reported as frozen to OFSI, a significant increase from £24.4 billion in the previous FY.”

Key focus areas for 2026 will include “tackling sanctions evasion, strengthening controls around crypto assets, and ensuring firms have the tools and confidence to implement measures effectively and responsibly.”

The pace of changes with regards to payments, “coupled with the increased threats posed by fraudsters leads to a fast paced environment in the fraud arena.”

UK Finance continues to bring members together “to choose the path for a single future-facing APP and data management solution.”

The Banking Protocol initiative, which links branch staff with police to protect vulnerable customers, has “prevented over £400 million being stolen since inception.”

The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit (DCPCU), has prevented over “£75 million from being stolen this year, charged 86 people and disrupted 120 Organised Crime Gangs.”

This is a “record” number.

Through their Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign, they have equipped individuals with “clear, actionable advice to help them recognise and resist fraudulent attempts.”

Their educational materials, interactive resources, and public outreach initiatives have “helped people to spot scams and make informed decisions, significantly reducing their vulnerability to fraud.”

They also stated:

“We have also seen record high campaign recognition ,with over 56% of people saying they recognise Take Five activity. The industry is spending billions on this issue. But let me talk

[TITLE]Creative Churn: Indian advertising agencies dread layoffs as AI upends industry globally:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI) is causing an upheaval in the global advertising industry, and the ripples of layoffs and cost cuts are being felt in India as well.

AI tools now enable clients to develop content, and they are outsourcing less and less work to advertising agencies. The industry is in turmoil, forcing two of the Big 5 advertising holding companies–Omnicom and Interpublic Group–to merge globally. That has triggered a wave of job cuts, and local agencies are also bracing for a shakeup.

“The Indian advertising market is going through a seismic shift. The creative work is now getting done by clients’ in-house teams. AI tools are used for creating advertisements across platforms as campaigns become hyper-personalised," said Rajesh Sethi, partner and leader Media, Entertainment and Sports, PwC India. “By leveraging AI, organisations are becoming more productive and efficient. However, this transformation may influence entry-level roles in the industry and gradually reshape the traditional business models of advertising agencies."

Also Read | How Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG will affect Indian advertising

Digital advertising was already on the rise. Clients are now betting on it even more, given a large youth population, expanding broadband access, and deeper consumption of online content. A PwC report estimates Indian internet advertising to expand from ₹6.25 billion in 2024 to ₹13.06 billion in 2029.

Late last month, NYSE-listed Omnicom and Interpublic Group announced a $13 billion merger. With global revenues exceeding $25 billion, the combined post-merger Omnicom will become the world’s largest advertising network.

In India, London-based WPP remains the largest, comprising media agencies such as Ogilvy, Burson and GroupM, which was rebranded as WPP in May.

Still, the merger between Omnicom and Interpublic Group (IPG) has already killed several well-known agencies, including FCB, DDB, and MullenLowe. There will be 4,000 layoffs worldwide, Omnicom’s top management told the Financial Times last week. Executives Mint spoke to said the India offices will also be impacted.

Senior executives on radar

"The newer age, more adaptable agency networks like Publicis and Omnicom are better and more centrally run," one senior executive close to the Omnicom-IPG merger said, requesting anonymity. "IPG is more of a holding company of the past, where there is just one financial entity with many more entities in it, which do not need to be connected with each other. The new age model of networks functions more like Omnicom and Publicis does, where advertisers buy into these main brands and not into the brand name of one of the many agencies they own."

The senior executive pointed out that these agencies and business units have separate finance, admin, and other teams. “All of this adds up to cost to the client, all costs that the client does not really need to eat."

Much of those cost efficiencies will now come from layoffs and the removal of overlapping functions. While India is not a significant cost centre for these global networks, which lean heavily on the US and European markets, much of the cost efficiency here is likely to come from cutting duplicate C-suite roles, the executive said. As much as 40% of such senior executive roles could go in the next few months, although major layoffs have not started yet, the executive added.

IPG operates agency networks FCB, McCann, MullenLowe and IPG Mediabrands, while Omnicom runs two verticals—the Omnicom Media Group for media buying, planning and investment agencies; and the Omnicom Advertising Group for the group’s creative agencies.

A creative agency offers services such as creating ad films and building brand marketing campaigns, while a media buying agency buys and plans media inventory and where these ads can be placed.

Omnicom Advertising Group, Omnicom Media Group, and WPP India declined to respond to Mint’s queries.

‘Dread throughout’

The second-order effects of the global merger are being felt in other agency networks.

“We had a townhall in November assuring us that there will not be any layoffs, but there is dread throughout the agency," the vice president of one of the largest creative agencies in India said, requesting anonymity. “We are getting to know of colleagues who are put on a performance improvement plan (PIP), and they are worried the next stage is retrenchment."

An employee with low appraisal ratings is put on a PIP, and the process is ideally meant to help the employee improve performance, but it could also be a step toward getting laid off.

“Much of the agency cutting has happened in the creative services and not in media buying and planning," Naresh Gupta, founder of independent agency Bang In The Middle, said. “The networks today are not interested in buying a pure creative service agency. You need to build a media practice, or you will get acquired if you run something like an influencer agency."

Doubt and unrest

Multinational advertising firm Publicis Groupe said it is upskilling teams and building hybrid roles.

“The industry is undergoing a period of global transformation led by AI, shifting client priorities and consolidation, and for us this has meant being intentional with talent—prioritising future-facing roles across data, tech, AI, commerce, media and integrated strategy," said Publicis Groupe India spokesperson in an emailed response to queries. The firm noted that its AI-led capabilities will “augment" and not “replace" talent.

A 40-year-old senior executive from Mumbai got retrenched last month from an advertising tech firm, and AI-driven creatives were one of the primary reasons. “For the past one year, the clients came up with their own creatives through AI prompts and the team just could not keep up," said the executive, who was given two months of severance pay. “Some of the firms are recruiting freelancers for client servicing, which until now was the work of the core teams in the agencies."

A senior HR executive at one of the leading agency holding companies said things are not so “bad with us yet, but increments are impacted".

“Everyone is waiting and watching how things will turn out with this big merger—leadership changes, how businesses and P&Ls will be impacted for everyone in the business in terms of market share," the executive said. “The same goes for talent–everyone is anticipating heavy layoffs in the merger. In general, there is unrest."

India's top tier software services firms together reported a 26% gain in total contract value year-on-year in the second quarter ended September 2025, according to Mirae Asset Sharekhan, pointing to a clearer turnaround in new signings after a period of weak demand.Analysts are anticipating that the momentum will strengthen over the next two years as clients increase their spending on artificial intelligence projects.Additionally, project delays appear to have bottomed in the June quarter, analysts at BNP Paribas noted, with management commentary from Indian IT vendors now pointing to better traction in signings.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, sector deal wins recovered by 2.8% after a 15.2% drop in the prior period, led mainly by HCLTech , while Infosys Mphasis and LTIMindtree saw lower wins, as per the BNP note.“Barring a significant macro shock, we expect demand to stabilise, followed by a meaningful inflexion in calendar year 2026 as enterprise budget flushes resumes and deferred programs are released,” analysts at Mirae Asset Sharekhan said.On a last-twelve-months basis, aggregate deal wins across the tracked IT services firms grew 7.8% in the September 2025 quarter from 2.3% in the previous quarter. This was supported by sharp increases in LTM deal values at Mphasis, Coforge and Wipro , partly offset by declines at Infosys, Atos and Accenture.Meanwhile, Nuvama highlighted that deal momentum has nonetheless remained consistent over the last few quarters despite ongoing tariff and geopolitical uncertainties, indicated by growth in contract values on an LTM basis.Companies leveraging AI-driven solutions to strengthen their service offerings and secure new deals are expected to benefit, the report added.Mirae Asset Sharekhan said,” Even as AI-driven productivity gains reduce some legacy services' work, we anticipate a new cycle of AI-centric workloads and AI-native deals to become a tangible revenue tailwind starting FY27.”Motilal Oswal estimates that companies are clocking growth in contract values in application modernisation, data engineering, and integration-led work, offsetting their productivity deflation in FY27, in addition to the AI-led revenues.

[TEXT]
A new artificial intelligence-powered tool that lets shoppers see how they would look in different outfits is resonating with clients, Stitch Fix CEO Matt Baer said Thursday (Dec. 4).

“We’re seeing engagement from our clients that far exceeded our expectations when we rolled out the beta just a couple of months ago,” Baer said during the company’s quarterly earnings call.

Stitch Fix announced the AI-powered visualization tool called Stitch Fix Vision on Oct. 6, saying it gives customers personalized imagery of their likeness in an array of shoppable outfit recommendations based on their style profile and the newest fashion trends.

Aside from seeing their likeness in a variety of styles, customers can see themselves in a range of locations, such as on a city street or at the beach, to help them visualize how outfits will look in different environments.

Baer said during Thursday’s call that the experience is “completely shoppable” and that the images can be shared across social media platforms.

Clients are using the tool in different ways, Baer said. Some purchase directly from the Stitch Fix Vision image, some share images with their Stitch Fix stylists to inform the next outfits they will receive, and some share images across social platforms.

“They’re sharing it with friends and family, and it’s creating a bit of virality and organic growth for us from a client acquisition standpoint as well,” Baer said.

Stitch Fix Vision has joined several other AI-powered tools the company has deployed, including client-facing tools and behind-the-scenes ones.

Baer highlighted the company’s AI Style Assistant that uses generative AI to engage in dialogue with clients and help them articulate their preferences to their stylists.

He also pointed to gen AI tools that help different Stitch Fix teams with things like private-brand product development, inventory management, trend forecasting and pricing. For example, the product development tool enables the company to bring products to market faster, while the pricing tool helps it ensure prices are profitable for the company and satisfactory for the client.

“AI is not new to Stitch Fix,” Baer said. “When we launched nearly 15 years ago, we disrupted retail with a proprietary data-driven approach. Over time, we’ve amassed billions of insights on our clients’ fit, style and budget preferences that, combined with the human judgment of our stylists, enable us to uniquely deliver ultra personalization at scale.”
