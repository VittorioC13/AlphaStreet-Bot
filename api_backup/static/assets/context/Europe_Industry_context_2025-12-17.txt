[TEXT]
Positioned to create value by offering broader portfolio of high performing commercial EVs at lower unit costs, targeting ~$23B medium-duty market1

Strengthened financial profile with access up to $50 million in new debt financing

Combined company to be called Workhorse and trade on Nasdaq under “WKHS”

Scott Griffith, Workhorse CEO, issues letter to shareholders highlighting strategic vision and go-forward priorities

WIXOM, Mich., Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group Inc. (Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or the “Company”), an American manufacturer of zero-emission commercial vehicles, and Motiv Electric Trucks (“Motiv”), a leading manufacturer of medium-duty electric trucks and buses, today announced that they have completed their merger and are moving forward as Workhorse, a leading North American manufacturer of medium-duty electric trucks and buses.

With the completion of the transaction, Workhorse has scalable manufacturing capabilities, advanced and road-tested products, and a robust go-to-market approach which includes successfully developing commercial relationships with 10 of the largest commercial truck fleets in North America.

In connection with the completion of the transaction, Motiv’s legacy controlling investor has provided Workhorse with up to $50 million in new debt financing capacity, of which approximately $10 million is available in a revolving credit facility and up to an additional $40 million is available to fund supply-chain related costs associated with new purchase orders. In addition to materially reducing time from order-to-delivery, these financings are expected to provide significant liquidity to fund growth.

“At Workhorse, we’re not just building electric trucks, we’re building better trucks. Our software-first electric trucks are powerful, cost-efficient, reliable, safe, and comfortable—all with zero tailpipe emissions and pollution,” said Scott Griffith, who became CEO of Workhorse upon the close of the transaction. “Workhorse trucks perform the same or better as their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts, while costing far less over the lifetime of the vehicle.”

“Looking ahead,” Griffith continued, “we are going to build on our 20-plus year combined legacy in electrification and the thousand-plus electric trucks and buses we have delivered to meet the needs of our growing customer base. In doing so, we believe we are positioned to drive profitable growth, create value for our shareholders and customers and deliver on our Better Trucks, Better World ambition.”

Workhorse is poised to create value for shareholders and customers by:

- Exchange remains subject to shareholder approval -

IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AEON Biopharma, Inc. (“AEON” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: AEON), a biopharmaceutical company seeking accelerated and full-label U.S. market entry by developing ABP-450 (prabotulinumtoxinA) as a BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) biosimilar, today announced that the Company and Daewoong Pharmaceutical (“Daewoong”) have entered into a definitive agreement to exchange the Company’s $15 million of convertible notes plus accrued interest into new equity, $1.5 million of new notes due 2030, and a cash-exercise warrant for 8 million shares of common stock, on the same terms as the warrants in the private placement financing announced in November 2025 (the “Exchange”). The cash-exercise warrants, if exercised, represent over $8 million in potential additional cash proceeds to AEON.

“We are pleased to report the signing of definitive documentation for our exchange of Daewoong’s existing AEON-issued debt,” said Rob Bancroft, President & Chief Executive Officer of AEON. “While the transaction remains subject to a shareholder vote, this is an impotant step forward in deleveraging the company and we believe sets the stage for continued progress for our ABP-450 biosimiliar strategy in 2026.”

Previously, AEON and Daewoong entered into a binding term sheet contemplating the Exchange. The parties have now completed the definitive documentation for the Exchange, which documentation aligns with the terms agreed upon in the binding term sheet. The consummation of the Exchange remains subject to stockholder approval.

The Exchange will result in the elimination of more than 90% of AEON’s outstanding debt, strengthen Daewoong’s long-term strategic alignment with the Company and the Company’s stockholders, and transform AEON’s capital structure.

NEW DELHI: More than 60% of the 8,500 registered small and medium pharmaceutical units in India may be forced to shut shop by the end of this month for failing to comply with the guidelines on good manufacturing practices (GMP).These manufacturers must upgrade their facilities by December 31 as per the extended deadline to comply with the revised Schedule M rules, which deal with good manufacturing practices under the Drugs and Cosmetic Act . But most of them, which operate single facilities, are unlikely to meet the deadline, said industry executives.Closing down these units many cause a shortage of commonly used drugs, affect thousands of jobs and impact the medicine security of low- and middle-income countries that depend on imports from India, they warned.India is estimated to have about 12,000 drug manufacturing units. The units that risk being shut down account for about Rs 75,000 crore of India's Rs 2.5 lakh crore domestic drug market, the executives said.This may result in shortages of antibiotics, anti-hypertensives, anti-inflammatory medicines, analgesic, anti-cough and cold tablets, diabetes drugs and general medicines, among others, said a pharma industry expert, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "The shortages of medicines will be seen across the country. Many of these units also cater to government supplies along with supplies to tier-II and tier-III cities and exports."As reported earlier, more than 20 pharma associations had asked the government to extend the deadline. The government has not yet changed its stance."Ironically, there are companies which have been in the industry for over 2-3 decades. They are already overburdened with the existing cash credit and cannot infuse any further capital," said Rajesh Gupta , who heads the pharma committee of the RSS-affiliated Laghu Udyog Bharati and is president of the Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association, Baddi.According to the drug regulator's November 7 order, drug makers will face stricter enforcement if they are found to be non-compliant with the guidelines. State drug regulators have been asked to submit monthly reports to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, containing details of inspections and observations made and the action taken pursuant to such inspections.The revised Schedule M-which outlines tighter quality rules for manufacturing, such as a prompt recall system for products known or suspected to be defective-was notified in January 2022. While units with annual turnover of more than Rs 250 crore had to comply with the rules from July 1, 2023, the implementation date for MSMEs was January 1 this year.While most big companies, which operate multiple units and export to developed markets like the US and Europe, already meet the new regulations, the government extended the deadline by a year for MSMEs after they sought more time to make the necessary changes in their processes.Drug makers that wanted to extend the timeline to the end of this month had been asked to carry out a gap analysis and file an application with the drug regulator, detailing their strategy to comply with the revised manufacturing standards.

[TITLE]EU Lawmakers to Weigh Easing Capital Rules on Safest Bank Bonds:

[TITLE]ECB to simplify bank capital rules but stick to buffer requirements:
[TEXT]

The European Central Bank (ECB) outlined plans to simplify bank regulation and capital rules on Thursday, but is sticking to its pledge not to ease overall capital reserve requirements.

The authority said the capital proposals are focused on having fewer – rather than lower – types of capital buffers lenders must hold to protect their balance sheets against shock losses.

Irish woman Sharon Donnery, a member of the ECB banking supervisory board, was a key member of the taskforce set up earlier this year to ease the burden of banking supervision following more than a decade of tighter rules in the wake of the global financial crisis, which resulted in taxpayer-funded bailouts of European banks.

In a statement, the ECB said its aim was to “simplify the framework” without endangering the “resilience of the European banking system”.

The ECB’s top decision-making body, its governing council, backed the recommendations. They will now be sent to the European Commission for consideration as part of a wider push by Brussels to streamline policies and laws to make the European Union more competitive.*

The taskforce concluded that the bloc’s current capital rules are overly complex and risk backfiring as investors may not understand them. European banks are at present subject to a number of individual capital buffers, four of which the ECB wants to merge into two.

“The variety of capital elements in place in the EU may decrease transparency and increase uncertainty as market participants face more challenges in assessing the capital framework,” the report said.

It suggested combining several individual capital surcharges that the ECB at present applies to banks based on their individual risk profile.

The report did not explicitly state whether the combined amount of capital that banks would be required to hold would stay the same, but it said lenders should “sustain current levels of resilience” to absorb losses in a crisis.

The ECB also proposed exempting more small lenders from the international Basel standards, which are designed for large, risky lenders with cross-border business.

At present, all banks with more than €5 billion in assets need to meet those rules, which the taskforce said created “undue complexity” and costs for lenders that were too small to have repercussions on financial stability.

The ECB suggested raising the threshold and adding more exemptions for smaller banks.

Still, the three domestic Irish lenders, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB will remain subject to standards set for larger banks.

The European Banking Federation welcomed the ECB’s report but said “concrete ‌and determined steps must now follow to enhance the global competitiveness of the EU’s financial sector”. – Additional reporting: Reuters, Financial Times

Erdoğan sets $100 bln trade goal with Turkic states

ANKARA

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Türkiye aims to raise trade with Turkic states to $100 billion, unveiling a new policy framework to deepen economic and political integration across these nations.

Erdoğan made the remarks on Dec. 15 at the launch of his ruling Justice and Development Party’s “Turkic World Vision Document” in the capital Ankara.

“This is an important document in building the next century. Our document is the most concrete indicator of developing unity and solidarity in our Turkic world,” Erdoğan said.

He said the vision document spans a broad range of policy areas, including economic integration, cultural cooperation, energy security, transportation networks and youth policies.

“The sections organized across a wide range of areas, from economic integration goals to cultural cooperation, from energy security to transportation networks and youth policies, plan to efficiently mobilize the existing potential of Turkic states,” he said.

Erdoğan said economic strategies form the backbone of the document, underscoring Ankara’s trade ambitions.

“As the Turkic world, we see our strengthening unity as the strengthening of all humanity. We aim to increase trade with the Turkic world to $100 billion,” he said, adding that “establishing financial mechanisms is vital for the sustainability of regional integration.”

He said Turkic states have built “unparalleled ties” over the past three decades in fields ranging from education and trade to security, energy, culture and the arts.

“We aim to deepen integration among Turkic states and strengthen multi-dimensional cooperation within an institutional framework. Economic development, cultural solidarity, strategic collaborations and the achievement of regional peace are central to our vision document,” Erdoğan said.

He added the document was prepared in six dialects using a common alphabet.

In September last year, a joint commission within the Organization of Turkic States (OTS) reached an agreement on adopting a shared alphabet consisting of 34 letters. The decision followed the commission’s third meeting held in Baku, with contributions from the Turkish Language Association.

[TITLE]FG to build 3,700 rural telecom towers in Nigeria:
[TEXT]
The Federal Government plans to bankroll the construction of 3,700 telecom towers in rural areas, a move aimed at connecting millions of citizens who currently lack reliable mobile and internet services.

Telecom operators often avoid sparsely populated rural areas due to low profit potential, focusing instead on urban centres where investment can be recouped. The government’s intervention will extend mobile and internet services to over 23 million Nigerians who presently lack access.

Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Bosun Tijani said the initiative has been approved by President Bola Tinubu and the Federal Executive Council.

“At the recent Federal Executive Council meeting, the President approved investment in close to 4,000 towers in rural areas.
