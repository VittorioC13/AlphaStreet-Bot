[TITLE]Barfresh Enters into Stock Purchase Agreement for Strategic Acquisition of Manufacturing Company: Arps Dairy:
[TEXT]
Company Increases Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Guidance to Range of $14.5 million to $15.5 million

Company Issues Preliminary Fiscal Year 2026 Pro Forma Revenue Guidance of $30 million to $35 Million; a 126% increase compared to the high range of fiscal 2025 guidance

Acquisition Dramatically Increases Bottling Production Capacity and is Expected to be Accretive to Earnings in Fiscal 2026

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barfresh Food Group Inc. (the “Company” or “Barfresh”) (Nasdaq: BRFH), a provider of frozen, ready-to-blend and ready-to-drink beverages, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding capital stock of Arps Dairy, Inc., an Ohio-based dairy processing company, for approximately $1.6 million in debt repayment, which the company was able to do by increasing its line of credit. The strategic acquisition positions Barfresh to significantly enhance its manufacturing capabilities while reducing operational costs and improving margins. The acquisition includes Arps Dairy's existing processing facility in Defiance, Ohio, consisting of 15,000 square-feet as well as an almost completely constructed 44,000-square-foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that Barfresh plans to complete construction and install processing equipment during 2026, creating a modern production hub that will serve as a cornerstone of the Company's expanded manufacturing strategy. In addition, Arps Dairy has been preliminarily approved for a $2.3 million government grant to be used towards finalizing the construction and equipment installation of the additional 44,000 square-foot facility.

Riccardo Delle Coste, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, "This manufacturing transaction represents a transformational step in our operational evolution and growth trajectory. By bringing the majority of our manufacturing in-house, we’re eliminating third-party manufacturing fees, reducing freight costs, and gaining greater control over our supply chain while positioning ourselves for accelerated growth and expanded market opportunities. The manufacturing facility acquisition provides us with the operational foundation and cost efficiencies necessary to scale our business profitably. The synergy of this acquisition will attract production opportunities and position us to capture significant value creation opportunities in 2026 and beyond, while delivering enhanced returns to our shareholders through improved operational efficiency and expanded market reach."

Barfresh is purchasing Arps at a discount to the projected completion value of its net assets, in addition to the benefit of an expected $2.3 million government grant, and has already commenced manufacturing certain products at Arps Dairy’s existing facility and expects to expand production immediately upon closing of agreement. This acquisition delivers multiple operational advantages including elimination of third-party manufacturing fees, more efficient ingredient procurement and reduced freight costs, lower cold storage costs through integrated operations, and enhanced oversight of production processes. Based on the expected operational benefits from the manufacturing capacity expansion and new market expansion opportunities enabled by the Arps acquisition, Barfresh is raising its fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance to $14.5 million to $15.5 million, representing an increase from the previous guidance range of $12.5 million to $14.0 million. The Company is also providing preliminary fiscal year 2026 revenue guidance of $30 million to $35 million, reflecting the full-year impact of the enhanced manufacturing capabilities, operational synergies and expanded market reach from the increased production capacity.

The acquisition is structured as a stock purchase for approximately $1.6 million, representing the repayment of certain existing Arps Dairy debt, including an asset-based revolving facility, with closing subject to customary conditions.

Barfresh expects the transaction to close by October 1, 2025.

[TITLE]How Intel's Nvidia deal could help Intel's next generation of chip manufacturing:
[TEXT]
By Stephen Nellis

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia's deal with Intel could put the struggling chipmaker's next-generation manufacturing technology on a stronger footing, even without a direct commitment from the AI chip leader to use that technology to make its own chips, analysts said.

Nvidia on Thursday invested $5 billion in Intel for a stake of roughly 4%, and the two firms agreed to a deal to supply chips to one another to create "multiple generations" of joint products. Those products will connect Intel's central processors and Nvidia's artificial intelligence and graphics chips with a speedy and proprietary Nvidia connection technology called NVLink.

This could give Intel a leg up against rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices because its chips will be attached to Nvidia's flagship products in a way that no other third-party chips currently are, analysts said. The joint products - in early stages of development and likely to be made on future manufacturing lines - could also provide an indirect boost to Intel's 14A manufacturing process slated for 2027. Analysts have said this process is critical to its success, and Intel itself has warned it may not be able to pursue 14A if the company fails to get enough customer commitments to justify the expense of building it.

[TITLE]Byte-Sized AI: Uber Freight Upgrades TMS; Ralph Lauren Launches Chatbot With OpenAI and Microsoft:
[TEXT]
Byte-Sized AI is a bi-weekly column that covers all things artificial intelligence—from startup funding, to newly inked partnerships, to just-launched, AI-powered capabilities from major retailers, software providers and supply chain players.

Google and PayPal partner in preparation for agentic commerce

Google and PayPal want to “help advance the intelligent agent revolution” by making the next generation of digital commerce more accessible to a broad swath of consumers.

The two companies announced Wednesday that they had entered a multi-year partnership focused on upgrading consumers’ transaction experience for evolving AI systems. One of the goals of the partnership is to solidify the necessary cogs for future agentic commerce by leveraging PayPal’s data capturing, identity verification and payment solutions and using Google’s AI savviness. While the two companies have a vested interest in pushing agentic commerce forward, they also highlighted the need for reliable, safe transactions, particularly with AI’s involvement. The partnership announcement comes just one day after Google unveiled its Agent Payments Protocol, which is intended to foster trustworthy transactions led by agents.

Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said the partnership will have far-reaching implications for the technology and e-commerce industries, if executed as planned.

“In this emerging world of agentic commerce, trust and innovation are key,” Chriss said in a statement. “Together with Google, we are leading the way for digital commerce, ensuring greater opportunities for merchants and users worldwide. We are bringing PayPal’s products and services to billions of Google users and redefining what’s possible at global scale.”

The move comes a few months after major payment providers Visa and Mastercard announced that they had teamed up with some of the world’s largest AI companies to enable agentic commerce securely and without sacrificing consumers’ sensitive information.

While the work stemming from those partnerships has not yet come to life at scale, the hope is that linking payment systems with existing AI shopping applications can allow for a truly autonomous experience that would see assistants purchasing items on consumers’ behalf based on a specific inquiry.

Uber Freight upgrades TMS with AI

Uber Freight announced at Deliver 2025, its annual conference, that it had upgraded the AI capabilities available on its platform in an effort to make logistics simpler and more efficient.

Uber Freight’s transportation management system (TMS) has been leveraging AI for some time, but this week, Uber announced that clients can now use the platform to track and handle the order-to-cash journey of shipments in full. That means that, where operators may previously have needed separate, disconnected systems, they can now leverage a single platform that helps them decision quicker and identify issues sooner.

Uber said the platform gives operators “greater control of freight spend and more accurate forecasting across the network.” The company’s hope is that clients use the TMS for real-time information, rather than treating it as a source for completed transactions and freight runs.

In addition to its spend upgrades, Uber has added more features to its procurement platform. The company said it can now automate the data-gathering and modeling behind bid awards. Rather than having a human spend days or weeks finding the information, requesting quotes and evaluating the options against one another, Uber Freight’s platform can generate a real-time comparison of costs, carriers, available services and more. What’s more, the system can project financial and performance metrics ahead of an operator choosing a specific carrier or plan.

The logistics player hopers that, in doing so, it can help clients cut costs and make faster decisions relying on data.

Steve Barber, vice president of product at Uber Freight, said it has already been leveraging agentic AI in its operations with customers, and noted that it expects to provide tangible improvements with these new capabilities.

“From procurement to payment, shippers face constant complexity across the freight lifecycle. Through continued investment in platform innovation, Uber Freight delivers the tools, automations and integrations that simplify the work and unlock meaningful outcomes such as faster decisions, smarter cost control, and more resilient supply chains,” Barber said in a statement.

[TITLE]Lyft, Inc. (LYFT): A Bull Case Theory:
[TEXT]
We came across a bullish thesis on Lyft, Inc. on Value investing subreddit by dimabiryuk. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LYFT. Lyft, Inc.'s share was trading at $18.62 as of September 12th. LYFT’s trailing and forward P/E were 80.96 and 16.47 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

5 Rental Car Companies, Ranked from Worst to Best

Lyft (LYFT) has seen its stock price decline sharply since its IPO peak of $88, but it has stabilized in the $8–20 range over the past four years. Recently, the company has shown meaningful improvements, turning profitable in the last several quarters while consistently beating analysts’ earnings expectations. Revenue growth has accelerated, with 20–30% year-over-year increases underscoring the business’s momentum.

Despite this, Lyft remains valued at just over one year’s revenue, creating a significant disconnect between fundamentals and market pricing. The company has also generated $1 billion in free cash flow, highlighting its improving financial strength. Strategically, Lyft acquired the European ride-hailing service FreeNow and entered a partnership with Baidu to launch robotaxis in Europe, positioning itself for exposure to autonomous mobility. Additionally, it teamed up with May Mobility to bring robotaxis to Atlanta, further strengthening its presence in next-generation transportation solutions. Insider alignment is clear, as the Lyft CEO continues to purchase company shares, signaling confidence in the company’s future.

From a market perspective, the stock appears to be emerging from a prolonged accumulation zone, with technical indicators pointing toward a potential breakout. Growing retail interest is also evident, with increasing coverage and investor attention in recent weeks. With profitability, rapid revenue growth, new strategic initiatives, and a clean valuation, Lyft presents a compelling risk/reward setup. In a bullish scenario, the stock could double within months and potentially quadruple over two years, offering investors significant upside if execution and momentum continue.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Lyft, Inc. (LYFT) by Stefan Waldhauser in April 2025, which highlighted the $197 million FreeNow acquisition as a pivotal expansion into Europe. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 67% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as international growth remains intact. Dimabiryuk shares a similar view but emphasizes profitability, revenue growth, and free cash flow.

Lyft, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 51 hedge fund portfolios held LYFT at the end of the second quarter which was 56 in the previous quarter.

[TITLE]Construction Spending Strategic Business Report 2025: Market to Reach $5 Trillion by 2030 - Growth in Public-Private Partnerships Spurs Investment in Large-Scale Projects:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Construction Spending - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Construction Spending was estimated at US$4.0 Trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$5.0 Trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Construction spending refers to the total expenditure on construction projects over a specific period. It encompasses a broad range of activities, from residential and commercial building to infrastructure development such as roads, bridges, and utilities. This measure is an important economic indicator, reflecting both public and private sector investment in building and infrastructure works. The figures are closely monitored by economists, investors, and policymakers because they provide insights into the health of the construction industry, which is a significant component of gross domestic product (GDP) and directly correlates with the overall economic health of a country.

In recent years, the landscape of construction spending has been shaped by a variety of trends and shifts in both residential and commercial sectors. Residential construction has seen a notable upswing driven by low interest rates, increasing demand for housing, and an evolving preference for suburban and rural homes - a trend accelerated by the global shift towards remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the commercial front, there has been a significant transformation with increased investments in industrial facilities, especially those related to e-commerce and logistics. Conversely, the office and retail construction sectors have faced declines, as businesses reevaluate their space needs in response to increasing online shopping and ongoing adjustments to where and how people work.

The growth in the construction spending market is driven by several factors, including technological advancements in building materials and construction methods. The adoption of green building practices, aimed at reducing carbon footprints and enhancing energy efficiency, has spurred new projects that adhere to stricter environmental regulations. Furthermore, government fiscal policies, particularly public spending on infrastructure projects, significantly influence construction spending.

Economic recovery packages, often including substantial allocations for infrastructure, can lead to surges in sector activity. Consumer behavior, particularly the increased demand for customized and luxury residential properties, also plays a critical role in driving construction spending. These multifaceted growth drivers ensure that the construction industry remains robust and capable of adapting to evolving economic and environmental landscapes.

[TEXT]
(Reuters) - GE Aerospace reached a five-year labor agreement with more than 600 striking workers of the United Auto Workers union at its Ohio and Kentucky distribution facilities, the aircraft engine supplier said on Friday.

The agreement ends a three-week strike at GE Aerospace's Evendale plant in Ohio that produces marine and industrial engines for the U.S. Navy and its Erlanger facility in Kentucky that supplies parts to some of the company's engine plants.

The tentative deal outlined by the union includes a base wage increase ranging from 3% to 5% through 2029, along with about $3,500 in cash payments per employee to help offset rising healthcare costs.
