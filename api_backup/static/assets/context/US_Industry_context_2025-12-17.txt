[TITLE]Haier India readying ₹3,500-crore investment plan as it looks to set up third manufacturing facility in India:
[TEXT]
Consumer durables major Haier Appliance India is readying an investment plan of ₹3,500 crore as it is looking to set up its third manufacturing facility in the country. The company said it is in the process of exploring locations for the new facility and expects to finalise plans by next year. It is also eyeing revenues of ₹14,500 crore in CY2026.

The company on Friday unveiled its Gravity AI Series air conditioners at an event held at its Greater Noida facility.

NS Satish, President, Haier Appliances India told businessline, “We are looking at setting up our third manufacturing facility in India. We are looking at possible locations and it could be in the southern or western region. We expect to finalise the plans by next year and expect to make investments of ₹3,500 crore in phases in the third facility. This will be funded through internal accruals,” he added.

Asked about the overall revenue target for 2026, he added, “We expect to end 2025 with revenues of about ₹11,000 crore – up about 22 per cent over previous year. For CY2026, we have set our sights on revenues of ₹14,500 crore. This growth will be led by air conditioners and LED televisions categories, besides washing machines and refrigerators. We are among the top three brands now and have been able to grow strongly in 2025 despite challenges.”

Capacity expansion

The company also aims to ramp up its air conditioner manufacturing capacity in India. It expects its annual production capacity to rise to 4 million AC units by 2027.

”Air conditioners segment has very low penetration levels of just about 11 per cent and hence is a rapidly growing segment in the country. We are ramping up our manufacturing capacity aggressively. We believe this will enable us to grow our market share to 18 per cent from the current 7 per cent by 2030,” he added.

The company said it has also been strategically investing in its Greater Noida facility to strengthen component development and enhance production agility.

“We believe the Haier Gravity AI Series AC powered by AI-Atmos represents the next frontier in AI-driven home appliances and reinforces our deep commitment to understanding the needs of Indian consumers. With 90 per cent of our products now manufactured locally, we are reinforcing self-reliance, improving efficiency, and ensuring faster availability for households across India,” Satish said. The new Haier Gravity AI Series AC range starts at ₹49,990.

Currently, Haier India operates two manufacturing facilities in Greater Noida and Pune.

[TITLE]Johnvents, Ondo reaffirm investment in agribusiness, manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Johnvents Group has reaffirmed its commitment to deepening partnerships, investing in capacity, and building industries that will accelerate Nigeria’s economic transformation and boost Africa’s global competitiveness.

The resolve came as the Ondo State Government restated its ambition to position the state as a competitive hub for agribusiness, manufacturing, technology, and energy.

According to a statement, the Johnvents Group’s leadership gave the assurance during the company’s 2025 End-of-Year Celebration held at The Dome, Akure, where industry leaders, international partners, traditional rulers, including the Deji of Akure, and senior government officials gathered to review what the firm described as “a transformative year.”

Delivering the welcome address, Group Executive Director of Johnvents, Tarun Chawla, stated that the organisation had strengthened its operations and expanded its global presence. He noted that the company’s growth was made possible by a supportive business environment provided by the Ondo State Government.

He said, “This year reshaped us as a business. We strengthened our operations, expanded our relevance, and demonstrated what a committed team can achieve when purpose and discipline align. The stability and clarity your administration provides form the foundation on which organisations like ours continue to grow and innovate.”

Chawla appreciated the confidence of partners such as British International Investment, the International Finance Corporation, AFRIEXIM Bank, and other financial institutions in the Group’s long-term vision. He said Johnvents had now become “a global value-chain participant with investments and collaborations spanning Africa, the UAE, Asia, and Europe.”

In his keynote address, the Executive Governor of Ondo State, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, described Johnvents Group as a model of how homegrown enterprises can become global powerhouses without losing touch with their host communities.

Aiyedatiwa noted: “Johnvents stands today as a monument to what focused investment and structured institutional support can achieve. With over ten factories, more than 1,500 direct employees, thousands of benefiting households and an ecosystem of over 5,000 farmers, Johnvents is living proof that prosperity becomes inevitable when ingenuity meets institutional support.”

He listed reforms in ease of doing business, digitisation of government processes, security enhancement, infrastructure expansion, and the work of the Ondo State Development and Investment Promotion Agency as critical pillars of the state’s strategy to strengthen private-sector competitiveness.

The governor noted that the success of companies like Johnvents aligns with the administration’s vision of an inclusive, opportunity-driven economy. “The Johnvents story assures every investor here and across the world that Ondo State is ready for investment, ready for expansion and ready for global competitiveness,” he emphasised.

The event also celebrated the resilience of Johnvents’ workforce and the company’s widening contributions to community development, including education, youth empowerment and agribusiness initiatives.

Johnvents added that it is committed to partnering with local and global institutions, scaling capacity, and building industries that deliver value across Nigeria’s agricultural and manufacturing value chains.

The Group operates seven businesses, including Johnvents Cocoa Factory, Johnvents Trading, Johnvents Foods, Johnvents Industries DMCC, Johnvents Farms, Premium Cocoa Product (Ile-Oluji), and Haven Hauling, spanning production, processing, manufacturing, and trade of commodities and food products in Nigeria and other regions.

[TITLE]Kennedy Wilson, Affinius Provide $384M Construction Financing Package for Jersey City Multifamily Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
New Jersey developer Panepinto Properties has landed a $384 million financing package to develop the first building in its two-tower multifamily project on the Jersey City waterfront, Commercial Observer can first report.

Kennedy Wilson provided a $306 million senior loan, while Affinius Capital supplied $78 million of preferred equity for the planned 678-unit Harborside 8 project.

“We are proud to play a role in bringing this high-impact multifamily project to fruition in Jersey City, which continues to experience low vacancy levels and consistent rent growth,” Thomas Whitesell, head of Kennedy Wilson’s debt investment group, said in a statement.

The property is scheduled for completion in 2028. Units in Harborside 8 will have views of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline, and amenities will include a rooftop terrace, a pool, a fitness center and coworking spaces.

“Harborside 8 will address the significant demand for premium multifamily housing in one of the region’s most dynamic and fastest-growing markets,” David Greenburg, Affinius Capital’s co-head of credit originations, said in a release. “Panepinto Properties brings proven execution capabilities and extensive New Jersey market knowledge, critical advantages for a development of this scale in Jersey City.”

Panepinto Properties, led by founder and CEO Joseph A. Panepinto Sr., acquired the development site that will be utilized for Penepinto’s Harborside 8 and Harborside 9 projects from Veris Residential — formerly Mack-Cali Realty — for $75 million, Real Estate NJ reported. Veris has been busy divesting properties, also recently selling The James in Park Ridge, according to NJ Biz.

The towers will have a combined 1,267 units. Harborside 8 will reach 65 stories and comprise 678 rental units, 8,578 square feet of retail space, a 350-space parking garage and a 40,000-square-foot public park along the Hudson River, according to Real Estate NJ.

JLL’s Tom Didio negotiated the financing.

[TITLE]Kawa Capital Provides $79M Construction Loan for Boston-Area Life Sciences Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, a Boston-area developer specializing in transportation projects, has secured $79.3 million to build The Bolt, a 180,000-square-foot life sciences lab, office and manufacturing complex in Woburn, Mass., a suburb 10 miles outside Boston.

Kawa Capital Management provided the construction financing for a project that is expected to require a total of $125 million of investment capital. Aries Capital served as the capital markets advisor on the transaction.

Jeremy Lash, director at Kawa Capital Management, described The Bolt in a statement as a “high-quality asset” in a popular market near Boston.

“We are confident The Bolt will draw interest from energy, manufacturing, life sciences and technology companies looking for prime space in an optimal location,” he said.

Located at 216 New Boston Street in Woburn — which has become a minor hub for life sciences development in recent years — The Bolt is part of a larger $400 million investment project by Cabot, Cabot & Forbes.

These other projects include the development of Emblem 120, a 289-unit luxury multifamily complex with ground-floor retail, and Zero New Boston, a planned building that would bring 250 apartments and 1,200 square feet of retail to Woburn.

In a statement, Daniel Nagler, chief investment officer at Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, called Woburn “an ideal location,” noting that the suburb is accessible from both Boston and Cambridge via two highways and a commuter rail station, positioning it as a regional destination for life sciences and other CRE development.

“We believe it will continue to attract innovative companies, and it is why we are so bullish on the location,” Nagler added.

The Bolt is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2027.
