Kopin gains significant access to the European and NATO defense market

Accelerates development of critical technologies

Further strengthens Kopin’s balance sheet

Fixed conversion price of $3.00 per share on $7 million convertible preferred stock issuance

WESTBOROUGH, Mass. – Kopin Corporation (NASDAQ: KOPN) a leading provider of application-specific optical systems and high-performance microdisplays for defense, training, enterprise, industrial, consumer and medical products, announces a $15.0 million strategic investment agreement by Theon International Plc (Euronext Amsterdam: THEON), a globally recognized developer and manufacturer of advanced thermal imaging and night vision systems for global defense and thermal imaging markets.

Upon closing the parties will enter into a licensing and development agreement and funding agreements. Theon will invest $8.0 million into Kopin’s subsidiary in Dalgety Bay, Scotland, supporting co-developed products for Europe, Southeast Asia, and NATO countries, enabling collaborative initiatives across key global regions. In exchange for the $8.0 million Theon will receive a 49% equity interest in Kopin Europe. The parties anticipate performing joint development and production activities at Kopin’s wholly owned subsidiary in Reston, Virginia USA.

In addition, Theon will purchase $7.0 million of preferred shares from Kopin convertible into common stock at a fixed conversion price of $3.00 per share. Kopin will have the ability to force the conversion to common stock, once Kopin’s stock trades at $4.50 or higher for a period of 10 trading days within a 30 consecutive trading day period as defined in the agreements. The preferred shares carry an annual dividend of 4% payable in cash and stock. The $15.0 million investment is subject to standard closing conditions including obtaining necessary regulatory approval and is expected to close in Kopin’s fiscal third quarter.

“We are glad to be partnering up with KOPIN to realize their strategy of supplying complete systems directly to end users using novel micro-displays,” said Christian Hadjiminas, THEON’s CEO. “THEON’s extended A.R.M.E.D. product line of Augmented Reality solutions for the dismounted solder will be a vehicle for co-developments between the two companies enabling and expanding resources on KOPIN’s facilities in Reston (VA) that becomes Theon USA ‘s new industrial location. KOPIN’s engineering, components, and market reach will increase THEON’s US market penetration, while THEON’s global footprint in the rest of the world, along with the European jointly owned company KOPIN Europe (Scotland, UK) will ensure KOPIN’s products as well as the new co-developed products by KOPIN and THEON will be globally promoted. A true U.S. and European alliance for the present and future in the digital man portable space.”

Michael Murray, Chairman and CEO of Kopin stated, “Theon’s investment reflects our confidence in the relationship and the value we see in working together. The investment is expected to accelerate revenue growth in new markets, scale existing operations and better leverage our manufacturing infrastructure. Partnering with a world class international organization like Theon – one that believes in our future and shares in our vision – comes at a pivotal time as global defense spending continues to rise and a transformative milestone in Kopin’s evolution.”

This strategic relationship is expected to elevate Kopin’s position as a global player in microdisplays and application specific optical solutions for defense applications, and drive innovation, expand market reach, and reinforce Kopin’s role in delivering mission-critical optical technologies to allied defense forces worldwide.

[TITLE]The defense prime contractors have a new problem on their hands:
[TEXT]
"We will set the pace with innovation, and we will win with silicon and software, and not with our soldiers' blood and bodies," US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said on Monday.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The defense primes have a fresh challenge on their hands: A US Army that's tilting ever more toward a start-up-friendly, fast-moving procurement system.

US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said on Monday that the military needs to rapidly overhaul its procurement processes and reduce its dependence on the largest defense contractors.

"We cannot f---ing wait to innovate until Americans are dying on the battlefield," Driscoll said in his remarks at the annual meeting of the Association of the United States Army in Washington.

"We must act now to enable our soldiers. Our window to change is right now, and we have a plan to do it. We will set the pace with innovation, and we will win with silicon and software, and not with our soldiers' blood and bodies," he added.

Driscoll told meeting attendees that the military will be announcing changes to the way equipment is purchased "in just a matter of weeks." He added that a Silicon Valley approach, which combines "venture capital money and mentorship with startup culture," would be "absolutely ideal for the Army."

"We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long," Driscoll said.

"We will break down barriers until we measure acquisitions, not in years and billions, but in months and thousands," he added.

Representatives for the US Army did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Primes under fire

Prime defense contractors are companies that have direct contracts with the government. They include major aerospace players such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as well as arms makers like General Dynamics.

Since taking office in February, Driscoll has called for a revamp of the military's procurement processes. Driscoll served in the Army from 2007 to 2011 and was an officer with the Army's 10th Mountain Division in Iraq.

In an interview with Business Insider in April, Driscoll said Washington has "optimized for nearly everything other than the soldier in their decision-making."

"What has occurred is a hollowing out of a lot of the tools that we have given our soldiers," Driscoll said.

During an appearance on the "TBPN" podcast in May, Driscoll said he would consider it a "success if in the next two years, one of the primes is no longer in business, and the rest of them have all gotten stronger."

The largest arms makers have the expertise to design classified systems to the military's needs and the advanced manufacturing to build them at scale in the US. They often rely on subcontractors to integrate the sophisticated systems and their computerized displays and controls.

These projects face an inherent strain: They must be built rapidly enough for current missions but with sufficient capability to remain effective in a war that could be decades into the future.

It's a lengthy process that has been consolidated to a smaller number of major companies since the end of the Cold War. And it is this system that the Defense Department wants to widen to new players and speed up.

Silicon Valley titans, who specialize in rushing new digital services to the market, have also criticized the defense establishment.

"The Pentagon recently failed its seventh consecutive audit, suggesting that the agency's leadership has little idea how its annual budget of more than $800 billion is spent," Elon Musk said in an op-ed he cowrote with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for The Wall Street Journal in November.

Musk and Ramaswamy wrote the op-ed as co-leaders of the White House DOGE office. Ramaswamy left DOGE in January, and Musk left in May.

Primes can move slowly

In the US, some major weapons developments by primes have been marked by severe delays. This includes Lockheed Martin's F-35 program, which was mired in controversy, delays, and rising costs. The United States Government Accountability Office in 2023 said the program that builds three versions of an advanced stealth fighter was "more than a decade delayed and $165 billion over its original plans."

Jets still arrive late. In 2024, all of the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters delivered came late, with an average delay of 238 days.

Other big projects involving primes that are facing delays include Boeing's KC-46 Pegasus aerial-refueling tanker and the US Navy's Virginia-class submarine program with General Dynamics Corp. and Huntington Ingalls Industries.

Driscoll did not elaborate on what a new procurement system looks like, and the Pentagon has gutted its weapons testing office that independently assesses programs. The US military would likely still need many of the products made by primes. They are often the most advanced items a military buys, which is why they can be more vulnerable to issues than when companies work on smaller systems or single components.

Many US defense contractors lack commercial sales, making them wholly dependent on government spending. Huntington Ingalls Industries, for example, is the only American shipbuilder with the facilities and expertise to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

An F-35, for example, has thousands of parts, and is a multinational project, with parts coming from allies like the UK and the Netherlands.

The defense market may be most open to new players in software and expendable drones, where barriers to entry are much lower.

Ukraine, hailed by allies as successful at manufacturing small drones to defend itself against Russia, still wants the big-ticket items like armored vehicles and missiles from allies, with its less-powerful assets alone unable to do much more than keep Ukraine on the defensive.

But its fight has still inspired Western industry. A host of new defense companies have emerged in response, and many major Western defense contractors have initiated new partnerships to acquire cutting-edge technology, work more efficiently, and address capacity gaps.

Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider that while startups could make inroads into arms manufacturing, it will be difficult for them to beat the incumbents.

McGinn was the principal deputy director in the Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy at the Department of Defense from 2015 to 2018, where he oversaw acquisition policy.

"You've got to have a strong technical workforce, so there are significant barriers to entry there, but you have seen companies get involved," McGinn said.

"The big example, of course, is SpaceX and Blue Origin. They disrupted the space launch business by coming in with their model, but it is hard to do," he added.

A startup-friendly US military

Driscoll's calls for quicker industry processes are in line with those of Silicon Valley and the views of US allies abroad.

And Driscoll's push for cost-cutting means the market will adjust accordingly, says McGinn.

"If the government says, 'We want more commercially oriented drones that they're simple to make, that cost a hundred thousand dollars or less,' companies are going to do that, and some companies that may not be competitive for them, they won't bid," he said.

"This is very much a monopsony, where the government sets the market. The companies are going to be competitive, and they are going to try to respond. They will partner with other companies to make themselves more competitive," he added.

In May, Meta announced it is partnering with the defense technology startup Anduril to build next-gen extended reality gear for the US military. Anduril said the project was "funded through private capital, without taxpayer support," and would "save the US military billions of dollars." This program has suffered from years of delays and problems.

Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, described the collaboration as a "return to grace" for Silicon Valley's ties with the military.

US allies have said the West needs to take a startup mindset to weapons development and testing.

While not rejecting the primes, many European defense leaders have said they want a shakeup. Militaries across the continent are buying from smaller, newer companies as well as the big players.

The UK's armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, in May said that "Ukraine's battlefield successes stems not just from great technology but also from their extraordinary ability to fail, learn, and iterate rapidly."

Startups building technology like drones have been key for Ukraine against Russia, and allies are watching Pierre Crom/Getty Images

Pål Jonson, the defense minister of Sweden, a NATO member and Ukraine ally, told Business Insider in February he was inspired by the Defense Innovation Unit in Silicon Valley, which helps companies and the US Department of Defense work together to field new technology at scale.

He said that using Silicon Valley as inspiration helped Sweden develop swarm drone technology in less than a year — a project that, he said, traditionally could have taken five years.

CSIS's McGinn said defense officials should not see startups as a silver bullet to their procurement issues. Relying on a mix of both startups and traditional defense firms will better "contribute to the Army's success," he added.

"This is not about choosing only Silicon Valley companies. We need all kinds of companies to help support the Army and other parts of the Department of War," McGinn said.

[TITLE]China-made motor sales surge in South Africa, cutting into rival brands' market dominance:
[TEXT]
Just a few years ago, Chinese-made cars were rare on South African roads, with manufacturers seen only as fringe players. However, this is quickly changing as Chinese carmakers now outsell some established Western, American and Japanese brands.

In recent years, South Africans have increasingly been buying Chinese brands like Chery and Haval, a subsidiary of Great Wall Motor (GWM), driven by affordability and feature-rich vehicles. Banking on growing demand, several Chinese car brands are now eyeing manufacturing and assembly plants in South Africa.

The cars are largely internal combustion engine vehicles, but there is no reason to doubt that electric vehicles will follow suit.

[TITLE]Gulf Inland Logistics Park Officially Opens Phase One With 7 Tenants, 400+ New Jobs, $250 Million in Capital Investment:
[TEXT]
DAYTON, Texas, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gulf Inland Logistics Park , managed and developed by Liberty Development Partners, officially celebrated the grand opening of Phase One of development at the CMC Railyard on Friday, October 10, marking a major milestone in regional economic development. The event highlighted the completion of Phase One infrastructure and the arrival of seven anchor tenants, representing more than 400 new jobs and approximately $250 million in capital investment to the Dayton area.

“This day represents nearly two decades of vision and determination,” said Marcus Goering, Principal at Liberty Development Partners. “Since we first identified this property in 2007, we've invested in the infrastructure and partnerships needed to create the premier rail-served industrial facility on the Gulf Coast. Today, we celebrate not just what we've accomplished, but what is yet to come.”

Community Partnership and Local Support

The recent grand opening celebration featured remarks from elected officials, including U.S. Rep. Brian Babin (36th District of Texas), Texas House of Representatives member Janis Holt (District 18), Liberty County Judge Jay Knight, and City of Dayton Mayor Martin Mudd. Congressman Babin was instrumental in securing a U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) grant that helped fund the construction of the first road into Gulf Inland Logistics Park.

“(Gulf Inland Logistics Park’s) impact on the economy of this region will be felt for generations to come,” Congressman Babin said. “Gulf Inland Logistics park is a prime example of private, local, state, and federal partners all working and coming together to create opportunities for the infrastructure needed to support job growth and capital investment, which will keep America and Texas great.”

The event also highlighted community engagement, with students from the Dayton High School hospitality program assisting with the celebration. Local businesses contributed to the festivities, including Weaver's BBQ (recognized as a 2025 Texas Monthly BBQ Top 50 honorable mention), Sweet Scoops ice cream, and Liberty Sweet Treats.

“What we're building here is critical for our young people and the future of Liberty County,” Goering said. “Liberty County is experiencing over 30% population growth and is poised for continued expansion. Gulf Inland Logistics Park is the engine driving job opportunities and economic development that benefit our entire community.”

Phase One Success and Strategic Location

The park's strategic positioning at the intersection of major transportation corridors makes it uniquely attractive to industrial operators. Gulf Inland Logistics Park offers immediate access to Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railways' major processing yards, combined with proximity to U.S. Highway 90, the Grand Parkway, State Highway 146, Interstate 10, and Interstate 59. The facility is located just 30 minutes northeast of Houston, 30 minutes from the Port of Houston (the largest U.S. port by tonnage), and within 100 miles of four additional Texas ports.

“Gulf Inland Logistics Park represents the intersection of rail and road – the most efficient location on the Gulf Coast for rail-served industrial, manufacturing, distribution, and operations,” Goering said. “Our tenants enjoy days faster transit times compared to other satellite rail developments, providing significant competitive advantages.”

Since June 2022, Liberty Development Partners has successfully located seven companies at Gulf Inland Logistics Park:

Phoenix Oil Inc.

Omnisource LLC

EGF Energy Partners

GPL Development

United States Lime & Minerals Inc.

Chemvest Holdings US Inc.

Midcontinent Steel and Wire (Deacero Division)

Infrastructure and Job Creation

The development has already delivered substantial infrastructure improvements, including three new roads, over 20 miles of new railroad track, and nearly 1 million square feet of completed vertical construction. Phase One tenants are already creating hundreds of jobs, with additional operations launching this fall.

Projections indicate that Gulf Inland Logistics Park will create over 10,000 jobs and bring more than $2 billion in capital investment to the region over the coming years, positioning Liberty County as a key hub for industrial growth.

Looking Forward

With Phase Two now in motion, Liberty Development Partners is pursuing new tenant opportunities and preparing to announce the eighth and final tenant from Phase One. The company also anticipates expansion into additional phases as demand continues to grow.

“This is just the beginning,” Goering said. “We've built the foundation. Now we're ready to scale.”

[TITLE]Winning! Global Shipping Carbon Tax Vote Deferred Until Next Year:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

Ahead of the meeting, the US government had threatened … targeting government officials who supported the NZF.

Oct 17, 2025 News, Politics US-led alliance wins a year’s delay in adoption of green shipping deal The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework will be up for approval again in October 2026, after the US and Saudi Arabia persuaded countries not to vote on it as planned Joe Lo

News editor …

In April 2025, governments provisionally agreed the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF), which would penalise high-emitting ships around the world and use the money to fund the transition to cleaner vessels and fuels. … The NZF was scheduled to set emissions reduction targets for ships starting in 2028. But this – and the rest of the framework’s timeline – have now been plunged into doubt. Although some technical work can continue, political progress will have to wait until October 2026 when delegates will next take up the issue of whether to adopt the NZF. … Trump’s threats Ahead of the meeting, the US government had threatened a series of measures targeting government officials who supported the NZF and threatening to make it difficult and expensive for those countries’ ships to call at US ports. A joint statement by the US transport and foreign ministers said: “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.” And on Thursday, President Donald Trump tried to intervene directly in the IMO process, urging countries to vote against what he called “this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping” and “a Green New Scam Bureaucracy”. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he suggested that the NZF would lead to higher prices for American consumers, adding that the US “will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form”. … Read more: https://www.climatechangenews.com/2025/10/17/us-led-alliance-delay-year-adoption-green-shipping-deal-nzf-imo-un/

The Trump administration released a statement ahead of the deferral vote;

Taking Action to Defend America from the UN’s First Global Carbon Tax – the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) “Net-Zero Framework” (NZF) MEDIA NOTE OFFICE OF THE SPOKESPERSON OCTOBER 10, 2025 Joint Statement by Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Energy Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Duffy President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world. The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security. The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers: Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration. The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.

The tax on global shipping would have been pumped into a net zero fund administered by the United Nations.

Why a deferral rather than a cancellation?

Green obsessed member states and UN officials are likely still clinging to the hope they can shift the political landscape in favour of supporting this new tax on prosperity.

Have no doubt that interference will include covert foreign interference in US domestic politics.

But the coming year will likely see political shifts which will not favour expensive luxuries like carbon taxes.

With safe haven investments like gold spiking to an all time high, an Indian property and stock market bubble which is threatening to precipitate a Chinese style crisis, an economic crisis in France threatening to fracture the Euro zone, and China sitting on the mother of all banking crisis, and making all the wrong moves trying to fix the crisis, lets just say by this time next year I doubt a tax which would further damage the global economy will win widespread support.

[TITLE]Union Pacific (UNP): Assessing Valuation After Recent 4% Share Price Rebound:
[TEXT]
Union Pacific (UNP) shares have drawn renewed interest after the company’s recent price movements in the market. Investors are keeping an eye on how the stock is responding over the past month, where it saw a gain of 4%.

See our latest analysis for Union Pacific.

Union Pacific’s recent 4% jump in share price over the past month has put the stock back on investors’ radar, hinting at renewed optimism after a stretch of muted momentum. While the current share price sits at $226.04, the big picture tells a more nuanced story. The company has weathered ups and downs, with a modest near-term move and a one-year total shareholder return of -5.2%, which contrasts with longer-term gains such as a 34.2% total return over the past five years. Momentum appears to be rebuilding, suggesting the market may be reconsidering the company’s growth prospects or risk profile.

If you’re scanning the horizon for what’s next in the market, now is a perfect moment to broaden your perspective and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership

With shares rebounding and a new surge of interest, the key question remains: is Union Pacific trading below its true value, or are markets already accounting for all its future growth, leaving little room for upside?

Most Popular Narrative: 13.6% Undervalued

Union Pacific's most widely followed narrative sets its fair value at $261.56, implying a notable discount to the recent closing price of $226.04. This perspective is informed by updated profit margin expectations and a resilient forward-looking industry outlook.

Union Pacific is implementing multiple efficiency enhancements, such as energy management systems for locomotives and optimization tools. These initiatives are expected to improve operational efficiency and net margins. The company is expanding capacity with new infrastructure, including facilities in Houston and Phoenix, which could support future growth and positively impact revenue.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious why analysts now see higher profit margins on the horizon? There is a pivotal shift happening within Union Pacific’s operations. Consider new cost controls, significant infrastructure investments, and major efficiency upgrades. Discover which key assumption the narrative highlights as a potential driver of the stock's next move.

Result: Fair Value of $261.56 (UNDERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, uncertainty around global trade policies and potential industry slowdowns could still present material headwinds and challenge Union Pacific’s positive outlook.

[TITLE]Clean energy jobs boom to bring thousands of new jobs:
[TEXT]
Government publishes first ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy mission, with over 400,000 extra jobs by 2030

31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and welders are particularly in demand

5 new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges to train next generation of workers, as part of government’s drive for two-thirds of young people to be in higher-level learning

Energy Secretary to set out measures ensuring companies receiving public grants and contracts need to deliver good jobs across the clean energy sector

A generation of young people across Britain will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, under new plans announced by the government today as part of the clean energy superpower mission

Backed by record government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK – with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, government will today (Sunday 19 October) publish a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90’s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen. Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders. This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said:

We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation. Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change.

The government’s clean energy mission is already delivering for the UK, with the certainty and stability of the government’s mission having galvanised over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

The government has also given Sizewell C the green light, which will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, announced Rolls Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs, and kickstarted the Acorn and the Viking projects in Scotland and the North East that is estimated to support a combined 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships. This builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers - 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans - Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

Upskill existing workers - Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50% today.

With at least 1 in 6 ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 60,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future. Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC , said:

After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy - as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

Crucially, it puts decent work at the heart of our energy system. And it shows that when government makes a plan with unions and workers, the whole country can benefit. Whether it’s welders in Wrexham or pipefitters on Teesside, the firm commitment to clean energy jobs being good union jobs is one which will improve working lives the country over. We now look forward to government delivering a similarly robust and funded plan for the North Sea transition, which safeguards jobs and livelihoods.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at the GMB, said:

GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs. GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions and their members will be at the heart of this. We need fair work agreements and taxpayers’ cash has to be spend where good jobs are going to be created. Today’s plan not only sets out that expectation but crucially, how good jobs can be measured.

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary of the RMT , said:

RMT welcomes the government’s commitment to closing loopholes in maritime and offshore employment law, which should in turn create domestic opportunities in coastal communities that support the entirety of the offshore wind supply chain. This plan has the potential to create hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the UK, offering real opportunities for those wishing to transition from oil and gas and for a new generation of workers in their own communities.

Christina McAnea, General Secretary of UNISON said:

Clean, homegrown energy is essential in tackling climate change and delivering economic growth. This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs. Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles. Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.

Alasdair McDiarmid, Assistant General Secretary of Community, said

After long years of managed decline and neglect under previous governments, we now have an ambitious government which is serious

[TITLE]The defense prime contractors have a new problem on their hands:
[TEXT]
"We will set the pace with innovation, and we will win with silicon and software, and not with our soldiers' blood and bodies," US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said on Monday.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The defense primes have a fresh challenge on their hands: A US Army that's tilting ever more toward a start-up-friendly, fast-moving procurement system.

US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said on Monday that the military needs to rapidly overhaul its procurement processes and reduce its dependence on the largest defense contractors.

"We cannot f---ing wait to innovate until Americans are dying on the battlefield," Driscoll said in his remarks at the annual meeting of the Association of the United States Army in Washington.

"We must act now to enable our soldiers. Our window to change is right now, and we have a plan to do it. We will set the pace with innovation, and we will win with silicon and software, and not with our soldiers' blood and bodies," he added.

Driscoll told meeting attendees that the military will be announcing changes to the way equipment is purchased "in just a matter of weeks." He added that a Silicon Valley approach, which combines "venture capital money and mentorship with startup culture," would be "absolutely ideal for the Army."

"We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long," Driscoll said.

"We will break down barriers until we measure acquisitions, not in years and billions, but in months and thousands," he added.

Representatives for the US Army did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Primes under fire

Prime defense contractors are companies that have direct contracts with the government. They include major aerospace players such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as well as arms makers like General Dynamics.

Since taking office in February, Driscoll has called for a revamp of the military's procurement processes. Driscoll served in the Army from 2007 to 2011 and was an officer with the Army's 10th Mountain Division in Iraq.

In an interview with Business Insider in April, Driscoll said Washington has "optimized for nearly everything other than the soldier in their decision-making."

"What has occurred is a hollowing out of a lot of the tools that we have given our soldiers," Driscoll said.

During an appearance on the "TBPN" podcast in May, Driscoll said he would consider it a "success if in the next two years, one of the primes is no longer in business, and the rest of them have all gotten stronger."

The largest arms makers have the expertise to design classified systems to the military's needs and the advanced manufacturing to build them at scale in the US. They often rely on subcontractors to integrate the sophisticated systems and their computerized displays and controls.

These projects face an inherent strain: They must be built rapidly enough for current missions but with sufficient capability to remain effective in a war that could be decades into the future.

It's a lengthy process that has been consolidated to a smaller number of major companies since the end of the Cold War. And it is this system that the Defense Department wants to widen to new players and speed up.

Silicon Valley titans, who specialize in rushing new digital services to the market, have also criticized the defense establishment.

"The Pentagon recently failed its seventh consecutive audit, suggesting that the agency's leadership has little idea how its annual budget of more than $800 billion is spent," Elon Musk said in an op-ed he cowrote with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for The Wall Street Journal in November.

Musk and Ramaswamy wrote the op-ed as co-leaders of the White House DOGE office. Ramaswamy left DOGE in January, and Musk left in May.

Primes can move slowly

In the US, some major weapons developments by primes have been marked by severe delays. This includes Lockheed Martin's F-35 program, which was mired in controversy, delays, and rising costs. The United States Government Accountability Office in 2023 said the program that builds three versions of an advanced stealth fighter was "more than a decade delayed and $165 billion over its original plans."

Lockheed Martin's advanced F-35s have faced delays and rising costs. Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu via Getty Images

Jets still arrive late. In 2024, all of the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters delivered came late, with an average delay of 238 days.

Other big projects involving primes that are facing delays include Boeing's KC-46 Pegasus aerial-refueling tanker and the US Navy's Virginia-class submarine program with General Dynamics Corp. and Huntington Ingalls Industries.

Driscoll did not elaborate on what a new procurement system looks like, and the Pentagon has gutted its weapons testing office that independently assesses programs. The US military would likely still need many of the products made by primes. They are often the most advanced items a military buys, which is why they can be more vulnerable to issues than when companies work on smaller systems or single components.

Many US defense contractors lack commercial sales, making them wholly dependent on government spending. Huntington Ingalls Industries, for example, is the only American shipbuilder with the facilities and expertise to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

An F-35, for example, has thousands of parts, and is a multinational project, with parts coming from allies like the UK and the Netherlands.

The defense market may be most open to new players in software and expendable drones, where barriers to entry are much lower.

Ukraine, hailed by allies as successful at manufacturing small drones to defend itself against Russia, still wants the big-ticket items like armored vehicles and missiles from allies, with its less-powerful assets alone unable to do much more than keep Ukraine on the defensive.

But its fight has still inspired Western industry. A host of new defense companies have emerged in response, and many major Western defense contractors have initiated new partnerships to acquire cutting-edge technology, work more efficiently, and address capacity gaps.

Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider that while startups could make inroads into arms manufacturing, it will be difficult for them to beat the incumbents.

McGinn was the principal deputy director in the Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy at the Department of Defense from 2015 to 2018, where he oversaw acquisition policy.

"You've got to have a strong technical workforce, so there are significant barriers to entry there, but you have seen companies get involved," McGinn said.

"The big example, of course, is SpaceX and Blue Origin. They disrupted the space launch business by coming in with their model, but it is hard to do," he added.

A startup-friendly US military

Driscoll's calls for quicker industry processes are in line with those of Silicon Valley and the views of US allies abroad.

And Driscoll's push for cost-cutting means the market will adjust accordingly, says McGinn.

"If the government says, 'We want more commercially oriented drones that they're simple to make, that cost a hundred thousand dollars or less,' companies are going to do that, and some companies that may not be competitive for them, they won't bid," he said.

"This is very much a monopsony, where the government sets the market. The companies are going to be competitive, and they are going to try to respond. They will partner with other companies to make themselves more competitive," he added.

In May, Meta announced it is partnering with the defense technology startup Anduril to build next-gen extended reality gear for the US military. Anduril said the project was "funded through private capital, without taxpayer support," and would "save the US military billions of dollars." This program has suffered from years of delays and problems.

Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, described the collaboration as a "return to grace" for Silicon Valley's ties with the military.

US allies have said the West needs to take a startup mindset to weapons development and testing.

While not rejecting the primes, many European defense leaders have said they want a shakeup. Militaries across the continent are buying from smaller, newer companies as well as the big players.

The UK's armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, in May said that "Ukraine's battlefield successes stems not just from great technology but also from their extraordinary ability to fail, learn, and iterate rapidly."

Startups building technology like drones have been key for Ukraine against Russia, and allies are watching Pierre Crom/Getty Images

Pål Jonson, the defense minister of Sweden, a NATO member and Ukraine ally, told Business Insider in February he was inspired by the Defense Innovation Unit in Silicon Valley, which helps companies and the US Department of Defense work together to field new technology at scale.

He said that using Silicon Valley as inspiration helped Sweden develop swarm drone technology in less than a year — a project that, he said, traditionally could have taken five years.

CSIS's McGinn said defense officials should not see startups as a silver bullet to their procurement issues. Relying on a mix of both startups and traditional defense firms will better "contribute to the Army's success," he added.

"This is not about choosing only Silicon Valley companies. We need all kinds of companies to help support the Army and other parts of the Department of War," McGinn said.
