[TITLE]EU Lawmakers to Weigh Easing Capital Rules on Safest Bank Bonds:

[TITLE]ECB to simplify bank capital rules but stick to buffer requirements:

The European Central Bank (ECB) outlined plans to simplify bank regulation and capital rules on Thursday, but is sticking to its pledge not to ease overall capital reserve requirements.

The authority said the capital proposals are focused on having fewer – rather than lower – types of capital buffers lenders must hold to protect their balance sheets against shock losses.

Irish woman Sharon Donnery, a member of the ECB banking supervisory board, was a key member of the taskforce set up earlier this year to ease the burden of banking supervision following more than a decade of tighter rules in the wake of the global financial crisis, which resulted in taxpayer-funded bailouts of European banks.

In a statement, the ECB said its aim was to “simplify the framework” without endangering the “resilience of the European banking system”.

The ECB’s top decision-making body, its governing council, backed the recommendations. They will now be sent to the European Commission for consideration as part of a wider push by Brussels to streamline policies and laws to make the European Union more competitive.*

The taskforce concluded that the bloc’s current capital rules are overly complex and risk backfiring as investors may not understand them. European banks are at present subject to a number of individual capital buffers, four of which the ECB wants to merge into two.

“The variety of capital elements in place in the EU may decrease transparency and increase uncertainty as market participants face more challenges in assessing the capital framework,” the report said.

It suggested combining several individual capital surcharges that the ECB at present applies to banks based on their individual risk profile.

The report did not explicitly state whether the combined amount of capital that banks would be required to hold would stay the same, but it said lenders should “sustain current levels of resilience” to absorb losses in a crisis.

The ECB also proposed exempting more small lenders from the international Basel standards, which are designed for large, risky lenders with cross-border business.

At present, all banks with more than €5 billion in assets need to meet those rules, which the taskforce said created “undue complexity” and costs for lenders that were too small to have repercussions on financial stability.

The ECB suggested raising the threshold and adding more exemptions for smaller banks.

Still, the three domestic Irish lenders, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB will remain subject to standards set for larger banks.

The European Banking Federation welcomed the ECB’s report but said “concrete ‌and determined steps must now follow to enhance the global competitiveness of the EU’s financial sector”. – Additional reporting: Reuters, Financial Times

*Sentence corrected to read that the recommendations will now - rather than not - be sent to Brussels

[TITLE]500 jobs protected at Grangemouth as UK Government partners with INEOS to save vital plant’s future:
[TEXT]
UK Government provides over £120m support package as part of £150m joint investment with INEOS to protect vital chemical production and 500 jobs at Grangemouth, plus hundreds more in the supply chain.

Unique plant strategically important for UK’s critical national infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, North Sea operations and modern Industrial Strategy.

Deal secures operational commitment from INEOS for the plant and multimillion-pound investment from the company.

Britain’s last ethylene plant at Grangemouth has been saved by the UK Government - securing 500 good jobs and hundreds more across the region in the supply chain.

Thanks to a landmark partnership between the UK Government and INEOS, the future of this vital site is now protected, sending a clear signal: this Government is backing workers and their communities across the whole of the UK.

With over £120 million in UK Government support and major investment from INEOS, the Grangemouth plant will stay open with jobs secured.

This huge win keeps the heart of Scotland’s industry beating strong, supports local families, and keeps critical supply chains running nationwide.

This package will help secure the site’s operations and contribute toward improving energy efficiencies, reducing carbon emissions and increasing productivity, helping to secure the site’s long-term competitiveness and sustainability. INEOS has spent over £100 million over the last year maintaining operations at the site.

The Grangemouth plant is vital for the whole UK economy. It produces ethylene which is essential for medical-grade plastics and use in the chemical supply chain. These plastics are also vital to key industries, including advanced manufacturing, automotive, and aerospace, where they are used in nearly every product.

The decisive action from the UK Government is part of its modern Industrial Strategy, which identifies chemicals as a vital foundational sector that underpins the UK’s high-growth industries like defence and advanced manufacturing by producing the materials they all depend on, while also being essential to many supply chains.

The UK Government is backing the chemicals sector through the Industrial Strategy with targeted support to bring down energy costs, including through the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme – which will slash costs for businesses in sectors including chemicals by up to 25% - and the British Industrial Supercharger, which will save Britain’s most energy-intensive firms money on their electricity costs.

The plant also links to the Forties Pipeline System, which is key for transporting North Sea oil and gas to onshore facilities. Without government intervention, the plant’s closure would have seriously affected hundreds of onsite workers, impacted thousands of jobs regionally, and devastated supply chains.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle will formally announce the support today (17 December) during a visit to the INEOS site in Grangemouth with the Chancellor and Scotland Secretary.

Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, said:

When we said we’d protect jobs and invest in Britain’s future, we meant it - and this is proof. Through partnership, determination, and our Modern Industrial Strategy, we’re delivering new opportunities, fresh investment, and security for the next generation of workers in Scotland. This is

[TITLE]Illinois law generates $1.5B to save public transit from fiscal calamity:
[TEXT]
Public transit in the Chicago metropolitan area will get a $1.5 billion infusion to save it from financial disaster under a law that will take effect next summer

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Illinois' public transit systems got a $1.5 billion annual infusion on Friday as Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law overhauling Chicago's web of buses and trains, sparing it from devastating service cuts and pledging upgraded performance and accountability.

Dozens of government, labor and transit leaders congregated for the ceremony at Chicago's century-old Union Station, legendary architect Daniel Burnham's vision for a centralized transportation hub through which 35 million commuters still move annually.

The law, which takes effect in June 2026, raises sales taxes in northeastern Illinois, slides into transit coffers a portion of the sales tax on gasoline and interest earnings on the state's road construction fund. The revenue infusion promises to claw the program back from a so-called fiscal cliff caused largely by a drop off in funding from federal pandemic relief programs that has threatened metropolitan commuter lines outside of Chicago as well.

“Our state is tough and resilient and forward-looking. Far from heading toward the abyss, as some predicted, we are on the verge of delivering a world class transportation network,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said. “This new law not only averts the ‘cliff,’ but preserves affordability and makes transit safer and more reliable."

The law, which was known as SB2111, creates the Northern Illinois Transit Authority as administrator of the region's transit programs with responsibility for ensuring funding and comprehensive planning while the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail and Pace suburban bus system focus on performance and reliability.

It promises safety improvements for a system often marred by crime and which received a particular black mark — not to mention ire from President Donald Trump — after a man on a downtown L train allegedly doused a 26-year-old woman with gasoline and set her afire in November.

Illinois, one of eight states that charge sales tax on gasoline, will generate $860 million in new transit funding by diverting gas sales tax from the road-construction fund; and $200 million from interest generated by the road fund, but that amount is expected to fall as principal is rolled out for road building. Nearly $150 million of that revenue is targeted for parts of the state outside Cook County, home to Chicago, and the five counties surrounding it.

Another $478 million is expected from a one-quarter percent increase in the sales tax in Cook and suburban counties.

That part particularly riled Republicans who claim that suburban residents are paying to fix Chicago's problems. State Senate Minority Leader John Curran, a Republican from suburban Downers Grove, said it also freezes out "suburban representation on transit decisions.”

"Taxpayers deserve a long-term, fiscally-conservative plan that includes the reforms needed to ensure a world-class, safe and reliable system — not a Chicago takeover of suburban public transit,” Curran said.

But advocates contended that the Northern Illinois Transit Authority will have wide representation.

The authority will also govern funding allocation based on performance; oversee capital and long-term planning to allow CTA, Metra and Pace to concentrate on operation; provide for a powerful executive director to hold employees accountable; and require regular internal as well as periodic external audits.

Initiatives to improve safety will include cross-jurisdictional law enforcement cooperation led by the Cook County sheriff; in 2027, a “transit ambassador" plan will put unarmed staff on trains to assist riders with safety issues while law enforcement and social services will develop a long-term strategy for assistance; and there will be a mobile application allowing riders to report problems.

By 2030, a single, integrated system will collect and process all fares systemwide.

[TITLE]Ojo hails Ekiti airport, urges collective ownership:
[TEXT]
Gubernatorial aspirant in the 2026 Ekiti State governorship election, Kayode Olubunmi Ojo, has lauded the commencement of commercial flight operations at the Ekiti State Agro-Allied and Cargo Airport, describing it as a landmark achievement with far-reaching economic benefits for the state.

Speaking through a statement signed by his media aide, Oyinloye Adeola, Ojo said the launch of commercial services marked a major milestone in Ekiti’s development trajectory, noting that the airport would significantly boost connectivity, stimulate agro-allied industries, promote tourism, and attract both local and foreign investment.

He said, “The realisation of the Agro-Allied and Cargo Airport project, and the sight of commercial planes touching down and taking off, is a moment of pride for every Ekiti son and daughter. It represents a critical piece of infrastructure that will serve as a catalyst for economic growth, especially in agro-allied industries and tourism.”

However, the APC governorship aspirant, who is a former Chairman of the Governing Council of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, and until September 26, 2025, served as Pro-Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, expressed strong displeasure over what he described as the Ekiti State Government’s reported denial of his involvement in aspects of the airport’s development.

He questioned the state government’s alleged refusal to acknowledge his contributions, particularly toward the construction of a multi-million-naira fire station at the airport, and his stated intention to support other critical infrastructure within the facility and across the state.

According to him, such denials could discourage prospective investors and undermine collective development efforts.

“It is contradictory and frankly confusing for any government to distance itself from contributions of other Ekiti sons and daughters to this monumental project, regardless of who initiated it or the source of the primary funding,” Ojo stated.

He specifically referenced remarks attributed to the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Yinka Oyebode, during the 2025 Press Week and public lecture of the Ekiti State chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists on August 28, 2025, where his claims were reportedly described as “false, misleading, and self-glorification.”

The aspirant advised the CPS to verify the facts from the former Project Manager of the airport, Air Vice Marshal Ojuawo (rtd), now a serving member of the House of Representatives, whom he said also deserved commendation for his role in the project.

He maintained that any genuine contribution, “even if it is only a bag of cement donated out of pocket, was worthy of acknowledgment rather than what he termed as political blasphemy and fabricated falsehood.”

In the same vein, he commended the Founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, Afe Babalola, for donating navigational equipment valued at $1.6m and constructing a 100-car capacity parking lot worth N356.7m at the airport.

He also appreciated the current administration for prioritising expenditure on the airport project while acknowledging previous administrations for their roles. He added that the airport was first conceived during the administration of Segun Oni, advanced under Mr Ayodele Fayose, and driven forward under Dr Kayode Fayemi.

He urged the present administration to rise above political differences and embrace the airport as a collective asset belonging to all Ekiti people, stressing that projects of such magnitude require broad-based collaboration and partnership.

“The Ekiti Airport is an asset of the people, not the property of any political party or individual,” he said, adding that attention should be focused on maximising the airport’s utility and ensuring its long-term sustainability rather than engaging in disputes over individual contributions.

Consolidated Quarterly Results

Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 increased $53.4 million, or 19.5%, over the prior year quarter to $327.5 million, driven by higher volumes within Building Products, including contributions from Elgen Manufacturing (“Elgen”), which was acquired on June 18, 2025.

Operating income increased $8.7 million to $12.3 million, driven by higher volumes within Building Products, compared to $3.5 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding restructuring and other expense, operating income increased $7.8 million in the quarter to $13.9 million.

Miscellaneous (income) expense was unfavorable by $4.2 million, primarily due to the divestment of the company’s 49% interest in the Sustainable Energy Solutions (“SES”) joint venture’s composite business on October 16, 2025, and the related mark-to-market loss on the securities received as consideration.

Equity income decreased $5.4 million over the prior year quarter to $29.1 million, on lower contributions from ClarkDietrich, which were down $5.6 million, partially offset by higher contributions from WAVE, which were up $1.7 million.

Income tax expense was $8.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to $9.1 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by lower pre-tax earnings. Tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 reflects an estimated annual effective rate of 24.1% in both the current and prior year quarter.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

The company ended the quarter with cash of $180.3 million, a decrease of $69.8 million from May 31, 2025, primarily driven by the purchase of Elgen. During the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company generated operating cash flow of $51.5 million, of which $12.4 million was invested in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $39.1 million, up from $33.9 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures in the current year quarter included approximately $5.8 million related to ongoing facility modernization projects.

Total debt at quarter end was $305.3 million, consisting entirely of long-term debt, an increase of $2.4 million from May 31, 2025, primarily due to the remeasurement of the company’s euro denominated notes. The company had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility as of November 30, 2025, leaving $500.0 million available for future use.

Quarterly Segment Results

Consumer Products generated net sales of $119.9 million in the current year quarter, an increase of $3.2 million, or 2.7%, over the prior year quarter, driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat at $15.3 million, as the impact of favorable product mix was offset by higher conversion costs and slightly lower volumes.

Building Products generated net sales of $207.5 million in the current year quarter, an increase of $50.2 million, or 31.9%, over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher overall volume, including contributions from Elgen. Adjusted EBITDA increased $5.8 million to $53.0 million, primarily due to volume growth in the wholly owned businesses, partially offset by lower overall contributions of equity income.

Outlook

“Across the company, we remain focused on delivering for our customers, investing in opportunities that fit our strategy and advancing the long-term value of Worthington Enterprises,” Hayek said. “As we enter the back half of our fiscal year, which is typically a seasonally stronger period, we are excited

New Delhi, The Centre has notified the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) with an outlay of Rs 7,280 crore.The initiative is targeting to reduce dependence on China for critical inputs and secure supply chains for EVs, electronics, aerospace and green energy The scheme, approved earlier by the Union Cabinet, aims to build a complete domestic value chain of converting rare earth oxide into sintered NdFeB , essential for India's strategic and industrial advancement.Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) is the alloy used to create the strongest type of permanent magnets "Through this scheme, the Government of India intends to incentivise setting up of 6,000 MTPA (Million Tonnes Per Annum) of integrated REO (rare earth oxides) to sintered NdFeB REPM's manufacturing facilities in the country," the Heavy Industries Ministry said in the notification.Indigenously produced sintered NdFeB REPMs from NdPr oxide will be eligible for sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy under the scheme.It will allocate up to 6,000 MTPA of integrated sintered NdFeB magnet manufacturing capacity to five applicants through a transparent bidding process -- Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) by issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP).The minimum allocation to a beneficiary will be 600 MTPA, going up to a maximum allocation of 1,200 MTPA, in multiples of 100 MTPA, as per the notification.The beneficiaries will receive sales-linked incentives on the sale of sintered NdFeB REPM and a capital subsidy for setting up the allocated manufacturing capacity.Further, three selected beneficiaries with the lowest bids would receive an assured limited supply of NdPr oxide from IREL (India) Ltd, a CPSE under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).The total duration of the scheme will be 7 years, which includes 2 years of gestation period for setting up the manufacturing facilities and 5 years for incentive disbursement on the sale of sintered NdFeB REPM.Further, in case the first sale of sintered NdFeB REPM commences prior to the completion of the gestation period, then this additional period will also be eligible for sales-linked incentive over and above the 5-year duration.India has one of the world's largest rare earth reserves, mostly located in coastal regions.IREL (India), a CPSE under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), is the only company in India that is engaged in the mining of rare earth ores and refining these into REOs.While India possesses upstream capabilities in mining, separation and oxide refining, there is a notable gap in the industrial-scale midstream capabilities needed for oxide-to-metal, metal-to-alloy and alloy-to-magnet conversion.Due to this, India currently imports all its sintered NdFeB REPM demand for downstream applications.
