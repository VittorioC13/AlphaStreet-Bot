Oil edged up after a fresh round of US-Russia talks failed to reach a deal to end Moscow's war in Ukraine, boosting fears that restrictions on Russian oil supply could remain in place for longer.

West Texas Intermediate rose 0.5% to settle near $59, remaining within the tight range prices have been stuck in this week. The Kremlin says talks with a US delegation led by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were "constructive," but no deal was made to end the Ukraine war.

The talks took place against a backdrop of recent attacks on Russia-linked tankers, with at least one ship manager saying it would stop sending vessels to the country. A deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine could mean the end of sanctions on Russian oil in a market already staring down concerns

[TITLE]Europe strikes a deal to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027:
[TEXT]
Brussels Reuters —

The European Union agreed Wednesday to phase out Russian natural gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decade-long dependency on Russian energy.

Representatives for EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement in the early hours of Wednesday on proposals set out by the European Commission in June to end shipments from the EU’s former top gas supplier following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move toward a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.

“Today, we are stopping these imports permanently,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement. “By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector.”

For short-term contracts concluded before June 17 this year, the prohibition will apply from April 25, 2026, for LNG and from June 17, 2026, for pipeline gas.

For long-term contracts concluded before June 17, the cut-off dates will be the start of 2027 and the start of October 2026, with a possible one-month extension for EU members facing difficulties reaching required storage levels.

As of October, Russia accounted for 12% of EU gas imports, down from 45% before its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Hungary, France and Belgium among the countries still receiving supplies.

The European Commission is also committed to phasing out remaining oil imports from Russia by the end of 2027, with a legislative proposal to be presented early next year.

Under Wednesday’s agreement, EU members will submit “national diversification plans” regarding oil and gas supplies to the commission by March 1, and will be required to notify the EU executive whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national bans in place.

The commission will issue recommendations based on this feedback.

[TITLE]ZenaTech Expands Drone as a Service to Australia with Offer to Acquire a Survey Firm Serving Government and Natural Resources and Commercial Sectors:
[TEXT]
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZenaTech, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology business solution provider specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone as a Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS, and Quantum Computing solutions, today announces it has signed an offer to acquire a long-established, multi-office Queensland, Australia-based surveying and spatial services firm, marking a significant step in the company’s global expansion strategy. This targeted acquisition represents ZenaTech’s first entry into Australia and provides a strategic gateway for expanding the Drone as a Service platform throughout the broader Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, strengthening the company’s position in one of the world’s most active mining and industrial ecosystems.

“Australia is a globally significant market for mining, infrastructure, and high-precision spatial data, and this opportunity aligns directly with ZenaTech’s long-term vision for international DaaS expansion,” said Shaun Passley, Ph.D., ZenaTech CEO. “This acquisition provides a strategic entry point into the APAC region and positions ZenaTech to deliver advanced drone-enabled solutions to government and commercial clients across key sectors.”

The target firm is a long-established, multi-office Australian surveying and spatial services firm with a proven history of delivering high-quality outcomes across a range of public and private sector projects. It is an early adopter of leading survey technologies with advanced reality-capture and geospatial capabilities, including drone-enabled survey workflows, LiDAR, and mobile mapping, applied consistently across its service offerings.

This acquisition would extend Drone as a Service into a new vertical within the natural resources sector. By integrating the target company’s advanced spatial capabilities with ZenaTech’s drone solutions, the company anticipates a more comprehensive and sector-diverse offering to one of Australia’s most data-intensive and resource-driven markets.

ZenaTech’s Drone as a Service (DaaS) offering is designed to provide business and government clients with flexible and on-demand or subscription-based access to drone services for surveying, inspection, maintenance, power washing, inventory management, precision agriculture, and other services, without the capital costs or operational burdens of ownership. By acquiring established, profitable service companies ready for drone innovation, ZenaTech is building a global, multi-service DaaS network anchored by existing customers and recurring revenue.

[TITLE]Claim: “lack of long-term revenue certainty” is Crashing Aussie Renewable Investment.:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

Are renewables investors worried the subsidies could cease?

Australia could miss clean energy target as solar and wind investment slumps, investors warn Expert cautions large pipeline of potential projects will not deliver required energy capacity unless companies make final investments Graham Readfearn and Adam Morton

Mon 1 Dec 2025 19.22 AEDT … Clean Energy Regulator data shows the government agency expects 2.5GW of industry-scale renewable energy capacity to reach a final investment decision this year, down from 4GW last year. The 12-month average for investment commitments on new developments is at its lowest since early 2017.

… … chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, Richie Merzian, said the lower financial investment decisions were a “symptom of deep structural issues, not just a blip”. “The structural issues include state planning delays, grid connection uncertainty, transmission constraints, rising project costs and lack of long-term revenue certainty,” he said. Merzian said the underwriting program had helped to develop a large pipeline of potential projects, but that they would not deliver the new energy capacity needed unless companies made final investments. “The contrast between the large pipeline and the limited number reaching [financial investment decision] indicates a system that is not functioning as intended,” he said. … Read more: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/01/australia-could-miss-clean-energy-target-as-solar-and-wind-investment-slumps-investors-warn

Data centers for AI could nearly triple San Jose’s energy use. Who foots the bill?

CalMatters ^ | December 8, 2025 | Alejandro Lazo

Posted on by artichokegrower

Artificial intelligence and its growing demand for data centers are putting new pressure on California’s electric grid. In San Jose, supporters see jobs and investment, while a key ratepayer advocate worries customers could end up paying for upgrades.

According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes

But they said I couldn’t have incandescent light bulbs in my home because they use to much electricity

“...data centers should have their own power...” A MD legislator wanted to do this, but one of the data center guys pointed out that MD is against fossil fuels and nuclear and the combined cost of setting up their own solar/wind generators and battery banks would be prohibitive. Which is what the Dims intended, I suppose, but they wanted to sound like they were protecting ratepayers.

To: ridesthemiles

to ridethemiles. I’m hearing you. You’ve had bad experiences. LEDs are getting better. They use so much less electricity. Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater, that’s my advice. Thanks for explaining your problems. Also, I’m impressed that an incandescent for 20 years, lasted that long. That said, I have a lot of LEDs for years now, and they’re still going, and they use a small percentage of electricity compared to an incandescent.

To: VanShuyten

I’m not an expert in this in any way, but if I owned or built a data center, I’d want a couple of natural gas powered turbines providing base power for the data center. Co-gen. Any engineers out there who can talk to this? (You’d have to have back up power in any case—enormous back up generators, always kept warm, to create power in a quarter of a second if power goes down.) They are every where in big installations, hospitals, etc. Input from SMEs please, is needed.

[TITLE]Working towards energy affordability in rural America:
[TEXT]
If you live in the United States, there is a one-in-eight chance that you own your electric utility. That is to say that there’s a one-in-eight chance that your electric utility has a similar structure to a credit union or food cooperative. And if you are one of the many millions of residents who pay a gas and electric bill to a co-op utility, then you have a lot of potential power that can be leveraged to save yourself—and others in your community—money through proven affordability programs that shift local infrastructure toward efficient, modernized, renewable energy.

But it’s not just a random roll of an eight-sided die that determines whether or not you belong to a cooperative utility. If you live in a rural area, it’s quite likely you are a member-owner of an electric co-op. If you live in a bigger city, it’s almost guaranteed that you aren’t.

[TITLE]California Regulators Fight To Keep Massive Desert Solar Boondoggle Kicking:
[TEXT]
California regulators rejected a plan to close the controversial Ivanpah solar plant on Thursday, despite federal government and private sector concerns.

The massive $2.2 billion plant features three 459-foot towers and was set to run until 2039 before Ivanpah’s owner, Solar Partners, offered Pacific, Gas and Electric (PG&E) the opportunity to end its power purchase agreement for several units at the plant in January. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) elected Thursday to keep the units at Ivanpah going for the sake of “reliability” and meeting California’s green energy mandates.

“The CPUC must consider other factors related to utilities’ duties to ensure safe, reliable, and affordable utility services that meet the state’s clean energy goals,” the regulators wrote in their Thursday filing. “Uncertainty in renewables project development driven in part by changing federal policy may undermine a core assumption of current reliability assessments.” (RELATED: Over $2 Billion California Solar Plant Built To Last, Now Closing Over Inefficiency)

California has stringent green energy goals, aiming for 100% clean energy by 2045. PG&E argued that ending the project would save customers money and that advanced solar technology is more efficient than the plant, which had been juiced by three $1.6 billion Obama-era loan guarantees.

The Trump Department of Energy (DOE) supported the shutdown plan, as Greg Beard, a senior advisor in the agency’s Office of Energy Dominance Financing, told E&E News that the DOE “will absolutely be appealing this decision.”

Ivanpah made headlines in recent years for reportedly blinding pilots, incinerating birds and energy policy experts dubbing the project “inefficient.”

“Ivanpah stands as a testament to the waste and inefficiency of government subsidized energy schemes,” CEO of the American Energy Institute, Jason Isaac, told Fox News. It “never lived up to its promises, producing less electricity than expected, while relying on natural gas to stay operational.”
