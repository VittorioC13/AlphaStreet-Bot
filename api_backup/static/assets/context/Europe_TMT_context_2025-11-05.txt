[TITLE]Waymo Expands Its Robotaxi Fleet to Las Vegas, San Diego and Detroit. Everything to Know:
[TEXT]
Self-driving cars are slowly becoming less sci-fi and more real-world as companies like Waymo, the autonomous arm of Google's parent, Alphabet, expand into more areas.

On Monday, Waymo said it's bringing its ride-hailing service to three new cities: Las Vegas, San Diego and Detroit. As part of the rollout, Waymo is deploying both its Jaguar I-Pace fleet, which already operates in a handful of other cities, as well as the newer Zeeker RT vehicles that are equipped with Waymo's latest, sixth-generation self-driving technology. The company plans to open up to public riders in the new locations next year.

Waymo currently operates fully autonomous rides for the general public in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Austin, Texas, which use the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace. The vehicles can be summoned either via the Waymo app or Uber, depending on the city.

Waymo's expansions have ramped up in recent months, with Nashville, New York, Denver and Seattle joining the roster of upcoming robotaxi locations. In an Aug. 29 blog post, Waymo said it's "entering a new chapter and accelerating our commercial expansion."

Last month, Waymo shared it's heading to London, making the city its first European location. It'll start driving on the city's roads with humans behind the wheel "while we lay the groundwork for fully autonomous operations," the company said in a statement. "We will scale up based on guidelines established by the UK Department for Transport and Transport for London, and work closely with local and national leaders to secure the necessary permissions to offer fully autonomous rides in 2026." London is Waymo's second international city, after announcing last year that it's expanding to Tokyo, though passengers can't hail a ride there just yet.

You can find a full list of where Waymo is heading below.

Waymo's expansion extends to its manufacturing facilities. In May, the company said it's opening a new, 239,000-square-foot autonomous vehicle factory in the Phoenix area. The plan is to add 2,000 more fully autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to its existing 1,500-vehicle fleet. Notably, Waymo indicated it received its "final delivery from Jaguar" earlier this year, as it plans for future iterations of its driverless rides. Waymo added that the "facility's flexible design" will allow it to integrate its upcoming sixth-generation self-driving technology into new vehicles, starting with the all-electric Zeekr RT.

Last October, Waymo also announced it's partnering with Hyundai to bring the next generation of its technology into Ioniq 5 SUVs. In the years to come, riders will be able to summon those all-electric, autonomous vehicles using the Waymo app. And in April, Waymo said it reached a preliminary agreement with Toyota to "explore a collaboration" geared toward developing autonomous driving tech, which could someday be factored into personally owned vehicles.

The self-driving company says it's driven over 100 million fully autonomous miles on public roads and has provided more than 10 million paid rides. I've hailed several rides myself in San Francisco and, as off-putting as it can seem at first (especially to see a steering wheel turn by itself), I quickly adjusted, and it soon felt like an ordinary ride.

That's not to say there hasn't been pushback as Waymo rolls out to more cities. The company's vehicles have been involved in a handful of high-profile collisions, including one with a bicyclist in San Francisco and another with a towed pickup truck in Phoenix. (Waymo recalled and updated its software to address the issue.)

Waymo's Safety Impact report notes that over the course of 71 million autonomous miles driven through March 2025, its Waymo Driver technology had 88% fewer crashes leading to serious injuries or worse and 78% fewer injury-causing crashes, compared with "an average human driver over the same distance in our operating cities." It also reported significantly fewer crashes with injuries to pedestrians (93%), cyclists (81%) and motorcyclists (86%).

As Waymo continues to expand and develop its self-driving tech, here's how and where to summon the robotaxi if you happen to be in one of the few cities where the company currently operates its fleet.

Hailing a ride in Phoenix

Phoenix was the first city to open up fully autonomous Waymo rides to the public, in 2020. To hail a ride, download the Waymo app on iOS or Android. The service operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

You can also use the Uber app to summon one of Waymo's vehicles in Phoenix. When you request an UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric ride, you'll have the choice to confirm a Waymo ride, if you're matched.

In addition to hailing a ride, you may also have your Uber Eats meal delivered by an autonomous car. When placing an order in the Phoenix area, you might get a note that "autonomous vehicles may deliver your order." When the Waymo car arrives, take your phone with you to pop open the trunk and grab your delivery. You can opt out of this during checkout if you'd rather have a human deliver your food.

Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport became the first major airport to offer fully autonomous Waymo rides to its terminals. Waymo said in September 2025 that it has "served hundreds of thousands of trips to/from Sky Harbor, and it remains the single most popular Waymo destination in Phoenix."

Hailing a ride in the San Francisco Bay Area

San Francisco followed suit after Phoenix, rolling out fully autonomous rides in late 2022. It scrapped the waiting list in June 2024, so now anyone can download the Waymo app to ride anytime. The service also operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There's currently no Uber partnership in San Francisco.

In August 2024, Waymo expanded its ride-hailing service into the San Francisco Peninsula, and expanded again in March so that select Waymo riders who live in Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto and parts of Sunnyvale have the option to hail a robotaxi there, too. In June, it expanded further into the Peninsula, and its service area now includes Brisbane, South San Francisco, San Bruno, Millbrae, Burlingame, Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma. Select riders can now also access Mountain View and more parts of Palo Alto and Menlo Park.

In May, the California Public Utilities Commission approved Waymo's application to operate in South Bay and nearly all of San Jose, opening up the door to future expansions.

In early September, San Jose Mineta International Airport became the first commercial airport in California where Waymo can offer fully autonomous rides to its terminals. Waymo says it'll start testing this fall and plans to make rides available there later this year.

And in mid-September, Waymo received a pilot permit to operate commercially at San Francisco International Airport. The rollout will include three phases, beginning with an onboard safety driver, then moving onto tests without a human driver with Waymo and airport employees, and culminating in commercial operations.

Hailing a ride in Los Angeles County

In November, Waymo scrapped its waitlist for Los Angeles and began welcoming all public riders via the Waymo app. Now any interested passengers can hop in the robotaxis 24/7 and ride across nearly 120 square miles of LA County, including Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Inglewood, Silver Lake, Playa del Rey, Ladera Heights, Echo Park and Downtown LA, and along all of Sunset Boulevard.

There's currently no Uber partnership in Los Angeles.

Hailing a ride in Austin

Riders can hail a Waymo across 90 square miles of Austin, including neighborhoods like Crestview, Windsor Park and Franklin Park and locations like The Domain and McKinney Falls State Park. There are more than 100 Waymo vehicles in the city, with plans for further expansion.

In Austin, the only way to hail a Waymo ride is through Uber -- no Waymo app here. By requesting an UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric, you could be matched with a Waymo vehicle -- and you won't be upcharged. If you'd rather not take a driverless ride, you'll have the option to switch to a standard one. On the other hand, if you want to boost your chances of being matched to a self-driving car, you can go to Account > Settings > Autonomous vehicles, then hit the toggle next to Get more Waymo rides.

Unlock the door, pop open the trunk and start the ride from the Uber app. You'll still be asked to rate your ride at the end, but you won't be asked to tip.

If there are any issues, riders can access human support 24/7 via the Uber app and from inside the Waymo vehicle (there are screens in the front and back that let you quickly summon customer support).

As part of the Uber partnership, Uber will manage tasks like vehicle cleaning and repair, while "Waymo will continue to be responsible for the testing and operation of the Waymo Driver, including roadside assistance and certain rider support functions," the companies said. The collaboration should make autonomous rides accessible to more people, who now won't have to download a separate app to hitch a ride in a robotaxi.

Hailing a ride in Atlanta

Waymo operates across 65 square miles of Atlanta, with plans for future expansions. Like in Austin, you can climb aboard a Waymo robotaxi only via the Uber app. When you book a ride through UberX, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric, you might be paired with a Waymo vehicle at no additional cost. You'll have the option to accept or decline the driverless ride each time.

You can unlock the vehicle, pop the trunk and start the trip all from the Uber app, and you can access human support 24/7 via the Uber app and from touchscreens inside the vehicle.

If you want to boost your chances of being paired with a Waymo vehicle, you can opt in by going to the Uber app, tapping Account > Settings > Autonomous vehicles (under Ride Preferences), and then hitting the toggle next to Get more Waymo rides.

Upcoming expansions

Las Vegas

In January, Waymo said it would begin testing with manually driven vehicles in 10 new cities, starting with Las Vegas and San Diego. And in November, it announced its robotaxi service will officially be expanding to those cities in 2026.

"We've regularly visited Las Vegas over the years and found the Waymo Driver easily adapts to the city," Waymo said in a blog post. "While Las Vegas is unique, its driving dynamics are familiar-similar to cities where we already operate. This familiarity positions us well to help serve Las Vegas's 40-plus million annual visitors."

Waymo said it plans to make its ride-hailing service available in Vegas in the summer of 2026.

San Diego

San Diego is the latest major city Waymo is expanding to in its home state of California.

"As we work to expand our deployment permits, we're partnering with local teams, training first responders, and deepening community relationships so we can best serve the community and its visitors when we open our doors," the company said in a blog post.

Waymo says it plans to open up its autonomous service in San Diego in 2026.

Detroit

Unlike many of the other cities Waymo is expanding to, Detroit presents the challenge of harsh winter weather.

In a blog post, Waymo said it has "regularly tested in Detroit during winter weather to develop our capabilities in snow and ice. We've made great strides in our efforts to operate in heavier snow - including testing in Michigan's Upper Peninsula - and look forward to the 6th-generation Waymo Driver navigating Detroit streets this winter."

London

In mid-October, Waymo said its vehicles will be heading to London with "trained human specialists" behind the wheel in the coming weeks, making the city its first European location. The company added that it's working with "local and national leaders to secure the necessary permissions to offer fully autonomous rides in 2026."

Nashville

In September, Waymo said it's partnering with Lyft to expand to Nashville. Waymo will start driving in the city autonomously in the "coming months," before opening to the public in 2026. Riders will be able to hail vehicles through the Waymo app, and will eventually have the option to be matched with a robotaxi in the Lyft app, too.

As part of the collaboration, Lyft will manage the robotaxi fleet, which includes vehicle maintenance and cleaning, while Waymo will be responsible for the self-driving technology.

Denver

Waymo is set to arrive in Denver this fall "to lay the groundwork for a fully autonomous service in the future," the company said in an early September blog post. It'll deploy a mixed fleet consisting of Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with its fifth-generation Waymo Driver as well as Zeekr RT vehicles with the sixth-gen Waymo Driver. That newer technology "is informed by years of winter weather experience across Michigan, upstate New York, and the Sierra Nevada and engineered to autonomously sustain operations in harsher climates," Waymo said.

Seattle

In early September, Waymo shared that it's heading to the Seattle metropolitan area, noting in a blog post that it "spent years getting to know the area -- from communities around the Lake to its notoriously wet weather." It's not yet clear when exactly that service will launch.

Dallas

Waymo is currently conducting early testing in Dallas, with plans to launch public rides via the Waymo app next year. The company is teaming up with Avis Budget Group, which will manage the fleet, including vehicle cleaning and maintenance.

"Our partnership with Waymo marks a pivotal milestone in our evolution, from a rental car company to a leading provider of fleet management, infrastructure and operations to the broader mobility ecosystem," Avis Budget Group CEO Brian Choi said in a statement. "Together, we're committed to making scaled autonomous mobility a reality for the people of Dallas, with plans to expand to additional cities in the near future."

New York City

In June, Waymo shared plans to bring its autonomous tech back to New York, after having first manually operated its vehicles there in 2021. It once again began driving manually in the Big Apple in early July, specifically in Manhattan and parts of downtown Brooklyn, as well as in nearby Jersey City and Hoboken. Waymo submitted a permit application with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a human behind the wheel, which was granted in late August.

As part of the New York City permit, Waymo can test up to eight autonomous vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn until September. After that, it can apply for an extension to the pilot testing period.

Existing laws in the state of New York don't permit the same fully autonomous ride-hailing service that companies like Waymo offer in other parts of the country, so Waymo is still unable to charge for rides. In June, Waymo said it was "advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel," adding, "we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future."

Philadelphia

Waymo said in July that it's bringing a limited fleet of its vehicles to "the most complex parts" of Philadelphia, "including downtown and freeways." These vehicles will have human drivers behind the wheel as the company continues to develop its driving capabilities. There are no immediate plans to launch a robotaxi service there.

Washington, DC

Waymo plans to start offering rides through its Waymo app in Washington, DC, in 2026. The company returned to the nation's capital in January to test its autonomous driving tech. In late March, it said it was bringing more vehicles to the city and working to scale its service throughout the year. In a blog post, Waymo said it'll "continue to work closely with policymakers to formalize the regulations needed to operate without a human behind the wheel in the District."

Miami

You'll also have to wait until 2026 to ride a Waymo in Miami. The company has been conducting weather testing in the lead-up to that eventual rollout, noting in a blog post, "Our previous road trips to the Sunshine State's challenging rainy conditions have been invaluable in advancing our autonomous driving capabilities."

Waymo will collaborate with Moove, a fintech company that offers vehicle financing, first in Phoenix, where Moove will manage the robotaxi's fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure. In Phoenix and then Miami, "Waymo will continue to offer our service through the Waymo app, and remain responsible for validation and operation of the Waymo Driver," the company said in a blog post.

Tokyo

In December, Waymo announced it's expanding to Tokyo, making it the company's first international location. Waymo is partnering with Japanese taxi service Nihon Kotsu and taxi app Go. In April, the self-driving company shared that it's finally ready to hit the road abroad.

Waymo says trained Nihon Kotsu drivers will manually drive its vehicles across seven Tokyo wards, including Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Chūō, Shinagawa and Kōtō. This will allow engineers to test and adapt Waymo's autonomous driving tech to local road features and traffic.

"In Tokyo, we are abiding by the same steadfast principles that guide us in the US -- commitment to safety, dedication to earning trust in communities where we operate, and collaboration with local officials and community groups here in Tokyo," Nicole Gavel, Waymo's head of business development and strategic partnerships, said in a statement.

It's not clear when riders will be able to hitch a self-driving ride with Waymo in Tokyo.

The road ahead: Future vehicles

In August 2024, Waymo unveiled the sixth generation of its self-driving technology, which strives to expand the capabilities of its driverless fleet. Smarter sensors are meant to help the cars better navigate in extreme weather, Waymo said. The sixth-gen Driver will come aboard the all-electric Zeekr vehicle, which features a flat floor, more head- and legroom, adjustable seats and a removable steering wheel and pedals. The updated tech is still being tested, but the company says it'll be available to riders soon.

In October, Waymo also announced a partnership with Hyundai to integrate its sixth-generation Driver into the all-electric Ioniq 5 SUV, which, according to a blog post, "will be added to the Waymo One fleet over time." The companies added that they "plan to produce a fleet of Ioniq 5s equipped with Waymo's technology in significant volume over multiple years to support Waymo One's growing scale." Testing with these vehicles will start by late 2025 and become available "in the years to follow."

Currently, everyday riders can't take a Waymo vehicle on highways and freeways, but that may soon change. The company is testing fully autonomous rides on freeways in Phoenix, as seen in an exclusive video shared with CNET in May 2024. It's also now making fully autonomous freeway rides available to Waymo employees in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Waymo is working to expand its autonomous driving tech into trucking as well, but it said in 2023 that it's scaling back those efforts for the time being, to focus on ride-hailing with Waymo One. It noted, "Our ongoing investment in advancing Waymo Driver capabilities, especially on freeways, will directly translate to trucking and benefit its development efforts."

[TITLE]Professors Press SCOTUS to Affirm Copyright Protection for AI-Created Works:
[TEXT]
“Excluding AI-generated works from copyright protection threatens the foundations of American creativity, innovation, and economic growth.” – Professors’ SCOTUS Amicus Brief

On Friday, October 31, Professors Shlomit Yanisky-Ravid, Lawrence Lessig and a number of other professors and researchers filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of Dr. Stephen Thaler’s petition for a writ of certiorari in Thaler v. Perlmutter, urging the Court to grant certiorari and recognize copyright protection for works generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

The brief argued that “excluding AI-generated works from copyright protection threatens the foundations of American creativity, innovation, and economic growth,” warning that the lower court’s interpretation, which requires human authorship, disregards the “spirit of the Copyright Act.”

Dr. Stephen Thaler has been seeking copyright protection for “A Recent Entrance to Paradise,” a work generated by his AI system, the Creativity Machine, after the U.S. Copyright Office refused registration because the work lacked human authorship. Thaler’s petition for a writ of certiorari argued that the Copyright Office has “ambiguously deemed humanity as the sine qua non of copyright, when this Court has explained the only sine qua non is originality.” It cautioned that if consistently enforced, the Office’s interpretation “would spell the end of copyright protection for many photographs and other works created with technological assistance.”

On October 31, Thaler also filed a letter requesting that the Court hold consideration of his petition pending the resolution of Blanche v. Perlmutter and Trump v. Slaughter. Blanche v. Perlmutter concerns whether U.S. Copyright Office Director Shira Perlmutter, a named respondent in Thaler’s case, should continue in her position following her removal by the Trump administration, while Trump v. Slaughter addresses the authority to remove Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, with oral arguments scheduled for December 8.

The case also presents “an opportunity for the Court to restore legal clarity and reaffirm its constitutional authority to interpret ambiguous statutes after Loper Bright [Enterprises v. Raimondo], ensuring that administrative agencies do not constrain creativity through overreach,” the amicus brief argued. Moreover, recognizing authorship and protection for AI-generated works, whether through the work-made-for-hire doctrine or comparable frameworks, would align copyright law with its constitutional purpose.

Highlighting the economic stakes, the amicus brief cited U.S. Chamber of Commerce data showing that core copyright industries contributed $3.37 trillion to the U.S. GDP in 2023, employed approximately 21.14 million people, and paid wages

[TITLE]Datavault AI, Music Dash and NFHITS Partner to Transform Music Data Tracking Display and Monetization Through Patented Inaudible Tones®, AI and Blockchain Technology:
[TEXT]
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN – Datavault AI Inc. (Nasdaq: DVLT), a leader in AI-driven data visualization, valuation, and monetization, today announces it has begun collaborating with NFHITS to pioneer a proprietary Web 3.0, minting and blockchain-based music and content distribution network.

NFHITS along with its monetization partner, Music Dash’s mission is to lead the music and film industries into their next era — where creativity, technology, and opportunity unite. It believes in empowering artists, filmmakers, creators, and entrepreneurs worldwide with tools that remove barriers, protect originality, and fuel innovation.

NFHITS and Music Dash’s current distribution network includes Apple Music and iTunes, AMI Entertainment, AWA, Bitmoji, Boomplay, Bose, Deutsche Telekom Austria and Netherlands, DiGi, Facebook, Flow, GraceNote, iHeartRadio, Instagram, iMusica, Naver Live, Shazam, Snapchat, Sonos, Soundcloud, Spotify, TikTok, Tidal, and more.

Together, the companies aim to establish fair, transparent, and automated monetization powered by Datavault AI’s unprecedented experiential, minting and exchange capabilities. To accelerate this process, Datavault AI is also integrating its VerifyU and ADIO into NFHITS distribution frameworks to authenticate artists and music rights, protect royalties, reduce digital piracy, and ensure distribution integrity while creating new revenue stream opportunities including digital collectibles and objectified music assets.

Datavault AI’s and NFHITS’s distribution infrastructure, which converges blockchain and AI, reimagines the current streaming and distribution models offering artists key benefits, such as:

The ability to exclusively distribute music, videos, independent films, and music videos

Protect artists’ creative and intellectual property and metadata to secure future royalties

Deliver artists’ music by incorporating Datavault AI’s ADIO technology through the audio systems at a variety of entertainment venues and public places

“Blockchain has matured and now, in combination with AI, we have the infrastructure to take artists’ content streaming mainstream with this technological breakthrough,” said Bob Shami, founder and CEO, NFHITS. “The music industry and content creators have been searching for ways to maximize their revenue. This new format provides the groundwork for a new way to increase profitability and hope for emerging content creators to grow and sustain their careers.”

The two companies are also considering deploying NFHITS digital music delivery into shopping markets, restaurants, stores, etc., using Datavault AI’s ADIO tone technology, which delivers inaudible sounds that send information to listeners’ devices with special offers such as exclusive content, merchandise, or discounted prices.

“Datavault A is dedicated to helping businesses and industries manage, secure, and leverage their data assets to maximize their monetization potential, but that really starts with understanding data’s value in whatever form it takes,” said Nate Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI. “Our collaboration with NFHITS holds tremendous potential to create annual recurring revenue for artists, promoters and the events industry which continues to be challenged in compensating artists for their art and shielding their digital assets from their unauthorized use. The implementation of VerifyU, ADIO, and our NYIAX powered exchanges offer solutions for NFHITS’ ecosystem that demonstrates how we work with partners to transform industries and create revenue in places no one else can unlock.”

[TITLE]What’s up with… MásOrange, Millicom, VodafoneZiggo:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Orange looks set to take full control of Spain’s largest telco (by subscriber numbers) by acquiring the 50% of MásOrange it doesn’t already own; as Millicom grows its presence in Latin America, so Telefónica retreats further; Ericsson is helping Dutch operator VodafoneZiggo cut its RAN energy consumption as part of a broad network upgrade; and much more!

Orange has decided to press ahead with highly anticipated plans to buy the 50% stake in Spanish joint venture (JV) telco MásOrange that is currently held by Lorca, the private-equity consortium of Cinven, KKR and Providence Equity Partners. In a statement, Orange said it has reached a “non-binding agreement” with Lorca to acquire full ownership of MásOrange, meaning it will splurge €4.25bn on the 50% of the JV that it does not already own. The signing of a binding agreement is expected to take place before the end of 2025, and the transaction is then likely to be completed in the first six months of 2026. According to Orange, the deal will “accelerate” its Lead the Future strategic plan, and further strengthen its position in Spain, the group’s second-largest market in Europe. “With full ownership, Orange confirms its long-term industrial commitment in Spain, and its confidence in MásOrange and its management to create value for all stakeholders,” the operator said. The move comes more than a year after the formation of MásOrange through the merger of Orange Spain with MásMovil. The shareholder agreement formed at the time contains clauses enabling MásOrange’s owners to instigate an initial public offering (IPO) under certain conditions after April 2026, and allowing Orange to take control of the business at the proposed IPO price. However, it has been speculated for some time that Orange and the private equity funds behind Lorca were keen to reach a deal before a possible IPO could take place. MásOrange is the largest telco in Spain by customer numbers, ending September this year with 26.2 million mobile connections and 7.2 million fixed broadband connections. It reported revenues of €5.66bn for the first nine months of 2025, up 3.7% compared with the same period a year earlier, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of almost €2.2bn, up by 8.3%. MásOrange ended September with net debt of €12.5bn.

Meanwhile, there are ongoing rumours

[TITLE]Warner Bros. Discovery & TNT Sports Target UK Piracy Blocking Injunction * TorrentFreak:
[TEXT]
Warner Bros. Discovery Sports and TNT Sports are the latest sports rightsholders to request a pirate site blocking injunction at the High Court in London. The specific content the companies aim to protect isn't clear but with football, rugby, MotoGP, UFC, boxing and more to choose from, there's no shortage of options. For UK consumers looking for choice, the opposite seems to be true.

The major Hollywood studios of the MPA, which in recent years now includes Netflix and Amazon, are well known for obtaining site blocking injunctions at the High Court in London.

While blocking of new domains continues at a considerable pace, applications for all-new injunctions are relatively rare. Since they tend to operate in groups while adopting familiar branding, the most persistent pirate sites are identified quite quickly, and then blocked under the scope of previously obtained injunctions.

Outliers certainly exist, but the recent addition of Cloudflare shows that the landscape can shift quite quickly and in unexpected directions. New rightsholders are also getting involved.

Warner Bros. Discovery & TNT Sports

During the past few years, surging interest in live sports coupled with rising prices for already expensive official packages, have combined to give pirate IPTV services the conditions in which they thrive. Pressure on the European Commission increased last week with demands that include the introduction of pan-European blocking orders.

In the UK, the Premier League has been going

[TITLE]AI darlings prop up Wall Street as most other stocks fall:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK (AP) — More gains for Nvidia, Amazon and other AI superstars propped up Wall Street on Monday.

The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and pulled closer to its all-time high set last week, even though the majority of stocks in the index sank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 226 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%.

Nvidia was the strongest force lifting the S&P 500, just like it has been for the year so far. The chip company rose 2.2% to bring its gain for the year to date to 54.1%.

Amazon was the No. 2 force pushing the market higher. It rallied 4% after announcing a $38 billion agreement with OpenAI, which will use Amazon’s cloud computing services to run its AI workloads.

IREN, an AI cloud service provider, jumped 11.5% after Microsoft announced a $9.7 billion contract with it that will give the tech giant access to some of Nvidia’s chips.

Palantir Technologies, which came into the day with a stunning 165% gain for the year so far, rose another 3.3%. Traders pushed the AI darling higher in the final hours before the data platform company reported its latest quarterly results after trading closed for the day.

Companies across the U.S. stock market will need to hit expectations for growth in profit to justify the big gains for their stock prices since April. Criticism has been rising that the broad U.S. market, and AI stocks in particular, have become too expensive and could be inflating into a dangerous bubble similar to the 2000 dot-com bust.

For the most part, companies have been meeting the high expectations for profits. Four out of every five companies in the S&P 500 have topped analysts’ forecasts so far this reporting season, according to FactSet. With roughly two-thirds of all S&P 500 reports in, companies in the index are on track to deliver healthy growth of nearly 11% versus a year earlier.

On the losing end of Wall Street Monday was Kimberly-Clark, which dropped 14.6% after it said it would buy Kenvue in a deal valuing it at $48.7 billion. Kenvue, which sells Tylenol, Band-Aids and Listerine, jumped 12.3%.

Beyond Meat tumbled 16% after the plant-based meat company delayed its report for the latest quarter’s results to Nov. 11 from Tuesday. It said it needs more time to assess how big of a non-cash charge it will take due to issues it had previously disclosed with some of its assets.

Beyond Meat’s stock has been mostly falling since topping $4 in July, but it went on a wild ride last month where it suddenly soared from 52 cents to $3.62 in three days, a nearly 600% surge. It got swept up in the “meme stock” craze, where prices can rise solely due to online hype rather than any change to the company’s actual business.

All told, the S&P 500 rose 11.77 points to 6,851.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 226.19 to 47,336.68, and the Nasdaq composite rose 109.77 to 23,834.72.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.10% from 4.11% late Friday.

A discouraging report on U.S. manufacturing said that activity shrank by more last month than economists expected. Several manufacturers told surveyors for the Institute for Supply Management that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are creating financial pain.

“Wonder has turned to concern regarding how the tariff threats are affecting our business,” a chemical products manufacturer told the survey. “Orders are down across most divisions, and we’ve lowered our financial expectations for 2025.”

“In general, business is really strained,” another manufacturer told the survey.

In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe following a stronger finish in Asia.

South Korea’s Kospi jumped 2.8% to another record. SK Hynix soared nearly 11%, helped by recent moves to team up with Nvidia in developing the country’s artificial intelligence infrastructure and capabilities.

South Korean shipbuilders also rose after China said it would cancel added port fees on U.S.-invested or U.S. flagged vessels after Trump met last week with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
