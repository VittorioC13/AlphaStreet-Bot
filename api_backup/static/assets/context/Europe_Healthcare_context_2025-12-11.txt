[TITLE]​Sanofi (SNY) Completes the Acquisition of Vicebio:
[TEXT]
​Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is one of the Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy Now. On December 4, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) announced the completion of the Vicebio acquisition. Vicebio is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing transformative multi-pathogen vaccines for respiratory viral infections.

​Management noted that this strategic acquisition brings Vicebio’s early-stage vaccine candidate for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus under Sanofi’s portfolio. Moreover, the company also noted that the acquisition will allow it to enhance vaccine design and development using Vicebio’s Molecular Clamp technology.

​Earlier on November 25, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) announced that its jointly developed program with Regeneron called Dupilumab was approved by the European Commission to treat moderate-to-severe chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and above. Management noted that Dupilumab can be used as a first-line targeted treatment option.

​The EU approval was based on positive results from the Phase 3 study, which showed Dupilumab reduced symptoms at 24 weeks compared to the placebo. The addressable market in the EU is significant, as there are over 270,000 adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria.

​Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) researches, produces, and distributes pharmaceutical products. The company’s operations are divided into the Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare, and Vaccines segments.

While we acknowledge the potential of SNY as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Licensing partner Zydus brings extensive commercial experience, marketing more than 225 FDA-approved medicines, providing a strong foundation for a successful launch of FYB206

Strong early partnering interest underscores industry confidence in Formycon’s biosimilar expertise and development excellence

Agreement structure includes in total mid-teens-million-euro upfront and 2025 milestone payments, alongside additional development and regulatory milestones and a mid-double-digit-gross-profit-share upon launch

Clinical development phase of FYB206 nearly completed; primary endpoint data expected in the first quarter of 2026

PLANEGG-MARTINSRIED, Germany and AHMEDABAD, India, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Formycon AG (FSE: FYB, “Formycon”) and Zydus Lifesciences Limited (including its subsidiaries and affiliates, “Zydus”), today jointly announced that they have entered into a strategic partnership for the exclusive licensing and supply of checkpoint inhibitor FYB206, a biosimilar of Keytruda®1 (Pembrolizumab), in the U.S. and Canada.

Under the terms of this agreement, Formycon AG will finalize development, prepare and file the regulatory dossier, and supply the product, while Zydus will be responsible for the commercialization of FYB206 in the U.S. and Canada. Meanwhile, FYB206 is approaching the end of its clinical development phase, with primary endpoint data expected in the first quarter of 2026. Following completion of the data package, Formycon will prepare the dossier and submit the biologics license application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in due course.

Dr. Stefan Glombitza, CEO of Formycon, commented: “Partnering with Zydus for the U.S. and Canada marks an important milestone for us. Zydus is an established, high-revenue player with a compelling and forward-looking oncology strategy. It has a strong commercial footprint in the U.S., where it generates nearly half of its global revenue and maintains a robust, scalable presence across key commercial channels. By commercializing over 225 FDA-approved products, including injectables and hospital-use medicines, Zydus has shown solid execution strength in complex launches, supporting the high-quality implementation of FYB206.

Continuing our indicated partnering approach, we are teaming up with strong local partners at attractive commercial terms as we work together to deliver meaningful value for patients and healthcare systems.”

Dr. Sharvil P. Patel, Managing Director of Zydus Lifesciences Limited, stated: “We are happy to collaborate with Formycon to develop and commercialize a biosimilar of Keytruda® across U.S. and Canada. This venture marks Zydus’ entry into the North American biosimilar market, debuting with an immunotherapy product. This collaboration also complements Zydus’ recent proposed acquisition of Agenus Inc.’s California, USA based manufacturing facilities, which we plan to integrate and leverage for manufacturing in the future. By combining our expertise and resources, we aim to drive significant organizational growth and deliver maximum value to patients through expanded access to affordable oncology care.”

Upon signature of the agreement, Formycon will be eligible to receive mid-teens-million-euro upfront and milestone payments in 2025. In addition, Formycon will be eligible for further payments linked to the achievement of defined development and regulatory milestones, which in total are expected to amount to a mid–double-digit-million-euro range. Upon market launch, Formycon will obtain a mid–double-digit-share of the gross profits generated in the territory.

Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that belongs to the group of immune checkpoint inhibitors and is used to treat a variety of tumors. With its broad range of indications in oncology and global sales of US$ 29.5 billion in 20242, Keytruda® is currently one of the world’s best-selling drugs, underscoring the substantial oncology demand and market potential across the world.

[TITLE]Idorsia’s treatment for insomnia disorder wins the inaugural Prix Galien Bridges Award in the ‘Best Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical Product’ category:
[TEXT]
Idorsia’s dual orexin receptor antagonist, the first and only drug of its kind approved in Europe for the treatment of insomnia disorder, has been awarded the inaugural Prix Galien Bridges Award in the category of “Best Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical Product”

Inaugural winners are honored for breakthrough innovations in life sciences

Allschwil, Switzerland – December 9, 2025

Idorsia Ltd (SIX: IDIA) announces that its novel treatment for insomnia disorder has been awarded the inaugural Prix Galien Bridges Award in the category of “Best Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical Product”. The award recognizes groundbreaking medicines, including biologics, gene therapies, and traditional pharmaceutical compounds, that advance patient care through scientific innovation.

Bettina Blosse, General Manager of Idorsia Nordics, commented:

"We are immensely proud to have been awarded the prestigious Prix Galien, particularly the first of its kind in the Nordics. The recognition from the jury is a wonderful endorsement of Idorsia's commitment to innovation in healthcare and the value that the new treatment brings to improving patient care for insomnia disorder. My team is working to make this medicine accessible to all patients in the Nordic region.”

Martine Clozel, MD and Chief Scientific Officer added:

“Our research team began work on the science of orexin and orexin receptors immediately after they were first described in 1998. Our initial work led to the understanding that antagonism of the orexin system induced a very physiological sleep. With a treatment of insomnia disorder in mind, the team set the target to design a dual orexin receptor antagonist that, among a number of criteria, would achieve a rapid onset of effect and a duration of action sufficient to cover the totality of the night at optimally effective doses, avoiding morning carry-over effects. It took us more than 10 years, and we had to synthesize and characterize more than 25,000 compounds to arrive at the molecule which has now been recognized with the Prix Galien Bridges Award – for improving not only the nights of patients with insomnia disorder, but also most importantly their daytime functioning.”

The Prix Galien Awards were created in 1970 by Roland Mehl in honor of Galien, the father of medical science and modern pharmacology, to recognize outstanding innovation and scientific advancement. With chapters in 16 countries and Africa, Prix Galien is regarded worldwide as the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for the life science industry.

[TITLE]“LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease Included in China’s Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that anti-Aβ protofibril* antibody “LEQEMBI®” (brand name in China: “乐意保®”, generic name: lecanemab), has been included in the “Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List” (Chinese: 商业健康保险创新药品目录), recently introduced by the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) of China. The inclusion of LEQEMBI in this list marks a meaningful step toward expanding access to early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) treatment in China.

The Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List is based on new policies of the Chinese government to support the development and access of innovative medicines. The list aims to help narrow the coverage gap between the basic reimbursement system under the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and innovative medicines that address areas of significant unmet need. Based on the Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List, Commercial insurance companies will discuss and reach the agreement with pharmaceutical companies regarding coverage details, and develop insurance products focusing on the listed medicines. The Commercial Insurance Innovative Drug List is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026.

Eisai estimates that there were 17 million patients with MCI or mild dementia due to AD in China in 2024, which is expected to increase with the aging of the population.

Eisai launched LEQEMBI in China in June 2024 and has delivered the product in the private market.

Eisai serves as the lead of LEQEMBI development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. Eisai will distribute the product in China and will conduct information provision activities through specialized Medical Representatives.

*Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.2
