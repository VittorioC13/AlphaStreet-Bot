[TITLE]City-States Without Limits – Part 2:
[TEXT]
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity.

In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.”

The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs.

The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain).

The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin.

By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means.

We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments.

At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring

[TITLE]Hong Kong stocks advance as investors look for signs of easing global tensions:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong stocks rose on Thursday, as investors looked for signs of easing geopolitical tensions following US leader Donald Trump's remarks that he had a "pretty long meeting scheduled" in South Korea with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week.

The Hang Seng Index advanced 0.7 per cent to 25,976.98 at 3.05pm local time, after falling by 0.4 per cent earlier. The Hang Seng Tech Index gained 0.7 per cent. On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index lifted 0.3 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2 per cent.

Leading the gainers, sportswear producer Li Ning jumped 6.7 per cent to HK$18.57, while property developer Sun Hung Kai Properties advanced 1.5 per cent to HK$93.75. Search-engine giant Baidu rose 1 per cent to HK$116.20, and WeChat operator Tencent Holdings added 1.1 per cent to HK$636.50.

On the negative side, blind-box toymaker Pop Mart International slumped 9.1 per cent to HK$233, while online-game provider NetEase dropped 0.4 per cent to HK$228.60. Short-video platform Kuaishou Technology tumbled 0.4 per cent to HK$73.45, and jeweller Chow Tai Fook Jewellery slipped 0.3 per cent to HK$15.65.

Investors are watching closely for any signs that the potential talks between Xi and Trump could help stabilise markets rattled by geopolitical risks and uncertainty over global trade flows. Trump said the talks would range from soybean purchases to rare earth exports and the Russia-Ukraine war.

Chinese oil firm CNOOC advanced 2.5 per cent to HK$19.98 and peer PetroChina added 1.4 per cent to HK$8, after Trump announced sanctions on Russia's largest oil producers.

Meanwhile, the White House was reportedly weighing export restrictions of US-made software to China, adding to the trade and geopolitical tensions.

"The market is adopting a wait-and-see attitude right now, as Donald Trump's remarks often change," said Kenny Tang, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Financial Analysts. "Investors will stay cautious until the meeting [with Xi] is confirmed. So for the time being, market conditions will likely remain volatile."

Tang said there was support at the lower end of the trading range, such as around the 100-day moving average. "However, I believe the market will become more volatile when it goes above the 26,000-point level," he said.

[TITLE]HKEX CEO Bonnie Chan says geopolitics and economic uncertainty may dim IPO outlook:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) CEO Bonnie Chan Yiting cautioned that the fundraising bonanza in the city, which leads the global initial public offering (IPO) rankings this year, could slow down amid geopolitical and economic risks.

"I would say that we need to be very conscious that the world is still under a lot of stress geopolitically and macroeconomically," she said at the Bund Summit financial forum in Shanghai on Thursday. "I think it's too early [for the HKEX] to claim victory."

Chan issued the warning despite a strong pipeline of more than 300 companies waiting to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange, home to the world's two largest share sales - Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and Zijin Gold International - this year.
