[TITLE]Trump’s sanctions on Russian energy are a massive step toward peace:
[TEXT]
Bravo to Team Trump for bringing the hammer down on Russia with its most significant sanctions yet — the only way to convince Vladimir Putin that refusing to make peace is a dead end.

The sanctions, levied against Russia’s top two energy companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, show the White House is ready to start dealing out hefty punishments for Moscow’s obstinance after a call between Trump and Putin last week.

The Kremlin’s insistence, after that call, that Russia won’t drop impossible demands, left the prez no reason to go face-to-face with Mad Vlad in Budapest.

Crippling the energy sector is a strike at the heart of Putin’s war economy.

Upping the ante, the European Union immediately followed Trump’s lead with its own sanctions, including a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports — another whack at Putin’s pockets, since Europe is the No. 1 buyer of the stuff.

This is what’s needed to get peace: a coordinated, US-led pressure campaign that hits Moscow where it hurts.

Yes, Trump has cooled on sending Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv (arguing that they’re too complex to use without months of training), a decision that Kyiv thinks led Russia to back off on making concessions.

But the president’s reasoning is fair enough: He doesn’t want unintended deaths on his hands if Ukrainian soldiers misfire a weapon the US gave them.

And it’s not clear how much they’re needed; Ukraine pulled off a successful strike on a Russian chemical plant with UK-made Storm Shadow missiles on Tuesday, proving that it can hit hard without Tomahawks.

Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report Wednesday that Washington lifted restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western-provided long-range missiles within Russia before the attack, but it hardly matters; an already paranoid Putin is left to fear how far the White House might still go.

All good, and Trump can next twist some more screws.

He can go after Putin’s other cash cow: his lapdog oligarchs, who prosper thanks to their Kremlin ties while funding Moscow’s war machine.

Many of these toadies have made money off the deaths of Ukrainians, raking in cash from ramped-up weapons manufacturing.

Wednesday’s EU sanctions package hit oligarchs hard, blocking them from accessing funding or economic resources and traveling to Europe.

The Trump team should tighten the noose on Putin’s puppets even further, broadening the US list of sanctioned individuals, seizing and freezing assets and closing loopholes so that intermediaries can’t do business on the oligarchs’ behalf.

A good start: Yelena Baturina and Vladimir Yevtushenkov, two Hunter Biden-linked Russian billionaires conspicuously left off President Joe Biden’s sanction lists.

Send a message to Putin: He and his cronies will get no quarter from the civilized world.

Make him see he has no path forward unless he gives up his grotesque fantasies of wiping Ukraine off the map.

America and its allies have to keep bringing the pain until Moscow cries “uncle.”

[TITLE]Hammond Power Solutions Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
GUELPH, Ontario, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hammond Power Solutions Inc. (“HPS” or the “Company”) (TSX: HPS.A), a leading manufacturer of dry-type transformers, power quality products and related magnetics, today announced its financial results for the third quarter 2025.

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS:

Sales of $218 million in the quarter, a 13.7% increase vs quarter 3, 2024;

Adjusted EBITDA of $30 million, or 13.9% of sales;

Gross margin of $66 million or 30.1% of sales;

Net earnings of $17.4 million;

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.56. Earnings per share of $1.46;

Backlog is 27.7% higher than the beginning of the year;

Significant data centre project orders booked subsequent to quarter-end.

“HPS delivered another strong quarter in Q3 2025, generating $218 million in revenue, our second highest quarter for shipments ever. The U.S. market delivered strong distribution and private label sales, offsetting a softer Canadian market,” said Adrian Thomas, CEO of Hammond Power Solutions. “While material cost inflation and overhead costs relating to our new facilities in Mexico have pressured margins, recent sales developments give us confidence in the quarters ahead. Data centre activity accelerated in the quarter, and we are pleased to note that substantial orders were received shortly after its close, amounting to 53% of the Q3 closing backlog. These orders are expected to be shipped primarily in 2026 and from our new facilities in Mexico, which will be reconfigured with additional equipment to support this new volume.”

Year-over-year, HPS’s sales in the U.S. market grew by 15.9%. In the third quarter of 2025, U.S. market sales grew by 21.5% versus the same quarter of 2024. The U.S. market experienced its strongest growth in the private label channel and steady growth in the distribution channel, with strong sales into data centres, switchgear manufacturers, motor control, and mining. While sales of stocked standard products have grown, they have been outpaced by higher sales of custom products, primarily sold into the data center market.

As of the close of the quarter, the Company’s Quarter 3, 2025 backlog increased by 22.4% as compared to Quarter 3, 2024. The Company’s backlog increased 27.7% from the beginning of the year, and 17.6% from Quarter 2, 2025. Orders received after the close of the quarter were valued at 53% of the closing backlog.

“The third quarter followed many of the trends we saw in the second quarter, including continued strength in the U.S. market, and higher costs resulting from inflation. The implementation of additional tariffs in late August had a negative impact on margins but we expect that pricing actions implemented in September and continued supplier discussions will offset this impact moving forward,” said Richard Vollering, Chief Financial Officer of HPS. “Working capital grew primarily due to increased inventory arising from shipping delays, requirements for certain large ongoing projects, and the additional cost of tariffs. Capital expenditures continued according to plan in the third quarter. We expect that our capital requirements will increase in the next two quarters as we add equipment and make production shifts to support incoming data centre orders.”

The Company saw a decrease in its gross margin rate for the three months of Quarter 3, 2025 which was 30.1% compared to the Quarter 3, 2024 record-high of 33.8%. The year-to-date gross margin rate decreased from 32.8% in 2024 to 30.7% in 2025, a decrease of 210 basis points. The decline in gross margin is mainly the result of higher material costs related to commodity volatility, supply chain inflation, and tariffs.

Total selling and distribution expenses were $24,224 in Quarter 3, 2025 (11.1% of sales) versus $20,252 in Quarter 3, 2024 (10.5% of sales), an increase of $3,972 or an increase of 60 basis points. Year-to-date selling and distribution expenses were $71,209 (11.1% of sales) in 2025 compared to $61,910 (10.7% of sales) in 2024, an increase of $9,299 or 40 basis points. The increase in selling and distribution expenses is a result of higher variable freight and commission expenses attributed to the increase in sales as well as investments in people and technology to support growth.

General and administrative expenses were $16,534 (7.6% of sales) for Quarter 3, 2025 compared to Quarter 3, 2024 expenses of $21,024 (11.0% of sales), a decrease of $4,490 or 340 basis points. Year-to-date general and administration expenses were $44,744 (6.9% of sales) in 2025 compared to $59,225 (10.2% of sales) in 2024, a decrease of $14,481 or 330 basis points. The change is mainly due to a decrease in share-based compensation costs, offset by ongoing strategic investments in people and resources to support our growth strategies and higher levels of general business activity.

Net earnings for Quarter 3, 2025 finished at $17,440 compared to net earnings of $16,311 in Quarter 3, 2024, an increase of $1,129. Year-to-date net earnings for 2025 finished at $57,038 compared to net earnings of $47,853 in 2024, an increase of $9,185.

EBITDA for Quarter 3, 2025 was $28,746 versus $27,229 in Quarter 3, 2024, an increase of $1,517 or 5.6%. Adjusted for foreign exchange loss/gain and share-based compensation expenses adjusted EBITDA for Quarter 3, 2025 was $30,290 versus $34,377 in Quarter 3, 2024, a decrease of $4,087 or 11.9%. Year-to-date EBITDA was $93,163 in 2025 and $78,939 in 2024, an increase of $14,224 or 18.0%. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $94,603 in 2025 and $97,936 in 2024, a decrease of $3,333 or 3.4%.

Basic earnings per share were $1.46 for Quarter 3, 2025 versus $1.37 in Quarter 3, 2024, an increase of $0.09. Year-to-date the basic earnings per share were $4.79 in 2025 compared to $4.02 in 2024, an increase of $0.77. Adjusted for foreign exchange losses and share-based compensation expenses adjusted earnings per share were $1.56 for Quarter 3, 2025 versus $1.80 for Quarter 3, 2024. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share were $4.88 for 2025 compared to $5.16 in 2024.

The Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of twenty-seven and a half cents ($0.275) per Class A Subordinate Voting Share of HPS and a quarterly cash dividend of twenty-seven and a half cents ($0.275) per Class B Common Share of HPS paid on September 25, 2025. Year-to-date the Company has paid a cash dividend of eighty-two and a half cents ($0.825) per Class A Subordinate Voting Share and of eighty-two and a half cents ($0.825) per Class B Shares.

[TITLE]Wall Streeters poised to get record bonuses in 2025 with profits exceeding $60B: NY comptroller:
[TEXT]
Wall Street bankers are set to rake in record bonuses this year, according to a new report from New York’s bean counter-in-chief, with profits fueled by a resurgence in dealmaking and a soaring stock market.

State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli predicted industry profits could exceed $60 billion in 2025 if current trends continue, up from the $49.9 billion full-year earnings posted by the Big Apple’s money men last year, handing a significant boost to city and state coffers.

“While uncertainty remains around interest rates, inflation, and the broader economy, Wall Street looks to have another strong year,” he said Thursday, pointing to a 10% rise in compensation expenses in just the first half of the year, compared to 2024.

DiNapoli, a Dem, noted that Wall Street profits “provide an important boost for tax revenues that support critical investments in housing, transportation and public services that New Yorkers depend on.”

The comptroller’s report said profits at the 130 firms on the New York Stock Exchange hit $30.4 billion in the first six months of this year — in spite of uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s trade policies, among other factors.

“The profit surge stems from a 73.4% increase in trading revenues, along with gains from commission income, AI-related deals and supervisory fees, despite market volatility tied to shifting tariff policies and global economic jitters,” DiNapoli wrote.

Major banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citi saw a boost to their trading units’ bottom lines as investors reorganized their portfolios while the White House overhauled trading policy with countries around the world.

4 DiNapoli’s report cited a recent AI stock boom and swelling trading revenues at some of New York’s top banks as the reason behind the bigger bonuses. Lev Radin/Shutterstock

Last year’s Wall Street bonuses hit a record $47.5 billion, coming to an average of $244,700 per employee, according to data from the comptroller’s office. Total compensation, including salaries, climbed 7.3% to an average of $505,630 — nearly five times the city’s private-sector average.

In August, leading compensation consultant Johnson Associates predicted an uptick in bonus payouts, too.

Johnson Associate said Wall Streeters working on fixed-income trading desks could see their bonuses grow 10% to 20%, while equities traders may get increases of up to 30%.

The improved outlook follows a weak start to the year, when banks and financial firms faced uncertainty from global trade tensions and muted deal-making.

DiNapoli’s forecast underscores the importance of the financial industry to New York City, with the sector coming under the microscope of left-wing firebrand Zohran Mamdani’s campaign to succeed Mayor Eric Adams.

Some top executives are concerned that his tax-and-spend proposals could force major firms to flee.

[TITLE]Union Pacific reports 7% higher profits as its CEO makes the case for Norfolk Southern merger:
[TEXT]
By JOSH FUNK

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific delivered 7% growth in its third-quarter earnings Thursday as its CEO continues to make the case for the potential benefits of acquiring one of the railroad’s eastern rivals.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad said it earned $1.79 billion, or $3.01 per share, in the quarter. That’s up from $1.67 billion, or $2.75 per share, a year ago. And without $41 million in merger costs the railroad would have made $3.08 per share but either number would have beat the Wall Street estimates of $2.97 per share.

Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad. That deal faces a lengthy review by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board before the companies would be able to merger Union Pacific’s vast network in the West with Norfolk Southern’s operation in the Eastern United States. Norfolk Southern will report its earnings Thursday afternoon.

Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena wrote a letter to employees reiterating that he thinks the merger is great for America because it would enable the railroad to deliver goods more quickly and help the companies that rely on its deliveries of raw materials and finished products.

He said other railroads that have come out against the merger like BNSF tend to look backward at the problems that followed past mergers in the 1990s while he is looking forward to finding the best way to compete against trucks and respond to advancements in technology. The merger has picked up support from the largest rail union and more than 400 shippers, but some other companies — particularly chemical producers — have said they think the deal will hurt competition and lead to higher rates.

“While Union Pacific has good opportunities to grow, the rail industry is going to be challenged by technology in the trucking and shipping industries,” Vena wrote. “Union Pacific continues to invest in technology, but if we truly want to compete and grow the business, we must have a network that is set up to provide seamless service at a cost-effective price, positioning manufacturers to win in the marketplace.”

Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said if autonomous trucking becomes common, then trucking will be an even stronger competitor for rail, and Union Pacific also has to compete with the Canadian railroads that have some advantages because their networks already run coast-to-coast in Canada and extend down into the United States.

“You can see where the environment increasingly becomes more competitive. And you need to continue to make improvements. And potentially at some point you’re constrained with your network in what you can do,” Windau said.

BNSF sent a letter to its customers last month urging them to express their concerns about the merger to the STB because that railroad, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, believes the combination would hurt competition in the industry. BNSF has said it believes railroads can better serve their customers by cooperating instead of undertaking costly and complicated mergers.

CPKC and Canadian National railroads have also come out in favor of more cooperative agreements instead of mergers, but President Donald Trump has said the deal sounds good to him.

Vena said he thinks the opposition from other railroads shows that they know this merger would give UP a competitive advantage that will force them to make changes, and he said the shippers that are raising concerns should wait to see the detailed application Union Pacific plans to submit in either late November or early December before declaring the deal is bad.

“If the other railroads thought we were being stupid about what we were doing and it was not going to provide a higher service at a lower cost for our shippers, then they wouldn’t be complaining, would they?” Vena said.

He compared the opposition to this merger to the backlash the United States faced in 1867 for agreeing to pay $7.2 million to acquire Alaska from Russia. “I don’t think anybody would claim that was a bad deal for America,” Vena said.

Union Pacific said it remains on track to deliver profits this year in line with its three-year goal for high-single digit to low double-digit growth.

This quarter the railroad was able to deliver 3% growth in revenue largely through higher rates even though the number of carloads it delivered was essentially flat.

[TITLE]Union Pacific profits rise on operational efficiency, pricing gains:
[TEXT]
Union Pacific was firing on all cylinders during the third quarter, as pricing gains, record workforce productivity and fuel consumption led to higher profits despite flat volume.

“We are focused on driving continued improvements in our pursuit of what’s possible … [C]ore pricing gains and continued operational efficiencies drove the strong financial results in the quarter,” Chief Executive Jim Vena said on the railroad’s Thursday morning earnings call. “Freight revenue, excluding fuel, grew for the sixth consecutive quarter and set a best-ever record. In addition, we set best-ever quarterly records in workforce productivity, fuel consumption, terminal dwell, and train length.”

Operating income at Omaha-based UP (NYSE: UNP) increased 6%, to $2.5 billion, as revenue grew 3%, to $6.2 billion. Earnings per share increased 9%, to $3.01.

The quarterly operating ratio improved 1.1 points to 59.2% as expenses increased 1%. Adjusted for costs related to the proposed acquisition of Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC), the operating ratio was 58.5%.

Norfolk Southern will report earnings Thursday after the close of markets. The companies are expected to submit their detailed merger application with the Surface Transportation Board after Oct. 29.

Volume was flat when measured by carloads and intermodal units, but up 5% based on revenue ton-miles.

Bulk carloads increased 7%, largely on a spike in coal traffic. Industrial products volume rose 3% as industrial chemicals and plastic traffic increased 8%. Premium volume – which includes intermodal and automotive traffic – declined 5%, led by an identical drop in intermodal volume. The intermodal decline, UP said, was largely due to unfavorable comparisons to last year’s unprecedented surge in international intermodal traffic.

Key operational metrics all improved for the quarter: Freight car velocity was up 8%, train speed increased 4%, and terminal dwell declined 9% to an all-time low of 20.4 hours. Average train length grew 2% to 9,801 feet, a quarterly record.

“Our results do an excellent job demonstrating the team’s unwavering focus on our strategy to lead the industry in safety, service, and operational excellence,” said Eric Gehringer, executive vice president of operations. “Our vision is clear and fundamentally the railroad is operating exceptionally well, showcasing robust fluidity, consistency, and reliability.”

Executives noted that the operational improvements came amid the highest volume quarter of the year.

Employment levels dropped 4% compared to a year ago, to 28,871.

In a note to employees, Vena said the personal injury and train accident rates improved to the point that UP was on pace to reach its goal of becoming the safest Class I railroad in the U.S.

[TITLE]China Threat Calls for Ideologically Free Energy Policy:
[TEXT]
By Vijay Jayaraj

Whether China’s threat to restrict export of rare earth minerals materializes or is resolved through trade negotiations, the episode underscores the fragility of U.S. supply chains and the importance of developing domestic sources.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the energy sector where climate policies have made dozens of countries more reliant on imports than ever before. Adherence to climate orthodoxy has repeatedly exposed countries to avoidable risks, each instance demonstrating the cost of subordinating real-world utility to the pseudoscience of theoretical models and the grifting of special interests.

The reshuffling of the global flow of oil and coal after 2022 exposed the foolishness of the anti-fossil fuel agenda. European nations, led by Germany and the U.K., embarked on aggressive phaseouts of fossil fuels, dismantling coal plants and shrinking domestic natural gas output in favor of wind and solar. Domestic production of hydrocarbons collapsed, and reliance on imported energy spiked, particularly for the Germans and British.

As Europe turned away from Russian coal, it rushed to buy that fuel from the U.S., Qatar and Africa, often at much higher prices. Coal that Germany once imported from Russia was replaced with fuel shipped from more distant locations, undermining supposed “carbon savings” of its climate policy. When Russia’s gas pipeline became a casualty of war, Europe found itself reliant on LNG (liquefied natural gas) shipments from the U.S. at double the cost.

Bureaucratic obstacles to restarting coal- and gas-fired power plants further magnified shortages, driving up costs for manufacturing and household heating. Energy-intensive sectors — steel, aluminum, fertilizers — either shut down or relocated to countries with more reliable and affordable electricity, among them the U.S. and India.

In the United States, federal climate-centered policies presented new bottlenecks. The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act poured billions into “renewables” and imposed restrictions on offshore drilling and pipeline construction. Supply chain resilience was undermined by the ideological sidelining of cheap, abundant fuels.

Why does a nation willingly trade resilient domestic energy for unreliable sources that are bound to fall short of their citizens’ daily needs and fail disastrously during a crisis? How can policymakers justify burdening entire industries with inflated energy costs to satisfy “net zero” policies based on wishful thinking and vacuous rhetoric? For some, the answer is ideological purity and muddled thinking, and for others, a cynical grab for power and money.

Every megawatt of domestic energy production mothballed in pursuit of climate targets is a future vulnerability that materializes not in white papers but in tangible hardships for people.

Countries with rigid “green” energy mandates fared worst during disruptions; those with diversified, fossil-based power grids bounced back faster.

Countries that continued investing in fossil fuels — such as India and Indonesia — did far better. As Europe suffered under the high cost of electricity, India accelerated coal production, expanded refinery capacity and signed long-term LNG deals. Indonesia leveraged its coal and oil resources to stabilize domestic power and shield consumers from global volatility.

These are examples proving energy pragmatism, not ideology, safeguards national interests. The failure of the “net zero” experiment lies in its detachment from physical reality. Fossil fuels remain the foundation of modern civilization — powering transport, agriculture, defense, manufacturing, digital technology and more.

Governments must repeal the labyrinth of regulations that stifle domestic oil and gas exploration and coal mining. They must fast-track the approval of pipelines, refineries and LNG export terminals. They must end the colossal subsidies that prop up unreliable technologies and allow energy sources to compete on cost and reliability.

Investment should be directed toward developing advanced fossil fuel technologies, such as high-efficiency, low-emission coal plants, which can provide clean power without sacrificing reliability. Simultaneously, irrational regulation of nuclear power must be replaced with a clear-eyed view of that technology’s enormous benefits and manageable risks.

Ultimately, energy independence is not merely an economic issue; it is the bedrock of national sovereignty. A nation that cannot power its homes, fuel its industries, and move its military is not independent. It is a nation at the mercy of others. In an era of escalating great-power competition, outsourcing energy security is an act of unilateral disarmament.

[TITLE]Just 1% of coastal waters could power a third of the world’s electricity – but can we do it in time?:
[TEXT]
Just 1% of the world’s coastal waters could, in theory, generate enough offshore wind and solar power to provide a third of the world’s electricity by 2050. That’s the promise highlighted in a new study by a team of scientists in Singapore and China, who systematically mapped the global potential of renewables at sea.

But turning that potential into reality is another story. Scaling up offshore renewables fast enough to seriously dent global emissions faces formidable technical, economic and political hurdles.

To reach global climate targets, the world’s electricity systems must be fully decarbonised within a couple of decades if not sooner. Wind and solar power have grown at record-breaking rates, yet further expansion on land is increasingly constrained by a scarcity of good sites and conflicts over land use.

Moving renewables offshore is therefore tempting. The sea is vast, windy and sunny, with few residents around to object. The team behind the new study identified coastal areas with enough wind or sunlight, and water shallower than 200 metres, that are relatively ice-free and within 200 kilometres of population centres.

They estimate that using just 1% of these areas could generate over 6,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of offshore wind power and 14,000TWh of offshore solar power each year. Together that’s roughly one-third of the electricity the world is expected to use in 2050, while avoiding 9 billion tonnes of CO₂ annually.

That sounds impressive as 1% of suitable ocean seems small. Many European countries, such as Denmark, Germany, Belgium and the UK, already allocate between 7% and 16% of their coastal waters for offshore wind farms. Yet what matters for climate mitigation is not only how much low-carbon energy could eventually be produced, but how fast that could happen.

At present, offshore wind generates less than 200TWh per year, less than 1% of global electricity. By 2030, that might rise to around 900TWh. Hitting 6,000TWh by 2050 would require annual installations – each year, for two decades – to be

[TITLE]Canada's first 'nation-building' nuclear project relies on US suppliers:
[TEXT]
During a joint announcement with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Bowmanville, Carney described the project as a generational investment aimed at extending Canada’s leadership in clean energy while ensuring long-term prosperity for Ontario workers and communities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the federal government will invest $2 billion in Ontario’s Darlington New Nuclear Project — a plan that has stirred controversy since the eruption of a trade war with the US.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

The $3-billion partnership includes $1 billion from Ontario’s Building Ontario Fund . Ontario Power Generation will remain the majority owner and operator, with the federal and provincial governments holding minority stakes.

In the weeks after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and critical minerals, demand grew for Ontario to cancel its contract with US-based GE Hitachi, the company supplying the small modular reactors (SMRs) and enriched uranium for the $21-billion project. Both Carney and Ford have promoted “buy Canadian” policies to shield domestic industry from US tariff threats. Yet, despite the project’s reliance on American suppliers, both leaders defended the investment as essential to meeting Ontario’s soaring energy needs.

“This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach,” Carney said. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity, and opportunities.”

Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Ottawa had earlier committed $970 million to the project.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

Carney said the project marks the start of a broader plan to fast-track large infrastructure and clean energy projects through Ottawa’s new major projects office as proof that “Canada can build big things again.”

Construction on the first reactor began in May, with completion expected in 2030. Once online, the four reactors will supply

Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.

Growth across Latin America no longer follows traditional lines. It is shaped by volatility, technology, and the region’s evolving relationship with regulation and innovation. From Santiago to Guadalajara, leaders are reassessing what it means to expand responsibly in an economy that demands both agility and accountability.

In today’s Latin America, growth does not always mean scaling fast or chasing capital. Instead, it reflects a more profound shift toward sustainability, purpose, and inclusion. Companies across industries are adjusting their structures to respond to new realities: stricter regulations, accelerating digitization, fragile supply chains, and the global call for more equitable business models.

The shift is not isolated to one sector or country. It spans finance, logistics, technology, and creative industries, each responding to unique pressures with local solutions and global ambition. Investors and policymakers are watching closely as the region positions itself as both an innovation hub and a testing ground for sustainable capitalism. Economic resilience is no longer measured only by growth rates but by how well companies can withstand uncertainty while building trust among employees, customers, and communities. In this climate, adaptability has become Latin America’s most valuable export.

Enterprises from Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and beyond are adapting to these pressures. Drawing insights from finance, technology, logistics, retail, and the creative economy, leaders across the region are not just surviving disruption; they are applying it as a framework for long-term resilience.

Adaptive growth in regulated environments

Latin America’s financial and legal sectors operate under some of the world’s most complex regulatory systems. Yet instead of seeing regulation as a constraint, several firms are using it as a framework for innovation. This approach has led to a new era of creative compliance, where companies address bureaucratic challenges through transparency and trust. By aligning technical precision with ethical intent, these firms are providing examples of how responsible growth can function within tightly controlled environments.

Redesigning the financial architecture

At International Disruption, chief executive Brian Minutti has focused on turning compliance into a catalyst for efficiency. The firm integrates legal, regulatory, and fund-administration services into one cohesive platform. It’s a structure designed to simplify private-credit investment in a space traditionally burdened by bureaucracy.

The result is measurable. Processes that once spanned years now close within weeks, creating faster capital movement for pension funds, asset managers, and fintechs across Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. The model has also been extended to Panama and the United States, signaling a regional blueprint for lean financial operations.

Minutti’s strategy centers on disciplined simplicity. By aligning legal, compliance, operations, and administrative functions, his company minimizes redundancies while maintaining full regulatory clarity. The emphasis on people and teams that understand both technical rigor and cultural nuance has proven essential in managing expansion across borders, where trust remains a currency as valuable as cash flow.

Expanding access to capital

A similar philosophy guides Jorge Márquez, co-founder and managing partner of Inteligencia Capital, who has spent more than a decade building financial bridges for mid-sized enterprises. His firm champions small and medium-sized enterprises and non-bank financial intermediaries, sectors often sidelined by traditional lenders despite their economic significance.

Márquez introduced joint securitization mechanisms that allow multiple institutions to pool portfolios and share costs. This approach gives smaller entities access to capital markets on fairer terms, lowering the barriers that once excluded them from growth opportunities.

His work illustrates a critical principle for Latin American finance: innovation thrives when regulators, investors, and rating agencies collaborate rather than compete. By emphasizing credibility and transparency, Márquez reframes profitability as a product of shared trust. In doing so, Inteligencia Capital reinforces that sustainable growth depends on inclusion, the idea that when more players can participate, entire economies stabilize.

Together, International Disruption and Inteligencia Capital demonstrate how the region’s financial leaders are adapting to new pressures. Their strategies demonstrate that regulatory systems, often perceived as obstacles, can serve as levers for equitable development when combined with vision and technical precision.

Technology and operational change

If regulation defines the financial landscape, technology defines the future of every other industry in Latin America. Enterprises are moving beyond simple digital adoption toward structural transformation, where agility, decentralization, and co-creation shape how companies grow. As cloud computing, AI, and data-driven tools become more accessible, organizations are learning to integrate them not as isolated systems but as extensions of human potential. In doing so, they are proving that true digital maturity depends as much on culture as it does on code.

Collective technology consulting

In the technology consulting arena, Denis Genova San Juan, founder and chief executive of XalDigital, leads one of Mexico’s fastest-growing enterprise-technology firms. Established in 2017, the company approaches digital transformation as a collaborative process rather than a top-down service.

Genova’s teams begin every engagement by studying a client’s operational pain points before designing a single technical solution. This empathy-driven method, coupled with rigorous engineering, earned XalDigital recognition as Amazon Web Services’ first Premier Partner in Mexico. This credential underscores both scale and reliability.

Internally, the company operates through multidisciplinary “cells,” agile micro-teams that function like startups inside the organization. Each unit has autonomy to experiment, make decisions, and learn from rapid feedback loops. This structure enables XalDigital to sustain its entrepreneurial energy as it expands to over 200 employees across Latin America.

The company’s guiding approach links technological progress with human adaptability. XalDigital’s trajectory suggests that sustainable expansion relies on cultivating workplace cultures that value flexibility over hierarchy.

Software for a moving economy

That same philosophy extends to Jaime Calderón-Mátar, co-founder and chief executive of Nuvigant, an enterprise-software firm focused on operational intelligence. Nuvigant has developed integrated systems that help clients, from small manufacturers to hospitals, manage everything from accounting to logistics under one platform.

Calderón-Mátar’s approach emphasizes usability and speed. By embedding artificial intelligence tools into daily workflows, his company reduces hours-long processes to minutes, freeing organizations to focus on innovation rather than administration.

His leadership is marked by accessibility. Building genuine relationships with clients, he argues, transforms business exchanges into partnerships rooted in trust. Nuvigant’s flexible structure, shaped by his own experiences living and working across multiple countries, reinforces this principle: a company grows sustainably when it mirrors the diversity and mobility of the people it serves.

Together, XalDigital and Nuvigant highlight a regional shift from technology as infrastructure to technology as organizational identity. Latin American enterprises are not merely digitizing; they are restructuring operations to meet markets that move faster than regulation or tradition can accommodate.

Infrastructure, logistics, and regenerative models

Few sectors illustrate the balance between expansion and responsibility as clearly as infrastructure and logistics. In these fields, the pursuit of efficiency increasingly coexists with environmental awareness and regional integration. Across railways, mining, and transport, new business leaders are re-evaluating established models to ensure that economic progress supports, rather than strains, the ecosystems around it. The result is a more deliberate approach to infrastructure that values regeneration and education alongside construction and output.

Mining with a regenerative perspective

At Durango Corp, positions mining as a practice grounded in long-term stewardship rather than short-term extraction. His model combines geology, finance, and environmental science to create frameworks that generate value beyond production.

Berdegué’s professional background includes conservation projects in Africa, which informed his understanding of how resource management can support community stability. Applying those lessons to Latin America, he developed methodologies to assess success not only through production metrics but also by measuring social and environmental outcomes.

Durango Corp operates alongside related entities such as Pacifica Silver Corp and maintains advisory roles with international mining firms. Across these initiatives, Berdegué promotes transparency and accountability as integral components of profitability. In a region rich in minerals yet environmentally sensitive, this approach challenges traditional assumptions

[TITLE]European aerospace groups reach framework deal on satellite merger, sources say:
[TEXT]
ROME/PARIS :European aerospace groups Leonardo, Airbus and Thales have reached a framework deal on a proposed merger of their satellite businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Leonardo is scheduled to hold an extraordinary board meeting on Tuesday to discuss details of the deal, which is subject to board and regulatory approvals, one of the sources said.

Leonardo, Thales and Airbus declined to comment.

PROPOSED VENTURE AIMS TO COMPETE WITH ELON MUSK

Europe's largest satellite makers have been in talks for more than a year to create a new satellite manufacturing company to compete on a larger scale with rivals led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which owns the highly successful Starlink service.

Reuters reported last month that the three groups had redoubled efforts to combine their satellite businesses into a roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.66 billion) joint venture modelled on the pan-European MBDA missiles business.

Code-named "Project Bromo," talks had hit a roadblock over the summer when the parties could not agree on governance and valuation, insiders said.

One of the sources said the talks, which involve dividing politically sensitive technology and jobs between France and Italy, had not been helped by the government crisis in Paris.

Problems have also included disputes over the politically sensitive share of work, according to French daily La Tribune.

ANTI-TRUST REVIEW

The key remaining hurdle, analysts say, will be getting past a competition review by the European Commission.

Previous attempts to merge satellite activities in the past decade foundered on anti-trust concerns and national rivalries.

But the dramatic rise of Musk's Starlink network and a shift in the market towards cheaper satellites have increased pressure on Europe to combine assets or be pushed out of the market.

The deal could take up to two years to implement and the initial umbrella deal is the first step, sources familiar with the matter said. Last week, Thales denied a report that a sought-after provisional deal had been reached at that time.

Europe's top satellite makers have long competed to build complex spacecraft in geostationary orbit but have been hit by the arrival of cheap tiny satellites in low Earth orbit.

The deal will combine loss-making satellite activities of Airbus with those of Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio - two ventures currently controlled by France's Thales and Italian aerospace group Leonardo.

Paris-based consultancy Novaspace says more than 43,000 satellites will launch over the next decade, representing a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services.
