[TITLE]Amid DIY frenzy, Wealthy’s ₹130-cr fund raise fuels big bet on adviser-led wealth-tech:
[TEXT]
Even as DIY investing apps dominate headlines, a chunk of mutual fund money in India is still routed through human advisers. While popular investing apps such as Zerodha and Groww race to cut out middlemen, there is Wealthy that is making a contrarian, high‑stakes bet on keeping human advisers at the centre of India’s wealth‑technology (wealth‑tech) stack.

The Bengaluru-based startup has raised ₹130 crore in fresh funding, led by Bertelsmann India Investments, to deepen its artificial intelligence (AI)-led platform for mutual fund distributors (MFDs), with participation from existing investor Alphawave Global, new investor Shepherd’s Hill and a clutch of tech entrepreneurs.

Instead of going direct to consumers, Wealthy looks to sell software and AI tools to MFDs—independent mutual fund distributors who still intermediate roughly 80% of India’s retail equity wealth—so they can handle know-your-customer (KYC) checks, compliance and portfolio reviews faster, and sell investment products more efficiently while staying the primary advisers to their clients.

Rising investment flows

Over the past few years, household money flowing into financial assets has been rising steadily. Annual financial savings have climbed from

[TITLE]China Insight: Hitting 100 Million RMB in One Night — What Chicjoc Got Right:
[TEXT]
China’s Double 11 shopping period this year once again proved the scale of the country’s consumer market: online retail sales reached nearly 2.4 trillion yuan, or $337.69 billion, marking double-digit, year-over-year growth. While major platforms kept sales reports intentionally low-key, several breakout brands delivered performance that cut through the noise.

Among them was Chicjoc. Its “Super Fashion Launch 2.0,” a global livestream co-created with Taobao Clothing, ran for 30 continuous hours and generated more than 100 million yuan in sales — a milestone that has quickly become part of Double 11 lore.

The achievement offered a counterargument to recent pessimism

[TITLE]How Starbucks tried to quash union activity in Colorado:
[TEXT]
On Feb. 14, 2022, a Starbucks manager pulled Michaela Sellaro aside for a meeting.

Just a few weeks earlier, Sellaro and a group of her fellow baristas at the coffee shop at 2975 East Colfax Ave. in Denver informed the company’s CEO that they planned to organize a union.

In the early afternoon, at a table by the windows, the store and district managers sat Sellaro down for a chat. The message, though light and breezy, was clear: “You know Starbucks’ stance is that we don’t need a union to represent our partners,” Kaylin Driscoll, the district manager, told Sellaro, according to a recording reviewed by The Denver Post.

Relationships with leadership will degrade if employees vote to organize, the managers told her. Promotions could be nixed. Benefits might change.

“The dynamic of having those conversations will change with a union,” said Ariel Rodriguez, the store’s manager, in the recording. “I have no personal desire to be part of a store that has to work through a union to have those conversations with you. I have zero interest in that.”

The East Colfax store, which the company has since closed, represents one of 18 Starbucks cafes in Colorado that have unionized since 2022, despite the Seattle-based coffee giant’s well-documented union-busting activity. What started with one unionized store in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 has blossomed into a nationwide movement encompassing 640 locations and thousands of workers around the United States.

Starbucks has nearly 18,300 locations, company-operated and licensed, across the U.S. and Canada. So far, despite the rapid growth in organizing, fewer than 4% of Starbucks workers are employed in unionized stores.

Starbucks has fought these efforts tooth and nail along the way. The National Labor Relations Board, which regulates private sector union activity in the U.S., has found the company illegally fired workers in response to organizing, closed stores because of union votes and engaged in widespread unfair labor practices designed to quash workers’ efforts.

The coffee conglomerate is the biggest violator of labor law in modern history, according to Starbucks Workers United, the national union representing company workers. The NLRB and its judges have found Starbucks has committed more than 500 labor law violations, the union says. Workers have filed more than 1,000 unfair labor practice charges, including more than 125 since January. More than 700 unresolved charges remain.

Despite the hundreds of union votes over the past four years, baristas are still working without a contract. This month, 92% of union workers voted to authorize an open-ended unfair labor practices strike ahead of the holiday season. The vote comes after six months of Starbucks “refusing to offer new proposals to address workers’ demands for better staffing, higher pay and a resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges,” the union said in a news release.

On Nov. 13, more than 1,000 workers — from 65 stores in more than 40 cities, including Colorado Springs and Lafayette — walked off the job. The union said it was “prepared to continue escalating” its strikes if the company failed to deliver a new contract.

“Union baristas mean business and are ready to do whatever it takes to win a fair contract and end Starbucks’ unfair labor practices,” said Michelle Eisen, a Starbucks Workers United spokesperson and 15-year veteran barista. “We want Starbucks to succeed, but turning the company around and bringing customers back begins with listening to and supporting the baristas who are responsible for the Starbucks experience.

“If Starbucks keeps stonewalling, they should expect to see their business grind to a halt. The ball is in Starbucks’ court.”

The union’s push comes amid a wave of public support for organizing efforts. More than two-thirds of American adults approve of labor unions, according to Gallup polling, a level last reached in the 1950s and early 1960s. Support remains especially strong among young people — a demographic common for Starbucks baristas.

Starbucks representatives declined an interview request for this story. Sara Kelly, Starbucks’ chief partner officer, told employees in a letter this month that the company had bargained in good faith with the union, reaching more than 30 tentative agreements on full contract articles.

“Our commitment to bargaining hasn’t changed,” Kelly wrote. “Workers United walked away from the table, but if they are ready to come back, we’re ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal.”

Starbucks, she said, remains the best job in retail, paying, on average, $30 per hour for hourly workers once benefits are factored in.

The first Colorado union shop

But employees at Colorado’s first unionized cafe quickly learned the extent to which Starbucks would go to dissuade organizing efforts.

It was 2021, and Len Harris, a shift supervisor at a Starbucks location in Superior, had just seen news of baristas in Buffalo forming the company’s first union in the United States.

[TITLE]WMT Stock Price Prediction: Where Walmart Could Be by 2025, 2026, and 2030:
[TEXT]
Walmart's resilience is fueled by the expansion of its omnichannel platform, which blends in-store shopping, curbside pickup, home delivery and a rapidly growing e-commerce presence. Membership and subscription efforts, along with international expansion, add further diversification. At the same time, Walmart's global sourcing footprint makes it highly sensitive to tariff changes. Any escalation in trade barriers or import costs can pressure margins and test the limits of its everyday-low-price strategy, introducing additional uncertainty for the stock.

Its premium valuation, reflected in a trailing P/E noticeably higher than historic retailer averages, suggests investors are willing to pay up for Walmart's earnings resilience and cash flow consistency. The share price has tended to move within a broader 79 to 109 dollar band, with periodic bouts of volatility as the market digests macro headlines and sector rotation.

Walmart currently trades just above 107 dollars as of October 2025, sitting not far below its all-time high from earlier in the year and comfortably above last year's bottom near 72 dollars. The stock has climbed steadily over the past twelve months, delivering more than a 29 percent return in a retail environment still dealing with inflation, shifting consumer habits and uneven discretionary spending.

Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT ), the world's largest retailer and a key pillar of both the U.S. and global economy, is juggling uncertain consumer demand, rapid digital transformation and intense competition in 2025. Thanks to its scale and reach, the company offers a mix of defensive stability and exposure to ongoing retail innovation, making it a frequent core holding in diversified portfolios.

Analysts are saying that Walmart could hit 82 dollars by 2030, a long-term price target that has both growth and income investors paying close attention to WMT's next decade. If you're bullish on Walmart and looking for a low-friction way to buy shares, SoFi lets you trade Walmart stock with zero commissions, and new users who fund their account can receive up to 1,000 dollars in stock . Investors who transfer their portfolio to SoFi and keep it there until December 31, 2025 can also earn a 1 percent bonus, adding a little extra tailwind to any long-term WMT position.

Analyst sentiment is generally positive. According to Benzinga, 29 of 42 analysts rate Walmart as Buy or Outperform, emphasizing its digital execution, scale advantages and defensive qualities. Targets like 129 dollars from Wolfe Research and 91 dollars from Stifel highlight differing views on valuation, with several firms pointing to elevated multiples and thin margins as reasons to temper expectations unless earnings growth or margin expansion accelerate meaningfully.

These ranges are based on CoinCodex's algorithmic models, which rely on historical price behavior, volatility trends and long-term moving averages to estimate potential paths for the stock.

Bull & Bear Case

Bull Case

The bullish view on Walmart starts with its dominant scale and omnichannel strategy. The company continues to grow global e-commerce sales while leveraging its massive store base for fulfillment, pickup and last-mile delivery, strengthening customer loyalty and helping to support digital margins over time. Market share gains in grocery, health, and international operations provide additional earnings support, especially during economic slowdowns when value-focused consumers trade down. Strategic investments in automation, logistics, and AI-driven inventory management are designed to reduce costs, improve in-stock levels and enhance the overall shopping experience, reinforcing Walmart's competitive edge. For defensive investors, the company's consistent dividend, large cash flows and broad product mix make it a reliable anchor in times of uncertainty.

Bear Case

The bear case emphasizes valuation, macro risks and intense competition. Near-term technical readings from CoinCodex point to a cautious backdrop, with only

Britain's finance ministry said on Friday that finance minister Rachel Reeves plans to raise around 500 million pounds ($655 million) a year by removing an exemption from tariffs for imports of individual goods costing under 135 pounds.Reeves has pledged not to increase the cost of living for British households in her annual budget on November 26, but retailers such as clothing chain Next and rival Primark-owner Associated British Foods have lobbied against what they see as unfair competition from overseas stores.While major retailers must pay tariffs on many goods they import in bulk, Britons who buy similar items direct from online retailers, often based in China, do not have to pay tariffs if they cost below a certain amount."It's time to make sure our local shops can compete fairly with overseas sellers and keep driving growth and good jobs across the UK," Reeves said in a statement.The finance ministry said that Reeves planned to scrap the exemption for imports of low-value items in her budget and launch a consultation on how to implement the new customs arrangements."Any impact on consumer prices will be modest," the finance ministry said.Reeves' actions follow in the footsteps of U.S. President Donald Trump - who scrapped tariff exemptions on imports worth under $800 in August - and the EU is bringing forward similar plans for imports worth under 150 euros ($172.65)."This move closes a loophole that has disadvantaged British business, damaged British high streets and allowed proper safety standards to be ignored and we hope it is implemented rapidly," ABF chief executive George Weston said in a statement alongside the finance ministry announcement.

[TITLE]Inside Crocs marketing: What they do differently on social media (and why it works):
[TEXT]
If there’s any brand that understands the power of the comeback, it’s Crocs. Its most recognizable product—lightweight, perforated clogs—were a fashion staple in the early to mid-2000s. However, the fallout from the 2008 global recession paired with overproduction left the American footwear business in a precarious state.

But nearly 20 years later, Crocs has emerged stronger than ever.

With the help of a new executive team and a refreshed marketing strategy (including social media marketing), Crocs increased its annual global revenue from $1.2 billion in 2014 to $4.1 billion in 2024.

The number of Crocs stores worldwide also hit its highest point in seven years as of 2024, with a total of 390 stores. Although the United States has the highest proportion of Crocs storefronts, the brand has expanded globally, with most of its international retail shops in South Korea (95), China (51) and Japan (21).

Crocs’ revival is undeniably impressive, and its social strategy has been a driving force in its overall marketing success.

In this guide, we’ll break down Crocs’ approach to social media and what you can learn from it.

Crocs’ marketing strategy is embedded in their brand ethos

NI businesses to get more than £16m in post-Brexit trade support

1 day ago Share Save Jayne McCormack BBC News NI political correspondent Share Save

Reuters Rachel Reeves will announce the details of the Budget on Wednesday

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce more than £16m to support businesses in Northern Ireland dealing with post-Brexit trade rules when she reveals her Budget later this week. The Windsor Framework was agreed between the UK and EU in 2023 and effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. Earlier this month, a report by an independent panel found the government's Windsor Framework guidance for businesses is "not fit for purpose". The government has said the financial package, to be officially announced on Wednesday as part of the Autumn Budget, will provide a "single point of contact" to solve disputes and guide businesses on trading in NI.

'Ridiculous scenario'

DUP assembly member Phillip Brett said the fact the government is providing more funding was "yet again a justification for the stance taken by unionists" in opposing the Windsor Framework. "£16m of funding will not remove the requirement for SPS checks, £16m in funding will not remove the ridiculous scenario that all goods moving from GB into NI are automatically treated as at risk," he added.

What is in the package?

The package comes months after recommendations from an independent review of the Windsor Framework, led by Lord Murphy. According to the Treasury, the package builds on that report's findings and will allow for: The creation of a Northern Ireland business concierge and trade resolution centre to sort out complex disputes

New Delhi: The government is expected to raise the minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar - after a nearly seven-year pause -by nearly 23% to ₹38 per kg, said people aware of the matter.The Centre could also increase ethanol procurement price for sugarcane-based feedstock, the people said.The steps would follow the Centre clearing the export of 1.5 million tonnes of sugar for the 2025-26 season (October-September).The government has maintained the MSP of sugar at ₹31 per kg since February 2019. The industry has been pushing for an increase in the price, citing higher production costs. An increase in MSP will boost liquidity for sugar mills, helping them pay cane farmers."In accordance with Section 9 of the Sugar (Control) Order, 2025, and considering the 4.42% increase in FRP (Fair and Remunerative Price) along with the rise in inflation-linked input costs, revision of the Sugar MSP to ₹41 per kg is both justified and logical," the National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories said in a letter to union minister for food and public distribution Pralhad Joshi.Status quo on ethanol prices adversely affects the ability of mills to meet cane payment obligations, especially when FRP and other input costs are continuing to rise, the industry body said, in the letter.Ethanol revenues contribute more than 20% of the total cane price payable to farmers. Prices for ethanol produced from B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice or syrup have remained unchanged since ESY /add full form/ 2022-23.

[TITLE]Trump’s Tariffs Don’t Help Workers. Labor Solidarity Across Borders Does.:
[TEXT]
Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today!

The Trump administration’s sprawling new tariffs took effect in August, and U.S. consumers are starting to feel the heat. The president and his cabinet have said the tariffs will bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and put American workers first. But are these tariff policies a real solution to the “race to the bottom” that has undercut so many U.S. jobs? Nike, the world’s single largest athletic apparel and footwear brand and an iconic American company, is a prime example of how Trump’s tariffs will actually hurt workers in the U.S. and abroad.

Even with higher tariffs than those implemented, American workers cannot compete with the current wages in Nike’s global supply chain. Many garment workers make Nike products for below $1 per hour in South and Southeast Asia, where the brand’s production is concentrated. In the lead up to August, Nike and other U.S.-based garment giants showed little interest in onshoring jobs. Instead, Nike has already begun to pass the cost of tariffs onto working people in the U.S. by increasing prices for consumers, who already face an affordability crisis. Meanwhile, garment workers reported Nike supplier factories enforcing mandatory overtime and anticipating mass layoffs ahead of the tariffs coming into effect.

By targeting countries, rather than corporations, Trump deliberately misidentifies the culprits of the global “race to the bottom.” Global corporations like Nike have pursued profit at any cost, which has undercut American jobs and pushed countries around the world to compete for industry by offering their citizens’ labor to companies like Nike for the lowest possible price. These tariffs don’t change that. Instead, Trump’s tariffs follow the consistent model of his administration: use the authority of the United States government to empower corporations and billionaires. Trump’s tariffs will do nothing to prevent corporations like Nike from pursuing higher profits at the expense of workers at home and abroad.

Nike Profited From the COVID Crisis

Nike showed us its playbook on how to profit from crises during the COVID pandemic in 2020. When COVID began, clothing and footwear corporations canceled and paused orders to factories in their supply chains with no plan for the impact on the millions of workers, the vast majority women, who make their products. Garment workers in South and Southeast Asia saw their already low wages slashed, many facing months of layoff with no income and no safety net. Women workers reported eating one meal a day and taking on crippling debt. Meanwhile, Nike bounced right back and made record profits by 2021. From 2020 to 2021, Nike’s billionaire founder Phil Knight’s family grew its wealth by $20 billion. In 2022, Nike authorized a new $18 billion share buyback program, benefitting investors.

Garment workers never saw any of Nike’s pandemic-era profits returned to them, despite repeated demands by their unions. If Nike had returned the $18 billion it is spending on buybacks to workers instead, it could offer a $125 per month raise to every garment worker who makes Nike products for 10 years — doubling the wages of many and transforming the lives of a million families.

Nike’s greed is not limited to its supply chain workers in the Global South. The company has announced two rounds of U.S. staff layoffs since February to reduce labor costs. And just this month, it ended a pandemic-era “wellness week” for its workers in order to increase productivity.

The company is also hoarding profits at the cost of public benefits to working people in Oregon, where Nike is headquartered. The company struck a favorable state income tax deal in 2012 that locked in a low tax rate and has paid no federal income tax in the U.S. for years. In the aftermath of Nike’s success in lobbying for continued low state taxes — which are paid into Oregon’s General Fund, which provides two-thirds of education funding for Oregon public schools — Oregon public education faces a budget crisis that has worsened in recent years, putting at risk critical resources for students and leading to cuts in teachers’ jobs. The taxes that Nike should have paid could go a long way toward funding Oregon public school budgets and avoiding further cuts.

The COVID pandemic previewed how Nike is again poised to profit at the expense of working people from Oregon to Cambodia, as Trump’s tariffs bring a new industry disruption. But another way forward is brewing, and it’s not coming from the White House.

Workers Are Coming Together Across Borders

In the aftermath of Nike’s grotesque show of greed, thousands of unionized garment workers from across South and Southeast Asia have come together to demand wage increases and labor rights protections from Nike, organized by Asia Floor Wage Alliance and supported by Global Labor Justice. These workers have been educating each other and finding common cause with unions across the U.S., especially in Nike’s home state of Oregon, in an example of what’s possible when working people unite across borders to challenge corporate power.

A recent action in Beaverton, Oregon, might be a blueprint for the labor movement’s broader fight for a truly fair global economy. On May 28, three Indonesian union garment worker activists walked into Nike’s corporate headquarters. The brave worker activists, who represent tens of thousands of Asian garment workers, wanted to be seen and heard directly by the company’s top executives. They were joined by leaders from the Portland Association of Teachers and other allied unions angry over Nike’s contribution to the underfunding of public schools. Together they were kicked out but vowed to continue their fights together until Asian garment workers and Oregon teachers and students take back their share of the money Nike has hoarded.

The next day, the same garment worker activists held a protest with the Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation (GTFF) outside of Hayward Field track and field stadium at the University of Oregon. The $270 million renovation of Hayward Field in 2020 is one of many vanity projects funded by Nike founder Phil Knight at the University of Oregon, but one with particularly offensive timing — it was undertaken at the same moment hundreds of thousands of Nike supply chain workers lost their livelihoods without any support from the company.

GTFF pointed out how Knight’s massive donations, made possible through years of profiting from the work of underpaid garment workers, have reshaped the priorities of the public University of Oregon, where the union is fighting for decent conditions and a democratic voice. New buildings named for the Knight family have popped up throughout the University of Oregon campus in recent years even as the administration cuts jobs to address deficits. Moving forward, Nike supply chain workers and their allies in the labor movement in Oregon and across the United States are evaluating how they can take united action to hold Nike accountable for its role in both local and global inequality.

Beyond Oregon, the women garment workers leading the Fight the Heist campaign have found strong allies with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), a constituency organization within the AFL-CIO devoted to building women’s leadership in unions. CLUW and CWA’s Women’s Committee led nationally-coordinated protests outside of Nike stores and events last year. More recently, the CLUW chapter in New York City has been publicly calling on Nike board member Michelle Peluso, the Revlon CEO, to meet directly with women garment workers and their unions in Asia.

[TITLE]Labour codes: A game changer for the Indian economy:

The long-awaited labour codes announced by the Government of India represent a truly big-bang reform. For decades, labour regulation in the country was guided by a multiplicity of out-dated laws, many of them dating back to pre-independence era. Reforming this ‘fragmented framework’ had become an economic imperative. Reducing the number of labour laws and enforcement authorities, and aligning the overall regulatory ecosystem with present-day economic scenario, has been the main objective of the new labour codes.As such, the labour codes are expected to enhance the welfare of the workers and improve social security coverage for the informal workforce. For businesses, they aim to simplify procedures, reduce compliance burden, and decriminalize minor offences, among other improvements.From the perspective of industry, a critical question at this stage is: following the introduction of labour codes, how competitive is the Indian economy compared to peer nations such as Brazil, China, S Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand? While overall competitiveness depends on reforms across multiple domains - including land, labour, infrastructure, power, logistics and the cost of capital – the availability of skilled, efficient, and cost-effective labour force remains central to both the ease and cost of doing business.Labour law regulations and compliances in India have long been viewed as burdensome for investors and industry. Multiple licenses, registrations and return filings have often been cited by industry as contributing to this burden. The newly introduced labour reforms seek to streamline these processes through several measures, including single registration, single license, and single return for businesses; uniformity in definitions; greater flexibility to States to prescribe thresholds for lay-offs or retrenchments when required. Additionally, the provision for fixed-term employment (FTE) allows firms to hire workers based on evolving needs without fear of future legal complications. Taken together, these changes are expected to enhance competitiveness for Indian businesses.Given the comprehensive nature of the labour codes, and assuming effective implementation, India can anticipate increased investment, greater job-creation, and improved labour productivity. Although the requirement to extend social security coverage may raise the cost of business for firms in the short term, these can be expected to be offset over time through higher labour productivity, improved ability of the firms to attract talent, and enhanced hiring flexibility – all of which contribute to greater cost-efficiency in production.Overtime work regulations across countries constitute another factor in assessing labour-related competitiveness. The Economic Survey 2024-25 provides a comparative picture: India (Union) permits 75 hours of overtime per quarter, while the best performing State, Telangana, allows 156 hours. In comparison, Indonesia permits 182 hours, S Korea 156 hours, Vietnam 120 hours, Malaysia 312 hours, and Japan 240 hours. Under the labour codes, Indian States have the flexibility to determine their own quarterly overtime limits.This flexibility to raise overtime ceilings has the potential to reduce the cost, time and operational risks faced by Indian firms, while enabling them to reap greater economies of scale. It can also support the growth of smaller firms, while helping businesses fulfil seasonal export orders, and provide workers with the opportunity to earn more. Higher earnings, in turn, can strengthen household purchasing power and stimulate consumption demand within the economy.The combined advantages of flexible hiring under fixed-term employment (FTE), and higher permissible overtime limits will be especially beneficial for labour-intensive, export-oriented firms that receive seasonal orders, such as in garments, apparel, and textiles. Similarly, export-focussed businesses that deal in high value items, such as gems and jewellery, would gain from the ability to hire skilled workers with greater flexibility.Further, leveraging new age technology to simplify compliance for businesses and for timely payment of wages, will enhance transparency and accountability in enforcement, while reducing operational costs for businesses. Industry experts note that India is competitively positioned on the labour-related parameters – such as minimum wage rates, permissible working hours, and mechanisms for dispute resolution – when compared with countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Positive outcomes are likely, if States implement the rules in a standardized manner that aligns with the spirit of the labour codes.Labour codes bode well for India’s prospects of attracting larger volumes of domestic and foreign investments into manufacturing and services. They are expected to strengthen resilient supply chains, deepen integration with global value chains (GVCs), nurture globally competitive manufacturing, and enable the adoption of technology by firms in administrative operations. The reforms also hold significant promise for building a resilient, skilled, more productive labour force.At the same time, for India’s GDP to grow at 10 percent and more annually, major states and high-growth sectors will need to deliver on the promise of even higher growth trajectories. Achieving this would require continued reforms, improved infrastructure and logistics, enhanced facilities within industrial clusters - including residential dormitories for workers - better access to technology and markets for MSMEs, and deeper specialisation among Indian businesses to strengthen their presence in global markets.

[TITLE]China Insight: Hitting 100 Million RMB in One Night — What Chicjoc Got Right:
[TEXT]
China’s Double 11 shopping period this year once again proved the scale of the country’s consumer market: online retail sales reached nearly 2.4 trillion yuan, or $337.69 billion, marking double-digit, year-over-year growth. While major platforms kept sales reports intentionally low-key, several breakout brands delivered performance that cut through the noise.

Among them was Chicjoc. Its “Super Fashion Launch 2.0,” a global livestream co-created with Taobao Clothing, ran for 30 continuous hours and generated more than 100 million yuan in sales — a milestone that has quickly become part of Double 11 lore.

The achievement offered a counterargument to recent pessimism

[TITLE]ITC’s growth recipe for 24 Mantra Organic: Strengthening portfolio, growing exports:
[TEXT]
Diversified conglomerate ITC Ltd is strengthening its organic food products portfolio and widening its distribution network across the country for the ‘24 Mantra Organic’ brand to grab a bigger slice of India’s ₹10,000-crore organic food products market.

Moreover, the Sanjiv Puri-led conglomerate is looking beyond the US to augment export of the organic products under this brand to Europe and other important overseas markets, as it acquired organic packaged food maker Sresta Natural Bioproducts earlier this year to expand its future ready portfolio for its non-cigarette FMCG business.

The domestic organic food products market, of which the packaged food market is estimated at around ₹3000 crore, has been growing between 15 per cent and 20 per cent annually. However, penetration in the country stands at only 0.3 per cent against the global average of 3.5-4 per cent.

“So the headroom for growth is immense which made this space interesting for us. One of the reasons for pursuing acquisitions is that it allows us to acquire a lot of capabilities which are currently not there or will take time to develop on our own,” Anuj Kumar Rustagi, Chief Executive, - Staples, Foods Division, ITC Ltd, told businessline.

As part of the ITC Next Strategy, which explores new horizons of growth and profitability for each business, the Kolkata-headquartered conglomerate has been exploring new vectors of growth in several emerging lifestyle-focused foods segments.

“We strongly believe that ITC’s enterprise strengths in agri sourcing, R&D, agile product development, integrated manufacturing, digital infrastructure and omni- channel distribution network will help in taking 24 Mantra Organic to millions of more homes not only in India but across the world, improve farmer livelihoods and most importantly, mainstream organic food among consumers,” said Rajashekar Reddy Seelam, Founder & MD, Sresta Natural Bioproducts.

Currently, 24 Mantra Organic has a wide range of over 100 products spanning branded grocery staples, spices and condiments, edible oils, and beverages. Around 50 per cent of its revenue comes from international business, primarily the US, where it has its own distribution set up and presence in over 900 ethnic stores.

At the backend, it has a strong network of over 27,000 farmers and around 1.4 lakh acres of certified organic farmland across 71 clusters in 10 States with Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan being the top four for it.

“Our first priority is to focus on the existing categories and grow them because even within those segments, there is a huge opportunity to expand. If we can grow the market by increasing penetration, then the addressable market alone will be significantly higher. So, the thrust is to accelerate growth of the pie, given the growing consumer preference for organic food which is today a lifestyle segment,” Rustagi said.

By leveraging ITC’s institutional strengths, the business has a significantly greater opportunity for growth. There are some products 24 Mantra organic has launched which are either currently in very small test markets or catering to the export market. “For example, organic frozen products and ethnic snacks are being sold in the US, but not in India. And therefore, that presents yet another opportunity,” Chief Executive pointed out.

The other area which the brand is working on is going up the processed food value chain. A large part of the portfolio is in the staples segment. According to Rustagi, even in a very basic thing like traditional Indian sweets in the form of Chikki, the addressable market is very huge because a lot of these offerings are still an unorganized play. The thrust is to grow the innovative existing portfolio within India.

ITC is also looking to grow exports in existing overseas markets and enter new markets like Europe and Canada with the organic product portfolio going forward. Export is a big growth vector for 24 Mantra Organic.

“Our focus is now to grow in the US this year with the current range of organic frozen products. 24 Mantra Organic has a large presence in the US and Gulf countries. However, there are other overseas markets which have a significant potential for organic products. About 25-30 per cent of the global organic market is in Europe. But the brand is yet to foray into those markets. So Canada, Southeast Asia and the Middle East are quite big opportunities, reflecting a big scope to expand to international markets,” Rustagi said.

In the domestic market, the brand has presence in all the major cities of all the States. But its endeavour is to build depth and width within cities.

For the organic products, the distribution dynamics is rapidly changing. At the beginning of this year, contributions from all the channels--general trade (GT), modern trade and e-commerce-- in terms of sales were equal. Now, e-commerce is becoming the biggest channel for organic products, contributing 40-50 per cent of total sales.

“Our objective is to double our footprint in the General Trade channel over the next three years. We are leveraging our omni-channel distribution network. We also have implemented digital technologies to be able to identify the areas of expansion. We are accelerating our digital capabilities,” Rustagi informed.

The headquarters of 24 Mantra Organic continues to be in Hyderabad.

“The capable team has full freedom to operate with the support of ITC’s institutional resources, in line with our philosophy of distributed leadership. That is the approach which we take for startups that work with us. That is our institutional culture and philosophy which makes us effective as an organisation,” Rustagi emphasised.
