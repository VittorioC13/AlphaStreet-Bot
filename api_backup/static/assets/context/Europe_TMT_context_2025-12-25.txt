[TITLE]Hungary’s 4iG Makes Historic $100M Investment in U.S. Space Firm Axiom: ‘Giant Leap’ for Bilateral Ties:
[TEXT]
A Hungarian technology firm is making what its chairman called a “giant leap” for bilateral cooperation after committing $100 million to a leading U.S. commercial space company, marking the first time a Hungarian enterprise has taken an ownership stake in a major American space player.

Budapest-based 4iG announced Friday that its space and defense subsidiary had signed a definitive agreement to become an anchor investor in Houston-based Axiom Space, committing $30 million by the end of 2025 and an additional $70 million by March 31, 2026.

The two-step investment, disclosed in a capital-market filing, represents a historic milestone in U.S.–Hungarian space cooperation and positions Hungary inside the rapidly expanding commercial space ecosystem, including low Earth orbit infrastructure, microgravity research, and space-based data services.

“This collaboration is of historic significance for the Hungarian space industry, as it marks the first time a Hungarian company participates as an owner of a U.S. space player,” said Gellért Jászai, chairman of 4iG, adding that Axiom is developing “revolutionary technological solutions that are fundamentally transforming the commercial space sector and setting the direction for developments in the coming decades.”

Jászai said the investment reflects Hungary’s growing role in the global space economy and underscores the strengthening ties between Budapest and Washington.

Under the agreement, 4iG Space and Defence Technologies will gain long-term access to space-based data processing, orbital communications, and industrial research programs conducted in microgravity environments — a core pillar of the company’s strategy to become a leading international player in space and defense technologies.

In a separate statement posted on social media, Jászai described the deal as the culmination of a deliberate push to deepen U.S. ties over the past year, calling the Axiom investment “a new chapter” for Hungarian-American cooperation and “a giant leap for 4iG.”

For Axiom Space, the investment brings in a European industrial partner as the company accelerates development of Axiom Station, the world’s first commercial space station designed to eventually succeed the International Space Station.

“We’re excited to welcome 4iG Space and Defence as an investor in Axiom Space at such a pivotal moment for commercial space,” said Kam Ghaffarian, executive chairman of Axiom Space. He said the partnership aligns with Axiom’s vision for global space infrastructure and will strengthen innovation in microgravity research, data processing, and space commercialization.

Axiom Space already plays a central role in Hungary’s space ambitions. The company is responsible for flying Hungary’s second astronaut, Tibor Kapu, as part of the HUNOR — Hungarian to Orbit — program, marking a milestone in the country’s human spaceflight history.

The agreement also builds on earlier cooperation between the two firms, including joint work on orbital data center technologies and low Earth orbit services — areas increasingly viewed as critical to the next phase of the commercial space economy.

The investment follows renewed optimism in Budapest about the trajectory of U.S.–Hungarian relations under President Donald Trump. In a December 2024 exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister Levente Magyar said Hungary expected a “new era” of economic and strategic cooperation with Washington after years of strained ties under the Biden administration.

Magyar underscored Hungary’s reliance on trade, openness to investment, and ambition to serve as a bridge between East and West — themes now reflected in 4iG’s expansion into the U.S. space sector.

With the first tranche set to close by the end of 2025, both companies have framed the deal as a long-term strategic alignment rather than a one-off financial transaction — signaling Hungary’s arrival as a serious player in the commercial space race and sharpening the technological partnership between Budapest and Washington.

[TITLE]SEC Files Complaint Against Crypto Exchanges In $14 Million Fraud Scheme:
[TEXT]
Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by pro-crypto chair Paul Atkins, has filed a significant complaint against a network of alleged crypto exchanges and online investment clubs accused of defrauding victims out of $14 million.

Major Crypto Scam Complaint

The complaint, which was filed in Colorado, identifies four entities that were operating under the guise of investment clubs and primarily used the popular social media app WhatsApp for communication.

The regulator alleges that these clubs falsely presented themselves as being managed by experienced financial professionals, offering what they claimed were valuable investment insights.

Participants were encouraged to invest in three purported crypto trading platforms, described as providing “security token offerings,” which they misleadingly likened to initial public offerings of legitimate company shares.

However, the Securities and Exchange Commission contends that those who bought into these so-called crypto investments were merely handing their money over to con artists.

“This was an elaborate confidence scam,” stated the SEC in its complaint, emphasizing that the investors’ assets were never invested as promised but were misappropriated from the very beginning.

Among the accused, one investment club, AI Investment Education, was registered with the SEC as an investment advisory firm. However, a phone number associated with the firm is currently out of service, and the regulatory filing indicated that it had no assets under management.

The other investment clubs named in the complaint include AI Wealth, Lane Wealth, and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation. The accused crypto trading platforms are Morocoin Tech, Berge Blockchain Technology, and Cirkor.

SEC Details Multistep Scheme

The scammers allegedly lured participants with promises of artificial intelligence-generated investment tips. Victims were persuaded to fund accounts on the fake trading platforms, which were falsely claimed to possess government licenses.

To expand their fraudulent agenda, the scammers implemented a tactic whereby victims wishing to withdraw their funds were required to pay fees upfront. According to the complaint, no withdrawal requests were ever fulfilled.

The SEC reports that the $14 million disappeared overseas, funneled through a complex web of bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.

Laura D’Allaird, the chief of the SEC’s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, asserts that this case exemplifies a prevalent type of confidence scheme targeting investors and leading to “devastating consequences.” D’Allaird elaborated on the mechanics of the fraud, stating”

Our complaint alleges a multistep fraud that attracted victims through social media advertisements, built trust in group chats where fraudsters posed as financial professionals, and ultimately led victims to invest their money into nonexistent crypto asset trading platforms where it was misappropriated.

[TITLE]China’s mineral dominance gives Western magnet makers a moment in the sun:
[TEXT]

Rare earth magnet makers are having a moment as Western nations scramble to build domestic "mine-to-magnet" supply chains and reduce their dependence on China. A turbulent year of supply restrictions and tariff threats has thrust the strategic importance of magnet manufacturers firmly into the spotlight, with rare earths surging toward the top of the agenda amid the U.S. and China's ongoing geopolitical rivalry. Magnets made from rare earths are vital components for everything from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones to medical equipment, artificial intelligence applications, and precision weaponry. It's in this context that the U.S., European Union and Australia, among others, have sought to break China's mineral dominance by taking a series of strategic measures to support magnet makers, including heavily investing in factories, supporting the buildout of new plants, and boosting processing capacity. The U.S. and Europe, in particular, are expected to emerge as key growth markets for rare earth magnet production over the next decade. Analysts, however, remain skeptical that Western nations will be able to escape China's mineral orbit anytime soon. "Frankly, we were the solution to the problem that the world didn't know it had," Rahim Suleman, CEO of Canadian group Neo Performance Materials, told CNBC by video call.

"The end-market is growing from the point of physics, not software, so therefore it has to grow in this way," he continued. "And it's not dependent on any single end market, so it's not dependent on automotive or battery electric vehicles or drones or wind farms. It's any energy-efficient motor across the spectrum," Suleman said, referring to the demand for magnets from fast-growing industries such as robotics. His comments came around three months after Neo launched the grand opening of its rare earth magnet factory in Narva, Estonia. Situated directly on Russia's doorstep, the facility is widely expected to play an integral role in Europe's plan to reduce its dependence on China. European Union industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, for example, lauded the plant's strategic importance, saying at an event in early December that the project marked "a high point of Europe's sovereignty."

Neo's Suleman said the Estonian facility is on track to produce 2,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets this year, before scaling up to 5,000 tons and beyond. "Globally, the market is 250,000 tons and going to 600,000 tons, so more than doubling in ten years," Suleman said. "And more importantly, our concentration is 93% in a single jurisdiction, so when you put those two factors together, I think you'll find an enormously quick growing market."

To be sure, the global supply of rare earths has long been dominated by Beijing. China is responsible for nearly 60% of the world's rare earths mining and more than 90% of magnet manufacturing, according to the International Energy Agency. A recent report from consultancy IDTechEx estimated that rare earth magnet capacity in the U.S. is on track to grow nearly six times by 2036, with the expansion driven by strategic support and funding from the Department of Defense, as well as increasing midstream activity. Magnet production in Europe, meanwhile, was forecast to grow 3.1 times over the same time period, bolstered by the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims for domestic production to satisfy 40% of the region's demand by 2030.

John Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina-based rare earth magnet producer, told CNBC that the company is seeking to scale up as fast as possible "so that this fundamental supply chain doesn't hold America back." Vulcan Elements is one of the companies to have received direct funding from the Trump administration. The magnet maker received a $620 million direct federal loan last month from the Department of Defense to support domestic magnet production. "Rare earth magnets convert electricity into motion, which means that virtually all advanced machines and technologies—the innovations that shape our daily lives and keep us safe—require them in order to be operational," Maslin told CNBC by email. "The need for high-performance magnets is accelerating exponentially amid a surge in demand and production of advanced technologies, including hard disk drives, semiconductor fabrication equipment, hybrid/electric motors, satellites, aircraft, drones, and almost every military capability," he added.

[TITLE]AMCS losses triple to €60m as it books costs linked to takeover:
[TEXT]
Revenues soared in 2024 at Limerick-based tech firm

Limerick-based tech firm Advanced Manufacturing Control Systems (AMCS) saw its losses almost triple to €60.4m last year as it incurred a total of €45m in transactions associated with the sale of a majority stake in the business in November 2024.

Last year, Swedish private equity firm EQT bought a majority stake in AMCS in a deal that valued the Irish company at €2.1bn.

The Irish business, which employs more than 1,200 people, is a supplier of cloud-based AI-enabled planning, performance and safety software that is used in the waste management and recycling sectors, as well as in other resource-intensive industries.

As part of the deal with EQT, AMCS co-founder and CEO Jimmy Martin, management and other existing investors, including Insight Partners, Clearlake Capital, Highland Europe and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, all retained minority stakes.

Newly-filed accounts for AMCS show that turnover jumped to €68.3m last year from €56.5m in 2023.

Recently-filed accounts for the group holding company, Arctic Topco, note that AMCS delivered a “robust financial performance” in 2024, underpinned by what it said was impressive growth in both annual recurring revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), “signalling sustained momentum and operational discipline”.

The adjusted Ebitda for AMCS last year was €7.9m. That was a 47pc increase compared to 2023. The adjusted figure excludes foreign exchange gains and losses and includes the margin on revenues flowing through from opening deferred revenue on acquisitions made during the year.

AMCS reported a 15pc year-on-year increase in annual recurring revenue (ARR) last year, reflecting new customer acquisition, high retention rates and strong upsell activity within its existing customer base.

“This surge in recurring revenue underscores the resilience of AMCS’ business model and the value of its solutions provided in the market,” note the Arctic Topco accounts.

Those accounts note that the margin improvement seen during 2024 reflects disciplined cost management, optimised sales and marketing spend, and increasing operating leverage as the business grows.

“With a strong ARR base and improving Ebitda margins, AMCS is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory,” they added.

Last year, AMCS acquired US-based solutions provider Qv21 Technologies. Qv21 Technologies is a software service solutions provider for short-haul, bulk commodity transportation.

In April this year, AMCS acquired Selected Interventions and Mandalay Technologies. Selected Interventions is a UK-based, global resource management software company and Mandalay Technologies is an Australia-headquartered provider of modular cloud-based weighbridge and data management solutions.

From an uncertain geopolitical environment that created an atmosphere of fear and fragility to the constantly evolving belligerent posture of the world’s two largest economies—the US and China—Indian businesses had to navigate a complex global landscape not only to stay resilient but also to find avenues for growth amid mounting challenges.India Inc had moments of caution, but it also made the most of the situation by recalibrating strategy and approach, choosing to invest time and energy in long-term growth rather than short-term gains. Many of these moves may not appear significant at the moment, as they are unlikely to yield immediate results, but over the longer run, they are expected to prove effective and bear fruit.One of the foremost challenges for India in 2025 was managing its approach towards China. In April, when China halted the supply of critical rare earth metals, essential for chips, weapons, electric vehicles and several other applications — India Inc, particularly automobile giants, knocked on the government’s door to secure supplies. Without intervention, the disruption threatened to derail India’s ambitious electric vehicle adoption plans.As industry flagged concerns, the government swiftly doubled down on diplomatic channels while simultaneously fast-tracking domestic measures. This included accelerated execution of the National Critical Mineral Mission , aimed at reducing regulatory bottlenecks and opening doors for private firms to scale up exploration and processing of rare earths. India also partnered with countries such as Australia, Japan and the US to explore alternative supply-chain routes.Although China partially eased the curbs later, the episode delivered a sharp jolt. It pushed India to prepare for future shocks, and crucial groundwork was laid to strengthen long-term resilience.Despite geopolitical headwinds and global uncertainty, India emerged as the world’s fourth-largest economy in 2025 in terms of GDP. India’s resilience stemmed largely from strong domestic consumption. As a consumption-driven economy, India was less vulnerable to the damage caused by Trump’s tariff war, which hit export-dependent economies like China harder. Manufacturing expansion — particularly in defence exports and a robust digital services sector also boosted investor confidence.GDP growth remained mostly in the 6–7% range, supported by public capital expenditure, services exports and sustained government spending on roads, transport and renewable energy. While corporate capex stayed relatively muted, India Inc’s balance sheets remained healthy.The 2025 Budget marked a decisive shift in India’s tax architecture, with a clear focus on simplifying compliance and boosting consumption. The government recalibrated income-tax slabs under the new regime to broaden the base, simplify compliance and put more disposable income in consumers’ hands.At the same time, the GST framework was streamlined, reducing multiple slabs to just two key rates — 5% and 18%. This not only eased the compliance burden for businesses but also strengthened digitisation and helped sustain business momentum across sectors.Investor confidence in India’s growth story was clearly reflected in a steady pipeline of IPOs on Dalal Street in 2025. From ICICI Prudential AMC — the country’s largest asset management company — to JSW Cement , manufacturing-linked firms such as Saatvik Green Energy and Manas Polymers, and niche industrial SME listings like Bai Kakaji Polymers and Admach, the market saw wide participation.Several marquee IPOs were oversubscribed multiple times, while many delivered healthy listing gains, reinforcing confidence in India’s long-term growth narrative.India witnessed a flurry of announcements and policy action aimed at building a manufacturing ecosystem focused on value addition and supply-chain resilience. Semiconductors gained priority, and incentives expanded under the PLI framework. Auto and EV companies scrambled to secure rare earth supplies from alternative sources, while defence manufacturing received a major boost as export order books swelled.India also sharpened its positioning from ‘Make in India’ to ‘Make in India, for the World’, projecting itself as a credible manufacturing hub capable of challenging China’s dominance. Manufacturing currently contributes about 17% to India’s GDP, but the government has set an ambitious target of raising this share to 25% by 2047. Decisions taken in 2025 — through initiatives such as PLI schemes, Make in India and support for sunrise sectors — are expected to be critical stepping stones.In 2025, trade policy emerged as a core economic tool. India concluded multiple trade agreements to diversify markets and counter tariff pressures. A landmark Free Trade Agreement with the UK was signed mid-year, followed by the finalisation of an FTA with New Zealand in December. India also concluded negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman in August, improving access to Gulf markets.Simultaneously, talks continued with the US, the EU and key Indo-Pacific partners, while ensuring protection for sensitive domestic sectors.As India heads into 2026, the questions are no longer about growth potential but about execution — whether the country can build deep manufacturing ecosystems, secure critical minerals, and strengthen technological capabilities for the long haul.

[TITLE]How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business:

How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business

toggle caption Pool/Getty Images North America

State capitalism. MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.

Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.

"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace," says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.

"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate," she adds. "It's just bad for the economy."

There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.

Sponsor Message

Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.

Lipton calls this capitalism by "schmoozing," and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.

"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products," she says. "If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody."

Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, "In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership."

China-style 'state capitalism'

Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or "rules-based" capitalism.

Sponsor Message

This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.

But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of "state capitalism," in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it "crony capitalism," meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.

"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that," says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.

In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried "

[TITLE]AI-linked IPOs in China are exploding. But it's not easy for foreigners to join the party:
[TEXT]
China's hottest artificial-intelligence listings are delivering eye-popping gains.

Shares of chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits skyrocketed almost 700% in their Shanghai market debut last week, while Moore Threads soared over 400% on its first day of trading earlier this month.

While domestic investors scramble for exposure to promising Chinese tech listings, overseas investors are largely left out from partaking in such blockbuster offerings.

Foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs: "It's not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker," said Chris Zhang, executive director at Chinese financial services firm China Fortune Securities Company.

Opening an onshore brokerage account with a Chinese securities firm requires a linked Chinese bank account, which generally requires a proof of residence in China, or a Chinese visa with sufficient validity. Foreigners also need to already hold other mainland-listed shares before being eligible to participate in an IPO lottery.

Most foreign banks do not have the necessary arrangements with Chinese brokers to support account openings, Zhang said, making the process unworkable for the vast majority of overseas retail investors.

Official guidance from Shanghai's city government states that only a narrow set of foreign individuals can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares — stocks listed in mainland China. For example, foreigners with permanent resident status, workers in China, or foreigners working abroad with equity incentive plans in A-share listed companies.

For many global investors, Stock Connect, a program that allows Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges mutual access to each other's stocks, is the most convenient way to gain exposure to Chinese equities.

It allows overseas investors to buy A-shares through their Hong Kong brokers without needing an onshore account, or special licenses— but the scheme offers little help when it comes to IPOs, or even freshly listed stocks. Access also depends on Hong Kong brokers' eligibility requirements, such as minimum account balances and risk disclosures.

"Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually it takes a few weeks to months should the stocks qualify," said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.

Inclusion of companies in the Stock Connect scheme depends on whether a stock meets the eligibility rules such as sufficient trading activity and market value, which often requires a period of trading and data history for qualifying.

[TITLE]Dycom Industries Completes Acquisition of Power Solutions:
[TEXT]
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY), a leading provider of specialty contracting services to the telecommunications and digital infrastructure industries throughout the United States, today announced that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of Power Solutions, LLC (“Power Solutions”), one of the Mid-Atlantic’s largest electrical contractors serving data centers. The purchase price on a cash-free, debt-free basis was comprised of approximately $1.63 billion of cash, including an estimated working capital adjustment, and approximately 1.0 million shares of Dycom common stock.

“Today’s announcement represents a significant milestone for Dycom, reinforcing the Company’s position as a leader in the fast-growing digital infrastructure industry,” said Dan Peyovich, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dycom. “We are excited to officially welcome Power Solutions to the Dycom family and look forward to working together to realize the opportunities ahead.”

Power Solutions will continue to operate under its brand within Dycom. Power Solutions’ strong management team will remain in place, and the company will maintain its headquarters in Bowie, Maryland.

As previously announced, the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Dycom’s Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets. It is also projected to improve free cash flow for the combined company.

In connection with the transaction, the Company amended and restated its existing credit agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the existing revolving facility commitments to $800 million from $650 million, (ii) increase the existing term loan facility to $1.540 billion from $440 million, (iii) extend the maturity of the foregoing facilities to December 2030, and (iv) establish a $600 million senior secured 364-day bridge loan facility. The proceeds of the term loan facility and the bridge loan facility were used to (i) refinance the outstanding term loans and (ii) finance the cash consideration component of the acquisition. Further details regarding the credit agreement amendment will be available in a Current Report on Form 8-K.

[TITLE]Trump’s FCC Seeks to Strip Even More Local Control Over 5G Rollout:
[TEXT]
The Federal Communications Commission and the Trump administration have introduced new legislation and a new rule that would further erode local governments’ ability to limit the rollout of 5G small cells.

On December 3rd, the House Energy and Commerce Committee advanced a package of fifteen bills that would reduce the ability of local municipalities to regulate wireless telecommunication technology. The passing of the bills from the committee came only days after the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) published a new rule in the Federal Register that is also aimed at taking away power from local governments when it comes to legislating the rollout of wireless technology.

Critics view both moves as a gift to the wireless telecommunications industry—often derisively called “Big Wireless.”

Of the fifteen bills advanced by the committee, H.R. 2289 is considered the most concerning, according to Environmental Health Sciences (EHS), a nonpartisan, nonprofit news and science organization. EHS warns that H.R. 2289, also known as the Proportional Reviews for Broadband Deployment Act, would grant “sweeping advantages to industry” by rewriting federal law to “override and basically steamroll local authority”.

EHS argues that the bill would force local governments to approve cell towers and wireless modifications or expansions with inadequate review, despite known health, environmental, and safety risks.

The group also notes that the bill would shorten the time frame in which local governments could process cell tower and wireless facility applications by imposing so-called “shot clocks”. For example, if a city or county fails to approve the application within the allocated period, the application would be automatically approved. Additionally, local governments would be restricted from pausing applications—even during extremely busy periods—to conduct a thorough review.

Another concern is the bill’s expansion and reaffirmation of existing rules that prevent local governments from considering the environmental or health effects of radiofrequency (RF) emissions when reviewing cell towers and wireless facilities. This prohibition on considering the impacts of radiofrequency radiation has been standard practice since the passing of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Specifically, Section 704 of that act bars local authorities from denying permits for cell towers or wireless equipment based on such environmental or health concerns.

Theodora Scarato, Executive Director of the Wireless and EMF Program at Environmental Health Sciences, warned that the bill represents a “historic transfer of decision-making from communities to corporations, with virtually no guardrails”. Scarato also spoke to the problems associated with the 1996 Telecom Act and how these new bills will make a bad situation worse:

“The American people are trapped in a regulatory catch-22: the 1996 Telecom Act prohibits local governments from considering health and environmental effects, federal agencies have cut off funding to study those effects, and the FCC still relies on outdated 1996 exposure limits for RF radiation while ignoring mounting scientific evidence of harm. How can Congress and federal regulators- the FCC- mandate unlimited wireless expansion while simultaneously blocking communities from raising safety concerns, eliminating local oversight, and defunding the very research needed to protect the public and environment? This regulatory quagmire leaves families exposed, voiceless, and without any meaningful path to protection.”

In November, the US Conference of Mayors issued a letter decrying the package of bills, calling them an “unprecedented federal intrusion into established local decision-making processes” that favor “large broadband, telecommunications, wireless, and cable companies at the expense of residents and taxpayers”.

“These bills strip local governments of the ability to effectively manage the infrastructure built on local streets and in neighborhoods, while imposing no reciprocal obligations on providers.”

The letter was also signed by the National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors.

[TITLE]Sierra AI's $10B Rise and the Age of Enterprise Agents:
[TEXT]
The Gist

Sierra moves from promise to proof. After a $175M raise in late 2024 and $350M more nearly a year later, Sierra reaches $100M ARR in just seven quarters, signaling real enterprise execution rather than speculative AI momentum.

After a $175M raise in late 2024 and $350M more nearly a year later, Sierra reaches $100M ARR in just seven quarters, signaling real enterprise execution rather than speculative AI momentum. Agents become enterprise infrastructure. With Agent OS 2.0, Workspaces, and the Agent Data Platform, Sierra shifts AI agents from one-off conversations to governed, memory-driven systems embedded across regulated workflows.

With Agent OS 2.0, Workspaces, and the Agent Data Platform, Sierra shifts AI agents from one-off conversations to governed, memory-driven systems embedded across regulated workflows. Growth raises the stakes. Sierra’s rapid valuation climb strengthens its category leadership narrative, but sustaining it will depend on continued ROI delivery, agent trust and differentiation as conversational AI becomes table stakes.

If you look at the evolution of conversational AI through the lens of one of the industry's providers, Sierra AI, last year ended with a bang. And so is 2025.

The company's $175 million funding round in December 2024, valuing the startup at $4.5 billion, and then $350M infusion in September 2025 at a $10 billion valuation highlighted then both the immense promise and the challenges of carving out a niche in the competitive conversational AI market.

In July, the momentum didn't slow down in 2025. CMSWire reported in July the projected $50 billion conversational AI market will not be won on technology alone. Agent buy-in remains a decisive factor, particularly in contact centers where frontline employees are asked to trust AI systems that shape workflows, customer outcomes and performance metrics.

Adoption hinges on whether agents see AI as an ally rather than a threat — one that reduces cognitive load, improves accuracy and supports better customer interactions instead of merely accelerating automation or cost-cutting. Without that trust and alignment, even the most advanced conversational platforms risk stalling at deployment rather than delivering real operational impact.

Now back to Sierra AI. It is a perfect company to walk down this particular corridor of the customer service and support market: conversational AI.

Co-founded by former Salesforce Co-CEO Bret Taylor and ex-Google Labs lead Clay Bavor three years ago, Sierra’s positioning highlights a combination of advanced technology and a focus on branding. By emphasizing AI reliability, brand-aligned customization and enterprise integration, the company signals its intent to address key limitations in existing chatbot technologies.

However, as Sierra scales amidst stiff competition and soaring valuations in the broader AI ecosystem, its ability to translate these advantages into long-term enterprise adoption will define its trajectory.

Table of Contents

What Changed Since Sierra’s $175M Raise

And the company's been busy this year. When Sierra AI closed its $175 million funding round in late 2024, the central question was whether its enterprise-first vision could translate into durable execution amid an increasingly crowded conversational AI market. One year later, that question is no longer theoretical.

Last month, Sierra announced it had crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue just seven quarters after launch — a pace that places it among the fastest-growing enterprise software companies on record.

That growth has been fueled by rapid adoption across both digital-native companies and legacy enterprises. Sierra reports customers ranging from fintech and media platforms to healthcare providers, insurers, retailers and home services brands — including organizations founded more than a century ago. The breadth of that adoption reinforces the company’s early thesis: conversational AI would move quickly from experimentation to mission-critical infrastructure, particularly in regulated and operationally complex environments.

Equally important, Sierra’s momentum reframes its valuation story. What initially looked like a bet on potential now reflects measurable enterprise demand, expanding use cases, and increasing operational dependence on AI agents that do more than answer questions. Sierra’s agents now authenticate patients, process financial workflows, originate mortgages, manage returns, and support complex customer journeys across industries — signaling a shift from novelty to necessity.

Sierra Is in the Conversation Among the Fastest-Growing Enterprise SaaS Companies

This comparison builds on the extensive research and benchmarking published by the team at Landbase, who analyzed growth velocity, ARR milestones and category impact across today’s fastest-growing enterprise SaaS companies.

Company Primary Category ARR Milestone Velocity Why It Ranks Here OpenAI AI platform & foundation models Unmatched, platform-scale Defines the AI application layer with massive consumer, developer, and enterprise gravity. Anthropic Enterprise AI & safety Very fast, capital-intensive Enterprise-first model provider setting the standard for safety, compliance, and regulated AI use. Anysphere (Cursor) AI-native developer tools Extraordinary Redefined software development workflows with unprecedented ARR acceleration and developer adoption. Stripe Payments & financial infrastructure Proven, long-term scale Foundational infrastructure for the internet economy with durable platform lock-in. Databricks Data & AI platform Slower, deeper compounding; $100B worth after $1B Series K Core data backbone for enterprise AI, analytics and lakehouse architectures. Sierra Enterprise agent platform & CX infrastructure $100M ARR in 7 quarters Fastest proof point that agentic AI can operate mission-critical, regulated customer experiences at scale. Perplexity Conversational AI search Fast, consumer-led Reimagines search with cited, conversational answers but remains less operationally embedded. Glean Enterprise AI search & agents Strong, internal-facing Transforms enterprise knowledge access, primarily focused on internal workflows. Workato Automation & integration Steady, scaled growth Critical enterprise automation layer with broad connector ecosystem. ClickHouse Real-time analytics database Rapid infrastructure adoption Essential real-time analytics engine powering AI, security, and observability workloads.

From Capital to Execution: Sierra’s 2025 Proof Points

Sierra’s product roadmap in 2025 offers further evidence that the company is building for scale, not just speed. With the release of Sierra Agent OS 2.0, the platform moves decisively beyond basic conversational automation toward agents with memory, context and the ability to take action across systems. Central to that evolution is Sierra’s Agent Data Platform, which unifies unstructured conversation data with enterprise systems such as billing, inventory, policies and transactions — enabling agents to operate with continuity across time, channels and customer interactions.

The company has also addressed a quieter but equally critical challenge in enterprise AI adoption: governance and collaboration. Sierra’s Workspaces introduce a software-style development model for agents, allowing CX, operations, product and engineering teams to collaborate in parallel, review changes safely and promote updates through controlled release pipelines. By borrowing proven practices from software development — such as versioning, snapshots and staged releases — Sierra positions agents as long-lived products rather than disposable automations.

Together, these developments reinforce Sierra’s original differentiation thesis while extending it. Accuracy and brand alignment remain table stakes, but Sierra’s 2025 strategy emphasizes something more consequential: enabling organizations to treat AI agents as core customer experience infrastructure. In doing so, Sierra shifts the conversation away from cost savings alone and toward long-term customer relationships, operational resilience and measurable business outcomes — the very criteria enterprise buyers increasingly demand.

Strategic Implications of Sierra AI's Growth

Sierra AI's valuation jump from $1 billion to $4.5 billion within a year highlights the investor confidence in its potential to capture market share in the competitive AI marketplace. This growth reflects not only the perceived strength of Sierra’s product offerings but also its ability to position itself as a leader in generative AI solutions, particularly in verticals such as finance and healthcare, where its applications are reportedly gaining traction.

Investor Confidence Signals More Than Capital

Backing from heavyweight investors including Greenoaks Capital, ICONIQ and Thrive Capital signals significant growth expectations. These firms are known for their selective investments in high-growth companies with scalable technology and substantial market opportunities. Their involvement highlights a belief that Sierra AI could rival, or even complement, established giants like OpenAI, whose $500-plus billion valuation dwarfs many other players, and Perplexity AI, which recently hit a $20 billion valuation.

From Early Agent Bet to Category-Defining Scale

Sierra’s $350M capital raise a couple of months ago reinforces how quickly its early thesis has moved from explanation to execution. What began as a bet that AI agents could meaningfully reshape enterprise software has now translated into hundreds of customers across financial services, healthcare, telecommunications, retail and consumer services — including some of the largest and most heavily regulated organizations in the world. More than 20% of Sierra’s customers report annual revenue exceeding $10 billion, and over half surpass $1 billion, signaling adoption not at the edges of the enterprise, but at its core.

The scope of Sierra’s operational footprint further strengthens the strategic case behind its valuation. Sierra-powered agents now reach the majority of U.S. consumers across retail and healthcare, support complex financial workflows on both sides of the Atlantic, and handle high-stakes interactions ranging from mortgage refinancing and insurance inquiries to roadside assistance and network troubleshooting. This breadth of use highlights a shift from experimental AI deployments toward agents as embedded infrastructure — systems that enterprises rely on to resolve real-world problems at massive scale.

Importantly, Sierra is signaling that its growth strategy extends beyond customer acquisition. The company plans to deploy new capital toward deepening its Agent OS platform, expanding internationally, and pushing agents beyond service into revenue-driving use cases such as sales, engagement and lifetime value optimization. That focus reflects a longer-term ambition: to define not just how enterprises deploy AI agents today, but how customer experience platforms evolve as agents become foundational to enterprise operations.

AI Investment Shifts Toward Practical ROI

These funding rounds also reflect a broad surge in AI investment, driven by transformative advancements in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI capabilities. As businesses increasingly prioritize AI integration to drive efficiency and innovation, investors are betting on a few key players to dominate the emerging AI economy.

Valuation Momentum Raises Sustainability Questions

However, Sierra's meteoric valuation raises questions

[TITLE]SEC Files Complaint Against Crypto Exchanges In $14 Million Fraud Scheme:
[TEXT]
Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by pro-crypto chair Paul Atkins, has filed a significant complaint against a network of alleged crypto exchanges and online investment clubs accused of defrauding victims out of $14 million.

Major Crypto Scam Complaint

The complaint, which was filed in Colorado, identifies four entities that were operating under the guise of investment clubs and primarily used the popular social media app WhatsApp for communication.

The regulator alleges that these clubs falsely presented themselves as being managed by experienced financial professionals, offering what they claimed were valuable investment insights.

Participants were encouraged to invest in three purported crypto trading platforms, described as providing “security token offerings,” which they misleadingly likened to initial public offerings of legitimate company shares.

However, the Securities and Exchange Commission contends that those who bought into these so-called crypto investments were merely handing their money over to con artists.

“This was an elaborate confidence scam,” stated the SEC in its complaint, emphasizing that the investors’ assets were never invested as promised but were misappropriated from the very beginning.

Among the accused, one investment club, AI Investment Education, was registered with the SEC as an investment advisory firm. However, a phone number associated with the firm is currently out of service, and the regulatory filing indicated that it had no assets under management.

The other investment clubs named in the complaint include AI Wealth, Lane Wealth, and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation. The accused crypto trading platforms are Morocoin Tech, Berge Blockchain Technology, and Cirkor.

SEC Details Multistep Scheme

The scammers allegedly lured participants with promises of artificial intelligence-generated investment tips. Victims were persuaded to fund accounts on the fake trading platforms, which were falsely claimed to possess government licenses.

To expand their fraudulent agenda, the scammers implemented a tactic whereby victims wishing to withdraw their funds were required to pay fees upfront. According to the complaint, no withdrawal requests were ever fulfilled.

The SEC reports that the $14 million disappeared overseas, funneled through a complex web of bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.

Laura D’Allaird, the chief of the SEC’s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, asserts that this case exemplifies a prevalent type of confidence scheme targeting investors and leading to “devastating consequences.” D’Allaird elaborated on the mechanics of the fraud, stating”

Our complaint alleges a multistep fraud that attracted victims through social media advertisements, built trust in group chats where fraudsters posed as financial professionals, and ultimately led victims to invest their money into nonexistent crypto asset trading platforms where it was misappropriated.

The company’s Series A round, announced by the Singapore-based startup last week, was led by BBVA and will help Olea invest in artificial intelligence (AI) driven analytics, Web3 readiness and expertise in areas such as embedded finance.

‘This funding marks an important milestone in Olea’s journey,” Amelia Ng, CEO of Olea, said in a news release. “The confidence shown by our new and existing investors is a powerful validation of the business we’ve built–institutional-grade, scalable, and ready for the next phase of growth. We are committed to building an efficient and accessible trade ecosystem that connects capital, commerce, and technology.”

The presence of BBVA as lead investor will help speed Olea’s expansion into new parts of Europe, the U.S., Latin America and Asia, the release added.

Launched in 2022, Olea has a capital market services license (CMS) from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and works to “transform trade finance through technology, data intelligence and institutional governance,” per the release.

The company’s new funding round comes at a moment when, as PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, trade finance is shifting “beyond a passive necessity” for CFOs to become “a strategic frontier, and one where innovation, agility and connectivity are increasingly colliding.”

Historically, that report added, trade finance has been a conservative corner of banking. Letters of credit, export credit insurance and factoring programs experienced a slower evolution, held back by paper-based processes and risk-averse compliance teams.

“Bills of lading passed through couriers, letters of credit crawled through manual approvals and invoice financing was riddled with delays and opaque fees,” PYMNTS wrote in a separate report. “The persistence of these manual processes has long been tolerated as the cost of doing business across borders.”

However, companies have outgrown these tools as modern supply chains have grown more complex with the inclusion of more counterparties, currencies and regulatory jurisdictions.

“The reality is that the world is moving way faster than most companies can keep up pace with,” Wendy Tapia, head of product, receivables, at FIS, told PYMNTS in an interview in September. “Because of legacy systems, there are still a lot of organizations that are stuck in heavily manual processes, very fragmented systems. Without realizing it, they are limiting their agility and ability to scale.”

[TITLE]Canada Backs €8 Billion European Data Centre Deal:
[TEXT]
Canada’s CPP Investments Board has joined forces with Goodman Group on a €8 billion European data centre partnership across Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris, marking a major expansion of Canada’s pension fund.

The venture, known as the Goodman European Data Centre Development Partnership, represents CPP Investments’ first formal entry into large-scale data centre development on the European continent, broadening its infrastructure footprint beyond earlier ventures in other regions.

Under the agreement, four major facilities will be developed in Germany, the Netherlands, and France, specifically in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris, strategically chosen for their roles as technology hubs and gateways for cloud services and artificial intelligence infrastructure. These sites together offer a combined 435 megawatts of primary power capacity and 282 megawatts of IT load.

Executives on both sides hailed the partnership as a timely response to the growing need for robust digital infrastructure that supports cloud computing and advanced computing services across Europe. CPP Investments’ Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Real Assets highlighted the opportunity to establish a strong presence in this vital sector.

Goodman Group’s leadership also stressed the rarity and strategic importance of the portfolio being assembled, noting that fully powered and permitted sites in the so-called FLAP markets, encompassing Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, and Paris, are exceptionally sought after by global technology companies.

The pace of construction for the new data centres is expected to pick up quickly, with groundwork and building set to begin by late June 2026, and the transaction anticipated to conclude by March of that year.

[TITLE]Goodman Group strikes $14bn data centre deal:
[TEXT]
Australia's Goodman Group has struck ​a ⁠$14 billion partnership with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to build data centres across Europe, deepening its foothold in the region's fast-growing AI infrastructure market.

Interest in data centres has swelled ‌this year as tech giants and artificial intelligence ⁠hyperscalers ‌have planned billions of dollars in spending ‍to scale up infrastructure.

The partnership with the ⁠Canadian pension fund aligns with the AI ambitions of Australia's biggest property developer, which said earlier this year that it would expand its data centre business.

"This agreement is the clearest expression ‍yet of how Goodman is evolving from a logistics specialist into an AI infrastructure provider," said David Tuckwell, chief ‌investment officer at ETF Shares.

"Goodman is not just a landlord but simultaneously the developer, operator and equity partner. That allows it to pursue very large, complex projects in tier-one global cities without overburdening its balance sheet."

The Sydney-headquartered firm currently has 5 gigawatts of data centres in 13 cities, according to its website.

Data centres under construction made up 68 percent of the group's $12.4 billion portfolio of projects under development, as of September.

Earlier this year, Goodman raised around $4 billion, the largest capital raising in Australia at that time, to fund its data centre ‌business growth plans.

The 50-50 venture, CPPIB's first data centre ‌tie-up in Europe, involves an initial $3.9 billion funding commitment to develop a portfolio of projects in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris.

The partnership's portfolio comprises four projects, spanning ‌across three different countries totalling 435 megawatts of primary power and 282MW of IT load - power delivered to the servers and other computing equipment.

All projects are designed for speed to market, ​with secured power connections, planning permits and advanced site infrastructure, enabling construction to start by June 30, 2026, Goodman said.
