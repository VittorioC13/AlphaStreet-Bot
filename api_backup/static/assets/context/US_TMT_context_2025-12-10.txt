[TITLE]Gogo makes a strategic investment in Farcast to support new cutting-edge user terminal technology to enhance inflight connectivity for business, military, and government aviation:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farcast , a San Francisco-based startup building advanced satellite user terminals, announces that it has received strategic equity investment from Gogo (Nasdaq: GOGO), a leading in-flight communications provider for business, military, and government aviation, to evolve a new class of aviation user terminals for Gogo customers.

The investment will support the development of core technology needed for new antennas to support optimized cabin connectivity, expanding crew and passenger use cases. Farcast’s single-aperture, full-duplex flat panel antenna, FPA, will deliver reduced size, weight, power, and cost, SWaP-C, for operators while simultaneously increasing bandwidth. Installation of the compact terminal on existing aircraft real estate will also extend connectivity reach for more aircraft categories.

Farcast has already developed a unique technology that can simultaneously transmit and receive data from the same aperture in a flat panel antenna, FPA. The proprietary Active Electronically Scanned Antenna (AESA) technology uses electronic beam scanning to compensate for the movement of satellites from a single aperture, enabling the full-duplex FPA to lower SWaP-C.

The next-gen technology will complement the existing Gogo portfolio and support the company’s strategy of delivering a multi-band, multi-orbit connectivity experience from a compact terminal, enhancing the value proposition for Gogo customers.

“We recognized Farcast’s innovative approach to resolving some of the most complex challenges we have faced regarding the development and deployment of aviation user terminals. Farcast has developed a technology that will substantially reduce key SWaP-C constraints aviation faces, including scalability, while retaining and improving performance in a small form factor design,” says Chris Moore, CEO, Gogo. “We are confident this technology can be a real game changer for Gogo and our aviation customers.”

“We know that the aviation sector increasingly expects powerful in-flight connectivity and we’re excited to work with Gogo to demonstrate the value of integrating our reduced SwaP-C technology into its portfolio to elevate its offering to its diverse customer portfolio,” says Siamak Ebadi, CEO, Farcast. “We are extremely excited

[TITLE]Intel signs $14 billion deal with India's Tata Electronics:
[TEXT]
4 Reviews ← exclude selected types

Intel has bagged yet another multi-billion dollar deal, this time, to expand into one of the world's most sought-after markets. It has teamed up with India's Tata Group to manufacture semiconductors in the Indian states of Gujarat and Assam. While the exact node isn't specified, it won't be anything cutting-edge. Additonally, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is in its initial stages, and the actual fab might take years to materialize. Reuters reports the deal is worth $14 billion. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan issued the following statement:

Intel's technology has driven decades of advancement in computing, and as we continue to innovate, our ambition is to broaden our reach, accelerate growth, and deliver even greater value to our customers. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to collaborate with Tata to rapidly scale in one of the world's fastest-growing compute markets, fuelled by rising PC demand and rapid AI adoption across India.

In addition to manufacturing semiconductors, Intel and Tata will also develop custom AI PC solutions for local markets. The partnership comes as a much-needed reprieve for the Indian semiconductor manufacturing market, which has previously been snubbed by market leaders like TSMC and Samsung. It will serve as a proof of concept and hopefully serve as an incentive for other companies to follow suit.

Broadcom surges 3.26% ahead of Thursday report

Semiconductor giant sees premarket gains as Wall Street lifts price targets ahead of Thursday’s fiscal Q4 earnings report

Broadcom Inc. experienced a notable premarket rally on Sunday, with shares climbing 3.26% to reach $402.97 as Wall Street analysts elevated their price targets in anticipation of the semiconductor company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings announcement. The chipmaker is scheduled to release its financial results on Thursday, December 11, at 5:00 PM ET.

The premarket gains added $12.73 per share, reflecting growing investor confidence in the company’s performance and future prospects. Multiple financial firms adjusted their outlooks upward, with some analysts projecting significantly higher valuations for the AI chip manufacturer.

Analysts signal strong confidence with elevated targets

Several prominent Wall Street firms have revised their price targets for Broadcom in recent days. 1) Cantor Fitzgerald delivered the most aggressive update, raising its target from $450 to $525 while maintaining an overweight rating. 2) UBS analyst Vivek Arya increased the firm’s target to $472, keeping a buy rating on the stock. 3) Oppenheimer lifted its target to $435 from $400, reflecting strong conviction in the company’s growth trajectory.

The average Wall Street price target currently sits at $391.04, though the recent upgrades suggest analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on the semiconductor leader’s near-term performance. The elevated targets reflect confidence in both the upcoming earnings report and the company’s positioning within the artificial intelligence infrastructure market.

Robust Q4 projections point to continued growth

Market expectations for Broadcom’s fourth quarter fiscal 2025 results indicate substantial growth across key metrics. Analysts are forecasting earnings per share of $1.87, which would represent a 32% increase compared to the same period last year. This anticipated acceleration underscores the company’s expanding profitability amid strong demand for its products.

Revenue projections stand at approximately $17.5 billion, marking a 24% year-over-year increase. The most closely watched figure involves AI-related revenues, which analysts expect to reach $6.2 billion for the quarter. This would represent a 66% jump from the previous year, exceeding the company’s fiscal 2025 estimated growth rate of 50-60% for AI revenue.

AI infrastructure driving semiconductor demand

Broadcom’s position as a major supplier of custom AI chips to cloud providers and data center operators has positioned the company to benefit significantly from the ongoing technology infrastructure buildout. The surge in artificial intelligence applications has created unprecedented demand for specialized semiconductors capable of handling complex computational tasks.

The company’s momentum extends beyond current product shipments. Investors and analysts are particularly focused on management’s commentary regarding future AI growth prospects, which could provide valuable insights into the sustainability of current demand trends. The earnings call scheduled for December 11 is expected to feature detailed discussion of these forward-looking projections.

Market positioning reflects optimism

The premarket strength in Broadcom shares suggests investors are positioning for positive surprises rather than disappointments. The stock has been trading near 52-week highs, supported by the company’s dominant market position and the broader enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence infrastructure investments.

However, the elevated expectations also raise the bar for Thursday’s announcement. Broadcom will need to deliver results that justify the current valuation and analyst optimism to maintain upward momentum. Any shortfall in either reported results or forward guidance could trigger profit-taking despite recent strength.

Critical earnings catalyst approaches

Thursday’s after-market earnings release will serve as a pivotal moment for determining whether the current rally can extend into regular trading sessions. The high expectations mean Broadcom faces pressure to exceed projections on both the top and bottom lines while providing guidance that supports continued enthusiasm.

If the company surpasses expectations on earnings and revenue while offering guidance that indicates sustained AI revenue acceleration, the stock could experience the type of sharp rally that technology leaders have enjoyed during positive earnings seasons. The company’s ability to maintain growth rates exceeding 60% in AI-related revenue will be particularly crucial for sustaining investor confidence.

The semiconductor sector has experienced significant volatility based on earnings reports and forward guidance, making Thursday’s announcement especially consequential for Broadcom shareholders and the broader technology market. Investors will be closely monitoring not just the reported numbers but also management’s commentary on demand trends and capacity expansion plans.

[TITLE]Intel Has Secured a Massive Deal With India’s Tata On Semiconductor Grounds, Strengthening Its Global Strategy:
[TEXT]
Intel has secured a partnership with India's Tata Electronics to build the company's products in the nation, with a collaboration on the semiconductor front as well.

Intel To Utilize Tata's Chip Fab & OSAT Facilities In India To Manufacture Consumer Products

Team Blue is continually seeking to strengthen its balance sheet after a few consecutive quarters of dwindling financial performance, and one of the ways the firm has achieved this is by forming partnerships with multiple entities to secure investments. Following the USG, NVIDIA, and SoftBank, Intel is now reported to have formed a collaboration with India's Tata Electronics, valued at $14 billion, according to a Reuters report. The goal is to utilize India's first "semiconductor fabrication facility" in Gujarat and an OSAT facility in the state of Assam.

Intel’s technology has driven decades of advancement in computing, and as we continue to innovate, our ambition is to broaden our reach, accelerate growth, and deliver even greater value to our customers. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to collaborate with Tata to rapidly scale in one of the world’s fastest-growing compute markets, fueled by rising PC demand and rapid AI adoption across India.

- Intel's CEO Lip-Bu Tan

The partnership, as announced by Tata, involves utilizing the company's chip and OSAT plants for Intel's products, and both parties will explore collaboration on advanced packaging in India. Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, signed an MOU with Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the Chairman of Tata Sons, and while we are unaware of the specifics when it comes to what the chip fab will produce, Intel's CEO does say that India is an emerging market in the realm of semiconductors.

It is claimed that this partnership is driven by India's ISM mission, introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021, which aims to boost domestic semiconductor fabrication, design, and packaging.

Intel 18A wafer

We do know that the expansion of chip facilities to foreign nations has brought trouble for Intel in the past, and one notable example is the Magdeburg facility, which has been a victim of delays and large-scale layoffs, despite an investment of 'billions of dollars' into it. India, being an emerging market, lacks the supply chain dynamics necessary for a large-scale fab buildout. Therefore, it appears that the collaboration will work from the ground up to establish a resilient supply chain.

For a struggling company, the $14 billion deal with Tata marks one of the most significant partnerships in recent times, and it will defintely boost internal momentum, at a time when the firm is involved in the 18A ramp-up and development of the 14A process.

[TITLE]AI Companies' Borrowing Spree Is a Threat to Markets, Top Economist Says:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Debt is a growing concern in the bear case for AI, and it's enough of a worry that a top economist says it should be considered a risk to the broader financial system if things go awry in the tech sector.

Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, has been bearish on the US economy all year. He's been focused on the growing threat of a recession, but recently, the economist flagged another concerning trend in the tech world.

Zandi noted that AI hyperscalers are taking on high levels of debt through record bond issuance in 2025, eclipsing the borrowing by tech companies in the years before the dot-com bubble popped.

My previous post on the surge in bond issuance by the big artificial intelligence companies has generated a bunch of questions. A common thread in the Qs concerns how the borrowing done by AI companies compares to that done by internet companies during the Y2K stock market… pic.twitter.com/vBjJQ3g0Mu — Mark Zandi (@Markzandi) December 7, 2025

"Issuance so far this year by all technology companies, including AI and telecommunications companies that did the bulk of the borrowing around Y2K to expand the internet, dwarfs that done around Y2K," he wrote on X.

He emphasized that companies aren't simply refinancing existing debt, but increasing their borrowing as they fight for a share of the booming AI market. Zandi argued that, even adjusting for inflation, tech-sector borrowing is at records. What's more, surging debt is a major risk to broader markets and the economy, he said.

"Borrowing by AI companies should be on the radar screen as a mounting potential threat to the financial system and broader economy."

Zandi's posts reiterated a bearish argument

[TITLE]Vocus seeks four new submarine cable protection zones:
[TEXT]
Vocus is lobbying the government to more than double the number of submarine cable protection zones in Australia and to more actively police the areas.

The telco has also asked Home Affairs to consider bringing submarine cables specifically under the Security of Critical Infrastructure (SOCI) Act, which could bring a greater focus to their security and resiliency.

In a submission to a cyber security strategy inquiry [pdf], Vocus asked for new cable protection zones “in Darwin, Port Hedland, Maroochydore and Christmas Island.”

“These locations are vital to Australia’s connectivity with the Indo-Pacific and northern regions,” Vocus said.

The number of cable protection zones in Australia has been the same since they were first declared in 2007 – three, two in Sydney and one in Perth.

Submarine cables are being brought ashore outside of those zones, however.

It is possible for telcos and cable operators to apply for new zones to be created, but there is a $170,527 application fee.

Vocus has suggested that the government or the Australian Communications and Media Authority foot the bill, in recognition that “the protection of these assets is a matter of strategic national importance.”

Vocus added that cable protection zones should also move beyond acting as a “passive layer of defence” against submarine cable damage.

“Active policing and enforcement will be essential to mitigate risks from both accidental damage and malicious interference,” Vocus said.

Vocus isn’t the first organisation to lobby for an expansion of the cable protection zones.

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) last year remarked on the increasing number of cables making land outside of the designated zones.

“It would be an obvious worry if providers don’t feel the zones are worth the effort to register,” ASPI senior analyst Jessie Jacob wrote.

Jacobs said that “cable owners have said that ACMA should be unilaterally declaring and funding these new zones as needed.”

Australian Telecommunications Alliance CEO Luke Coleman – who previously worked at Vocus – also took up the issue of cable protection zones earlier this year.

“Not only do we need more protection zones, but we need active monitoring of those protection zones,” Coleman said.

“At the moment, you submit an application to get a cable landed in a protection zone, but then there is no actual protection offered. Nobody is monitoring those zones. Nobody is enforcing those zones.”

IBM said Monday it’s buying data streaming platform Confluent in a deal worth $11 billion that will help bolster the technology company’s artificial intelligence strategy.

The two companies said they signed a “definitive agreement” for IBM to acquire all of Confluent Inc.'s issued and outstanding common stock for $31 per share in cash, which represents an enterprise value of $11 billion.

Confluent, based in Mountain View, Calif., is an open source data streaming platform that “connects, processes and governs” data and events in real time, the companies said in a joint statement. It specializes in preparing data for AI and keeping it “clean and connected across systems and applications,” they said.

The deal means IBM’s client companies can deploy artificial intelligence services better and faster “by providing trusted communication and data flow between environments, applications and APIs,” IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in the statement. “Data is spread across public and private clouds, data centers and countless technology providers.”

The transaction is expected to close in mid-2026. It still needs approval from Confluent shareholders as well as clearance from regulators.

Confluent shares, which closed at $23.14 Friday, surged 29% in premarket trading. Shares of IBM ticked down less than 1%.
