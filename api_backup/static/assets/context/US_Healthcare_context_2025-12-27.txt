[TITLE]How Two Women Are Working to Modernize India’s Radiology Systems:
[TEXT]
CHENNAI, India, Dec. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Every medical diagnosis is built on data. A significant part of that data comes from radiology. Yet while imaging technology has advanced rapidly, the digital systems that manage images, reports, and workflows inside radiology centers have largely remained unchanged. This gap between modern machines and legacy software is what led to the founding of Medtatvaa.

The impact of this gap is most visible in long-term care. Consider a patient with a slow-growing meningioma near the optic nerve. Even years after surgery, the condition requires periodic MRIs and neurological follow-ups. Each consultation depends on access to historical scans and reports. In practice, that often means patients and families carrying CDs, paper files, and fragmented records across hospitals. Continuity of care is still manual.

Medtatvaa was built around a simple but often overlooked reality: radiology systems are not just
