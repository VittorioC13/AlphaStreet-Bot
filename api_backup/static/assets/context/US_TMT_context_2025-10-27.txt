[TITLE]Assessing SEALSQ (NasdaqCM:LAES) Valuation as NASDAQ Uplisting and Quantum Chip Launch Drive Investor Optimism:
[TEXT]
SEALSQ (NasdaqCM:LAES) is getting plenty of attention as it moves onto the NASDAQ Global Select Market, a step paired with its new Quantum Shield QS7001 chip launch and strategic expansion plans. This combination of milestones highlights the company’s drive to advance post-quantum security solutions at a global scale.

See our latest analysis for SEALSQ.

Excitement around SEALSQ is clearly building, with the share price surging 78.8% over the past month and notching a 22.6% one-day gain as investors responded to the company’s major NASDAQ uplisting, breakthrough chip launch, and a series of strategic alliances. Despite some earlier volatility, SEALSQ’s one-year total shareholder return stands out at a remarkable 1,656.5%. This highlights strong momentum as the company pushes deeper into post-quantum security and advanced semiconductor markets.

If recent headlines in semiconductors have caught your attention, this is a perfect moment to broaden your perspective and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership

With shares rallying and newsflow turning positive, investors now face a key question: is SEALSQ still trading at an attractive valuation, or has market optimism already priced in the next phase of growth?

Price-to-Book Ratio of 10.1x: Is it justified?

SEALSQ trades at a price-to-book ratio of 10.1x, which is significantly higher than both its peer average and the broader US semiconductor industry. With the recent close of $7.01, the valuation raises questions about whether current optimism is overheating the stock relative to its book value.

The price-to-book ratio measures how the market values a company’s net assets and is commonly used to assess hardware and semiconductor businesses, where tangible assets can be a key part of the investment case. A high ratio suggests that investors are anticipating rapid future growth or untapped value beyond what is represented on the balance sheet. However, it can also signal potential overpricing if fundamentals do not support such optimism.

SEALSQ’s price-to-book multiple of 10.1x is well above the US semiconductor industry average of 3.7x and the peer average of 4.6x. This premium may reflect excitement around the company’s recent innovations and expansion, but it greatly outpaces typical sector valuations. With no fair price-to-book ratio available for context, the market appears to be setting a lofty bar for future performance.

See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.

Result: Price-to-Book Ratio of 10.1x (OVERVALUED)

However, a lack of profitability and a premium valuation could pose risks if growth expectations do not materialize in upcoming quarters.

[TITLE]Can This AI Stock Dethrone Nvidia by 2030?:
[TEXT]
Nvidia (NVDA) has been the undisputed king of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It creates GPUs (graphics processing units) utilized in almost every industry and owns the CUDA software ecosystem, which makes its hardware indispensable for AI developers. Meanwhile, Broadcom (AVGO) is an infrastructure company that creates networking chips, AI accelerators (XPUs), and infrastructure software to help large-scale computer systems run smoothly.

AVGO stock has surged 53% year-to-date (YTD), outperforming NVDA’s gain of 38% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX) gain of 20%.

Broadcom continues to deliver record results, deepen its technological moat, and sharpen its long-term strategy. But the company’s AI-driven growth story is still in its early innings and has a lot of room to run.

AI Takes the Driver’s Seat in Broadcom’s Growth Engine

Broadcom designs, develops, and sells chips and infrastructure software for data centers, networking, broadband, wireless communications, and enterprise computing. Its Semiconductor Solutions segment provides chips that power modern computing, networking, and connectivity systems. It is the backbone of Broadcom’s business and its largest segment. However, since the VMware acquisition in 2023, the company’s Infrastructure Software segment has also started growing significantly.

In the third quarter, Broadcom reported total revenue of $15.9 billion, up 22% year-over-year (YoY), marking its fourth consecutive record quarter. This performance was driven by explosive demand for AI-centric semiconductors and strong momentum in the company's infrastructure software division. Semiconductor revenue alone amounted to $9.2 billion, a 26% YoY rise driven mostly by AI sales. Notably, AI semiconductor revenue increased 63% to $5.2 billion, continuing Broadcom's ten-quarter streak of strong AI growth.

Broadcom's outstanding performance has been fueled by the rapid expansion of its XPU business, which provides custom AI accelerators for large-scale, high-performance computing. XPUs accounted for 65% of Broadcom's AI revenue in Q3, as three important hyperscale customers continued to strive for compute self-sufficiency. In addition, the company secured a $10 billion order for AI racks from a mystery fourth customer, incorrectly believed to be OpenAI.

However, OpenAI and Broadcom have announced a multi-year strategic partnership to deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators, combining OpenAI-designed processors with Broadcom's Ethernet and connectivity solutions. These accelerator racks, which are scheduled to be deployed between 2026 and 2029, will power next-generation AI clusters.

This month, Broadcom introduced Thor Ultra, the industry's first 800G AI Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC), which represents a significant improvement in AI networking speed and scalability. In addition, the company announced the industry's first Wi-Fi 8 silicon ecosystem, kicking off a new era of AI-powered wireless connectivity for smartphones, PCs, IoT devices, and vehicles.

These achievements support the company's fiscal 2026 AI outlook, which anticipates significant revenue growth next year.

According to management, Broadcom's consolidated backlog has hit $110 billion, the highest in the company's history. This backlog indicates strong demand from AI customers and ensures future revenue. Adjusted earnings increased by 36.3%, reaching $1.69 per share. The quarter's gross margin stood at 78.4%, driven by increased software contribution and a favorable semiconductor mix.

VMware Integration Unlocks a New Growth Engine

While AI semiconductors remain the company's backbone, infrastructure software continues to be a significant profit driver. In Q3, the segment generated $6.8 billion in revenue, a 17% increase YoY. The gross margin in the infrastructure software segment increased to 93% from 90% a year ago. Broadcom released VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 this quarter, a fully integrated cloud platform that allows organizations to execute traditional and AI workloads on-premises or in any cloud environment.

The company generated free cash flow of $7 billion, or 44% of revenue, highlighting Broadcom’s ability to fund growth while rewarding shareholders. As a dividend stock, the company paid out $2.8 billion in cash dividends during the quarter and maintained a strong balance sheet with $10.7 billion in cash. In a move that signals stability and long-term confidence, the board of directors extended Hock Tan’s tenure as CEO through 2030.

Broadcom can compete with Nvidia in some areas of the AI ecosystem, but it cannot compete with the semiconductor giant across the entire stack. Nvidia's dominance in the AI business remains unshakeable, and Broadcom may not be able to dethrone it by 2030. However, under Tan's leadership, Broadcom's disciplined strategy, innovation, operational excellence, and capital efficiency may propel the business farther into the AI infrastructure ecosystem, perhaps positioning it as Nvidia’s most formidable rival by 2030.

What Does Wall Street Say About AVGO Stock?

Overall, the consensus for AVGO stock is a “Strong Buy.” Out of the 40 analysts in coverage, 35 rate it a “Strong Buy,” two say it is a “Moderate Buy,” and three recommend a “Hold.” Based on the mean target price of $397.92, the stock has a potential upside of 12% from current levels. Plus, its high price estimate of $460 indicates the stock could gain as much as 30% in the next 12 months.

[TITLE]What Would an Antitrust Review Look Like for a Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery Merger?:
[TEXT]
In a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery’s board, David Ellison argued that Paramount would be the “best partner” to merge with, citing “significant (perhaps insurmountable) hurdles” for other potential acquirers due to their “dominant market positions.” But that doesn’t mean a Paramount-WBD deal would be without its own regulatory challenges.

Unlike Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount, an acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery would not require a review by the Federal Communications Commission, as there is no required transfer of broadcast licenses. But a deal would still be subject to the same standard antitrust review that other bidders would face, not to mention the financial burden that comes with taking on Warner Bros. Discovery’s roughly $35 billion in debt.

A Paramount-WBD combination appears to be in the pole position in the eyes of the White House, with President Donald Trump reportedly throwing his support behind the company’s bid. Paramount is also able to leverage the expertise of its chief legal officer Makan Delrahim, who served as a former assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division during Trump’s first term.

Still, Hollywood has already been left battered from years of consolidation, and a deal of such magnitude will draw scrutiny on a number of levels. Regulators could see divestitures or other long-term commitments to offset the power and reach a combined company would have.

“In contrast with the Skydance/Paramount deal in which almost no one other than the principals and the President was affected by the outcome, here everyone, from theater owners to sports leagues to streamers to broadcasters to all the MVPDs and VMVPDs to all the Hollywood guilds will be affected, due to the increased leverage PWBD will have in negotiations,” New Street Research analyst and former FCC chief of staff Blair Levin wrote in a Sept. 16 research note. “As far as we can see, everyone in the sector will be negatively affected if the deal is approved.”

In other words, it’s not a slam dunk, despite Trump’s support.

Representatives for Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment.

What would a DOJ antitrust review look like?

For any bidder, the Department of Justice’s review would look at a combined company’s impact on the market concentration across areas such as theatrical, streaming, advertising and sports.

The agency calculates market concentration using what’s known as the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI), which operates on a scale of zero to 10,000 points. An HHI between 1,000 and 1,800 points is considered moderately concentrated, while an anything in excess of 1,800 points is considered highly concentrated.

Based on his own initial review, Levin estimated that a combined Paramount-WBD’s impact on the concentration of movie studios could climb from an HHI score of 1,730 to

[TITLE]I tried ChatGPT's Atlas browser to rival Google:
[TEXT]
ChatGPT's new browser has potential, if you're willing to pay

1 day ago Share Save Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter Share Save

Getty Images OpenAI wants to take on similar browsers such as those from Microsoft, Oracle and Perplexity

A few minutes into using ChatGPT Atlas, the new internet browser from OpenAI, I ran into quite a big road block. This isn't like Google Chrome, which is used by roughly 60% of people. It's all built around a chatbot you're meant to talk to to surf the web. "Messages limit reached," read one note. "No available models support the tools in use," said another. And then: "You've hit the free plan limit for GPT-5." OpenAI says it will make using the internet easier and more efficient. A step closer to "a true super-assistant". But assistants, super or not, don't come free - and the company needs to start making a lot more money from its 800 million users.

So how helpful is it?

OpenAI says Atlas offers us an opportunity to "rethink what it means to use the web". It looks somewhat similar to Chrome or Apple's Safari to begin with, apart from the big difference - a sidebar chatbot.

ChatGPT On the BBC News website, for example, it suggests it could show me the trending stories, or filter stories according to my interests

On a train booking website, it offered to "highlight deals" or compare prices with other places. I asked it to book me a train, but was told this is only available for paying ChatGPT customers. Later, I tried something simpler: I asked it to take me to an article I was reading the other day, but couldn't quite remember what website it was on.

ChatGPT Atlas rapidly searched my browsing history and opened the page for me in a matter of seconds

These are early days, but there's potential for big changes in how we use the internet. What's clear is this will be a premium product which will only work to its full capacity if you pay a subscription fee. Given we are so used to browsing the internet for free, this would require a lot of people to alter their habits quite dramatically.

Money, data, competition

OpenAI's founding mission was to reach artificial general intelligence - roughly meaning an AI which can match human intelligence. So how does a browser help with that mission? It doesn't, really. But it could raise some revenue. The firm has convinced venture capitalists and investors to back it with billions of dollars - and at some point, it needs to start showing a return on that investment. In other words, it needs to make money.

ChatGPT The chatbot still struggled with some basic commands - in these examples, it gave two very different responses when I said "yes please"

But raising money the internet's traditional way - advertising - might be a risk. "OpenAI may be tempted to show ads to recoup costs and turn a profit, but it also must deliver a good user experience to stand out in a competitive market," said Stephanie Liu, a senior analyst at Forrester. OpenAI will be hoping its users will find it so good they are willing to start paying - but only about 5% of ChatGPT users pay for a subscription, according to the Financial Times. The other thing Atlas could do is give the firm access to a huge amount of user data. These kinds of AI tools are ultimately about scale - the more data you feed them, the thinking goes, the better they will become. The web is designed for humans to use, so if Atlas can monitor us - how we book train tickets for example - it can learn how to better navigate these kinds of processes. "It remains to be seen how OpenAI will use users' data from Atlas, but for users who prefer anonymity and privacy, the browser may be too great of a risk," said Ms Liu.

[TITLE]Next 2-3 Years AI Unleashing 10X Productivity on Business and the World:
[TEXT]
An AI expert from Anthropic predicts a mostly smooth transition for AI over the next 2-3 years where business adopts best practice AI that is unleashing 10X productivity. This will be great value creation that would payoff the trillions we are and will invest.

Perfecting and scaling what AI is capable of now and what can make it do better with improved software architectures to ensure quality and verify results looks useful, valuable and not scary.

This looks like we avoid the fears of big problems of getting too little or too much AI.

The too little AI problem is a crash where the world cannot get return on trillions in investment.

The too much AI problem is where AI is so good and so powerful that humans become useless and humans lose control.

A world in three to five years where we have absorbed and disseminated 10X productivity that still mainly helps top human performers deliver big results would be ready to make another step up in 10-100X productivity.

Human civilization would be safely surfing an AI technology wave that continues the industrial and information revolutions where GDP increased 100 times. We would be in the Goldie Locks zone. Not too much, not too little. Just right.

2026–2027 Predictions: Full-Day Agents, Expert Parity, and GDP-Val

Naive extrapolations (METR, others):

Mid-2026: Models autonomous for a full day (e.g., implement app features, research reports)—key for delegation (10-min vs. hour-long runs enable “teams” of agents).

Late 2026: One model matches experts across occupations (per OpenAI’s GDP-Val: Real-world tasks from domain pros, benchmarked vs. humans).

2027: Frequent expert outperformance on many tasks.

Move 37: AI Creativity and Novelty

Iconic 2016 AlphaGo moment (Game 2 vs. Lee Sedol): Unexpected, “creative” move stunned pros (commentator: “Truly novel”). Not rote imitation—AI samples probability distributions for infinite novelty. Modern LLMs generate diverse outputs (e.g., unseen code/papers), but “Move 37” needs: Hard tasks + diverse ideas + accurate evaluation (easy to create junk; hard to ensure utility). Pre-training aids via distributions; sampling unlocks non-human paths.

Novel Science: From AlphaCode/AlphaTensor to Nobel-Worthy Breakthroughs

AlphaCode (novel programs), AlphaTensor (algorithms), and recent DeepMind/Yale biomed discoveries prove AI invents. Trajectory: Scaling impressiveness—2026 likely sees “super impressive” (consensus-level) novelties; debates fade as clarity grows. Nobel timeline: 2027 capability (solo breakthroughs rival AlphaFold’s 2024 win); awards lag (2028+). Excitement: Unlocks universe mysteries, living standards (e.g., aging halt, climate fixes).

Discontinuity vs. Smooth Progress: No Sudden Takeoff

AI 2027 singularity (AI self-improves via novel science) unlikely—smooth productivity ramps (researchers already use AI). Key: Does AI productivity offset rising difficulty (easy problems first; cf. pharma: $B drugs vs. accidental antibiotics)? Normal: Exponential research effort for linear gains. Unlikely acceleration (unlike fields needing more humans)

We’d see weekly signals (10x jumps)—pause if unclear. Optimistic: Balanced trends sustain linear progress.

Jobs: Complementarity, Not Replacement

AI ≠ human intelligence—superhuman calc, subpar others. Gradual synergy (comparative advantage): Offload drudgery (Schrittwieser: Claude refactors UI)

humans excel integration/creativity. Chess/Go: Enhanced (AI tutors/streams; easier solo practice).

Coding/study: Raises idea-to-output bar.

Inequality? Hard—lifts floor (anyone builds) but amplifies top performers

cCountry diffs via taxes/redistribution.

Nonzero-sum: Grow pie (agri/industrial parallels)—

10x productivity → abundance (medicine, energy, materials).

Political fix: Democratic wealth-sharing (tech can’t. 40-hour weeks persist despite gains).

[TITLE]SoftBank approves remaining $22.5bn OpenAI investment: report:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) -- SoftBank has approved a second installment of $22.5 billion to complete its $30 billion investment in OpenAI, tech news website the Information reported on Saturday.

The Japanese investment group's board has approved the installment as long as the artificial intelligence startup completes a corporate restructuring that would pave the way for an eventual public offering, the report said, citing a person with knowledge of the decision.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. SoftBank and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The money would fill out a $41 billion financing round that was announced in April, according to the Information report.

SoftBank had earlier agreed to fund OpenAI with $10 billion in mid-April and an additional $30 billion in December, contingent on the AI firm transitioning to a for-profit structure by the end of the year.

However, the tech investment firm had said that if OpenAI's restructuring fails, the investment amount would drop to $20 billion.
