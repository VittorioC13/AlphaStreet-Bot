[TITLE]Dems Say They'll Stand Firm Against Budget Deal Unless GOP Halts Attack on Healthcare:
[TEXT]
Democratic leaders said Thursday that they plan to hold up negotiations on a potential government shutdown unless Republicans agree to forfeit a policy change that is expected to dramatically raise health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.

Health insurance premiums are expected to rise significantly for approximately 22 million Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans after Republicans refused to extend enhanced tax credits when passing Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" in July.

In remarks on Capitol Hill Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) were in total agreement not to negotiate unless Republicans agree to extend the tax credits.

“On this issue, we’re totally united. The Republicans have to come to meet with us in a true bipartisan negotiation to satisfy the American people’s needs on healthcare, or they won't get our votes, plain and simple,” Schumer warned at a press conference.

"We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people. Period. Full stop,” Jeffries said.

The enhanced tax credits, which were created in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan Act and later extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, are credited with reducing the insurance premiums of millions of people who purchase health insurance through government exchanges.

The tax credits have reduced insurance premiums by 44% on average—over $700 per enrollee—and have contributed to the number of people purchasing insurance on the exchanges more than doubling to over 24 million in 2025.

According to a report released Wednesday by KFF:

Nine in 10 enrollees (92%) receive some amount of premium tax credit. If these enhanced tax credits expire at the end of 2025, out-of-pocket premiums would rise by over 75% on average for the vast majority of individuals and families buying coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.

The increases come as insurance companies, citing "slumping share prices," per the Financial Times, are planning the largest hike to premiums in 15 years, including an 18% increase for those buying from ACA exchanges.

These increases will come on top of those already expected as a result of a Trump administration rule passed in June, which increased the maximum percentages of income and raw dollar amounts that insurance plans could charge patients out-of-pocket for care.

According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, these changes "will make coverage less affordable for millions of people." The CBPP estimates that "a family of four making $85,000 will have to pay an additional $197 in premiums for coverage in 2026" while a "family of two or more people on the same plan could face an additional $900 in medical bills if a family member is seriously ill or injured in 2026, and an individual enrolled in self-only coverage could face an additional $450 in medical bills."

In all, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in May that as a result of these mounting costs, over 5 million people will no longer be able to afford their health insurance plans.

"The death star of American healthcare, the insurance companies are preparing to blow up the lives of millions of middle-class families," warned journalist David Sirota in a podcast for The Lever.

Republicans in Congress are facing mounting pressure to extend the tax credits and stave off the premium hikes. Last week, 11 Republicans in Congress signed onto a bill that would extend the credits through 2026, allowing them to avoid the issue until after the midterm elections.

A survey conducted in July by two of Trump's most trusted pollsters, Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward, found that for Republicans in the most competitive districts, "a 3-point deficit becomes a 15-point deficit" against the generic Democrat if they allow the healthcare premium tax credit to expire.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has stayed coy

[TITLE]Dems Say They'll Stand Firm Against Budget Deal Unless GOP Halts Attack on Healthcare:
[TEXT]
Democratic leaders said Thursday that they plan to hold up negotiations on a potential government shutdown unless Republicans agree to forfeit a policy change that is expected to dramatically raise health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.

Health insurance premiums are expected to rise significantly for approximately 22 million Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans after Republicans refused to extend enhanced tax credits when passing Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" in July.

In remarks on Capitol Hill Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) were in total agreement not to negotiate unless Republicans agree to extend the tax credits.

“On this issue, we’re totally united. The Republicans have to come to meet with us in a true bipartisan negotiation to satisfy the American people’s needs on healthcare, or they won't get our votes, plain and simple,” Schumer warned at a press conference.

"We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people. Period. Full stop,” Jeffries said.

The enhanced tax credits, which were created in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan Act and later extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, are credited with reducing the insurance premiums of millions of people who purchase health insurance through government exchanges.

The tax credits have reduced insurance premiums by 44% on average—over $700 per enrollee—and have contributed to the number of people purchasing insurance on the exchanges more than doubling to over 24 million in 2025.

According to a report released Wednesday by KFF:

Nine in 10 enrollees (92%) receive some amount of premium tax credit. If these enhanced tax credits expire at the end of 2025, out-of-pocket premiums would rise by over 75% on average for the vast majority of individuals and families buying coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.

The increases come as insurance companies, citing "slumping share prices," per the Financial Times, are planning the largest hike to premiums in 15 years, including an 18% increase for those buying from ACA exchanges.

These increases will come on top of those already expected as a result of a Trump administration rule passed in June, which increased the maximum percentages of income and raw dollar amounts that insurance plans could charge patients out-of-pocket for care.

According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, these changes "will make coverage less affordable for millions of people." The CBPP estimates that "a family of four making $85,000 will have to pay an additional $197 in premiums for coverage in 2026" while a "family of two or more people on the same plan could face an additional $900 in medical bills if a family member is seriously ill or injured in 2026, and an individual enrolled in self-only coverage could face an additional $450 in medical bills."

In all, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in May that as a result of these mounting costs, over 5 million people will no longer be able to afford their health insurance plans.

"The death star of American healthcare, the insurance companies are preparing to blow up the lives of millions of middle-class families," warned journalist David Sirota in a podcast for The Lever.

Republicans in Congress are facing mounting pressure to extend the tax credits and stave off the premium hikes. Last week, 11 Republicans in Congress signed onto a bill that would extend the credits through 2026, allowing them to avoid the issue until after the midterm elections.

A survey conducted in July by two of Trump's most trusted pollsters, Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward, found that for Republicans in the most competitive districts, "a 3-point deficit becomes a 15-point deficit" against the generic Democrat if they allow the healthcare premium tax credit to expire.

[TITLE]Clinical, biographical and healthcare-related factors associated with accelerated health decline in persons with multimorbidity: an evidence mapping review protocol:
[TEXT]
Introduction

Multimorbidity, commonly defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic conditions in the same individual,1 presents a significant health and economic burden. A systematic review published in 20232 reported that the prevalence of multimorbidity in Europe is approximately 39.2% (95% CI: 33.2% to 45.2%), with a higher prevalence observed in North America (43.1%, 95% CI: 32.3% to 53.8%). The overall global prevalence of multimorbidity in adult community settings is 37.2% (95% CI=34.9% to 39.4%).2 The prevalence of multimorbidity rises with increasing age: 20% of individuals experience multimorbidity before the age of 40,3 two-thirds of those over 65 have it,4 5 and by 70, 75% of the population is affected.6

The prevalence of multimorbidity is rapidly increasing. While this trend is especially pronounced in low-income and middle-income countries, where populations are ageing at a faster rate,7 high-income countries are also experiencing a significant surge.8 This growth in prevalence is primarily driven by an ageing population and advancements in medical care, which have improved survival rates for individuals with chronic illnesses. Additionally, important changes in lifestyle (eg, smoking cessation, reduced alcohol consumption, improved diet and sleep quality, sufficient physical activity) may contribute to prolonging life expectancy in this population, further increasing the prevalence of multimorbidity.9–11 A 2017 report by the Academy of Medical Sciences12 indicates that, within primary healthcare services of many high-income countries, multimorbidity is regarded as a norm rather than an exception. In the next 20 years, multimorbidity is anticipated to rise even more, especially involving complex multimorbidity (four or more diseases affecting different organ systems13). Patients over the age of 65 are expected to spend nearly two-thirds of their additional years of life expectancy with four or more chronic conditions.13

Multimorbidity can be associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as poor quality of life,14 increased disability and functional decline,15 and premature death.16 Due to the synergistic effects between multiple chronic conditions and their consequences, one of which is polypharmacy (intake of five or more drugs), the negative impact of multimorbidity on health can surpass the impact of individual conditions.17 Patients with multimorbidity, therefore, require more complex clinical management which can also lead to increased care costs.

Attempts to study multimorbidity have been hindered by a lack of consensus on how multimorbidity is defined and measured, the number of chronic conditions to be included in the count of morbidities, or the value of simple conditions counts vs weighted indexes,18 19 among other challenges. Another challenge is that the development and progression of multimorbidity involves numerous interrelated factors, including ageing-related biological factors, socioeconomic, psychosocial and behavioural determinants, as well as medical interventions and treatments.18 20 While the cross-sectional approach may offer insights into multimorbidity clusters, the development of multimorbidity over time and the sequencing of diseases, which are crucial for prevention and clinical management, remain undiscovered. Longitudinal study designs are warranted to better understand the development of multimorbidity and disease sequencing over time, which is crucial for designing preventive strategies.

While there are many cross-sectional studies evaluating risk factors for negative health outcomes in patients with multimorbidity,21–23 this topic lacks extensive investigation in longitudinal studies. A systematic review by Cezard et al24 identified 35 studies evaluating multimorbidity longitudinally. These studies focused on identifying patterns of chronic conditions and their trajectories over time. Factors associated with the onset and progression of multimorbidity in these studies included older age, increased socioeconomic and area-level deprivation, excess body weight and suboptimal health behaviours.24 Of importance, different studies suggest that the progression of multimorbidity and incremental decline in health may not follow a linear pattern but instead represent a multistage process with diverse trajectories in disease development.24–27

Individual-level multimorbidity phenotypes may evolve or change over time, leading to different trajectories.27 While some patients maintain a stable health status for a long time, others experience health declines surpassing the natural age-related deterioration.28 This ‘accelerated health decline’ may be triggered by specific factors or events that cause irreversible damage to patients’ health, preventing them from returning to their previous state.28 Despite the relevance of such triggers, little research has been devoted to their systematic identification and further classification. Timely detection of such risk factors could help identify key targets and facilitate the development of interventions aimed at minimising the progression and negative impacts of multimorbidity. Conversely, in cases where further medical intervention may offer limited benefit, a structured de-escalation of care may be appropriate. At the patient level, this approach can enable clearer communication about prognosis, improve care planning and ensure that treatment decisions are more closely aligned with individual health goals. At the population level, the ability to recognise such patterns may inform the development of risk-based care models and guide resource allocation towards patients most likely to benefit from proactive or tailored interventions.

In our study, we aim to assess the scope of existing evidence on the association between clinical, biographical and healthcare-related factors with accelerated health decline in multimorbid patients, as evaluated in longitudinal studies, and to identify clusters of evidence related to specific exposure-outcome combinations. This will help us understand future research priorities and directions for both original and knowledge synthesis studies. Based on our findings, we will issue recommendations to address gaps in primary research where evidence is lacking and to encourage synthesis of knowledge in areas with a substantial body of evidence.
