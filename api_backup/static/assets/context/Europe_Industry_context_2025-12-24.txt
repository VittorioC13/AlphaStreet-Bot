[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital urges LKQ to sell its European auto parts business:
[TEXT]
Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: 0.39%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

Behind the scenes

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers.

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers.

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint.

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount.

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000 . However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock.

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment.

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries.

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA.

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA.

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price.

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone , and Genuine Parts , may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that.

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time.

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders.

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]Global Times: 'Five imperatives' outlined at CEWC underscore maturity and resolve of China's economic governance philosophy: economist:
[TEXT]
Beijing, China, Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The annual Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) was held in Beijing from December 10 to 11. Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered an important speech at the conference. The conference reviewed the country's economic work in 2025, analyzed the current economic situation, and arranged next year's economic work, providing guidance and direction for ensuring a good start to the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026-30).

The meeting took into consideration both domestic and international situations and made a scientific assessment of China's development situation. Building on new practical experience, it summarized and outlined "five imperatives" as new understandings and insights, and identified key tasks for next year's economic work through "eight commitments." These range from continuously expanding domestic demand as a focus and enhancing innovation-driven development, to deepening reform and expanding opening-up; from promoting coordinated development and advancing the carbon emissions peaking and carbon neutrality goals, to prioritizing people's livelihoods and safeguarding the bottom line against systemic risks - covering all aspects of economic and social development.

Since the new era, the Central Economic Work Conference has consistently attached great importance to theoretical summary as a means of guiding economic development and practices. As circumstances evolve, the conference has continued to deepen its understanding of the underlying laws governing economic work. The book series Xi Jinping: The Governance of China include important speeches delivered by President Xi at the CEWC in 2014 (Volume II), 2017 (Volume III), 2021 (Volume IV), 2022 (Volume V), and 2024 (Volume V), which have provided guidance and direction for promoting China's high-quality economic development.

In the 18th installment of the special series "Decoding the Book of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China," the Global Times (GT), along with the People's Daily Overseas Edition, continues to invite Chinese and foreign scholars, translators of Xi's works, practitioners with firsthand experience, and international readers to discuss how under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Economy, the CEWC plays a key role in steering China's economic development and practices, and, with a focus on this year's conference, explore the key priorities for China's economic work in the opening year of the 15th Five-Year Plan period.

In the 17th installment of the "Practitioner's Insights" column, a patient and a medical expert at the Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone in South China’s Hainan Province share their personal experiences related to China’s high-standard opening-up.

A beam of bright laser light flashed before her eyes, leaving a microscopic incision on the surface of the cornea – so small it was almost imperceptible. Yet it was this barely visible cut that allowed Zhou Suyun, a patient from Southwest China’s Sichuan Province, to see the world clearly again.

This winter, at Boao Super Hospital in the Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone in South China’s Hainan Province, Zhou, now in her 60s, underwent refractive surgery using the latest-generation Zeiss robotic femtosecond laser system, VISUMAX 800. On the operating table, the laser completed the corneal procedure in less than 10 seconds. But those few seconds put an end to years of inconvenience that had shaped her daily life.

When Zhou opened her eyes, morning sunlight streamed through rows of palm trees outside the hospital. The clarity was so striking that she hesitated to blink. “I haven’t seen things this bright in many years,” she said softly.

Such moments of “pleasant surprise” are far from rare in Lecheng.

As one of the earliest ophthalmology experts to establish a presence in the pilot zone, Qu Jia views the changes behind these surgeries as a mirror of China’s broader opening-up process in the medical field. From the introduction of cutting-edge technologies and their standardized application to the growth of indigenous innovation, he has witnessed nearly every stage firsthand.

On March 1, 2018, Qu led a team from Wenzhou Medical University, in East China’s Zhejiang Province, into Lecheng, spearheading the development of its ophthalmology platform and playing a key role in building the pilot zone’s real-world evidence (RWE) research system, which generates clinical evidence on the use, benefits and potential risks of medical products based on real-world data (RWD). Today, he serves as president of the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and dean of the Boao Super TCM Hospital (Research-oriented Hospital) – positions that place him at the intersection of China’s leading clinical ophthalmology network and the institutional innovation unfolding in Hainan’s medical opening-up trial zone.

“What patients see is a long-lost brightness. What lies behind that brightness is a set of tailor-made policies designed by the country specifically for the pilot zone,” Qu told the Global Times. These include the “nine preferential policies,” which grant special approvals for the import of medical technologies, equipment and pharmaceuticals – an institutional framework that allows Lecheng to pioneer reforms on a trial basis.

One example is the introduction of the VISUMAX 800 on November 7, 2022. Under the policy framework, the device was allowed to be used in the pilot zone despite not yet being approved domestically, enabling patients to access cutting-edge technologies much earlier than would otherwise be possible.

On March 1 this year, the VISUMAX 800 was officially approved for sale in China. Prior to that, the ophthalmology department at Boao Super Hospital, where Qu works, had already completed more than 270 procedures using the device. Of these, 62 cases were included in real-world research and submitted as supporting evidence for domestic registration, significantly accelerating the approval process. “From acceptance to approval, it took just a year and a half, dramatically shortening the time to market,” Qu said.

“Globally speaking, medical special zones like Lecheng are extremely rare,” Qu noted. “Now, with the added advantages of the Hainan Free Trade Port (FTP) and the policy emphasis under the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) on “advancing the healthy China initiative,” Lecheng is well positioned to become a world-leading comprehensive health service hub.” As the island-wide special customs operation approaches, he added, institutional and resource advantages will be further unleashed.

Like a faint glimmer at sea that signals the direction of the tide, the practice of the pilot zone reflects the broader landscape of China’s high-standard opening-up. The recently concluded 2025 Central Economic Work Conference underscored the need to steadily advance institutional opening-up, expand self-initiated opening-up in the service sector in an orderly manner, and make solid progress in developing the Hainan FTP.

A pilot zone for institutional innovation

Turning the clock back to 2018, when Qu’s team was building the ophthalmology platform in Lecheng, China was sending a clear signal to the world

[TITLE]Korean FTC Forces Korean Air to Rework Asiana Mileage Plan Again:
[TEXT]
South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) rejected Korean Air’s proposal to integrate Asiana’s frequent flier program back in June (read more here), and Korean Air submitted an updated proposal in September 2025 (read more here).

The FTC is still not willing to accept the updated plan and has ordered Korean Air to submit an updated one within a month, while simultaneously fining both Korean Air and Asiana a combined $4.4M

You can access Korean Air here, and Asiana here.

The FTC doesn’t appear to be concerned that not all the miles are converted at a 1:1 ratio (credit card miles from Asia would be at 1:0.82), but that Korean Air doesn’t have a concrete plan in place to ensure that there is availability for mileage program members to redeem their miles for upgrades and award seats.

The FTC also fined airlines a combined $4.4M for failing to meet their promise to maintain at least 90% of their 2019 capacity, which was less than 70% on their Incheon–Frankfurt route.

Korean Air plans to complete the operational merger before the end of 2026 and have the unified carrier the following year.

Goodman Group (ASX: GMG) shares are on the move on Tuesday morning.

At the time of writing, the industrial property company's shares are up 8% to $31.48.

Why are Goodman shares rocketing?

This morning, Goodman announced that it has signed an agreement with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) to establish a A$14 billion (8 billion euros) European data centre partnership.

According to the release, the 50/50 Partnership involves an initial total capital commitment of A$3.9 billion (2.2 billion euros) to develop a portfolio of data centre projects in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris.

The partnership will be known as the Goodman European Data Centre Development Partnership (GEDCDP) and is CPP Investments' first data centre partnership in Europe, and will significantly add to its data centre portfolio.

Goodman revealed that the partnership's portfolio will comprise four projects totalling 435 MW of primary power and 282 MW of IT load. There will be two centres in Paris (PAR01 and PAR02), one in Frankfurt (FRA02), and one in Amsterdam (AMS01).

All projects provide speed to market with secured power connections, planning permits, and substantially progressed site infrastructure works. This means that construction can commence by 30 June 2026.

This isn't the first time the two parties have worked together. CPP Investments has partnered with Goodman Group since 2009 across Australia, Asia, The Americas, and Europe. It notes that the GEDCDP follows the establishment of the Goodman Hong Kong Data Centre Partnership and other data centre partnerships in Europe and Japan.

AI demand

Commenting on the news, Goodman's CEO, Greg Goodman, said:

A portfolio of this size and quality – located in Europe's FLAP markets – is rare. These powered locations are highly sought after to meet the rapidly growing requirement for cloud computing and AI adoption, particularly when they offer speed to market and delivery certainty. The quality and scale of this Partnership make it ideal for our long-term relationship with CPP Investments. We're pleased to be investing alongside them for their entry into the European data centre market.

This sentiment was echoed by Max Biagosch, who is senior managing director and global head of real assets for CPP Investments. He said:

[TITLE]Trump suspends all large offshore wind farms under construction, threatening thousands of jobs and cheaper energy:
[TEXT]
In the latest blow to the US offshore wind industry, the Trump administration announced Monday it is suspending the federal leases for all large offshore wind projects currently under construction, citing unspecified national security risks.

It marks a major escalation in President Donald Trump’s attacks against offshore wind, a form of energy he has long railed against. The suspension could impact billions of dollars of investment and stall nearly six gigawatts of new electricity set to come online in the next few years.

The new sweeping order impacts five projects being built in the Atlantic Ocean, including a massive Virginia offshore wind farm that could eventually be the largest such project in the nation. Set to be completed by the end of 2026, it would supply electricity to Virginia, the state with the world’s largest cluster of power-hungry data centers — and skyrocketing energy costs partially tied to that growing demand. Other wind farms impacted are off the coast of New England.

The exact national security risks of concern are unclear. In a news release, the Interior Department cited “national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports,” but didn’t say specifically what those risks were. The release also noted the potential for wind turbine movement and light reflectivity to interfere with radar.

In a Monday Fox Business interview, Interior Sec. Doug Burgum said the Department of Defense has “conclusively” determined that large offshore wind farms “have created radar interference that creates a genuine risk for the US,” especially “our east coast population centers.”

A Department of Defense official said it is working with Interior and other agencies to “assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects” but had no additional comment.

Last year, Sweden blocked the construction of new wind farms over concerns they could interfere with military radar, amid heightened tensions between the European Union﻿ and Russia. But experts have noted the design of wind farms can be adjusted to account for the issue, and it’s something US government officials have been aware of for decades.

Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, who serve on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, respectively, said the administration had “failed to share any new information” justifying the sudden pause.

“That silence speaks volumes, especially given the president’s longstanding, well-documented opposition to offshore wind,” the senators said in a joint statement along with Rep. Bobby Scott, also a Virginia Democrat.

In his Fox Business interview, Burgum said radar interference can “create real issues for trying to determine what’s friend or what’s foe in our airspace for our country” and suggested they could also create issues for commercial aircraft “given the proximity to all the large airports” on the East Coast.

The Trump administration’s move drew critiques from clean energy and fossil fuel groups alike.

“Companies with roots in the oil and gas sector have committed substantial capital to participate in the build-out of our offshore wind sector,” Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association — a group that represents offshore oil, gas and wind companies. “We urge the administration end this pause and to resist taking further action that may harm jobs and investment.”

Oceantic Network, a trade group representing offshore wind companies, said its member companies have worked with the Department of Defense for over a decade to address national security concerns.

The Department of Defense has “signed off on every offshore wind lease ahead of construction,” said Liz Burdock, the group’s president and CEO.

Burdock called Interior’s suspension “another veiled attempt to hide the fact that the President doesn’t like offshore wind,” and said the move would kill American jobs by the thousands and raise electricity prices.

“The US needs an all-of-the-above energy strategy, not an all-out assault on renewable energy based on personal preference,” Burdock said.

Burgum claimed offshore wind generates the most expensive form of electricity and said New England states should instead rely on Pennsylvania natural gas in his Monday interview.

New England states had planned a buildout of offshore wind in an attempt to get more energy to the region, which has limited infrastructure for electricity generation. It is literally the last stop of the nation’s natural gas pipelines and gets much of its natural gas shipped on ocean tankers.

Meanwhile, mid-Atlantic states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia have been seeing high electricity bills driven by their own electricity supply shortages. Just last week, the regional grid operator for those states announced prices hit a record high at a regional auction. Virginia’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has led a push toward vast offshore wind buildouts in an attempt to satisfy that state’s growing energy needs.

The Virginia offshore wind farm is 60% complete, according to a recent state report, and would deliver more than two gigawatts of energy to the grid — enough to power around 660,000 homes.
