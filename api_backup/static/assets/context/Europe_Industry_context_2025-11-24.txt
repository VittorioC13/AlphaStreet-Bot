[TITLE]Toyota CEO goes full MAGA at Japanese NASCAR race, investing nearly $1B in US manufacturing. Why he’s betting on America:
[TEXT]
Major companies across industries are pouring billions into America. Apple has announced a sweeping $600 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and workforce training (4). Johnson & Johnson plans to put $55 billion into U.S. manufacturing, research and development and new technologies (5). And Hyundai is investing $21 billion in the U.S. to boost automotive production capacity, localize key components and accelerate work on future industries (6).

And Toyota isn’t the only multinational committing big money to the U.S.

The investment is part of Toyota’s broader plan to inject up to $10 billion into its U.S. operations over the next five years, as announced on Nov. 13 (3).

The new funding will go to five Toyota manufacturing plants involved in hybrid vehicle production: the Buffalo plant in West Virginia, Georgetown plant in Kentucky, Blue Springs plant in Mississippi, Jackson plant in Tennessee and Troy plant in Missouri.

Just two days after Toyoda’s MAGA appearance, Toyota announced a $912 million investment in the U.S (2).

In September, Trump signed an executive order cutting tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 27.5% to 15%.

“I’m not here to argue whether tariffs are good or bad. Every national leader wants to protect their own auto industry,” he said. “We are exploring ways to make tariffs a winner for everyone. The people we want most to be winners are our customers.”

Toyota has long been the best-selling foreign automaker in America, which makes tariffs a high-stakes issue for the company. Toyoda used Sunday’s appearance to make his stance clear.

Toyoda appeared at a NASCAR event at Fuji Speedway on Sunday, where the crowd cheered and waved American flags. He didn’t just sport a MAGA hat — he also wore a “Trump–Vance 2024” T-shirt (1). The event was also attended by U.S. Ambassador to Japan, George Glass.

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have shaken foreign automakers, so it came as a surprise when Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was spotted wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat over the weekend.

Betting on America

These massive commitments point to a broader reality: even as policies shift — and even when they’re unpopular, with some of Trump’s own supporters criticizing tariffs — global companies still view the U.S. as one of the most reliable places to build and grow.

America’s economic strength and long-term growth potential have made it a magnet for capital for decades. That optimism is shared by some of the world’s most successful investors, including Warren Buffett.

“America has been a terrific country for investors. All they have needed to do is sit quietly, listening to no one,” Buffett wrote in his 2023 shareholder letter (7).

Buffett has been remarkably consistent on this point.

“For 240 years, it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America and now is no time to start. America’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs,” he wrote in 2016 (8).

His unwavering confidence in the country has paid off: U.S. equities have been a cornerstone of his wealth.

“I can’t remember a period since March 11, 1942 — the date of my first stock purchase — that I have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based equities,” he recalled (7).

For those looking to follow in Buffett’s footsteps, he has long championed a simple but effective strategy: investing in an S&P 500 index fund.

“In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” Buffett has famously stated (9). This approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America’s largest companies across a wide range of industries, providing instant diversification without the need for constant monitoring or active trading.

The beauty of this tactic is its accessibility — anyone, regardless of wealth, can take advantage of it. Even small amounts can grow over time with tools like Acorns, a popular app that automatically invests your spare change.

China's economic challenges are reshaping global trade dynamics, with Beijing increasingly relying on manufacturing and exports to compensate for a sluggish domestic economy, noted the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2025 Report to Congress.The report warns that the growing imbalance is triggering what the report's experts describe as " China Shock 2.0 ," impacting jobs and industrial capacity across multiple regions, including the United States.The Commission highlights a widening "two-speed economy" inside China. While consumption and household spending remain weak, state-backed high-tech and heavy manufacturing industries continue to enjoy abundant capital and policy support. Investments are increasingly skewed toward advanced manufacturing, including sectors targeted under China's industrial programs, as Beijing treats industry as its primary engine of growth amid a property sector collapse and massive debt pressures.China is now more dependent than ever on exporting manufactured goods. The report states that excess goods from China's factories are being pushed into foreign markets because domestic demand cannot absorb them, to dominate global value chains and push out competitors.As China redirects supply into global markets, the Commission warns of an emerging wave of dumping, overcapacity, and subsidised exports harming foreign manufacturers. This trend has already triggered protectionist responses, with several emerging economies imposing new trade barriers to defend their industries.The report warns that the United States could see further losses in critical supply chains if China's export surge goes unchecked.Technology competition is further aggravating the economic standoff. US restrictions on advanced semiconductor exports to China are increasingly being used as bargaining tools in broader trade negotiations.China has pushed back forcefully, targeting individual US companies and restricting exports of critical minerals used in high-end manufacturing and defence systems.The Commission notes that as bilateral tensions escalate, Chinese producers are turning to third markets for growth, offshoring manufacturing to bypass tariffs and embed themselves further in global supply chains . As China expands its footprint overseas, it continues to position itself as the world's reliable trade partner, despite benefiting from global rules it regularly circumvents.With the 25th anniversary of China's entry into the WTO approaching, the report concludes that Beijing has grown into one of the world's biggest beneficiaries of the rules-based trade system, while maintaining a state-led economy described as "fundamentally inconsistent" with those very rules.As China's structural imbalances collide with U.S. efforts to protect strategic technology sectors, the Commission warns that the global trading system is entering a period of unprecedented strain--where industrial policy, trade dependency, and national security are no longer separate spheres, but drivers of an intensifying economic rivalry .c

[TITLE]Labour codes: A game changer for the Indian economy:

The long-awaited labour codes announced by the Government of India represent a truly big-bang reform. For decades, labour regulation in the country was guided by a multiplicity of out-dated laws, many of them dating back to pre-independence era. Reforming this ‘fragmented framework’ had become an economic imperative. Reducing the number of labour laws and enforcement authorities, and aligning the overall regulatory ecosystem with present-day economic scenario, has been the main objective of the new labour codes.As such, the labour codes are expected to enhance the welfare of the workers and improve social security coverage for the informal workforce. For businesses, they aim to simplify procedures, reduce compliance burden, and decriminalize minor offences, among other improvements.From the perspective of industry, a critical question at this stage is: following the introduction of labour codes, how competitive is the Indian economy compared to peer nations such as Brazil, China, S Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand? While overall competitiveness depends on reforms across multiple domains - including land, labour, infrastructure, power, logistics and the cost of capital – the availability of skilled, efficient, and cost-effective labour force remains central to both the ease and cost of doing business.Labour law regulations and compliances in India have long been viewed as burdensome for investors and industry. Multiple licenses, registrations and return filings have often been cited by industry as contributing to this burden. The newly introduced labour reforms seek to streamline these processes through several measures, including single registration, single license, and single return for businesses; uniformity in definitions; greater flexibility to States to prescribe thresholds for lay-offs or retrenchments when required. Additionally, the provision for fixed-term employment (FTE) allows firms to hire workers based on evolving needs without fear of future legal complications. Taken together, these changes are expected to enhance competitiveness for Indian businesses.Given the comprehensive nature of the labour codes, and assuming effective implementation, India can anticipate increased investment, greater job-creation, and improved labour productivity. Although the requirement to extend social security coverage may raise the cost of business for firms in the short term, these can be expected to be offset over time through higher labour productivity, improved ability of the firms to attract talent, and enhanced hiring flexibility – all of which contribute to greater cost-efficiency in production.Overtime work regulations across countries constitute another factor in assessing labour-related competitiveness. The Economic Survey 2024-25 provides a comparative picture: India (Union) permits 75 hours of overtime per quarter, while the best performing State, Telangana, allows 156 hours. In comparison, Indonesia permits 182 hours, S Korea 156 hours, Vietnam 120 hours, Malaysia 312 hours, and Japan 240 hours. Under the labour codes, Indian States have the flexibility to determine their own quarterly overtime limits.This flexibility to raise overtime ceilings has the potential to reduce the cost, time and operational risks faced by Indian firms, while enabling them to reap greater economies of scale. It can also support the growth of smaller firms, while helping businesses fulfil seasonal export orders, and provide workers with the opportunity to earn more. Higher earnings, in turn, can strengthen household purchasing power and stimulate consumption demand within the economy.The combined advantages of flexible hiring under fixed-term employment (FTE), and higher permissible overtime limits will be especially beneficial for labour-intensive, export-oriented firms that receive seasonal orders, such as in garments, apparel, and textiles. Similarly, export-focussed businesses that deal in high value items, such as gems and jewellery, would gain from the ability to hire skilled workers with greater flexibility.Further, leveraging new age technology to simplify compliance for businesses and for timely payment of wages, will enhance transparency and accountability in enforcement, while reducing operational costs for businesses. Industry experts note that India is competitively positioned on the labour-related parameters – such as minimum wage rates, permissible working hours, and mechanisms for dispute resolution – when compared with countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Positive outcomes are likely, if States implement the rules in a standardized manner that aligns with the spirit of the labour codes.Labour codes bode well for India’s prospects of attracting larger volumes of domestic and foreign investments into manufacturing and services. They are expected to strengthen resilient supply chains, deepen integration with global value chains (GVCs), nurture globally competitive manufacturing, and enable the adoption of technology by firms in administrative operations. The reforms also hold significant promise for building a resilient, skilled, more productive labour force.At the same time, for India’s GDP to grow at 10 percent and more annually, major states and high-growth sectors will need to deliver on the promise of even higher growth trajectories. Achieving this would require continued reforms, improved infrastructure and logistics, enhanced facilities within industrial clusters - including residential dormitories for workers - better access to technology and markets for MSMEs, and deeper specialisation among Indian businesses to strengthen their presence in global markets.

What are EV makers importing?

India's emerging electric car market remains under the shadow of Chinese imports as the manufacturers continue to rely on the world's largest exporter for key components such as semiconductors, batteries and magnets. A report in the Times of India reveals that only six of every 46 (around 13%) electric vehicle (EV) models sold in India have been found eligible for benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme of the government, as they meet the domestic value-addition mandates.The rest 87% EV models in India were marked ineligible for PLI as they carried imported content more than the stipulated levels with the vast part of components coming in from China, sources told TOI.As per the Ministry of Heavy Industries' PLI Scheme for automobile companies and auto components released in September 2021, automakers are required to meet a minimum 50% domestic value addition (DVA) and follow Phased Manufacturing Programme similar to FAME-II Scheme. The government provides a relaxation on import of battery cells that takes the DVA cut-off lower to 40%As per TOI's sources, the government has approved six models under the scheme, including five car models from Tata Motors and one from Mahindra . "All the other models sold in the market, including from companies such as JSW MG, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Citroen, VinFast, Volvo, Tesla and Audi, have over 60% imported content," the source said.The EV models that have gained from the PLI scheme are - Tata Punch , Tata Nexon, and Tata Harrier SUVs, Tata Tiago hatch, and Tata Tigor sedan, along with Mahindra XEV9E.Tata's popular EV Curvv and Mahindra BE6 green did not meet PLI's local value addition criteria, despite other models from the autogiants making the cut.Officials from companies whose models did not make the cut told TOI that meeting the DVA criteria at such a nascent stage of EV adoption remains challenging. "The local supply ecosystem for EVs is still not as evolved as it is in the internal-combustion engine (ICE) category. Also, with limited sales of the greens, it is quite challenging and practically unviable to ask our supply chain partners to come to India," a top functionary at a leading European automaker told TOI.EV makers in India import a range of auto components from China and Taiwan, some of which are key elements to make the industry function smoothly."These include lithium-ion battery cells; rare earth magnets; DC Motors; laminated stators; semiconductor chips; printed circuit boards, and electronic child parts, all of which are coming from China," an industry executive said, citing a PwC study on localisation of EV component supply chain in India. "Then you have connectors; contactors; relays, and DC-DC converters which come from China and Taiwan," the executive said.The government launched the PLI scheme in view of the need to reduce exposure to supply chain volatility and drive localisation in the production of EVs. The PWc study emphasises that a strong push from various Government initiatives over the next few years to create an enabling local ecosystem, coupled with the need for EV OEMs to stabilise and control the ever-growing spend on EV components , will drive localisation of the EV supply chain in India.The PLI scheme aims to build 50 GWh of manufacturing capacity with 60% value addition over a period of 5 years. However, the pace at which this capacity grows may be slow due to the high investments required and the complexities involved in cell manufacturing.Localisation has always been a strong mandate for India’s automotive sector due to numerous inherent advantages, the study mentioned, adding that global tensions and COVID-led disruptions in the auto sector have reinforced the need for developing strong local supply chains.The localisation of EV manufacturing in India is particularly challenging due to the nature of components, assembly lines and the available infrastructure in India. As per estimates by PwC, previously non-existent components such as batteries with advanced chemistry, electric motors, power electronics and software now make up at least 50–60% of an EV, most of which are not present in India.Most of the locally manufactured motors are currently relying on Chinese imports for child parts to ensure commercial viability, with limited local value addition in brushless DC (BLDC) motors. While India will have to import rare earth magnets from China, other components such as laminated stators, are also mainly Chinese imports. China and Taiwan control majority of the global supplies of electric components like connectors, contactors, relays and DC-DC convertors, which are important parts of an EV high-voltage circuit.In addition to this, the black box assembly locks in a significant value in EV manufacturing, but is difficult to localise without the support of tier-1 manufacturers or in-house capabilities.India's auto sector continues to rely heavily on Chinese imports, which give rise to volatility and price hikes for the industry. While the government is taking crucial steps to boost localisation of EV production, private players can also play a key role with collaboration and investment to make India an EV superpower.

NE inland waterways get Rs 3000 Cr boost as IWAI signs multiple MoUs

The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has inked a series of memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth Rs 3,000 crore aimed at accelerating inland water transport and industrial connectivity across the Northeast.

The agreements—one with Assam Petro-Chemicals Ltd. (APL) and another with the Government of Assam—aim to promote the movement of cargo and passengers through the state’s extensive river systems, advancing the goals of sustainable connectivity and regional growth.

They were signed in presence of Union Minister of Ports, Shipping & Waterways Sabananda Sonowal, who also chaired a comprehensive review meeting on Northeast projects.

The meeting was attended by senior officials of the ministry as well as the IWAI on all projects in Assam, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya, including those under Centra Sector Scheme (CSS).

At the IMW, the first MoU between IWAI and Assam Petro-Chemicals Ltd. (APL) aims to collaborate for transportation of Methanol and Formalin through the Indo-Bangladesh Protocol Route (IBPR) and National Waterways (NW). The initiative will facilitate exports from IWAI jetties at Bogibeel, Pandu, and Jogighopa to destinations in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, while also strengthening domestic supply chains through National Waterways-1 and 2.

The project aligns with the Government of India’s flagship initiative, PM Gati Shakti – National Master Plan for Multi-Modal Connectivity, and is expected to significantly enhance Assam’s export and industrial potential. APL currently produces 1.98 lakh metric tonnes of Methanol and 1.15 lakh metric tonnes of Formalin annually, and the new arrangement will enable bulk, cost-effective, and eco-friendly transportation of these products. The total investment for the initiative is pegged at Rs 400 crore, covering the procurement of tanker vessels and related infrastructure.

IWAI will provide comprehensive operational and technical support, including facilities at its Bogibeel, Pandu, and Jogighopa terminals, navigation assistance, bunkering facilities, and firefighting systems. It will also help APL develop 10 flat-bottom tanker barges with capacities between 500 and 1,000 metric tonnes. APL will coordinate logistics, vessel operations, and statutory clearances to ensure seamless cargo movement.

The second MoU, signed between IWAI and the Government of Assam, focuses on the development and promotion of an Urban Water Transport (UWT) System, or Water Metro, in Tezpur, Guwahati, and Dibrugarh. The project aims to establish a seamless and sustainable water-based mobility network along the River Brahmaputra, integrated with existing transport modes such as roads, railways, and bus systems.

Speaking on the occasion, Sarbananda Sonowal said, “These MoUs mark a major step forward in realising the vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, whose leadership continues to transform the Northeast into a hub of inland waterway connectivity and industrial opportunity. We remain firmly anchored in our intent to develop the inland waterways ecosystem in the region for optimum utilisation and explore possibilities and converting them into tangible opportunities that drive growth, trade, and sustainability.”

The UWT project will develop fairways, navigation aids, and passenger terminals, supported by electric hybrid passenger boats to create a modern and environmentally responsible transport system. A feasibility study is being undertaken by Kochi Metro Rail Ltd. (KMRL) in consultation with the State Government. The tentative cost of the project is estimated at Rs 1,000 crore, excluding land costs.

The review meet, held at the Maritime Skill Development Centre (MSDC), focussed on 15 primary projects in progress as well as 10 Central Sector Scheme (CSS) projects including 3 in Mizoram, 2 in Nagaland, 2 in Tripura and 1 each in Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur. Two recommended new projects under CSS, one each in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, were also discussed at the event. The meeting also cleared for a Concept Study for an all-weather approach road at Bogibeel for smooth passage to the Cargo-cum-Tourist terminal.

With a vision to expand river cruise tourism, the Inland Waterways Authority of India signed an agreement with Heritage River Journeys Pvt. Ltd. to develop and induct new cruise vessels and expand cruising operations on the national waterways. The partnership aims to strengthen premium tourism experiences and tap the heritage and natural appeal of the Brahmaputra and other major rivers. The value of the MoU stands at Rs 500 crores.

IWAI and the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL) have signed an MoU to establish a collaborative framework aimed at enhancing river navigation safety and promoting tourism along National Waterway 2 (NW-2) in Assam. The partnership envisions the development and establishment of river lighthouses and allied infrastructure at Bogibeel, Silghat, Biswanath Ghat, and Pandu, which will serve as vital aids to navigation and help ensure safer passage for vessels operating along the Brahmaputra. The MoU exchanged aims to unlock the tourism potential of river lighthouses by promoting them as hubs for eco-tourism and heritage tourism.

A landmark MoU with Rhenus Logistics at Rs 1,000 crores will enable induction of modern tug-barges on the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers, significantly enhancing cargo transportation capacity and improving multimodal logistics efficiency for the Northeast. In addition, for the development of cruise terminals at Neamati, Silghat, Biswanath Ghat and Guijan, an investment of Rs 299 crore has been earmarked.

For the development of the Regional Centre of Excellence in Dibrugarh with a project value of Rs 188 crore, alongside a Rs 55 crore plan for developing a key land parcel in Guwahati, two other MoUs were also signed. These projects, supported through consultant engagement by IPRCL, mark a transformative phase in Assam’s River economy and position the state as a major hub of inland waterways connectivity and cruise tourism in India.

“Our collaboration to export products to neighbouring markets and the creation of a Regional Centre of Excellence in Dibrugarh reflect our commitment to innovation and global integration. Guided by the visionary leadership of PM Narendra Modi ji, we are transforming our waterways into engines of growth, prosperity and pride — reshaping the future of the Northeast,” said Sarbananda Sonowal.

In Mizoram, IWAI is advancing key inland water transport projects in Mizoram to strengthen regional connectivity and river-based mobility. Study is underway for IWT infrastructure on the Tlawng River and the Chhimtuipui River, with project values of Rs 0.89 crore and Rs 1.42 crore respectively. Additionally, construction work has commenced under Stage-I of the Rs 9.82-crore project for developing IWT infrastructure on the Khawthlangtuipui–Tuichawng stretch in Lunglei district. The project includes two river terminals at Thekaduar and Tlabung, two HDPE floating jetties with floating gangways, and new passenger boats equipped with outboard jets, enabling safer and more efficient passenger movement in the region.

In Nagaland, IWAI is preparing DPRs for developing Inland Water Transport facilities at Doyang Lake and for promoting water sports and tourism at Noune and Shilloi Lakes under CSS. In Manipur, a Techno-Economic Feasibility study and DPR has been proposed for developing IWT on the Barak River and its tributaries, as well as the Imphal and Nambul rivers in Manipur under the CSS. In Meghalaya, DPR for developing IWT infrastructure on Umiam Lake and the Umngot River (NW-106) are being conducted.

In Tripura, IWAI is advancing two key initiatives to strengthen regional connectivity and tourism. A project valued at Rs 24.53 crore has been taken up to develop the Gumti River and establish navigational linkage with the Meghna River system in Bangladesh. The project includes development of a navigational channel, bank protection works, construction of nine floating pontoon terminals, and installation of navigational aids. Additionally, study is going on for the introduction of a cruise ship service on Dumbur Lake in Dhalai district aimed at boosting tourism and leisure-based river travel in the state.

A proposal has been initiated for the development of Inland Water Transport (IWT) infrastructure on the Siang River in Arunachal Pradesh. The project includes construction of terminals with associated facilities such as buildings, sheds, internal roads, pathways, fencing, wharves, and solar infrastructure, along with installation of floating jetties, fairway development and navigational aids. The proposal also includes provision of vessels such as ferry services, FRP boats and high-speed leisure boats to support passenger mobility and tourism.

“The ongoing projects across Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh reflect the commitment of Modi Govt to transform the region through modern IWT infrastructure. By enhancing river connectivity, tourism and trade corridors, we are unlocking new economic opportunities and integrating the region more closely with national and international markets. Under the dynamic leadership of PM Narendra Modi ji, the Northeast is entering a new era of connectivity and economic resurgence powered by the revival of our mighty rivers. We aim to invest more than Rs 5,000 crores for the development of IWT in the region in the coming years. With new partnerships to strengthen cargo movement, river tourism and cross-border trade, Inland Waterways are becoming a lifeline of opportunity for our people,” said Sarbananda Sonowal.

The initiatives represent a pivotal step in operationalising the vast potential of the inland waterways and rivers of the region as engines of economic transformation.

APL will coordinate logistics, vessel operations, and statutory clearances to ensure seamless cargo movement.The second MoU, signed between IWAI and the Government of Assam, focuses on the development and promotion of an Urban Water Transport (UWT) System, or Water Metro, in Tezpur, Guwahati, and Dibrugarh.Sonowal said, “These MoUs mark a major step forward in realizing the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose leadership continues to transform the Northeast into a hub of inland waterway connectivity and industrial opportunity. We remain firmly anchored in our intent to develop the inland waterways ecosystem in the region for optimum utilization and explore possibilities and convert them into tangible opportunities that drive growth, trade, and sustainability.”The review meet, held at the Maritime Skill Development Centre (MSDC), focused on 15 primary projects in progress as well as 10 Central Sector Scheme (CSS) projects including 3 in Mizoram, 2 in Nagaland, 2 in Tripura and 1 each in Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur. Two recommended new projects under CSS, one each in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, were also discussed at the event. The meeting also cleared a Concept Study for an all-weather approach road at Bogibeel for smooth passage to the Cargo-cum-Tourist terminal.The Inland Waterways Authority of India signed an agreement with Heritage River Journeys Pvt. Ltd. to develop and induct new cruise vessels and expand cruising operations on the national waterways. The partnership aims to strengthen premium tourism experiences and tap the heritage and natural appeal of the Brahmaputra and other major rivers. The value of the MoU stands at Rs 500 crores.IWAI and the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL) have signed an MoU to establish a collaborative framework aimed at enhancing river navigation safety and promoting tourism along National Waterway 2 (NW-2) in Assam. The partnership envisions the development and establishment of river lighthouses and allied infrastructure at Bogibeel, Silghat, Biswanath Ghat, and Pandu, which will serve as vital aids to navigation and help ensure safer passage for vessels operating along the Brahmaputra. The MoU exchange aims to unlock the tourism potential of river lighthouses by promoting them as hubs for eco-tourism and heritage tourism.A landmark MoU with Rhenus Logistics at Rs 1,000 crores will enable induction of modern tug-barges on the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers, significantly enhancing cargo transportation capacity and improving multimodal logistics efficiency for the Northeast. In addition, for the development of cruise terminals at Neamati, Silghat, Biswanath Ghat and Guijan, an investment of Rs 299 crore has been earmarked.In Mizoram, IWAI is advancing key inland water transport projects in Mizoram to strengthen regional connectivity and river-based mobility. Study is underway for IWT infrastructure on the Tlawng River and the Chhimtuipui River, with project values of Rs 0.89 crore and Rs 1.42 crore respectively.Additionally, construction work has commenced under Stage-I of the Rs 9.82-crore project for developing IWT infrastructure on the Khawthlangtuipui–Tuichawng stretch in Lunglei district. The project includes two river terminals at Thekaduar and Tlabung, two HDPE floating jetties with floating gangways, and new passenger boats equipped with outboard jets, enabling safer and more efficient passenger movement in the region.In Nagaland, IWAI is preparing DPRs for developing Inland Water Transport facilities at Doyang Lake and for promoting water sports and tourism at Noune and Shilloi Lakes under CSS. In Manipur, a Techno-Economic Feasibility study and DPR has been proposed for developing IWT on the Barak River and its tributaries, as well as the Imphal and Nambul rivers in Manipur under the CSS. In Meghalaya, DPR for developing IWT infrastructure on Umiam Lake and the Umngot River (NW-106) are being conducted.In Tripura, IWAI is advancing two key initiatives to strengthen regional connectivity and tourism. A project valued at Rs 24.53 crore has been taken up to develop the Gumti River and establish navigational linkage with the Meghna river system in Bangladesh.The project includes development of a navigational channel, bank protection works, construction of nine floating pontoon terminals, and installation of navigational aids. Additionally, study is going on for the introduction of a cruise ship service on Dumbur Lake in Dhalai district aimed at boosting tourism and leisure-based river travel in the state.A proposal has been initiated for the development of Inland Water Transport (IWT) infrastructure on the Siang River in Arunachal Pradesh. The project includes construction of terminals with associated facilities such as buildings, sheds, internal roads, pathways, fencing, wharves, and solar infrastructure, along with installation of floating jetties, fairway development and navigational aids. The proposal also includes provision of vessels such as ferry services, FRP boats and high-speed leisure boats to support passenger mobility and tourism.

[TITLE]Xcel Energy seeks $355.5M revenue hike, increasing residential bills nearly 10% on average:
[TEXT]
Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has asked state regulators for an increase of $355.5 million to its rate base, which would boost the average residential electric bill by nearly 10% per month.

Xcel filed the proposal Friday with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which will take testimony from the company and various intervening parties and hold a public hearing. If approved, the increase would take effect in September 2026.

Xcel Energy-Colorado President Robert Kenney said the utility’s last increase to the rate base was in 2022. The average residential bill rose by 3.2%, according to an Xcel statement after an agreement was reached with all the parties

The rate base is a utility’s investments to provide services and on which it’s allowed to earn a regulated rate of return.

“This rate case is to recover costs associated with investments that we’ve made over the last three years,” Kenney said.

The Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, said the proposed increase is “too big of an increase.”

“It’s an especially large increase given the context of the economic times,” said Joseph Pereira, UCA deputy director.

The increase is largely related to Xcel’s expanded capital spending on distribution, transmission and generation, Pereira said.

“It’s unclear to parties in the UCA that the company is prioritizing investments that are the biggest bang for the buck, that increase reliability and that adopt an intelligent approach to how they’re using the grid,” Pereira said. “It still appears that the company is using a crude blanket approach to replacing and investing in new infrastructure.”

Kenney said Xcel has invested in safety, reliability, making the system more resilient, electrifying transportation and buildings, meeting increased demands from growth and taking steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Xcel has said it has reduced carbon emissions by 57%. The state’s target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.

Xcel is upgrading its electric grid with a $1.7 billion transmission project. The Colorado Power Pathway includes transmission lines, power substations and other equipment stretching over 12 counties, mostly in eastern Colorado.

“We’ve added a tremendous amount of renewable energy over the last several years,” Kenney said. “And we’ve done all of this while keeping bills as low as possible.”

Xcel has faced criticism from the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, and customers over the past few years for what the UCA has called “a pancaking of rate increases.”

The criticism of Xcel and other regulated utilities heated up in 2023 after a cold winter and high natural gas prices sent costs soaring statewide. A legislative committee held hearings and approved a bill intended to protect customers against future price shocks and level what some see as a playing field tilted in the utilities’ favor.

Kenney said Xcel Energy’s rates have been well below state and national averages for approximately the last 10 years. But, he added, the company recognizes that some customers face challenges to paying their bills. He said Xcel is expanding its programs to help people struggling to pay their bills and adding $10 million in assistance. People can also call 800-895-4999.

In the past, Xcel required people to show proof of income to apply for help, but now will accept their statements of need. And those receiving other aid, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will be automatically eligible.

Under Xcel’s proposed rate hike, the average monthly residential bill would rise 9.9%; small commercial bills would go up 9.3%-9.4% per month; and large commercial monthly bills would increase 7.3%-8.6%.

[TITLE]From smartphones to fridges: UK to end overreliance on imports of critical minerals:
[TEXT]
New Critical Minerals Strategy sets out the ambition to produce 10% of UK’s mineral needs domestically and 20% through recycling by 2035.

At least 50,000 tonnes of lithium to be produced in the UK by 2035 – more than the weight of the Titanic.

Up to £50 million fund backs UK businesses by boosting critical minerals projects and turbocharging domestic production and processing, helping UK move ahead in the global race.

Britain’s supplies of the vital materials powering everyday essentials like smartphones and fridges are set to be shored up as the Prime Minister launches the UK’s new Critical Minerals Strategy today [22 November].

The strategy, backed by up to £50 million new funding, will aim to reduce the UK’s overreliance on foreign imports of critical minerals essential for everyday life by ramping up domestic production, protecting the UK from shortages in global shocks like natural disasters or war.

The move comes as the Government doubles down on shoring up supply chains as part of its push on national security.

China currently dominates global critical mineral production and supply chains, for example controlling 70% and 90% of rare earth mining and refining respectively, making Britain vulnerable from overreliance on a select few exporters for its supplies of materials needed to power things like electric vehicles and wind turbines.

But in the UK alone, demand for copper – used for electric plugs in our homes and the brakes in our cars – is set to almost double by 2035, while demand for lithium – vital for powering our laptops and electric cars – will increase by 1,100%.

That is why the Government is taking decisive action to ensure no more than 60% of the UK’s supply of any one critical mineral is imported from any one country by 2035.

The strategy will see the Government work with the sector to harness the UK’s world leading capability with Europe’s largest lithium deposit in Cornwall, one of the largest sources of tungsten globally, one of the largest nickel refineries in Europe in Clydach, Swansea and the only Western source of rare earth alloys used in the magnets found in wind turbines and F-35 fighter jets, amongst others.

It will help the UK meet 10% of its demand through domestic production, with 20% to come from recycling of products to recover minerals. This is the first time the UK has set out clear, tangible ambitions to grow domestic production and recycling, while reducing our reliance on third countries.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

Critical minerals are the backbone of modern life and our national security – powering everything from smartphones and fighter jets to electric vehicles and wind turbines. For too long, Britain has been dependent on a handful of overseas suppliers, leaving our economy and national security exposed to global shocks. That is why we are taking decisive action to change that, boosting domestic production, ramping up recycling, and backing British businesses with the investment they need to compete on the international stage and drive down the cost of living for people at home.

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said:

We need critical minerals for everything – from the phones we use to the cars we drive – and for too long we’ve been dependent on a select few sources for our supplies of them, putting our national security at risk. Now, we’re taking the bold action needed to shore up our supply chains, ramp up domestic production and back businesses with the investment they need to create new jobs and drive growth, as part of our Plan for Change.

The new strategy also has the ambition to produce at least 50,000 tonnes of lithium in the UK in the next decade – more than the weight of the Titanic (around 46,000 tonnes).

The Government will deliver on the strategy by supporting UK businesses to grow and scale up their production with up to £50 million funding to boost critical minerals projects, as well as through our strong public finance offer, including investments via the National Wealth Fund and UK Export Finance.

In September the National Wealth Fund announced a £31 million commitment to Cornish Lithium to advance the Trelavour Lithium Project towards a construction decision and the Cross Lanes Geothermal Lithium Project to commercial drilling.

Businesses’ industrial electricity costs will also be slashed through the government’s British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS), encouraging firms to grow and drive new investment into the UK. The Government will launch a consultation on eligibility for BICS shortly.

To achieve the strategy’s bold aims the Government will also support permitting for innovative projects in domestic production and recycling through the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service, and work with Skills England and the Department for Work and Pensions to support the skills required in the UK to meet the Strategy’s goals.

For the first time, the new Critical Minerals Strategy is also laser-focused on growing the economy in line with the Government’s wider Plan for Growth, with critical minerals earmarked as a foundational sector to the modern Industrial Strategy.

The critical minerals sector contributes £1.79 billion to the UK economy and directly supports over 50,000 jobs, while there are currently more than 50 critical mineral projects based in the UK aimed at extracting and refining these vital materials.

Key regions including across North East England, in County Durham and Teesside, and the South West in Devon and Cornwall, have vital resources.

Jamie Airnes, CEO of Cornish Lithium, said:

We welcome the publication of the UK Government’s Critical Minerals Strategy that provides a clear strategic framework within which industrial scale UK critical minerals production can become a reality. The strategy highlights the need to accelerate domestic capability, unlock investment, and build strategic partnerships – all of which are essential to delivering lithium production at scale. Securing a domestic supply of critical minerals, including lithium, will create high-quality jobs, deliver supply chain resilience and support key manufacturing sectors across the UK. We look forward to working closely with Government and industry partners to turn this strategy into action.

Jeff Townsend, Critical Minerals Association, said:

We welcome the Government’s renewed commitment to securing the critical minerals that underpin the UK’s Industrial Strategy and future economic resilience. This strategy marks an important and timely step forward – one that recognises that modern industries, from advanced manufacturing to defence, clean energy, and high-tech innovation, are only as strong as the minerals and materials on which they depend. We recognise the growth and investment opportunities that this strategy will unlock, not only for Britain’s critical minerals companies but also for the hundreds of thousands of jobs and sectors that rely on them. If fully supported and delivered with intent, this strategy can secure the UK’s position as a trusted global partner and a leader in the technologies that will define the coming decades. The Critical Minerals Association stands ready to support its implementation and help ensure its success.

Tom McCulley, CEO of Anglo American’s Crop Nutrients business, said:

Metals and minerals are fundamental to the energy transition, improving living standards, and food security. It is important for the UK to have a clear strategy, both in terms of the supply of critical metals and minerals, as well as the opportunities that the UK’s own resource endowments offer for economic growth. With London at the centre of global mining finance, the UK has an opportunity to drive investment and growth through partnerships along the value chain and through the emergence of a modern mining industry in the UK itself.

The new strategy will commit up to £50 million to support projects across the country, including by expanding the research and innovation which goes into extracting and refining critical minerals, and helping businesses to commercialise and scale up their projects.

Government has already backed critical minerals businesses across the UK with over £165 million, and together with support from the National Wealth Fund, UK Export Finance and other public finance streams, this fund will drive growth in the sector across the country and help the UK move ahead in the global race to secure supplies of these minerals.

To boost resilience and national security, the Government will look at stockpiling, including through defence procurement, to shore up the UK’s critical minerals supplies for UK defence – in line with their widespread uses in advanced military hardware.

The UK is a member of the NATO Critical Mineral Stockpiling Project which is considering potential options for establishing, procuring and maintaining stockpiles of critical minerals, raw materials, components such as magnets and battery cells and recycled materials.

The Government will also continue to pursue partnerships with resource-rich and like-minded countries around the world to diversify the UK’s supply chains for critical minerals, using Britain’s world-leading credentials in academia, R&D, finance and trade to boost growth opportunities for UK businesses at home and abroad.

The new Strategy will be vital to delivering on the aims of the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy, with all the UK’s leading sectors which the Industrial Strategy backs – from advanced manufacturing to clean energies – dependent on steady supplies of critical minerals, including plane engines and semiconductors.

The benefits will also be reaped across the country, with Scotland placing critical minerals resilience at the forefront of its commitment to meet net zero and create a more circular economy, while Wales has maximised the geology and skills of its workforce to retain nickel and titanium product manufacturing to this day.

And in Northern Ireland, pioneering research from Queens University Belfast and work from firms like Ionic Technologies is finding new ways of recycling permanent magnets, which are used in applications from wind turbines to vehicles.

[TITLE]6 Democratic Governors Have Linked Arms With the GOP to Push Fossil Fuels:
[TEXT]
Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A bipartisan group of 13 governors is pushing to deregulate the permitting of energy infrastructure in the U.S., arguing that doing so is necessary to “win the AI race, lower costs for consumers, and responsibly develop the advanced energy sources of the future.”

But in reality, deregulating energy infrastructure construction would be a disastrous mistake that would increase greenhouse gas emissions and toxic pollution, further harming already polluted communities, and drive up utility bills by enabling proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

The bipartisan group of governors, which was led by Oklahoma Republican Kevin Stitt and Pennsylvania Democrat Josh Shapiro, sent a letter on October 28 to the leaders of several House and Senate committees urging them to deregulate the permitting of energy infrastructure. The group includes seven Republicans (Stitt plus Mike Braun from Indiana, Jeff Landry from Louisiana, Kelly Armstrong from North Dakota, Bill Lee from Tennessee, Spencer Cox from Utah, and Mark Gordon from Wyoming) and six Democrats (Shapiro plus Jared Polis from Colorado, Ned Lamont from Connecticut, Wes Moore from Maryland, Maura Healey from Massachusetts, and Dan McKee from Rhode Island).

Their letter essentially argues that all forms of energy are equally beneficial; that excessive regulation is impeding needed energy infrastructure; that a lack of energy infrastructure is raising utility bills; and that winning the “AI race” is in the public interest.

But every one of these assertions is demonstrably false. Let’s correct the record, one by one.

Some Energy Infrastructure Shouldn’t Be Built

There is a nearly universal scientific consensus today that building more fossil fuel infrastructure locks in growth in greenhouse gas emissions, precisely when we should be cutting them instead. Burning fossil fuels, of course, heats the planet. And building new infrastructure — even for supposed “bridge fuels” that could be phased out later on — creates costs that fossil fuel companies will want to recoup and profits that they’ll want to lock in for years.

All of the credible international institutions with expertise on the subject — including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN Environment Program, and the International Energy Agency — have concluded that we need to stop building fossil fuel infrastructure.

The International Court of Justice ruled in July 2025 that countries have an obligation under international law to phase out fossil fuels. Earlier, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea reached similar conclusions as the International Court of Justice.

The Trump administration officially rejects this overwhelming consensus, but its irrationality is no justification for governors from both parties to push for more fossil fuel infrastructure.

“Permitting Reform” Won’t Help Expand Renewable Energy

We undoubtedly need to build more renewable energy infrastructure. But “permitting reform” won’t help with that.

Peer-reviewed studies show that permitting requirements aren’t a major factor in obstructing renewable energy. One study found that the vast majority of renewable energy projects are either subject to streamlined federal environmental review, or exempt from it altogether. Another study found that most delays in permitting under the National Environmental Policy Act are not attributable to stringency of the permitting process, but to staff shortages and turnover at permitting agencies (exacerbated by federal budget cuts), and delays in project developers submitting required information to agencies.

A real obstacle to expanding renewable energy is the “interconnection queue,” or the wait time for new power generation facilities to be connected to the grid. In 2023, the generation and storage capacity waiting in the interconnection queue (which overwhelmingly consisted of wind, solar, and battery storage) was more than twice the existing grid-connected capacity, which was dominated by fossil energy.

A call for speeding up interconnection requests is one thing the governors’ letter gets right. One of their proposals is to require grid operators to fulfill interconnection requests by new generation and storage facilities within six months of receiving a complete application. That makes sense.

Today, there are two other factors obstructing renewable energy growth.

One is the repeal of tax credits for renewable energy. Under the GOP budget bill signed into law in July, tax credits for residential solar energy — essential for expanding distributed renewables — expire at the end of 2025. Tax credits for utility-scale solar and wind energy projects that commence construction after July 4, 2026, are ineligible for the tax credit if they are placed into service after December 31, 2027, creating significant uncertainty for new projects.

A solar or wind energy developer planning to build a new project today is under pressure to complete all pre-construction activities (site selection, land acquisition, obtaining financing and permits, etc.) before July 4, 2026. Otherwise, they face an 18-month deadline to complete all of these steps, plus construction, to qualify for tax credits.

Another factor is the Trump administration’s arbitrary cancellation of offshore wind energy leasing and permits for already permitted wind energy projects. Why bother building a wind energy project if the administration can just cancel it for ideological reasons?

“Permitting Reform” Won’t Lower Electricity Bills

Electric utility rates for residential customers reached a three-year high in August 2025, causing serious hardship.

In 2020-2021 (the last time the U.S. government collected residential energy consumption data), 27 percent of all households, 52 percent of Black and Indigenous households, and 57 percent of households with an annual income below $10,000 had difficulty paying their utility bills. Today, these numbers are almost certain to be higher.

Two key factors are to blame. One, our energy mix contains too much of the wrong kind of generation capacity. Solar and onshore wind are significantly cheaper than natural gas or nuclear energy, but renewable energy projects are waiting in line to be connected while our grid is still dependent on old, expensive fossil and nuclear power plants.

Accelerating the transition to renewables will help lower bills. But as we’ve seen, permitting “reform” won’t help with this transition.

Another factor, determined by analyses by the Union of Concerned Scientists and Bloomberg News, is the proliferation of data centers to power the internet — and increasingly, to provide the computational capacity to run AI.

The AI industry is increasing the load on the grid, and passing the costs of needed generation, transmission, and distribution upgrades on to households. It’s not an altogether new phenomenon. Residential customers consistently pay higher rates than commercial and industrial customers, subsidizing big corporations through their bills.

The “AI Race” Harms the Public Interest

Winning the “AI race” and lowering costs for consumers are mutually exclusive — unless utility rate structures are reformed to make large commercial and industrial customers pay the full cost of their added load on the grid.

Utility rate structures are set by state legislators and public utility commissions. If these governors were serious

[TITLE]Sudeep Pharma IPO: Should you subscribe?:
[TEXT]
Sudeep Pharma, which manufactures excipients and speciality ingredients for pharma, food and nutrition industries, is coming with an IPO that is open till November 25. The company has reported a modest revenue growth of 8.2 per cent in FY23-25. Strong growth from specialty ingredients business offset the weak growth in pharma and food segment. The growth in high-margin segment has also elevated the margins, with PAT growth of 49 per cent in FY23-25.

The IPO prices the company at a premium valuation of 48 times FY25 earnings. At such valuation, the growth prospects are fully factored, including the expansion plans of the company. With little margin of safety in valuations, we recommend investors to skip the IPO. Investors should also monitor the promoter-pledged shares, which are contingent on offer-for-sale proceeds to be released. The IPO involves a fresh issue of ₹95 crore (with objective of capital expenditure) and an offer for sale (OFS) of ₹800 crore.

Segment drivers

Pharmaceutical, food and nutrition division accounted for 66 per cent of FY25 revenues. The segment manufactures mineral-based single ingredients such as calcium, zinc, iron, potassium, magnesium, sodium and copper, which also act as excipients. Excipients are added to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to support stability of the formulations.

The segment reported flat growth in FY23-25. A significant shareholder from Germany, who also accounted for a significant share of revenues, had sold shareholding in the company to the promoter. This occurred as Sudeep Pharma pursued specialty ingredients which differed from shareholder’s strategy. The loss of sales from the shareholder along with the weak prices in the segment (following high prices post-Covid) impacted the division. The company expects to return to growth in FY26 and is now operating sales offices in Europe to accomplish the same.

Specialty ingredients is the other segment, which the company started in FY22. The segment reported a strong 32 per cent CAGR in FY23-25 and now accounted for 33 per cent of FY25 revenues. The segment adds value to the pharma, food and nutrition segment output. The segment manufactures client-customised ingredients designed to improve functionality, stability and bio-availability. The company has developed proprietary technology to deliver the minerals or nutrients in encapsulate, granulate or deliver liposomal or in spray-dried format, as per client specifications. This also delivers delayed-release or extended-release route of administration for nutrient premixes. The ingredients are either sourced from the company or are sourced from third parties before undergoing the encapsulation, granulation or other processes. The technology, while prevalent in pharmaceuticals, is limited in nutrient and food additives sector especially in India, which should ensure high growth for the company.

Expansion plans

The company expects to double its capacity with the addition of a new facility, which is under construction in Nandesari, Gujarat (near its existing facilities). This will add capacity to the pharma, food and nutrition segment. The speciality ingredients segment is now operating at a third of its capacity and doesn’t need capex, as per the company. The project is expected to cost around ₹110 crore.

The company is also one of the largest producers of food-grade iron phosphate for infant nutrition. The fresh issue proceeds will be used for procuring machinery to expand the production of iron phosphate. Also, the company is venturing into battery-grade iron phosphate production, which is used to produce lithium ion-based batteries.

It also acquired Nutrition Supplies and Services, an Ireland-based infant nutrition manufacturer with an established European clientele, a proprietary technology of manufacturing and requisite approvals. This acquisition, at the cost of ₹135 crore, has a margin profile similar to Sudeep Pharma and should not be margin-dilutive. The consolidated subsidiaries performance is yet to be reflected in company financials as only a portion of sales was reflected in Q1FY26.

Financials, valuation

The company reported a near-doubling of EBITDA margins from 20.8 per cent to 37.8 per cent in FY25. The director remuneration, lowered from ₹46 crore to ₹3.5 crore in FY25, accounted for half of the improvement. The remaining improvement is from increasing share of speciality ingredient, which has an EBITDA margin profile higher than the company. This is reflected in gross margin improvement of 10 percentage points in the period as well. With speciality ingredient expected to continue a higher growth, the revenue share and EBITDA margin profile of the company is expected to increase.

The company has a manageable net debt to EBITDA profile of 0.4 times as on March 2025. The company plans to fund the expansion plans from internal accruals as well.

As mentioned, close to 90 per cent of the promoter shareholding was pledged. Contingent on OFS funds, the debt and pledge are expected to be released. This debt was raised by the promoters to buyback the shareholding from the German shareholder last year. The release of pledged shares following the listing is an important monitorable.

The company has strong growth prospects from speciality ingredients and expansion plans. The resumption of growth in the larger pharma, food and nutrition segment should be monitored in FY26.

[TITLE]India’s labour reform has arrived in one sweep—but laws alone won’t create jobs or a dynamic labour market:
[TEXT]
A historic step has been taken. On 21 November 2025, India formally brought into effect its four Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019) , Industrial Relations Code (2020) , Code on Social Security (2020) and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code (2020). These replace 29 Central labour laws that had accumulated piecemeal over the past seven decades.

The notification marks the culmination of a reform process initiated in 2015, with years of tripartite consultation and delay due to the rule-making responsibilities of states under the Constitution’s Concurrent List.

The move is being described by the government as a “historic simplification" of India’s labour governance—intended to reduce compliance burdens for employers, widen social protection and make the country’s labour market more responsive to a changing economy.

The respective states of India must now pass their own rules and regulations to ensure the four labour codes are fully implemented within their jurisdictions

Reform objectives: Whose flexibility and whose protection?

Labour reforms in India, considered one of the ‘big’ pending reforms, have always been ideologically contested. Are the Codes meant to protect labour, provide flexibility to employers, formalize the workforce, or spur job creation?

In truth, they seek to do all four at once, though tensions among these goals remain.

• For employers, the new regime promises ease of compliance: a single registration, licence and return system instead of dozens of filings; higher thresholds for layoffs and closures; and fixed-term employment that enables time-bound hiring.

• For workers, it offers wider protection: a national floor wage, written appointment letters, health and safety coverage, maternity and provident-fund benefits for gig, platform and contract workers.

• For the state, it offers a path to job formalization: digitized e-Shram cards, portable benefits and a unified inspection and facilitation system.

In short, the Codes try to replace the rigid dualism of India’s labour market—where a small formal segment enjoys heavy protection and elite status, while the vast informal majority has none—with a continuum of graded protections linked to digital identity and compliance. This continuing and entrenched dual structure, a phenomenon called ‘casualization of labour,’ has had sometimes ugly and violent manifestations, endangering social stability and harmony.

What changes on the ground

According to the government’s notification and supporting documentation:

• All workers must receive appointment letters, ending informal oral contracts.

• Universal social security now extends to gig and platform workers, with aggregators contributing 1–2% of their turnover to welfare funds.

• Women may work night shifts in all sectors, including mining and IT, provided safety measures are assured.

• Free annual health check-ups are mandated for workers over 40.

• Fixed-term employees gain parity with permanent staff, including gratuity after one year (instead of five).

• A National Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Board will unify safety standards; the ‘inspector-cum-facilitator’ model replaces punitive inspections with guidance.

The Codes also envisage faster dispute resolution through two-member tribunals and portability of provident fund (PF) and Employee State Insurance Corp (ESIC) benefits across states—critical for India’s 120 million odd migrant workers.

The labour union critique and wage debate

The rollout has not been without dissent. Trade unions, including the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), which is ironically affiliated with the ruling BJP, have expressed mixed reactions. While they welcome codification, they lament what they call “unimplemented promises" and the lack of tripartite dialogue before final notification.

In a detailed memorandum to Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, the BMS urged that immediate attention be paid to pension ceilings, welfare cess restoration and regularisation of contract and scheme workers.

Other central trade unions went further, demanding a repeal of all four Codes, arguing that they weaken collective bargaining and legitimize contractualization. They fear that de-registering a union might become easier and the requirement of a single negotiating union with 51% labour representation might fragment their voice.

They have called for a statutory minimum wage of ₹26,000 per month (indexed to inflation) and criticized the government for not revising the National Floor Level Minimum Wage (NFLMW) since 2017—a lapse also noted by a Parliamentary Standing Committee.

This debate over minimum wages reveals a core tension: the Codes create the framework for a national floor, but without periodic revision and strong enforcement, the promise risks remaining symbolic.

Labour reform is not the same as job creation

The government’s hope is that streamlined regulation will encourage firms—especially small businesses—to scale up and hire formally. Yet, employment generation depends on far more than labour laws.

India’s unemployment challenge arises from a skills mismatch, inadequate infrastructure, rigid land markets and policy uncertainty as much as from labour regulation. The new Codes can reduce transaction costs, but cannot by themselves create demand for labour. Job creation requires:

• Human-capital development: expansion of apprenticeship programmes, skill-certification linked to industry needs and integration of vocational courses into mainstream education.

• Infrastructure and logistics: efficient transport, reliable power and digital networks that lower operational costs for manufacturing and services.

• Ease of doing business: predictable taxation, faster dispute resolution and simplified compliance across all regulatory fronts—not just labour.

• Export competitiveness: integration with global value chains and labour-intensive manufacturing growth (textiles, footwear, electronics) that can absorb semi-skilled youth.

Without these enablers, easier hiring and firing may only formalize precarious jobs rather than expand stable employment.

Formalization and social justice

Where the Codes could be transformative is in bringing India’s 90% informal workforce into the net of formal jobs. Appointment-letter requirements, digital wage payments and mandatory social-security registration make informality more visible—and therefore governable.

For millions of construction, plantation and domestic workers, universal ESIC coverage and portability of benefits promise a first experience of state-backed security.

If successfully implemented, the Codes could expand India’s social-security coverage from 64% of the workforce in 2025 to near-universal levels within a decade.

But formalization will also increase compliance costs for small firms and may push some marginal enterprises back into informality unless the shift is accompanied by simplified digital systems and fiscal incentives.

The missing part: Dialogue and trust

Labour reforms succeed only when grounded in social partnership. The delay in convening the Indian Labour Conference (last held in 2015) has eroded institutional dialogue.

As the BMS noted in its November 2025 letter, “economic, technological and industrial reforms must advance in tandem with labour reforms." Without ongoing consultation, even well-designed laws can breed resistance or token compliance.

Restoring trust between unions, employers and government is thus essential. Implementation committees at the state level, joint awareness campaigns on the Codes and transparent grievance mechanisms could bridge the gap between legislative intent and workplace reality.

India’s quest for a dynamic labour market

The long-term test of these reforms lies in whether they can make India’s labour market dynamic yet humane—encouraging enterprise while ensuring dignity and security for workers.

A genuinely dynamic market requires both flexibility in hiring and predictability in livelihoods. The Codes tilt towards flexibility, but they also plant the seeds for universal protection. The challenge is to ensure that flexibility does not turn into vulnerability.

If effectively enforced—with regular wage-floor revisions, expanded ESIC coverage and genuine collective bargaining—the four Labour Codes could move India closer to the model of ‘flexicurity’ seen in advanced economies: combining adaptability for firms with assurance for workers.

Governance test

The implementation of the four Labour Codes marks the end of a legislative journey and the beginning of a governance test. It symbolizes a shift from colonial-era statutes to a unified framework designed for a digital, mobile and globalizing workforce. It represents a long overdue upgrade of labour laws to reflect current reality and of the nature of work and of employment relationships in the future. It tries to respond to the maxim, that in the age of AI and automation, there will be ‘plenty of work but not enough jobs.’

Yet, laws alone do not create jobs. A dynamic labour market does. And so does a workforce equipped with human capital for the 21st century. India’s employment renaissance will depend on skills, investment and productivity growth as much as on codified rights. If this reform is accompanied by parallel investments in education, skilling, infrastructure and enterprise support, it could indeed become the cornerstone of inclusive growth.

An important challenge not to be missed is ensuring women’s participation in the paid workforce, on par in participation and pay parity with men.

In essence, the success of India’s labour reform will not be judged merely by the number of laws repealed, but by whether it delivers what the Constitution’s Directive Principles envisioned: “just and humane conditions of work" alongside “the right to adequate means of livelihood."

JPMorgan Chase announced a sudden increase in investments in critical U.S. industries, such as energy and defense, noting the firm will increase its previous 10-year $1 trillion commitment by 50%, to $1.5 trillion.

This initiative will begin with a $10 billion investment primarily into select American companies to help enhance growth, spur innovation and accelerate strategic manufacturing.

Must Read

“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security,” Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorganChase, said in a statement (1).

“Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy. America needs more speed and investment. It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need.”

The four key industries the company plans to focus on include supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience, and frontier and strategic technologies.

Following the Trump administration’s lead

On Oct. 10, after Beijing announced extensive new export control rules on rare earth minerals and other technologies, the Trump administration retaliated with an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. President Donald Trump also cancelled his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

In October alone, the U.S. imported 5,473 metric tons of rare earth minerals from China, according to data from the General Administration of Customs (2).

As a way to reduce U.S. dependence on China, the Trump administration has begun investing in these critical mineral industries, and the Pentagon plans to procure up to $1 billion worth of critical minerals as part of a global stockpiling spree, according to a Financial Times report (3).

“China’s ability to turn off the supply of these critical minerals would have a direct, palpable and adverse effect on U.S. ability to field the kind of high-tech capabilities that we’re going to need for any kind of strategic competition or conflict,” Stephanie Barna, a lawyer at Covington & Burling, told the Financial Times.
