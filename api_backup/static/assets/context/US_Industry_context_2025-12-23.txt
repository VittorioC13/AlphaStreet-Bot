Alnylam Pharmaceuticals is set to invest $250m in the expansion of its facility in Norton, Massachusetts, US, to meet the growing global demand for RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics.

This is claimed to become the first fully dedicated small-interfering RNA (siRNA) enzymatic-ligation manufacturing facility.

The facility expansion is intended to increase capacity, lower production expenses, and enable support for future medicine launches from the company’s development pipeline.

As part of this, the company’s next-generation, scalable enzymatic ligation manufacturing platform, known as siRELIS, has been accepted into the US Food and Drug Administration’s Emerging Technology Program.

The programme is expected to facilitate discussions with global health authorities regarding manufacturing approaches for oligonucleotide-based medicines.

This acceptance comes after pilot-scale production of zilebesiran, which is under investigation for decreasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in hypertension patients, and nucresiran, being developed for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR).

[TITLE]Halo Pharma Enhances Manufacturing Capabilities with Macro-Pactor® Investment:
[TEXT]
New addition enhances manufacturing continuity and supports seamless progression from early-phase development to late-stage production

Macro-Pactor® to be online in Q1 2026

WHIPPANY, N.J., Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Halo Pharma, a leading CDMO specializing in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, is expanding its manufacturing capabilities at its Whippany, New Jersey facility with the addition of a Gerteis Macro-Pactor®, a versatile roller compactor that enhances the company’s ability to manage complex formulations, improve process efficiency, and deliver consistent solid-dose pharmaceutical products. The investment reinforces Halo Pharma’s position as a reliable partner for both development and commercial manufacturing as it allows for seamless scale up from Halo Whippany’s Gerties Mini-Pactor® currently used for development, clinical and small scall commercial manufacturing.

The Macro-Pactor is expected to be online in the first quarter of 2026. Its high throughput, superior dry-granulation performance, improved powder flow, and reduced variability will significantly expand Halo Pharma’s dry-granulation capabilities. It will improve formulation flexibility, process predictability, and granule quality. This technology is especially beneficial for the development of moisture-sensitive APIs, high-drug-load formulations, poor-flowing powders, potent compounds, and modified-release products within Halo Pharma’s portfolio.

“One of the major advantages of adding the Macro-Pactor is that the process parameters established during early-phase development translates almost directly into larger batch sizes,” says Satish Shetty, Senior Director, Product Development & Technical Services at Halo Pharma. “Since the equipment is engineered for both development and commercial throughput, it eliminates the typical disconnect between small-scale R&D and large-scale manufacturing, reducing scale-up risk, timelines, and the need for reformulation.”

Shetty adds that the Macro-Pactor’s closed, dust-contained design reduces operator exposure, minimizes product loss, and supports secure, regulatory-compliant handling. With fewer open processing steps, the system provides safer, more controlled operation for potent APIs and controlled substances.

Beyond scale-up, the Macro-Pactor supports Halo Pharma’s tech-transfer process. Its precise, data-rich control of critical process parameters enables smooth, low-risk transitions from lab-scale development to commercial manufacturing, strengthening the company’s Quality by Design (QbD) efforts. Fully compatible with existing upstream and downstream equipment, the system ensures efficient end-to-end processing and strengthens collaboration across R&D, process development, manufacturing, and quality teams.

"Investing in the Macro-Pactor reinforces Halo Pharma’s commitment to delivering high-quality, scalable manufacturing solutions for our clients. It ensures that they can confidently advance their programs with predictable outcomes and faster timelines," says Lee Karras, Group Chief Executive for the Noramco Group, parent company of Halo Pharma.

[TITLE]AG Mortgage Bank plans N10bn capital injection at 20 years:
[TEXT]
AG Mortgage Bank Plc has showcased its resilience, growth, and commitment to innovation over the past two decades, as it marked its 20th anniversary with a product exhibition in Abuja.

The bank, in a statement on Sunday, stated that it leveraged the milestone event to unveil plans to raise fresh capital aimed at scaling its operations, strengthening its balance sheet, and supporting Nigeria’s housing finance sector. The N10bn capital raise, according to the bank, is being pursued through offerings to existing shareholders, strategic partners, institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, and development finance institutions.

Speaking at the event, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of AG Mortgage Bank Plc, Ngozi Anyogu, said the anniversary represented a significant milestone in the bank’s journey.

“In September 2025, we proudly celebrated our 20th anniversary—two decades marked by unwavering dedication, impactful innovation, and transformative service to millions of Nigerians,” Anyogu said.

He noted that the anniversary celebration, held in Abuja, highlighted the bank’s evolution into a trusted institution that not only provides innovative mortgage products but also plays a vital role in driving economic growth and sustainable housing solutions in Nigeria.

Financially, the bank recorded steady growth in the 2024 financial year. Its gross earnings rose by seven per cent year-on-year to N3.47bn, while total assets expanded to N22.36bn from N21.1bn in 2023. Shareholders’ funds also grew by eight per cent to N6.1bn within the same period.

“From our inception, driven by a bold vision, AG Mortgage Bank Plc has evolved into a trusted institution synonymous with tailored financial solutions that meet the dynamic needs of individuals, businesses, and entire communities,” Anyogu added.

The event also underscored the bank’s emphasis on corporate values such as Accountability, Godliness, Integrity, Teamwork, Respect, Innovation, and Professionalism. It further highlighted recognition of AG Mortgage Bank as a pillar of hope and a catalyst for change in Nigeria’s mortgage sector, as well as its partnership with Invest Africa to expand reach and impact in housing finance.

Key highlights of the 20th anniversary included celebrating the bank’s growth from a single branch in 2005 to five branches, alongside capital growth from N200m to N23bn. The bank said it has financed over 20,000 homes nationwide, contributing to efforts to address Nigeria’s housing deficit.

The celebration also reaffirmed the bank’s commitment to Project Momentum 2025–2030, which includes targets to create 300,000 mortgages, grow its customer base to one million, raise capital to N20bn, and lead green, sustainable housing initiatives.

Held at the Continental Hotel, Abuja, the exhibition formed part of a grand celebration attended by industry leaders, customers, shareholders, regulators, and key stakeholders. Activities included thanksgiving, keynote addresses, award presentations, cultural performances reflecting Nigeria’s diversity, and the unveiling of over 12 new products tailored to Nigeria’s evolving housing finance needs.

Products launched at the exhibition included Sustainability Products focused on green financing and ESG-aligned investments supporting Nigeria’s Sustainable Development Goals; Treasury Products for institutional investors and corporations seeking secure, high-yield instruments; Flexible Loan Products designed to improve access to credit for Nigerian households and businesses; and E-Business Products delivering seamless digital transactions and business automation for SMEs and entrepreneurs.

“These products exemplify AG Mortgage Bank’s commitment to financial inclusion, innovation, and sustainable national development,” the bank said.

Reflecting further on the exhibition, Anyogu said, “Our recent landmark product exhibition unveiled a suite of innovative offerings—ranging from treasury products designed for institutional investors, to Sustainability products supporting Nigeria’s green development aspirations, and digital-first E-Business solutions empowering SMEs and entrepreneurs.

“As we advance in 2025, we are firmly anchored by Project Momentum 2025–2030. This bold strategic blueprint guides our transformation into a diversified group structure that encompasses mortgage finance, housing microfinance, development, insurance, brokerage, and rental housing services.

“Among our ambitious goals are increasing shareholder value with a 20 percent return on equity, leading green sustainable housing initiatives, and significantly growing our customer base and loan portfolio,” he added.

The Lendlease Group (ASX: LLC) share price is in focus today after the company announced a ~$400 million sale of its interests in The Exchange TRX in Malaysia, and gave investors an update on its Capital Release Unit (CRU) for FY26.

What did Lendlease report?

Binding agreement to sell a 40% interest in The Exchange TRX retail mall and full 60% interest in the adjacent office tower for ~$400 million

Lendlease retains a 20% interest in the retail mall and 60% stakes in the adjoining hotel and residential land plots

Targeting $2 billion in capital recycling from the CRU during FY26

Net debt reduction target: 15% Group gearing by the end of FY26, excluding hybrid benefit

CRU expected to post a loss in 1H FY26 due to transaction delays and higher holding costs

What else do investors need to know?

Lendlease's $400 million sale to Malaysia's Valiram Family Office forms part of a broader push to recycle capital and strengthen its balance sheet. The transaction—which is still subject to financing and third-party approvals—is expected to complete in the second half of FY26.

The company continues to pursue exclusive negotiations for the sale of its remaining share in Keyton, with further ~$1 billion in CRU asset sales in progress. However, delays in transaction timing mean anticipated cash inflows of ~$1 billion, initially expected in the first half, are now forecast for the second half of FY26.

On the back of these delays, Lendlease expects higher than previously forecast gearing in 1H FY26, reaching the mid- to high-30% range (excluding a 7% hybrid securities benefit to statutory gearing).

What did Lendlease management say?

Lendlease Group CEO Tony Lombardo said:

We are pleased to announce further progress on our capital recycling initiatives, with $400 million to be released from the high quality Exchange TRX retail mall and office assets. We continue to be highly active on capital recycling, with more than $3 billion of transactions underway for the second half of the financial year. This includes $2 billion of announced or advanced stage capital recycling initiatives across our segments.

What's next for Lendlease?

Lendlease says it remains focused on its ~$2 billion capital recycling target from the CRU in FY26, including asset disposals already announced and ongoing sales processes. The group has also flagged significant planned capital expenditure on growth projects like One Circular Quay and Victoria Harbour, which are expected to deliver more than $1 billion in proceeds upon settlement in FY27.

No specific earnings guidance has been provided for the CRU segment for FY26. Management is balancing speed of execution with achieving value for shareholders as it completes these transactions.

Lendlease share price snapshot

Over the past 12 months, Lendlease shares have declined 20%, trailing the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) which has risen 6% over the same period.

[TITLE]Activist Ananym Capital urges LKQ to sell its European auto parts business:
[TEXT]
Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.

Activist: Ananym Capital Management

Ownership: 0.39%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

What's happening

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

Behind the scenes

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers.

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers.

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint.

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount.

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000 . However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock.

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment.

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries.

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA.

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA.

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price.

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone , and Genuine Parts , may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that.

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time.

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders.

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

[TITLE]Holiday Trading, Inflation Data and Other Key Things to Watch this Week:
[TEXT]
Markets enter the final full week of 2025 with a significantly abbreviated trading schedule as the Christmas holiday brings early closures and reduced participation that will likely result in light volume and muted price action.

Wednesday features an early 1:00pm close for Christmas Eve, followed by markets closed Thursday for Christmas Day, before normal trading hours resume on Friday.

Despite the holiday-shortened schedule, the week delivers several important economic releases including Monday's Core PCE Price Index, Tuesday's Q3 GDP revision and consumer confidence data, and Wednesday morning's durable goods orders and initial jobless claims before the early close.

The light earnings calendar and reduced institutional participation create an environment where technical factors and year-end positioning adjustments may drive price action more than fundamental developments.

Markets will be digesting last week's economic data deluge that included mixed employment numbers, stubborn inflation readings, and earnings from Micron (MU), FedEx (FDX), and Nike (NKE) as participants look ahead to final 2025 positioning and early 2026 outlook development.

Here are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.

Core PCE and Final Inflation Assessment

Monday's Core PCE Price Index at 10:00am represents the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and serves as a final comprehensive inflation checkpoint before year-end, following last week's concerning CPI data that showed persistent price pressures. Both month-over-month and year-over-year readings will be analyzed for evidence supporting or contradicting the sticky inflation narrative that has complicated the Fed's policy outlook heading into 2026. The PCE report often provides different perspectives than CPI due to methodological differences in weighting and components, making the comparison between the two measures particularly important for understanding complete inflation dynamics. Any significant upside surprise could reinforce concerns that the Fed may need to pause its cutting cycle earlier than previously expected, while benign readings could provide some relief heading into the new year. The timing on the Monday before Christmas creates potential for muted market reactions given reduced participation, though any major deviation from expectations could still trigger positioning adjustments in rate-sensitive sectors before the holiday break.

Economic Growth and Consumer Sentiment Convergence

Tuesday delivers a dual snapshot of economic fundamentals through the Q3 GDP revision at 8:30am and consumer confidence report at 10:00am that together will provide final perspectives on growth momentum and household sentiment heading into 2026. The GDP revision will offer updated insights into third-quarter economic expansion, with particular focus on consumer spending, business investment, and net export contributions that determine underlying economic health. Any significant revisions to previous estimates could influence perceptions

RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson said the talks left the firm feeling positive. The analyst noted that even with some higher investments in 2026, Uber Technologies, Inc.’s (NYSE:UBER) management shared plans to “durably sustain mid to high teens growth for the foreseeable future with margin leverage.”

RBC and Mizuho Stay Positive on Uber Technologies (UBER)

Discussions also touched on autonomous vehicle (AV) strategies. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) sees its financing plans as a competitive advantage. RBC Capital expects market and partner growth for AV initiatives next year. The research firm also noted that the company’s management demonstrated “open-mindedness” on capital allocation. However, share buybacks are still the main focus for now.

Earlier, on December 11, Mizuho also reiterated an Outperform rating on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) with a price target of $130.

(NYSE:UBER) has announced plans for a big investment in Japan over the next five years to target what it sees as the biggest taxi market in the world.

[TITLE]TEXRail expansion moving forward with revised $33M contract:
[TEXT]
Plans to expand a popular Fort Worth passenger rail line are progressing.

Trinity Metro isn’t quite ready to start building its 2.1-mile extension from downtown to the Medical District but it is taking steps forward. The agency’s board authorized early-work contract amendments for a construction manager at risk — a consultant who will manage the project from design to completion while monitoring costs. The contract with Fort Worth Transit Partners was first approved in June 2023.

A nearly $33.1 million revised contract now includes an updated contingency fee for potential cost increases.

Richey Thompson, Trinity Metro chief engineer, said the revised contract is essentially the beginning of the expansion project.

“I’m excited to be here today — finally,” Thompson told board members Nov. 17. “Today’s item is basically the initial step for Trinity Metro to start the construction and completion of the TEXRail extension project. … We’re getting closer.”

Thompson said the contract will be essentially split into two phases — the first phase covers long-range procurement items under the Guaranteed Maximum Price such as steel acquisition and special track work while the second will cover remaining items.

The 27.2-mile TEXRail line — which had a near 12% increase in ridership during 2025 — is exceeding the expectations of agency officials.

Rich Andreski, president and CEO of Trinity Metro, said the transit agency seeks to be the “preferred choice for simple, safe and innovative mobility services” as total system ridership exceeded more than 8 million trips in 2025.

“Yes, we do move people on various services, but it is really about powering our economy, providing access to jobs and other (opportunities) in Fort Worth and Tarrant County,” he said.

With some leadership changes in 2025, projects are moving along quicker, Andreski said.

“We’ve made substantial progress on our TEXRail to the Medical District extension project,” he said.

In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced a $25 million RAISE grant for Trinity Metro to expand TEXRail to the Near Southside neighborhood. Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity — or RAISE — grants are discretionary federal funds awarded to support state and local transportation projects.

Although the estimated $167 million-plus project still needs up to $20 million to begin construction, the grant is intended to aid in building a 2.1-mile extension from the T&P Station to a site in the 2100 block of Mistletoe Boulevard near Baylor Scott & White All Saints Medical Center – Fort Worth.

Trinity Metro hasn’t determined when construction will start, although it was once scheduled to start in 2024, according to the federal grant summary.

Design work

Officials plan to remove and replace the train crossing at Mistletoe and implement Leslie Street culvert extensions.

The RAISE grant will aid in the construction of the station, platforms and canopy tracks, signals, parking and pedestrian and bicycle connections. Trinity Metro plans to demolish and reconstruct the platform of the T&P Station to accommodate the expansion.

Agency officials said they are confident they can acquire another $20 million needed to begin construction.

Trinity Metro hired Huitt-Zollars and TranSystems as the final design consultants in August 2023 to nail down project costs. The firms worked on the initial TEXRail designs when the first line opened in 2019.

Ridership gains

Ridership on TEXRail grew to more than 877,000 trips in 2025, nearly more than 100,000 trips recorded in 2024, agency data shows. That line now connects with the new Silver Line route operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit that launched on Oct. 25.

About 100 to 150 new TEXRail riders are coming daily from the Silver Line that stretches from DFW Airport to Collin County, said Brad Beason, Trinity Metro manager of rail operations.

“We’ve noticed that jump already,” Beason said.

TEXRail’s ridership is “meteoric” — growth that is usually not seen by most transit agencies, Andreski said. Usually agencies see growth at 2% to 3%.

“TEXRail is exceeding all expectations,” he said.

In response, Trinity Metro doubled its mid-day TEXRail schedule to run more daytime trains to popular stops such as DFW Airport and downtown Grapevine. The agency even added more nighttime trains on some Saturday nights in December to accommodate passengers interested in visiting Grapevine for holiday activities and events.

The line’s ridership gains show no part in slowing down, Andreski said, noting that the service is coming up on its eighth year.

[TITLE]North American Construction Group Strengthens its Presence in Western Australia with the Acquisition of Iron Mine Contracting, a Diversified Mining Services Contractor:
[TEXT]
ACHESON, Alberta, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- North American Construction Group Ltd. (“NACG” or the “Company”) (TSX:NOA/NYSE:NOA) today announced that it has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement to acquire Iron Mine Contracting (“IMC”), a privately owned Western Australian diversified mining services contractor. The acquisition is valued at approximately $115 million (“the Transaction”). Concurrent with this announcement, the Company is providing a year-end update on its infrastructure and fleet optimization initiatives, along with its 2026 financial outlook. All references to dollars are in Canadian dollars.

Acquisition of Iron Mine Contracting

IMC is a diversified mining services contractor headquartered in Western Australia. The company provides a full suite of services, including contract mining, crushing, civil and tailings services to a blue-chip customer base. Its operations span key commodity sectors such as gold, iron ore and lithium backed by an established track record of safe and profitable operations.

IMC boasts a strong order book, currently exceeding $1.0 billion and including a recently awarded lithium mining contract with a three-year term. This backlog is supported by a strong pipeline of large mining and civil projects.

Joe Lambert, President and Chief Executive Officer of NACG, commented: “IMC represents a natural and strategic extension of our business into the Western Australian market. The IMC team has built a high-quality business with strong margins sharing NACG’s core culture of operational and safety excellence. This acquisition provides a great foundation to fast track our Western Australia growth strategy which is considered a global powerhouse for base metals, precious metals and critical & rare earth minerals. Combined with the MacKellar Group, we are now an Australian Tier 1 contractor capable of executing complex scopes across the entirety of Australia. IMC is a well-run business in a great market presenting a clear opportunity for low-capital growth by leveraging our underutilized Canadian assets and our highly skilled in-house maintenance team experienced in major component and whole machine rebuilds.”

“Partnering with NACG and the MacKellar Group is a strategic accelerator for IMC, allowing us to meet our customers’ expanding needs within a strong market. This significantly scales our growth potential while preserving the strong culture, agility and customer focus that have always defined our business,” said Clinton Keenan, Chief Executive Officer of IMC. “We look forward to immediately leveraging NACG’s balance sheet and extensive equipment fleet to pursue a greater number of larger projects as this partnership will surely expand our client base and commodity market presence.”

Highlights of the Transaction

The total estimated consideration of $115 million represents 2.5x of expected EBITDA in 2026, calculated prior to any realized synergies. The acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive, increasing NACG’s incremental earnings per share by approximately 20% in 2026.

The Transaction will be fully funded by senior-secured bank financing (65% of the purchase price) and vendor-provided debt financing (35% of the purchase price).

The estimated upfront payment of approximately $40 million will be funded by the Company’s existing revolving credit facility. In addition, NACG plans to assume secured equipment financing of $35 million. The remaining $40 million of the consideration will be addressed through structured earn-out and deferred payment mechanisms payable to the vendors over the next four years.

Strategic Rationale for and Highlights of the Acquisition

The acquisition of IMC is immediately accretive and strategically transformative for NACG, delivering key benefits:

Increased exposure to rare earth & critical minerals in Western Australia: step-change in geographic and commodity diversification with Western Australia set to immediately grow from 5% to 15% of our total earnings;

[TITLE]Forman Capital Provides $37M Construction Financing for Houston-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Ferguson Family Partners has secured $37.1 million in construction financing to build The Oaks of District West, a 10-building mixed-use center outside of Houston, Texas, Commercial Observer can first report.

Forman Capital provided the construction loan, while Daniel Eidson of Concord Summit Capital arranged the transaction.

Scott Mehlman, chief investment officer and partner at Forman Capital, noted in a statement that the Richmond submarket of Houston, where The Oak of District West will be located, has experienced a surge in residential building in recent years, but retail has failed to keep pace.

“Our client is addressing a clear market gap, and the early leasing momentum speaks to both the strength of the location and the quality of the concept,” said Mehlman.

The open-air project is already 70 percent pre-leased in its 15 tenant spaces, even though construction is expected to last until the third quarter of 2027. Tenants include Pacific Coast Tacos, Virtual Golf Bar, Pecan Jack’s Ice Cream, and Picklr, a national indoor pickleball company.

Located at 21711 FM-1093 in Richmond, Texas, directly off the Westpark Tollway and South Peak Road, The Oaks of District West will span more than 87,000 square feet across 10 buildings on a site that sits 30 miles southwest of Downtown Houston.

Brett Forman, managing partner of Forman Capital, said in a statement that the new retail center will tap into the affluent residential community within the Richmond area.

“The Oaks of District West aligns directly with Forman Capital’s retail thesis of investing in necessity-driven centers in affluent residential markets,” he said.

[TITLE]Affinius Capital Provides $81M Construction Loan for Arizona State Student Housing – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Fields Holdings has secured $81.2 million to finance the construction of the Samuel, a 14-story student housing property that will boast 224 units on Arizona State University’s main campus in Tempe, Commercial Observer can first report.

Affinius Capital provided the construction financing, while CBRE’s Scott Williams arranged the transaction.

Affinius Capital Senior Vice President Tyler Figley described the Samuel in a statement as a “high-quality” student housing property that sits on a prime location within the sprawling Arizona State campus. Figley said the apartment complex will likely “capture demand” from the growing enrollment at ASU, which currently has roughly 56,000 students in Tempe.

“We look forward to working with Fields Holdings, which has the experience to execute on this caliber of project,” he added.

Located at 706 South College Avenue near Downtown Tempe, the Samuel will deliver 408 beds and also feature 8,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The units will be organized as studios to three-bedroom apartments, and the building will include a swimming pool, a basketball court, an outdoor courtyard, a fitness center, and several lounges with media spaces for students to access

Fields Holdings did not respond to requests for comment.

[TITLE]Is TransDigm Group (TDG) One of the Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?:
[TEXT]
TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) is one of the best aerospace and defense stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts. TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) commands a consensus Buy rating on Wall Street. The average price target for the stock is $1568.46, implying 23.45% upside from current levels.

​Bank of America Touts TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG) Growth Metrics amid Robust Business Model

The consensus bullish rating coincides with Bank of America Securities analyst Ronald Epstein reiterating a Buy rating on the stock on November 17. According to the investment bank, the company boasts a robust business model and growth potential. Its performance is driven by strong pricing power and disciplined execution in the commercial aerospace aftermarket.

The company’s outlook also remains positive following the addressing of OEM destocking concerns. Bank of America expects opportunities in the defense sector to continue being a growth driver for revenue and cash generation. Strategic focus on mergers and acquisitions, along with effective capital deployment, affirms the company’s ability to generate long-term value.

The investment bank also expects the aftermarket and defense sectors to drive TransDigm’s margin opportunities through 2026. Improved visibility into original equipment manufacturer operations and stable production rates at Boeing and Airbus strengthen the long-term outlook. Strong cash generation and liquidity position should allow the company to pursue acquisitions to unlock new growth opportunities.

TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) designs, produces, and supplies highly engineered aircraft components, systems, and subsystems for nearly all commercial and military aircraft. It focuses on critical parts like pumps, valves, actuators, seatbelts, and flight controls, often through a strategy of acquiring specialized, market-leading aerospace companies with proprietary products and strong aftermarket sales.

While we acknowledge the potential of TDG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Defence, aerospace firms have designs on niche engineers from IITs, competing with Big Tech:
[TEXT]
Prolonged affair

“Space is a slow-burn industry, where revenue generation is a prolonged affair and is hinged more upon technological progress—even though geopolitics is catching up fast,” said Chaitanya Giri, space and geopolitics fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. “The private defence space, however, is scaling early, driven by the spate of geopolitical conflicts today. With specialized prototype development a key part of how companies can differentiate themselves, companies are likely to start hiring heavily for this.”

There are plenty of conventional indicators that signal that a product is turning heads: Weekly active user figures start to soar, products fly off the shelves, there is unsolicited praise.

But for San Diego-based Shield AI, validation has looked a little different. In April of this year, Russian armed forces fired two HESA Shahed 136 missiles into a hangar in Kyiv, where a team of 30 Shield AI employees had been doing research and development just two weeks earlier. The missiles turned the facility into a skeleton of twisted metal and rubble, according to a photo and video footage reviewed by Fortune.

Incredibly, no one was harmed. James Lythgoe, a former U.K. Royal Marine who is now Shield AI’s managing director of Ukrainian operations, had moved the Shield AI employees to a new site, as he had been concerned
