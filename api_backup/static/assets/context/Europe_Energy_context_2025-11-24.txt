European Energy has entered into a solar park operations agreement with Heartland, assuming responsibility for Gedmose solar park near Holstebro, Denmark, from January 2026.

This move marks the first time European Energy will operate a solar park it has not developed or owned, expanding its portfolio of operational activities within renewable energy.

The Gedmose solar park, owned by Heartland, was connected to the grid in 2021 and was Northern Europe’s largest at the time, with a capacity of 207MW.

Situated just outside Holstebro, the facility generates enough electricity to supply more than 50,000 households annually.

Under the new agreement, European Energy will further diversify its operational services.

The company currently is engaged in operational and asset management for 4GW of renewable energy capacity.

Electricity produced by the Gedmose solar park is sold to BESTSELLER, Normal, Nemlig.com, and Faerch under a power purchase agreement.

Heartland communications head Kasper Reggelsen said: “Gedmose solar park was established as part of our ambition to invest responsibly and with a long-term perspective in the green transition.

“In recent years, we have been reminded of the importance of a robust energy infrastructure that benefits everyone. We are pleased to gain a skilled partner to handle the day-to-day operations and ensure that the park continues to contribute efficiently to Denmark’s energy supply.”

European Energy plans to further expand its asset management and operations activities both in Denmark and across international markets.

European Energy asset management and operations EVP Jacob Saust Jacobsen said: “A key part of our strategic shift in asset management has been to offer our services to third-party owners – not only to the parks we develop ourselves.

“In recent years, we have also developed new technological solutions that enable us to optimise electricity production at a lower cost. Our ambition is for asset management to become a significant revenue driver for the company, and this agreement marks an important step forward in that direction.

“We therefore look forward to taking over the operations of Gedmose solar park and providing the owners with a stable and efficient partner.”

Last month, European Energy agreed to sell a 50% stake in its Saldus project in Latvia to Sampension, a Danish pension fund.

[TITLE]6 Democratic Governors Have Linked Arms With the GOP to Push Fossil Fuels:
[TEXT]
Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A bipartisan group of 13 governors is pushing to deregulate the permitting of energy infrastructure in the U.S., arguing that doing so is necessary to “win the AI race, lower costs for consumers, and responsibly develop the advanced energy sources of the future.”

But in reality, deregulating energy infrastructure construction would be a disastrous mistake that would increase greenhouse gas emissions and toxic pollution, further harming already polluted communities, and drive up utility bills by enabling proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

The bipartisan group of governors, which was led by Oklahoma Republican Kevin Stitt and Pennsylvania Democrat Josh Shapiro, sent a letter on October 28 to the leaders of several House and Senate committees urging them to deregulate the permitting of energy infrastructure. The group includes seven Republicans (Stitt plus Mike Braun from Indiana, Jeff Landry from Louisiana, Kelly Armstrong from North Dakota, Bill Lee from Tennessee, Spencer Cox from Utah, and Mark Gordon from Wyoming) and six Democrats (Shapiro plus Jared Polis from Colorado, Ned Lamont from Connecticut, Wes Moore from Maryland, Maura Healey from Massachusetts, and Dan McKee from Rhode Island).

Their letter essentially argues that all forms of energy are equally beneficial; that excessive regulation is impeding needed energy infrastructure; that a lack of energy infrastructure is raising utility bills; and that winning the “AI race” is in the public interest.

But every one of these assertions is demonstrably false. Let’s correct the record, one by one.

Some Energy Infrastructure Shouldn’t Be Built

There is a nearly universal scientific consensus today that building more fossil fuel infrastructure locks in growth in greenhouse gas emissions, precisely when we should be cutting them instead. Burning fossil fuels, of course, heats the planet. And building new infrastructure — even for supposed “bridge fuels” that could be phased out later on — creates costs that fossil fuel companies will want to recoup and profits that they’ll want to lock in for years.

All of the credible international institutions with expertise on the subject — including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN Environment Program, and the International Energy Agency — have concluded that we need to stop building fossil fuel infrastructure.

The International Court of Justice ruled in July 2025 that countries have an obligation under international law to phase out fossil fuels. Earlier, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea reached similar conclusions as the International Court of Justice.

The Trump administration officially rejects this overwhelming consensus, but its irrationality is no justification for governors from both parties to push for more fossil fuel infrastructure.

“Permitting Reform” Won’t Help Expand Renewable Energy

We undoubtedly need to build more renewable energy infrastructure. But “permitting reform” won’t help with that.

Peer-reviewed studies show that permitting requirements aren’t a major factor in obstructing renewable energy. One study found that the vast majority of renewable energy projects are either subject to streamlined federal environmental review, or exempt from it altogether. Another study found that most delays in permitting under the National Environmental Policy Act are not attributable to stringency of the permitting process, but to staff shortages and turnover at permitting agencies (exacerbated by federal budget cuts), and delays in project developers submitting required information to agencies.

A real obstacle to expanding renewable energy is the “interconnection queue,” or the wait time for new power generation facilities to be connected to the grid. In 2023, the generation and storage capacity waiting in the interconnection queue (which overwhelmingly consisted of wind, solar, and battery storage) was more than twice the existing grid-connected capacity, which was dominated by fossil energy.

A call for speeding up interconnection requests is one thing the governors’ letter gets right. One of their proposals is to require grid operators to fulfill interconnection requests by new generation and storage facilities within six months of receiving a complete application. That makes sense.

Today, there are two other factors obstructing renewable energy growth.

One is the repeal of tax credits for renewable energy. Under the GOP budget bill signed into law in July, tax credits for residential solar energy — essential for expanding distributed renewables — expire at the end of 2025. Tax credits for utility-scale solar and wind energy projects that commence construction after July 4, 2026, are ineligible for the tax credit if they are placed into service after December 31, 2027, creating significant uncertainty for new projects.

A solar or wind energy developer planning to build a new project today is under pressure to complete all pre-construction activities (site selection, land acquisition, obtaining financing and permits, etc.) before July 4, 2026. Otherwise, they face an 18-month deadline to complete all of these steps, plus construction, to qualify for tax credits.

Another factor is the Trump administration’s arbitrary cancellation of offshore wind energy leasing and permits for already permitted wind energy projects. Why bother building a wind energy project if the administration can just cancel it for ideological reasons?

“Permitting Reform” Won’t Lower Electricity Bills

Electric utility rates for residential customers reached a three-year high in August 2025, causing serious hardship.

In 2020-2021 (the last time the U.S. government collected residential energy consumption data), 27 percent of all households, 52 percent of Black and Indigenous households, and 57 percent of households with an annual income below $10,000 had difficulty paying their utility bills. Today, these numbers are almost certain to be higher.

Two key factors are to blame. One, our energy mix contains too much of the wrong kind of generation capacity. Solar and onshore wind are significantly cheaper than natural gas or nuclear energy, but renewable energy projects are waiting in line to be connected while our grid is still dependent on old, expensive fossil and nuclear power plants.

Accelerating the transition to renewables will help lower bills. But as we’ve seen, permitting “reform” won’t help with this transition.

Another factor, determined by analyses by the Union of Concerned Scientists and Bloomberg News, is the proliferation of data centers to power the internet — and increasingly, to provide the computational capacity to run AI.

The AI industry is increasing the load on the grid, and passing the costs of needed generation, transmission, and distribution upgrades on to households. It’s not an altogether new phenomenon. Residential customers consistently pay higher rates than commercial and industrial customers, subsidizing big corporations through their bills.

The “AI Race” Harms the Public Interest

Winning the “AI race” and lowering costs for consumers are mutually exclusive — unless utility rate structures are reformed to make large commercial and industrial customers pay the full cost of their added load on the grid.

Utility rate structures are set by state legislators and public utility commissions. If these governors were serious

[TITLE]Xcel Energy seeks $355.5M revenue hike, increasing residential bills nearly 10% on average:
[TEXT]
Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has asked state regulators for an increase of $355.5 million to its rate base, which would boost the average residential electric bill by nearly 10% per month.

Xcel filed the proposal Friday with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which will take testimony from the company and various intervening parties and hold a public hearing. If approved, the increase would take effect in September 2026.

Xcel Energy-Colorado President Robert Kenney said the utility’s last increase to the rate base was in 2022. The average residential bill rose by 3.2%, according to an Xcel statement after an agreement was reached with all the parties

The rate base is a utility’s investments to provide services and on which it’s allowed to earn a regulated rate of return.

“This rate case is to recover costs associated with investments that we’ve made over the last three years,” Kenney said.

The Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, said the proposed increase is “too big of an increase.”

“It’s an especially large increase given the context of the economic times,” said Joseph Pereira, UCA deputy director.

The increase is largely related to Xcel’s expanded capital spending on distribution, transmission and generation, Pereira said.

“It’s unclear to parties in the UCA that the company is prioritizing investments that are the biggest bang for the buck, that increase reliability and that adopt an intelligent approach to how they’re using the grid,” Pereira said. “It still appears that the company is using a crude blanket approach to replacing and investing in new infrastructure.”

Kenney said Xcel has invested in safety, reliability, making the system more resilient, electrifying transportation and buildings, meeting increased demands from growth and taking steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Xcel has said it has reduced carbon emissions by 57%. The state’s target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.

Xcel is upgrading its electric grid with a $1.7 billion transmission project. The Colorado Power Pathway includes transmission lines, power substations and other equipment stretching over 12 counties, mostly in eastern Colorado.

“We’ve added a tremendous amount of renewable energy over the last several years,” Kenney said. “And we’ve done all of this while keeping bills as low as possible.”

Xcel has faced criticism from the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, and customers over the past few years for what the UCA has called “a pancaking of rate increases.”

The criticism of Xcel and other regulated utilities heated up in 2023 after a cold winter and high natural gas prices sent costs soaring statewide. A legislative committee held hearings and approved a bill intended to protect customers against future price shocks and level what some see as a playing field tilted in the utilities’ favor.

Kenney said Xcel Energy’s rates have been well below state and national averages for approximately the last 10 years. But, he added, the company recognizes that some customers face challenges to paying their bills. He said Xcel is expanding its programs to help people struggling to pay their bills and adding $10 million in assistance. People can also call 800-895-4999.

In the past, Xcel required people to show proof of income to apply for help, but now will accept their statements of need. And those receiving other aid, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will be automatically eligible.

Under Xcel’s proposed rate hike, the average monthly residential bill would rise 9.9%; small commercial bills would go up 9.3%-9.4% per month; and large commercial monthly bills would increase 7.3%-8.6%.

[TITLE]Fossil fuel dispute stalls COP30 as climate talks extend into weekend:
[TEXT]
BELEM: Negotiations at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, have run into overtime as delegates remain deadlocked over the inclusion of fossil fuels in the final agreement. The summit, originally scheduled to conclude Friday evening, is now set to spill over into the weekend with no deal reached.

Delegates from nearly 200 countries engaged in closed-door discussions Saturday evening, focusing on adjustments to three key contentious issues: reducing fossil fuel consumption, financial aid from developed nations to developing countries, and tensions over carbon border taxes. Observers say these disputes have slowed efforts to secure a unified agreement to accelerate global emissions reductions.

A new draft agreement, unveiled earlier this week by host Brazil, omitted references to both “fossil fuels” and the “roadmap” for transitioning away from them, despite President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s earlier public support for such a plan. European Union climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra criticized the draft as “unacceptable,” warning that the summit could end without a deal.

“Clearly, what is now on the table is no deal,” Hoekstra told reporters. Some EU member states are reportedly considering walking out, fearing blame if talks collapse.

The conference has faced additional disruptions, including a fire that damaged the venue’s roof and two Indigenous-led protests earlier in the week.

Calls for consensus

Thirty-six countries, including developed nations, emerging economies, and small island states, have demanded a plan to phase out oil, coal, and gas, threatening to reject any agreement that does not address fossil fuels. France’s ecological transition minister Monique Barbut pointed to opposition from oil-rich Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as coal producer India and several emerging countries.

Some observers argue that developing nations need a careful approach to maintain energy security and ensure a just transition for workers dependent on fossil fuel industries. “To assume that one side cares

[TITLE]COP30 delegates agree to a last-minute deal that falls short of expectations:
[TEXT]
The agreement does not include a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels worldwide.

It took an extra day, but delegates at COP30, the United Nations' climate conference, have reached a deal on a final agreement.

The agreement, however, falls far short of the high expectations many delegates, environmental groups and non-governmental organizations had going into the annual conference in Belém, Brazil.

Despite more than 80 countries calling for a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels worldwide, the primary cause of human-amplified climate change, that demand did not make it into the final text.

Although the conference took place in what's called the "gateway to the Amazon," the COP30 agreement also doesn't include any significant new initiatives to stop deforestation and protect the Amazon rainforest, known as "the lungs of the planet."

"The venue bursting into flames couldn't be a more apt metaphor for COP30's catastrophic failure to take concrete action to implement a funded and fair fossil fuel phaseout," Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement to ABC News, referencing a fire that broke out Thursday at the COP30 venue.

"These negotiations keep hitting a wall because wealthy nations profiting off polluting fossil fuels fail to offer the needed financial support to developing countries and any meaningful commitment to move first," she added.

Appearing to acknowledge the disappointment of some delegates and environmental and climate groups that the final agreement didn't include the roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago said during his remarks during the closing plenary that he would use his authority as the COP30 president to create the roadmaps himself.

These roadmaps would not be binding, however, because they weren't part of the approved agreement and aren't backed by all 195 countries.

"I, as president of COP30, will therefore create two roadmaps. One on halting and reverting deforestation, another to transitioning away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner," do Lago said during the final plenary session.

The World Resources Institute (WRI), an environmental research organization that sent a delegation to COP30, said that while there were some notable successes during the nearly two week conference, it didn't deliver on what many delegates and advocates were hoping it would.

"COP30 delivered breakthroughs to triple adaptation finance, protect the world's forests and elevate the voices of Indigenous people like never before. This shows that even against a challenging geopolitical backdrop, international climate cooperation can still deliver results," Ani Dasgupta, the president and CEO of WRI, said in a statement to ABC News.

"But many will leave Belém disappointed that negotiators couldn't agree to develop a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels. More than 80 countries stood their ground for a fair and equitable shift off fossil fuels, but intense lobbying from a few petrostates weakened the deal," she added.

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) expressed disappointment that a stronger agreement couldn't be reached but praised the delegates for making progress in some areas.

"The barely adequate outcome salvaged in the final hours of COP30 keeps the Paris Agreement alive but exposes the monumental failures of rich countries--including the United States and European Union nations--to live up to the commitments they made under that agreement," Dr. Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS, said in a statement to ABC News.

Cleetus acknowledged that the conference saw some progress in several key areas, including "a nod to tripling adaptation finance," although she said that the specific details of how that will be implemented were left out of the text.

"On a positive note, the COP30 outcome includes a very encouraging agreement to develop a just transition mechanism to help enable a fair, funded transformation to a clean energy future with social and economic safeguards for workers and communities," she said.

The Center for Biological Diversity praised delegates for the "establishment of a first-ever just transition mechanism for workers, Indigenous peoples and frontline communities transitioning to renewable energy economies."

These initiatives will focus on ensuring that the shift to a low-carbon economy is fair to workers, communities, and ecosystems.

"It's a big win to have the Belém Action Mechanism established with the strongest-ever COP language around Indigenous and worker rights and biodiversity protection," said Su of the Center for Biological Diversity.

"The BAM agreement is in stark contrast to this COP's total flameout on implementing a funded and fair fossil fuel phaseout," Su added.

In his closing remarks, do Lago acknowledged that the outcomes of COP30 may disappoint many.

"I know some of you had higher ambitions," said do Lago. "I know youth and civil society will demand we do more," he said. "I will try not to disappoint you during my presidency."

Next year's COP31 will be held in Antalya, Turkey, with Australia leading the negotiations.

This rare splitting of responsibilities was part of an agreement to end a standoff between Turkey and Australia over who would host the event.

[TITLE]EIB backs Edison’s energy transition with major financing:
[TEXT]
BAKU, Azerbaijan, November 22. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is providing up to €800 million to support Edison’s investment plan aimed at promoting Italy’s energy transition, Trend reports via the EIB.

The funding will be structured through several loan agreements, with the first €200 million agreement signed today at Palazzo Edison during a meeting between EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti and Edison CEO Nicola Monti.

The financing will support Edison’s development in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and public lighting. Thanks to the significant contribution of the projects to REPowerEU objectives, the EIB will cover up to 75% of project costs, exceeding the standard 50% threshold under its Energy Lending Policy.

The investments align with Edison’s strategy as a responsible operator and Italy’s national energy and climate plan. In 2023, Edison formalised its commitment to ensure 75% of its investments comply with the EU taxonomy by 2030. In 2024, over half of Edison’s EBITDA came from renewables, flexibility instruments, customer solutions, and services.

The favorable financial terms of the EIB loans, supported by the Bank’s AAA credit rating, will underpin Edison’s sustainable growth and energy transition ambitions.

The rapid expansion of data centers in Texas is driving electricity demand higher during the winter, compounding the risk of supply shortfalls that could lead to blackouts during freezing temperatures. The Lone Star state is attracting a huge amount of data center requests, driven by its abundant renewable energy and natural gas resources as well as its business friendly environment. OpenAI, for example, is developing its flagship Stargate campus in Abilene,

[TITLE]Xcel Energy seeks $355.5M revenue hike, increasing residential bills nearly 10% on average:
[TEXT]
Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has asked state regulators for an increase of $355.5 million to its rate base, which would boost the average residential electric bill by nearly 10% per month.

Xcel filed the proposal Friday with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which will take testimony from the company and various intervening parties and hold a public hearing. If approved, the increase would take effect in September 2026.

Xcel Energy-Colorado President Robert Kenney said the utility’s last increase to the rate base was in 2022. The average residential bill rose by 3.2%, according to an Xcel statement after an agreement was reached with all the parties

The rate base is a utility’s investments to provide services and on which it’s allowed to earn a regulated rate of return.

“This rate case is to recover costs associated with investments that we’ve made over the last three years,” Kenney said.

The Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, said the proposed increase is “too big of an increase.”

“It’s an especially large increase given the context of the economic times,” said Joseph Pereira, UCA deputy director.

The increase is largely related to Xcel’s expanded capital spending on distribution, transmission and generation, Pereira said.

“It’s unclear to parties in the UCA that the company is prioritizing investments that are the biggest bang for the buck, that increase reliability and that adopt an intelligent approach to how they’re using the grid,” Pereira said. “It still appears that the company is using a crude blanket approach to replacing and investing in new infrastructure.”

Kenney said Xcel has invested in safety, reliability, making the system more resilient, electrifying transportation and buildings, meeting increased demands from growth and taking steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Xcel has said it has reduced carbon emissions by 57%. The state’s target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.

Xcel is upgrading its electric grid with a $1.7 billion transmission project. The Colorado Power Pathway includes transmission lines, power substations and other equipment stretching over 12 counties, mostly in eastern Colorado.

“We’ve added a tremendous amount of renewable energy over the last several years,” Kenney said. “And we’ve done all of this while keeping bills as low as possible.”

Xcel has faced criticism from the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, and customers over the past few years for what the UCA has called “a pancaking of rate increases.”

The criticism of Xcel and other regulated utilities heated up in 2023 after a cold winter and high natural gas prices sent costs soaring statewide. A legislative committee held hearings and approved a bill intended to protect customers against future price shocks and level what some see as a playing field tilted in the utilities’ favor.

Kenney said Xcel Energy’s rates have been well below state and national averages for approximately the last 10 years. But, he added, the company recognizes that some customers face challenges to paying their bills. He said Xcel is expanding its programs to help people struggling to pay their bills and adding $10 million in assistance. People can also call 800-895-4999.

In the past, Xcel required people to show proof of income to apply for help, but now will accept their statements of need. And those receiving other aid, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will be automatically eligible.

Under Xcel’s proposed rate hike, the average monthly residential bill would rise 9.9%; small commercial bills would go up 9.3%-9.4% per month; and large commercial monthly bills would increase 7.3%-8.6%.

[TITLE]How to make the data center buildout in North Carolina cleaner, cheaper and more predictable:
[TEXT]
Data centers are popping up all across the nation, causing electric utilities to grapple with how to provide for these new power-hungry customers while managing costs — and North Carolina is no different.

A recent hearing at the North Carolina Utilities Commission focused on how to handle data centers, a.k.a. “Large Load” customers, who are driving up electricity demand and creating a “who pays for what” conundrum.

EDF put forward expert witnesses Jeff Bower and Karan Pol of Daymark Energy Advisors, who have experience working in states across the country grappling with the same problems. Our expert witnesses had two main recommendations in their written and oral testimony:

Improve forecasts of data center load to avoid unnecessary investments and emissions; and

Protect existing customers from bearing the brunt of cost impacts and reduce uncertainty around the data center buildout by using “large load tariffs.”

Achieving these objectives won’t be easy, but it’s critical that we develop sustainable solutions that insulate households while meeting the energy needs of this growing industry.

Large load tariffs

Across the country we are seeing many states attempting to limit the cost risks to their shareholders and customers by negotiating what are commonly called “large load tariffs” — custom rates and standardized contracts that utilities institute for large new projects above a certain threshold of annual electricity usage — which usually includes data centers. In other words, these are contracts that can protect households from footing the bill for the costs associated with data centers.

In North Carolina, this could take any number of forms. For example, stakeholders in Kansas came to agreement on the parameters of a structure and submitted it to their state commission for approval. In North Carolina, despite the announcement of a Clean Transition Tariff that Duke Energy worked on with a number of partners in May 2024, all such discussions have remained behind closed doors with no input from the public and no actual proposed tariff ever filed before the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

Fortunately, North Carolina has a good opportunity coming up to change that. Duke Energy recently filed notice that it will be initiating multi-year rate case proceedings before the end of 2025. These rate cases are exactly the kind of venue in which discussions

[TITLE]Can the ‘fog clear’ to deliver clean Irish offshore wind energy?:
[TEXT]
A turbine being installed at the Neart na Gaoithe offshore wind farm off the east coast of Scotland. Ireland has not built an offshore wind farm for 20 years.

The global offshore wind energy sector is in the doldrums due to hostility from Donald Trump; supply chain bottlenecks, planning uncertainties, and high costs.

The North Sea boasts of having the best wind speeds in the world – averaging 9 metres per second – and yet following the German government offer of two prime sites off its coastline recently, not one developer bid for a contract. Ireland has even better wind speeds from the Atlantic but it has not built an offshore wind farm in 20 years.

The world market for offshore renewable energy (ORE) has soured in less than 18 months. Trump’s scuppering of fully financed and permitted offshore wind farms has undermined mood music but higher interest rates, a row-back on net-zero ambitions, and energy companies weakening or abandoning decarbonisation commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels have all played a part.

Some 24 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity and offtake agreements were cancelled since 2023, according to energy analysts Wood Mackenzie. Just 1GW powers the equivalent of 1 million homes.

Last June, the Norwegian company Statkraft announced it is to stop further activities in new offshore wind projects, including floating wind, but will continue developing the 500MW North Irish Sea Array (NISA) in the Irish Sea.

Statkraft’s senior vice-president and managing director for Ireland and UK, Kevin O’Donovan, is well placed to outline why, despite the dismal global picture, Ireland is well placed to scale up its ORE. He provided that perspective at a recent National Economic and Social Council (Nesc) conference. It was a frank assessment layered with realistic optimism by prioritising ways forward.

Wind turbines in the Irish sea

Firstly, O’Donovan wants to underline progress made in Ireland over the past 25 years, with wind technology efficiency increasing by a factor of 20.

He recalls how, two decades ago, ESB National Grid (a forerunner to EirGrid) said that Ireland would never have more than 300-500MW of wind energy on our grid system. Any more and the system would break down.

“[Today] we have over 5,000 megawatts of wind on our system, and heading for two gigawatts of solar,” O’Donovan adds.

[ Fossil fuel dependence ‘is Ireland’s biggest block’ to achieving carbon emissions cutsOpens in new window ]

He was impressed by Minister for Energy Darragh O’Brien’s “positive vision for where we need to go”, with emphasis on delivery. The industry needs to “show people we can deliver on what needs to be achieved over the next decade and the technology is, for me, the way we will achieve that”.

Ireland stands out in Europe as a good market for renewables, with clear policy and plans backed by strong political consensus. We have had significant success but sometimes “get a little bit too focused on targets and the timing of those targets and on the net zero discussion”.

Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer and trader of renewables, yet even it would say “we can’t fully tell you right now how we’re going to get to net zero ... it would be far better focusing on we actually have the technologies right now to deliver 80 per cent of all our electricity [from renewables] by 2030 to 2031 or 2032, maybe”.

That amounts to huge electrification of Irish transport and heating sectors using wind and solar, the cheapest renewables – “and basically electrifying our economy”. This requires focus on delivery, recognising “every megawatt hour we get on the system, year-on-year for this next decade, is going to put us in a better position”.

Ireland stands out in Europe as a good market for renewables.

O’Donovan does not want to moan given significant progress but challenges needed to be overcome. Reforms to the Planning Act took too long and implementation could be another year. “We have very good aspirations and very good plans. It’s the implementation and the fast implementations where we fall down.”

Statkraft is one of the four projects with Offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS) contracts. It was in a position to easily complete it by 2030. It submitted its bid two years ago, assuming planning would be secured within 12 months. “Today, we are 16 months and counting since we submitted our planning application,” he says.

Statkraft had to print out 10,000 pages per application and submit up to 20 copies, which required hiring a van. “That alone shows where we need to start getting more efficient. For goodness sake, just digitise the thing. Every other country is doing that.”

More frustration followed, waiting nine months for An Bord Pleanála (now An Coimisiún Pleanála) to issue a “further information request”.

“What was issued is something that requires years of further surveys, millions of euros of further investment before we could even respond to all of the requests,” he says.

Statkraft then spent seven months waiting for the commission to have a meeting with it, to explain that it had provided much of the required information.

It will probably be mid-2027 before planning is granted. The Minister hoped turbines would be in the water by 2030 but “if we can’t have faster decision-making time, then that won’t happen”, O’Donovan says.
