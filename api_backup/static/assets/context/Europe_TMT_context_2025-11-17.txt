Harvard, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, has significantly ramped up its indirect Bitcoin exposure, sharply boosting its position in BlackRock’s spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).

While the allocation remains small relative to Harvard’s $56.9 billion academic endowment fund, it signals a longer-term investment strategy by traditional investors of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETF Is Now Harvard’s Biggest Public Investment

According to a Form 13F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university’s $50 billion endowment, held 6.8 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of September 30. The stake is worth around $442.8 million, up from $326 million from the 1,906,000 shares reported on June 30.

The Ivy League university’s allocation of IBIT shares ranked as its largest investment, placing it just ahead of its investment in Google’s parent company, Alphabet, Amazon, travel technology company Booking Holdings, and Meta.

IBIT, one of the most successfully launched exchange-traded funds in history, is a spot Bitcoin ETF that allows investors to gain exposure to the premier crypto without directly holding it.

Harvard joins an increasing number of universities adding regulated BTC products to their portfolios. Others include Brown University, which holds $13.8 million in IBIT shares.

The disclosure comes as spot Bitcoin funds witnessed massive outflows this week. The 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs bled roughly $869 million on Thursday, the second-largest single-day tally since the SEC greenlighted their Wall Street debut in 2024.

Despite a painful week for Bitcoin, which kicked off the week at over $107,000 before slumping below $95,000 on Friday, the university endowment disclosures signal growing institutional comfort with the asset class.

[TITLE]Phia, the buzzy AI shopping tool, was pulling far more user data than disclosed, security researchers say:
[TEXT]
Phia, an AI shopping agent co-founded by Bill Gates’ daughter Phoebe Gates, has been collecting more than just users’ fashion preferences through its desktop browser extension.

Four cybersecurity researchers told Fortune that the company’s browser extension, which is aimed at simplifying price comparisons for users, has been capturing a concerning amount of users’ information. In a previous version of the browser extension, researchers found that a snapshot of every web page a user of visited—including sites containing highly sensitive information such as bank statements and private emails—was transmitted back to Phia’s servers, even when users were not interacting with e-commerce sites.

The AI shopping startup is fresh off an $8 million seed round led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, with participation from high-profile investors including Hailey Bieber, Kris Jenner, and Sheryl Sandberg. In October, Phia was named one of TIME’s Best Inventions of 2025. Launched in April, the New York-based startup has since grown rapidly, reaching hundreds of thousands of users between the app and desktop browser extension.

Maahir Sharma, an ex-Meta software engineer based in Dublin, was the first to notice privacy issues with the AI browser extension.

“I began by testing it on Amazon,” he told Fortune. “But what really caught my attention was the number of requests being sent, transmitting product page details back to their servers.”

Transmitting retail site data for comparison and other AI-driven features was somewhat expected, he said, but after he noticed the same network calls were happening in the background while checking his Gmail, he was alarmed.

“Why was the extension making requests when I hadn’t interacted with it at all,” he said. “I discovered that the URL of every tab I visited was being logged, which was a red flag. Technically, this meant my complete browsing history could be reconstructed from this data alone.”

He went on to find that the extension wasn’t just tracking browsing behavior—it was quietly collecting full copies of every webpage a user opened and uploading it to Phia’s servers through a function buried in the code called “logCompleteHTMLtoGCS.”

In practice, that meant the extension was lifting the entire HTML—the behind-the-scenes text that tells a webpage how to look and function—compressing it, and sending the file back to the company’s servers through automated data-transfer calls known as API requests, researchers said. In other words, every page a user loaded was being replicated, packaged, and shipped off in the background, seemingly without users’ consent or knowledge.

“I tested it using a Revolut account while the extension was installed. And, unsurprisingly, that activity was logged as well,” he said, referring to the popular digital bank. “At that point, I was honestly at a loss for words.”

Sharma’s findings were reviewed by Fortune, replicated by three independent researchers, including Kushagra Sharma, a software engineer at Accolite, and reviewed by an additional two cybersecurity experts.

Late last week, after Sharma contacted Phia to alert them to the issue and request mitigation steps, the company removed the feature that collected users’ HTML pages, but did not disclose the potential privacy violation to users or confirm what had happened to the data that had been transmitted. Fortune is the first to report the privacy concerns.

Charlie Eriksen, a security researcher at Aikido Security, who reviewed the findings, said it was unclear why the original “archive” feature even existed in the browser extension.

“Not only do I not believe the ‘archive’ feature should ever have existed, and question why it was ever implemented, but they have no right to do any such thing under their own privacy policy,” he said. “I’ve seen quite a few messed-up things in my career. This one must be among some of the crazier things.”

A spokesperson for Phia said: “All versions of Phia, current and previous, performed logging in an aggregate and anonymous way for the purpose of identifying and discovering new retail websites. To determine when to appear, the extension previously logged webpage content to understand if the site was a shopping destination. It was also to identify and support additional retailers as they were discovered. Phia currently only logs URLs. Phia has never in the past, or at present stored this data.”

Privacy red flags

The amount of personal data that was transmitted to the company’s servers is highly unusual and could constitute a major privacy violation, according to cybersecurity experts and legal professionals who spoke to Fortune.

“The original version collected full page contents, and it was running as a background service. It collected pretty much all web pages for all users, which is a huge security and privacy violation,” Eyal Arazi, head of product strategy at LayerX Security which replicated Sharma’s findings, said.

According to Phia’s own privacy policy, the company “generally excludes personally identifiable information” and collects limited technical data only from “retail sites.” In a Chrome Store disclosure, the company also stated that users’ data is “not being used or transferred for purposes that are unrelated to the item’s core functionality.”

“Its privacy policy fails to highlight this scraping, and emphasizes ‘fundamental principles’ which seem to be in direct contradiction with the data they were actually collecting,” Alexandre Pauwels, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Cambridge who also analysed the browser extension, said. “Although Phia seems to have addressed the issue, this does not tell us whether or not they have deleted the data itself.”

Experts noted these practices not only appear to contradict the company’s public assurances

[TITLE]US slashes tariffs to 15% for Switzerland after reaching trade deal, boost bilateral investment:
[TEXT]
Live Events

Reduction of US tariffs on Swiss and Liechtenstein goods to a maximum of 15%, aligning them with rates applied to the European Union, down from 39%, which had severely impacted Swiss exports.

Switzerland's commitment to removing tariffs on American industrial goods, while also opening up new duty-free quota systems for specific U.S. agricultural products such as beef, poultry, and bison.

Measures to simplify customs and labeling processes, making it easier for American goods like poultry, dairy, and medical devices to enter Swiss markets.

Robust agreements on intellectual property rights, digital trade principles including the avoidance of harmful digital services taxes, and enhanced cooperation on export controls, sanctions, and investment screening.

Swiss plans to invest $200 billion in the U.S. by 2028, with substantial new investments focused on pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and other key sectors.

The United States and Switzerland announced a framework agreement which significantly reduces US tariffs on Swiss goods from a steep 39% to a balanced 15%, marking a major step in improving trade relations and addressing longstanding barriers.The deal also includes a commitment by Swiss and Liechtenstein companies to invest $200 billion in the US, with $67 billion slated for 2026 alone, aiming to create thousands of American jobs and reduce the US trade deficit with Switzerland.The agreement, announced by US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer and Swiss officials, reflects the successful culmination of constructive negotiations to promote “Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade."ALSO READ: Trump plots major tariff cuts to slash soaring grocery bills for millions of Americans Ambassador Greer highlighted the deal as a continuation of the "America First Trade Policy" that removes tariff and non-tariff barriers, expands market access for U.S. exports, and welcomes sizable Swiss investment into the US economy.Key features of the agreement include:Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said the agreement “puts Switzerland on an equal footing with the European Union.” The framework contains sectoral safeguards (the United States will cap tariffs at 15% for Swiss goods, and some sectors, notably pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, have special treatment or caps under the arrangement), but detailed implementation and any sectoral exemptions will be specified as negotiations proceed.The US trade deficit with Switzerland and Liechtenstein stood at $38.3 billion in 2024, and this agreement is expected to pave the way for levelling that deficit by 2028 by fostering more balanced, reciprocal trade ties.This trade deal ends months of tariff tensions that began when the Trump administration imposed the 39% tariffs in 2025 as part of a broader strategy to address trade imbalances and alleged unfair trade practices by key partners.The agreement is seen as a mutually beneficial framework that strengthens economic ties, secures supply chain resilience, and supports job growth on both sides of the Atlantic through expanded market access and substantial new investments.

The United States will slash its tariffs on goods from Switzerland to 15 percent from a crippling 39 percent under a new framework trade agreement that includes a pledge by Swiss companies to invest $200bn into the US by the end of 2028, the Swiss government has said.

The announcement by Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin on Friday brings the US tariff rate on Swiss goods in line with those from the European Union (EU). Parmelin told a news conference that the tariff reduction would provide relief for

[TITLE]US-China tech war: Nexperia saga exposes Europe's loosening grip on chip supply chain:
[TEXT]
"Chinese wafer fabs possess the technical capability to fulfil Nexperia's orders," said Arisa Liu, chief director and research fellow at Taiwan Industry Economics Services, a databank of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

Experts, however, suggested that Chinese fabs might be ready to supply the wafers needed by Nexperia's local facility.

Nexperia's Chinese management refused to comply with directives from its head office and planned to switch to local wafer suppliers, a transition that could take at least six months. Meanwhile, the Dutch headquarters warned clients that products from the Chinese facility may be substandard.

Nexperia's Chinese facility had relied on wafers from its fabrication plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, but those shipments were abruptly halted as the Dutch-based company grappled with an internal conflict.

Wafers, which are cut into dies, are the core materials in assembling integrated circuits used in computing, communications and power switch applications.

For nearly a month, parts of Nexperia's Dongguan production lines have sat idle. Two factory workers said this week that some machinery had been turned off due to a wafer shortage since late last month, with one estimating that a third of the machines were idled - echoing earlier reports by the Post.

The Nexperia saga, which has created a global car chip shortage, reveals a new reality: Europe's once-vaunted neutrality and industrial sovereignty are eroding, while China's foundational role in manufacturing has become too large to fail and too complex to legally unwind.

[TITLE]Global Drone Market Size Projected to Reach $163 Billion By 2030 as Technological Innovations Fuels Growth:
[TEXT]
MarketNewsUpdates News Commentary

NEW YORK, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Drones as a Service" (DaaS) industry outlook is extraordinarily strong, marked by rapid growth, increasing adoption across diverse industries, and significant technological advancements like AI integration. The market is projected to reach substantial values in the coming years, driven by the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of outsourced drone services. A recent report from Grand View Research projects that the global drone market size is estimated at USD 73.06 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 163.60 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.3% from 2025 to 2030.

This surge in demand across industries is expected to be one of the key growth drivers for the drone market in the coming years, especially as drone technology becomes more accessible and affordable. Another significant trend in the drone industry is the rise of Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS), where businesses can rent drones and drone-related services instead of purchasing them outright. This model is popular in industries that require drone services only periodically or in specific use cases, such as infrastructure inspection, surveying, or mapping. The ability to access drone technology without heavy upfront investment is democratizing the use of drones and making them more accessible to small businesses and industries with niche needs.” Active Companies in the drone industry this week include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (NYSE: UAVS), AIRO Group Holdings (NASDAQ: AIRO), Ondas Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ONDS), Unusual Machines, Inc. (NYSE American: UMAC).

Grand View Research concluded: “Key Market Trends & Insights Are: The North America drone industry dominated the market in 2024 with a share of over 39%; and The U.S. drone industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13% from 2025 to 2030. The North America drone industry dominated the market in 2024 with a share of over 39%, driven by the widespread adoption of drones for various commercial uses, particularly in sectors like agriculture, construction, and oil & gas. Companies in this region are leveraging drones for tasks such as crop monitoring, land surveying, infrastructure inspection, and pipeline monitoring. The rapid integration of advanced drone capabilities, coupled with supportive regulatory frameworks in countries like the U.S. and Canada, is significantly enhancing the adoption of drone technology across diverse industries.”

ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) Drone as a Service Drives 82% of Q3 2025 Revenue as Company Advances Toward Goal of 25 Acquisitions by Mid-2026 - ZenaTech, Inc. ($ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology business solution provider specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone as a Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS and Quantum Computing solutions, announces that its Drone as a Service segment accounted for 82% of Q3 2025 revenue, generating $3.57 million of the record $4.35 million for the quarter. This builds on a 60% Drone as a Service contribution in Q2 2025 as the company strengthens revenue concentration in the drone services segment from the software services segment. The Company continues to expand its current global DaaS footprint of 11 US acquisitions and two international company-owned locations, with a goal to have acquired a total of 25 new companies by mid-2026 to lead drone-powered surveying, mapping, inspections, power washing and precision agriculture.

“Drone as a Service is one of the key growth areas of our business moving forward,” said CEO Dr. Shaun Passley. “Our targeted expansion in land surveying and geospatial sectors reflects our strategy to bring advanced aerial intelligence, speed and cost efficiencies to industries and tasks overdue for innovation. We have a strong pipeline of international acquisition opportunities to integrate with our drones across sectors and are focused on building a global, branded tech-driven services platform that creates both customer and shareholder value.”

ZenaTech focuses on industries where there are processes ripe for drone automation—such as surveying, construction, renewable energy, infrastructure, utilities, maintenance, cleaning, and agriculture—that still rely on low tech or manual methods for tasks.

[TITLE]Musk's AI answer to Wikipedia pushes racist conspiracy theories and gets some basic facts wrong:
[TEXT]
AT THE END of October, Elon Musk launched his website Grokipedia, the billionaire’s latest attempt to shape the information people access online.

Alongside biases shown in descriptions of racist conspiracy theories, Grokipedia contains some straightforward factual errors – including misnaming the alleged attacker in the Parnell Square stabbing of 2023.

The website, whose content is all AI-generated, is supposed to be a counter-balance to what Musk and other prominent figures on the American right say is Wikipedia’s “left-biased” content.

On the day of the website’s launch, Musk said Grokipedia would carry “the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth”.

“We will never be perfect, but we shall nonetheless strive towards that goal,” he said on X.

Grokipedia’s release had been slated for the end of September, but was delayed to “purge out the propaganda”, Musk said.

Academic research has shown that Wikipedia does have biases, mostly due to its reliance on establishment media, academia and other institutional sources. Wikipedia also has an issue with the make-up of the volunteers who edit its articles – the vast majority are men.

AI models, similarly, have been shown to exhibit biases contained within the data sets on which they are trained.

A new study by Cornell University researchers, which scraped hundreds of thousands of Grokipedia articles, has found it uses sources like the conspiracy theory site Infowars as well as anti-immigration, antisemitic or anti-Muslim sites.

On top of that, the researchers found Grokipedia lifts heavily from Wikipedia.

There are currently just over 885,000 articles on Grokipedia, all of which are in English. For reference, Wikipedia has more than 7 million English-language articles.

Given the number of articles on Grokipedia, The Journal chose to focus on topics that Elon Musk has shown he personally cares about, in particular migration. So, this article should not be taken as an exhaustive survey of the website’s content.

Its master’s voice

Musk has claimed Grokipedia is already better than Wikipedia, which is a crowdsourced online encyclopedia edited by humans.

Grokipedia articles are the output of xAI’s large language model (LLM) Grok, which is Musk’s answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and has already caused scandals due to some of the clear bias built into its code.

Musk’s xAI is his venture into the artificial intelligence industry, while ChatGPT is the most popular LLM in the sector.

At one point this year, Grok answered questions from X users on completely unrelated topics by explaining the false claim that “white genocide” is occurring in Musk’s native South Africa. The myth was later brought up by US President Donald Trump when South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa visited Washington this year.

In another episode, the LLM christened itself “MechaHitler” and churned out antisemitic conspiracy theories while praising Adolf Hitler and telling users the German dictator would be the best historical figure to address immigration issues in the United States.

Musk has come in for fierce criticism himself for endorsing an explicitly antisemitic version of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory.

Bias and factual errors

It is obvious that Musk’s chatbot has maintained its master’s biases, especially when it comes to migration and racial issues. For example, its description of the “White Genocide” conspiracy theory presents it as something worthy of debate and underpinned by facts.

Some articles also contain glaring factual errors, a number of which have been documented by The Guardian and Wired, including the claim that HIV was spread in part because of the proliferation of pornography in US society (although those lines now appear to have been deleted).

The gravest error seen by The Journal is the misnaming of the man charged over the 2023 knife attack at Parnell Square in Dublin that sparked a riot in the capital.

The alleged attacker’s real name is Riad Bouchaker but the name in the Grokipedia article is completely different.

The article goes on to argue that immigrants in Ireland are more likely to commit crimes, using prisoner population demographics because An Garda Síochána does not break down crime statistics by ethnicity, nationality or immigration status.

Far-right activists in Ireland often try to make the same argument, even though immigrants get longer sentences on average.

The sources cited in the article vary in quality – from FactCheck articles by The Journal to Facebook posts by prominent Irish far-right personalities.

There are also plenty of articles on the website

[TITLE]Bearish On AI? Tell That To The $600 Billion Big Tech Is About To Spend:

Despite a sharp pullback in major artificial intelligence tech stocks like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), the downturn appears to be a brief panic rather than any real slowdown in the AI boom.

Big Tech’s massive cloud spending and surging enterprise AI adoption are still powering a multiyear growth cycle that could keep the AI-driven rally alive into 2026 and beyond.

AI Sell-Off Seen as Temporary Panic

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives argued that the recent sell-off in top AI tech names like Tesla, Microsoft, Palantir, and Nvidia reflects a temporary panic rather than a fundamental shift.

Don’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

The analyst says turbulent trading began a few weeks ago when Palantir reported extremely strong growth, yet the stock slid sharply the next day.

Quantum computing stocks didn't correct — they detonated. IonQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ), Rigetti Computing Inc (NYSE:RGTI), D-Wave Quantum Inc (NYSE:QBTS) and Quantum Computing Inc (NASDAQ:QUBT) have lost more than $30 billion in market value in just weeks, plunging 40–55% from their euphoric mid-October highs.

For a sector that marketed itself as "the next platform shift," this looks less like a dip... and more like a dot-com-style valuation event.
