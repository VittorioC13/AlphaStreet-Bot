NOV becomes investor in Natura Resources (“Natura”) and appoints representative to Natura’s Board of Directors in conjunction with the sale of Shepherd Power

NOV and Natura sign Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to establish a supply chain agreement where NOV will leverage its manufacturing, supply chain, and project management expertise to support scaling advanced nuclear power solutions

HOUSTON, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOV Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today announced the sale of Shepherd Power, its advanced nuclear development company, to Natura, a leading developer of advanced small modular reactor (“SMR”) technology. As part of the transaction, NOV and Natura have signed an MOU to establish a supply chain agreement where NOV will provide manufacturing and project management expertise to support scaled deployment of Natura’s advanced nuclear reactors.

Specifically, the supply chain agreement is expected to support Natura’s plans to deploy 100-megawatt molten salt reactor units for data center and industrial markets starting in 2029 and reaching scale in 2032. The cooperation will leverage NOV’s manufacturing footprint and procurement expertise alongside Natura’s reactor platform.

“The power market is one of the most significant industrial growth opportunities of the next decade,” said Jose Bayardo, President and COO of NOV. “Our collaboration with Natura allows NOV to bring its unmatched manufacturing and project management capabilities into an adjacent sector that demands the same rigor, scale, and reliability we have delivered to energy customers for more than a century. We believe that Natura’s technology will be one of the first advanced reactors commercially available in the United States. Natura’s molten salt reactor design incorporates critical safety features and leverages the existing uranium supply chain, enabling the ability to scale manufacturing of reactors that can economically produce heat and power.”

“This strategic transaction will accelerate commercialization of our molten salt reactor technology and enhance our ability to offer comprehensive power solutions to customers,” said Doug Robison, Founder and CEO of Natura Resources. “Shepherd Power is a leading voice in the advanced nuclear regulatory space, having significantly contributed to commercial licensing clarity with federal and state regulators and has expertise in the requirements to site, build, own and operate reactors. Combined with NOV’s expertise in scaling highly engineered equipment to drive down delivery costs, this transaction positions us to lead in delivering gigawatts of safe, advanced nuclear reactors within the next 5 years to support critical power needs and fuel American A.I. leadership.”

Natura is developing molten salt SMR technology, engineered for use at modern datacenters supporting artificial intelligence expansion, large industrial micro-grid applications, and industrial heat installations. Shepherd Power, founded by NOV, has catalyzed regulatory and licensing reform at the federal and state level. Its integration into Natura unites complementary capabilities focused on commercial reactor deployment. As part of the transaction, NOV will become an investor in Natura and will appoint a representative to Natura’s Board of Directors, ensuring continued collaboration in advanced nuclear technologies.

[TITLE]Perimeter Solutions Announces Agreement to Acquire MMT for $685 Million:
[TEXT]
CLAYTON, Mo., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Perimeter Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: PRM) (“Perimeter,” “Perimeter Solutions,” or the “Company”), today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Manufacturing Technologies LLC (“MMT”) from Arcline Investment Management for approximately $685 million in cash, including certain tax benefits.

MMT is a leading provider of highly engineered machinery and associated aftermarket consumables, parts, and services for the manufacturing of minimally invasive medical devices. Nearly all MMT’s revenue is generated from proprietary products and approximately half of its revenue is derived from the aftermarket. MMT is expected to generate approximately $140 million of revenue and $50 million of Adjusted EBITDA on a full-year basis in 2025.

Haitham Khouri, Perimeter Solutions’ Chief Executive Officer, stated, “MMT is an excellent fit with our operating strategy. MMT serves a recurring and growing aftermarket, where it reliably provides highly engineered proprietary parts and consumables that are critical to zero-defect customer workflows and stringent regulatory standards. MMT has a strong track-record of organic and M&A driven growth, both of which we expect to continue.”

Mr. Khouri continued, “We expect MMT to fit seamlessly into our decentralized operating structure, and we believe that the Company is a particularly strong fit with our Operational Value Driver focused operating strategy”.

Perimeter expects to fund the acquisition through $500 million of new secured debt financing and $185 million of cash on hand.

Perimeter Solutions’ Chief Financial Officer Kyle Sable said, “MMT matches our focus on businesses in secularly growing markets with strong free cash flow, high returns on tangible capital, and durable earnings power. As a result of the transaction, we expect to have net leverage profile of approximately 2.7 times net debt to combined Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended September 30, 2025, which we believe will be well supported by the cash generation capability of our combined business.”

The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Nixon Peabody and Greenberg Traurig provided legal counsel to Perimeter.

Banks in the Asia-Pacific region, including those in India, have built stronger capital positions compared to their counterparts in the United States and Western Europe, Moody's highlighted in its latest survey report.The survey pointed out that a comparison of the largest banks in Asia-Pacific systems with peers in the US and Western Europe shows they generally have built strong capital positions under prudent regulatory supervision.Further, it noted that large Asia-Pacific banks' risk-weighted asset (RWA) densities reflect their underlying asset risks, consistent with their credit losses for the past 10 years. It also added that the banks' RWA densities vary across the Asia-Pacific.Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) represent a bank's assets adjusted for risk levels, meaning loans or investments considered riskier are assigned higher weights. A bank with higher RWA density indicates that a larger part of its assets carries higher risk.Explaining the capital strength, Moody's highlighted, "Large private sector banks in India have high CET1 capital adequacy and leverage ratios because their internal capital generation has outpaced their RWA growth in the past couple of years, and they can raise equity easily from capital markets when needed."CET1, or Common Equity Tier 1 capital, refers to a bank's core capital, primarily common shares and retained earnings, which serves as the first line of financial protection against losses. A higher CET1 ratio indicates a stronger ability to absorb shocks without affecting depositors.The report mentioned that as of the end of 2024, the average reported CET1 capital adequacy ratios of the large banks in Hong Kong, India, Korea in the sample stood at 18.0 per cent, 14.7 per cent, and 14.5 per cent, respectively, all above 13.5 per cent for the four largest banks in the US and 13.8 per cent for the top six banks in Western Europe.According to the survey, these banks can also raise equity easily from the capital markets when required. However, it stated that their government-owned peers remain weaker than private banks in both metrics.The report attributed the higher RWA densities in India, Vietnam and among certain Chinese banks to the use of the standardized approach, a regulatory method that assigns fixed risk weights rather than relying on banks' internal risk assessment models.It added that regulators in India have announced plans allowing banks to transition to the more advanced IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) approach by 2028, a move expected to lower RWA densities if successfully implemented.For India, the sample included State Bank of India ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank , together accounting for approximately 50 per cent of system assets.Overall, the report assessed a total of 35 banks across eight key Asia-Pacific banking systems, representing 75 per cent of total assets of all rated banks in these markets.

[TITLE]Bucharest votes in mayoral race that could hand far right a first EU capital:
[TEXT]
BUCHAREST, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Bucharest could become the first European Union capital led by a hard-right mayor in Sunday's local election, a contest which threatens Romania's fragile pro-European coalition government.

The influential post has been vacant since May when centrist Nicusor Dan won a presidential election re-run one year into his second term as mayor.

The re-run came after Romania cancelled an election on suspicion of Russian interference that favoured far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu, who is currently awaiting trial on charges of attempting to subvert national security.

Polls show TV anchor Anca Alexandrescu, running as an independent backed by the opposition hard-right Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR), tied for first place in the mayoral race. Analysts caution, however, that surveys may be unreliable as Romania's biggest city isn't a far right stronghold.

Voting closes at 1900 GMT with preliminary results expected later on Sunday.

AUR opposes military aid to neighbouring Ukraine, is critical of EU leadership and supportive of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies including on energy and immigration.

Alexandrescu's main rivals all come from the broad coalition government: leftist Social Democrat Daniel Baluta who polls show to be tied in first place, Ciprian Ciucu, the protégé of Liberal Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan, and Catalin Drula of centre-right Save Romania Union (USR), which backed Dan's presidential bid.

The Social Democrats (PSD), without whom a ruling pro-European majority could not be formed, joined the government on condition that each party had separate mayoral candidates, undermining centre-right Ciucu and Drula.

"On the one hand, the stakes for AUR are huge, winning the capital would dispel the idea of a sanitary cordon isolating extremist parties," said Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University.

"On the other, if any of the ruling coalition's candidates wins, then it will change the balance of power in the ruling coalition."

Alexandrescu, a former PSD spokeswoman, was a vocal supporter of Georgescu - who did not endorse her or any other candidate - and is targeting the same voters angry at mainstream parties they perceive as incompetent and corrupt.

The government faces a no-confidence vote this month over judicial pension reform. AUR has said it would be willing to ally with the Social Democrats, who have rejected the idea but some of whom are pushing for the resignation of Prime Minister Bolojan over austerity plans.

Last year's cancelled election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades, exposed its deep vulnerability to hybrid attacks and disinformation, divided voters, crashed markets and threatened the country's investment-grade rating.

CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:GTE) (TSX:GTE) (LSE:GTE) today announced its 2026 capital budget, production guidance and operational update. All dollar amounts are in United States dollars and all production volumes are on a working interest before royalties basis and are expressed in barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) per day (“BOEPD”), unless otherwise stated.

Message to Shareholders

Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, commented: “With our exploration commitments in Ecuador now completely fulfilled during 2025 and the Suroriente carried work program forecast to be completed by early Q2 2026, Gran Tierra is entering a new phase focused on generating free cash flow and maximizing the value of our diversified portfolio. Our 2026 capital program is focused on high-return, quick-payout development projects across both South America and Canada, including the upcoming production well drilling program in Cohembi and the Montney program at Simonette.

Based on our 2026 budget, we see a clear path to fully addressing the $180 million amortization of our 2029 notes due in October 2026 while continuing to optimize long-term value of our asset portfolio. Beyond 2026, Gran Tierra maintains a clear path to meeting all debt maturities, supported by strong liquidity, a resilient cash-generating asset base and commitment to generating free cash flow.

The successful closing of the Perico and Espejo acquisition further enhances and strengthens our portfolio in Ecuador, especially as we integrate development plans with our Iguana discovery to unlock meaningful operational and cost synergies. Gran Tierra expects production in Ecuador to exit 2025 at approximately 8,500 to 9,500 bopd with corporate production of approximately 48,000 to 49,000 boepd. Gran Tierra is well-positioned for a period of sustained free cash flow generation and disciplined, return-focused execution.”

Free Cash Flow 2 Generation a Key Focus: With all 2025 Ecuador exploration commitments fulfilled and most Suroriente Continuation obligations complete, Gran Tierra is shifting its focus to generating free cash flow 2 while maximizing portfolio value. Recent exploration success and the strong performance of its core assets provide a substantial reserve base to support ongoing free cash flow 2 generation. The Company’s Ecuador portfolio has reached an inflection point, moving from exploration to development as we integrate recent discoveries and advance multi-year growth opportunities. Based on existing assets, Gran Tierra is targeting over $75-$150 million of free cash flow per year from 2027 onwards at a long-term real Brent price of $70 per bbl.

The Company’s Ecuador portfolio has reached an inflection point, moving from exploration to development as we integrate recent discoveries and advance multi-year growth opportunities. Based on existing assets, Gran Tierra is targeting over $75-$150 million of free cash flow per year from 2027 onwards at a long-term real Brent price of $70 per bbl. 2026 Base Capital Program: The program will focus on quick payback development projects with a focus on free cash flow 2 generation. Development: Gran Tierra expects to drill a total of 8 to 10 gross development wells in its 2026 capital program, including: Suroriente: The Company plans to drill 4 gross development wells in the Cohembi oil field located in the Southern Putumayo Basin of Colombia. With the completion of this drilling program Gran Tierra expects to completely fulfill its commitments associated with the Suroriente Continuation. Upon completion of the commitments, the economics of the Suroriente block strengthen for Gran Tierra and its Partner paying its working interest share of operating and capital costs. Simonette: Gran Tierra plans to drill 5 gross (2.5 net) wells in South Simonette targeting oil weighted-Montney production.

The program will focus on quick payback development projects with a focus on free cash flow generation. Structural Cost Saving Initiatives: Structural cost initiatives are underway across the portfolio, focused on rationalizing workover activity, improving procurement terms and reducing costs through operational optimization and planning. Gran Tierra maintains a disciplined and constant focus on process improvement, ensuring that small operational changes accumulate into meaningful structural cost savings. Collectively, these actions support a stronger, more efficient cost profile across the organization.

Gran Tierra maintains a disciplined and constant focus on process improvement, ensuring that small operational changes accumulate into meaningful structural cost savings. Collectively, these actions support a stronger, more efficient cost profile across the organization. Repayment of $180 Million of Debt in October 2026: As part of the Company’s ongoing strategy to reduce debt, Gran Tierra has repurchased $20 million of its 2029 Notes during the year, reducing the October 2026 amortization to $180 million while lowering the outstanding balance to $718 million. Gran Tierra intends to fully address the $180 million scheduled amortization related to the 2029 notes coming due in October 2026. Based on the Company’s 2026 expected free cash flow 2 generation, disciplined capital program, and continued focus on operational efficiency provide a clear path to meeting this obligation under any of the provided cases – Low, Base and High. Gran Tierra’s planning assumptions incorporate this repayment as a core use of free cash flow in addition to its available credit facilities of approximately $67 million stated as of September 30, 2025, and previously announced $150 million prepayment facility. Gran Tierra is targeting to reach Net Debt to EBITDA to be below 1.5x in 2028 and below 1.0 by the end of 2029. The Company’s long-term plan, coupled with disciplined capital spending and growing free cash flow, underpins our confidence in fully repaying our debt as scheduled while growing EBITDA.

Hedging: Gran Tierra also employs a disciplined, risk-managed hedging strategy designed to protect cash flow, support capital planning, and enhance financial stability across commodity cycles. Gran Tierra maintains a rolling 12-month hedging program and typically hedges 30–50% of forecast production over the next six months, and 20–30% over the subsequent six-month period.

Close of Acquisition of Perico and Espejo Blocks in Ecuador

Gran Tierra has closed the previously announced strategic acquisition of the Perico and Espejo Blocks in Ecuador, following approval from the Ecuador Ministry of Environment and Energy. The transaction shall follow with customary post-closing regulatory requirements including the authorization of the amendment of the underlying Perico and Espejo block contracts after the approval of the Comité de Licitaciones Hidrocarburíferas.

Following Gran Tierra’s 2025 discoveries on the adjacent Iguana Block, the Company believes that developing the Perico and Iguana Blocks together will capture meaningful operational and cost synergies.

Operations Update

Current Production: The Company’s current production 5 is approximately 48,000 to 49,000 boepd.

The Company’s current production is approximately 48,000 to 49,000 boepd. Ecuador Conejo A-2: The Hollin oil zone was perforated over 41 feet (“ ft ”) of reservoir. Using an electric submersible pump, the well has produced at stabilized rates of 1,524 bbls of oil per day (“bopd”) over 63 hours with 29.6-degree API gravity oil, a 5.6 % water cut, and a gas-oil ratio of 166 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel. This is the second well in the Conejo discovery area. Conejo A-1: The Conejo A-1 well continues to produce at a rate of 1,532 bopd over 192 hours with 26.8-degree API gravity oil, an 18 % water cut, and a gas-oil ratio of 277 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel from the Basal Tena formation.

Colombia Suroriente Block: The Raju well was spud on November 5, 2025, targeting the N Sand oil zone. The well discovered 21 ft of net reservoir with an average porosity of 17% in the N Sand formation. Currently the well is in early stages of testing and has confirmed the significant resource potential of the Cohembi field to the north extending the current development area by more than ~2 kilometers.

Union warns 'inaction' could sabotage shipyard's survival

1 day ago Share Save Calum Watson BBC Scotland Share Save

The biggest union at the publicly-owned Ferguson shipyard has claimed that government inaction is jeopardising its future. GMB Scotland said a failure to deliver promised investment or new orders to Ferguson Marine would amount to "sabotage". The union has been calling for a direct award of a new CalMac ferry order to help the Port Glasgow yard restore its reputation after delays and huge cost overruns building two dual-fuel ships. Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said the shipyard was of "national importance" and the government had previously acted to save jobs but any contract awards must satisfy procurement and state subsidy rules.

During a debate at Holyrood on Tuesday she also made clear the release of modernisation funding was dependent on the firm presenting a revised business plan which factored in new orders.

The Holyrood debate discussed a report from the parliament's public audit committee which criticised previous governance failures but also called for more support for the shipyard to help it become more competitive. It warned the shipyard's viability was at risk without urgent action to address years of underinvestment and give the firm "a realistic chance" of securing new work. GMB Scotland general secretary Louise Gilmour said the report should serve as an "emergency flare". "The public audit committee could not have sounded the alarm more clearly or loudly over the future of Ferguson Marine," she said. "Its report demanded swift and effective action from the Scottish government but, in the six months since, we have heard only excuses and seen no action at all." She said ministers from John Swinney down had taken turns to "wring their hands and tell us how complicated it is". "Scotland has a publicly-owned shipyard which successfully built small ferries for generations and a publicly-owned ferry company that urgently needs them. It is not that complicated," she added. In September, a cross-party coalition of community leaders, trade unions, and local politicians urged First Minister John Swinney to award the contract for a replacement for the CalMac ferry MV Lord of the Isles directly to the shipyard. The project has been ready to go to procurement since mid-summer, but three months on, no timescale has been given for a decision. Forbes said any such award must be lawful and Transport Scotland was still considering the business case.

Consultants have said the Ferguson shipyard needs an equipment upgrade to help it compete in the open market

Nearly 18 months ago, Forbes announced that £14.2m of investment could be available over two years to install modern equipment such as new cutting machines and a semi-automated panel line to raise productivity. But in October she confirmed that only £570,000 of this money has yet been handed over. Labour's Daniel Johnson accused the government of creating a "catch 22" situation where it will not provide the money until orders are forthcoming but the yard was unable to secure those orders without investment. Forbes said the money was still available but it depended on the board and new chief executive presenting a revised business case which reflected new work. "The funding is available - it is about drawing down that funding. There is no challenge in respect of that funding not being available," she said.

[TITLE]Zelenskyy warns Russia, China stepping up military-industrial cooperation:
[TEXT]
A new report by Ukraine’s foreign intelligence has warned of intensifying ties between the strategic partners.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that China is moving to “intensify cooperation” with Russia, particularly in the military-industrial sphere, amid deepening ties between the strategic partners since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour.

In comments on social media on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said a report from the head of Kyiv’s foreign intelligence had noted the dependence of the Russian state on “Chinese investment, technologies, and political priorities”.

The Ukrainian leader said that Kyiv’s partner intelligence services had also noted the moves by Beijing and Moscow to ramp up their cooperation in the military-industrial sector, adding he had instructed Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service to monitor the cooperation “more substantively” for how it related to Ukraine’s and its Western allies’ interests.

“Global security must not be undermined because Russia’s appetite for aggression remains unabated,” he said.

The report also observed a growing trend of the “de-sovereignisation of parts of Russian territory” in Beijing’s favour – primarily through the use of resource-rich land, and the sale of precious resources to China, he said.

Despite pressure from the West, Beijing, Moscow’s key strategic partner, has drawn closer to Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

It has claimed neutrality in the conflict, maintaining a low profile amid international efforts to negotiate peace, despite calls for it to use its influence over Moscow – which relies heavily on China to blunt the impact of Western sanctions – to help bring an end to the conflict.

In September, the Chinese and Russian leaders outlined their vision of a new, multilateral international order at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, while last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to expand investment and deepen economic relations between the countries in a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, describing the enhanced ties as a “shared strategic choice”.

Xi highlighted industries including aerospace, energy, agriculture, and the digital economy as sectors where the countries could cooperate.

‘Coalition of willing’ to meet

Zelenskyy’s remarks came as he announced that Ukraine had reached agreement with senior US officials on the main elements of a plan for the country’s post-war recovery during talks with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Joining Zelenskyy for the discussions were Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, government officials and top military commanders. He said the discussions centred on what he described as an “economic document”.

From the US delegation, those present included Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink.

“The principles of the economic document are clear, and we have full understanding with the American side,” Zelenskyy said. “A key shared point is that real, tangible economic growth after the war depends on strong security. Without security, nothing else can follow.”

He added that work was continuing on a 20-point “fundamental document” aimed at bringing an end to the conflict, now nearing the fourth anniversary of Russia’s 2022 invasion.

Separately, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany held a call with Trump on Wednesday to review US-led peace efforts, describing it as “a critical moment” in attempts to halt the war.

The French presidency said the “Coalition of the Willing” – a group of Ukraine’s supporters largely made up of EU countries – will convene on Thursday.

Ukraine’s European allies are backing Zelenskyy’s effort to ensure that any deal to end the war is fair and deters future Russian aggression in Europe, amid concerns that Trump’s push for a swift settlement will result in an outcome heavily weighted in the Kremlin’s favour.

Responding to comments from Trump that suggested the Ukrainian president was using the war as an excuse not to hold an election, Zelenskyy also said the country would be ready to hold a vote within three months if its partners guaranteed security during wartime, and provided its electoral law could be altered.

“To hold elections, two issues must be addressed: primarily, security – how to conduct them, how to do it under strikes, under missile attacks; and a question regarding our military – how they would vote,” Zelenskyy said.

“The second issue is the legislative framework required to ensure the legitimacy of elections,” he said, referring to the fact that elections cannot be held during times of martial law.

Hospital shelled in Russian-held Kherson

Meanwhile, as efforts continued to reach a settlement in the war, hostilities continued to play out on the battlefield.

In a Russia-controlled part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, three people were killed and two wounded by Ukrainian shelling of a hospital, a Russia-installed governor, Vladimir Saldo, said on Telegram.

He said all the victims worked at the facility, and one of the injured was in intensive care.

Elsewhere, Russian drones hit the gas transport system in Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, Deputy Energy Minister Mykola Kolisnyk said, while heavy fighting was continuing to rage in Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region, where Ukraine’s military said it was fending off a Russian mechanised assault.

How 3D printing is changing the world

Because of the capabilities and advances in materials, 3D printing has already changed several industries forever.

In manufacturing, it’s not an either-or proposition of using subtractive or additive methods. A London design company is already deploying a huge additive-manufacturing tool in traditional factory settings to create a hybrid model.

It’s also expanding the possibilities for what can be made. Health care is a great example, where additively manufactured skin, titanium bones and joints, and even blood vessels count among the innovations.

The construction innovations are even more advanced—and have great potential to change the industry. Additive practices are already established enough for calls to properly regulate the field with relevant and updated building codes.

To benefit the social good, you can start with the fact that dwellings are expensive. Lots of people simply can’t afford them, so if it’s possible to build a home in a single day for the cost of a decent second-hand car, this could help lift tens of millions out of poverty.

Additive manufacturing also offers efficiencies regular construction doesn’t. Housing is normally built in a linear process: erecting the frame, laying bricks, applying roof trusses—all readying the project for glaziers and plumbers to work on later.
