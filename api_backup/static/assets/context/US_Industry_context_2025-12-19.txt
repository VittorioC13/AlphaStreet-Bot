[TITLE]Halo Pharma Enhances Manufacturing Capabilities with Macro-Pactor® Investment:
[TEXT]
New addition enhances manufacturing continuity and supports seamless progression from early-phase development to late-stage production

Macro-Pactor® to be online in Q1 2026

WHIPPANY, N.J., Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Halo Pharma, a leading CDMO specializing in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, is expanding its manufacturing capabilities at its Whippany, New Jersey facility with the addition of a Gerteis Macro-Pactor®, a versatile roller compactor that enhances the company’s ability to manage complex formulations, improve process efficiency, and deliver consistent solid-dose pharmaceutical products. The investment reinforces Halo Pharma’s position as a reliable partner for both development and commercial manufacturing as it allows for seamless scale up from Halo Whippany’s Gerties Mini-Pactor® currently used for development, clinical and small scall commercial manufacturing.

The Macro-Pactor is expected to be online in the first quarter of 2026. Its high throughput, superior dry-granulation performance, improved powder flow, and reduced variability will significantly expand Halo Pharma’s dry-granulation capabilities. It will improve formulation flexibility, process predictability, and granule quality. This technology is especially beneficial for the development of moisture-sensitive APIs, high-drug-load formulations, poor-flowing powders, potent compounds, and modified-release products within Halo Pharma’s portfolio.

“One of the major advantages of adding the Macro-Pactor is that the process parameters established during early-phase development translates almost directly into larger batch sizes,” says Satish Shetty, Senior Director, Product Development & Technical Services at Halo Pharma. “Since the equipment is engineered for both development and commercial throughput, it eliminates the typical disconnect between small-scale R&D and large-scale manufacturing, reducing scale-up risk, timelines, and the need for reformulation.”

Shetty adds that the Macro-Pactor’s closed, dust-contained design reduces operator exposure, minimizes product loss, and supports secure, regulatory-compliant handling. With fewer open processing steps, the system provides safer, more controlled operation for potent APIs and controlled substances.

Beyond scale-up, the Macro-Pactor supports Halo Pharma’s tech-transfer process. Its precise, data-rich control of critical process parameters enables smooth, low-risk transitions from lab-scale development to commercial manufacturing, strengthening the company’s Quality by Design (QbD) efforts. Fully compatible with existing upstream and downstream equipment, the system ensures efficient end-to-end processing and strengthens collaboration across R&D, process development, manufacturing, and quality teams.

"Investing in the Macro-Pactor reinforces Halo Pharma’s commitment to delivering high-quality, scalable manufacturing solutions for our clients. It ensures that they can confidently advance their programs with predictable outcomes and faster timelines," says Lee Karras, Group Chief Executive for the Noramco Group, parent company of Halo Pharma.

of Singapore selected as NeuroSigma’s manufacturing partner Investment led by Checkmate Capital as part of strategic partnership with Armstrong Asia

First commercial units to be delivered in March 2026

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuroSigma, Inc., a Los Angeles-based bioelectronics company, today announced completion of an approximately $1 million investment into a high-volume manufacturing line for the second-generation Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS) device for treating pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NeuroSigma’s manufacturing partner for the project is Singapore-based Armstrong Asia , a leading manufacturer for the medical, automotive and consumer electronics industries, with operations across Asia and partnerships around the globe. The investment was led by Checkmate Capital, a strategic advisory and investment group headquartered in Pasadena, California. The investment and manufacturing project are part of a collaboration between Armstrong and Checkmate, stemming from their July 2025 strategic memorandum of understanding (MOU) focused on the development and manufacturing of new technologies, particularly in the medical device industry.

“This investment enables cost-efficient and scalable manufacturing of the second-generation Monarch eTNS device,” said Colin Kealey, M.D., President and CEO of NeuroSigma. "As we move into 2026, we look forward to working with Armstrong Asia to deliver this innovative product to patients and families throughout the world."

“We would like to thank NeuroSigma and Checkmate for selecting Armstrong as their manufacturing partner for the second-generation Monarch eTNS device,” added Phyllis Ong, CEO of Armstrong Asia. “Armstrong’s engineering team is highly inspired to co-design and manufacture advanced medical devices, and we look forward to producing the device at scale to serve the millions of patients suffering from ADHD.”

In November 2025, NeuroSigma announced successful completion of its pilot commercialization program for the first-generation Monarch eTNS device. During the pilot phase, the company dispensed over 1,000 Monarch devices and over 100,000 of the daily disposable patches. Based on strong market demand, NeuroSigma is preparing to launch the second-generation Monarch eTNS device in late Q1 2026.

“Completion of this investment marks a significant milestone for NeuroSigma, Armstrong, and Checkmate,” said Tom Paschall, CEO of Checkmate Capital and NeuroSigma Director. “Within the medical device industry, we see favorable conditions for the external neurostimulation sector and the central nervous system therapeutics market in general. The Monarch eTNS device is a groundbreaking neuro-electronic product that provides patients, families, and physicians with an alternative to stimulant medications and the negative side effects associated with them.”

[TITLE]Haier India readying ₹3,500-crore investment plan as it looks to set up third manufacturing facility in India:
[TEXT]
Consumer durables major Haier Appliance India is readying an investment plan of ₹3,500 crore as it is looking to set up its third manufacturing facility in the country. The company said it is in the process of exploring locations for the new facility and expects to finalise plans by next year. It is also eyeing revenues of ₹14,500 crore in CY2026.

The company on Friday unveiled its Gravity AI Series air conditioners at an event held at its Greater Noida facility.

NS Satish, President, Haier Appliances India told businessline, “We are looking at setting up our third manufacturing facility in India. We are looking at possible locations and it could be in the southern or western region. We expect to finalise the plans by next year and expect to make investments of ₹3,500 crore in phases in the third facility. This will be funded through internal accruals,” he added.

Asked about the overall revenue target for 2026, he added, “We expect to end 2025 with revenues of about ₹11,000 crore – up about 22 per cent over previous year. For CY2026, we have set our sights on revenues of ₹14,500 crore. This growth will be led by air conditioners and LED televisions categories, besides washing machines and refrigerators. We are among the top three brands now and have been able to grow strongly in 2025 despite challenges.”

Capacity expansion

The company also aims to ramp up its air conditioner manufacturing capacity in India. It expects its annual production capacity to rise to 4 million AC units by 2027.

”Air conditioners segment has very low penetration levels of just about 11 per cent and hence is a rapidly growing segment in the country. We are ramping up our manufacturing capacity aggressively. We believe this will enable us to grow our market share to 18 per cent from the current 7 per cent by 2030,” he added.

The company said it has also been strategically investing in its Greater Noida facility to strengthen component development and enhance production agility.

“We believe the Haier Gravity AI Series AC powered by AI-Atmos represents the next frontier in AI-driven home appliances and reinforces our deep commitment to understanding the needs of Indian consumers. With 90 per cent of our products now manufactured locally, we are reinforcing self-reliance, improving efficiency, and ensuring faster availability for households across India,” Satish said. The new Haier Gravity AI Series AC range starts at ₹49,990.

Currently, Haier India operates two manufacturing facilities in Greater Noida and Pune.

The Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd (ASX: BEN) share price is in focus today after the bank received a $50 million operational risk capital charge from APRA and revealed it is subject to an AUSTRAC enforcement investigation into AML/CTF compliance.

What did Bendigo and Adelaide Bank report?

Received a $50 million operational risk capital charge from APRA effective 1 January 2026

The capital charge is expected to lower the Level 2 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio by about 17 basis points

CET1 ratio was 11.19% as at 30 November 2025, still above the board's target

AUSTRAC has begun an enforcement investigation relating to serious potential contraventions of AML/CTF laws

The bank continues to uplift its approach to non-financial risk management

What else do investors need to know?

APRA's decision means Bendigo and Adelaide Bank must hold extra capital against operational risk, but its CET1 ratio remains above both board targets and regulatory minimums for 'unquestionably strong' banks.

On the regulatory front, AUSTRAC has not yet decided whether it will take enforcement action following its investigation, leaving some future uncertainty for shareholders. The bank has committed to ongoing engagement with the regulator and ramping up risk management efforts.

Cost estimates for potential remediation or additional compliance are not yet available, with the bank saying further updates will be provided when they are determined.

What did Bendigo and Adelaide Bank management say?

Bendigo Bank CEO and Managing Director Richard Fennell said:

Bendigo Bank has taken a number of steps to improve its risk capability and strengthen its risk culture over the last 12 months however I recognise the need to intensify our focus and our efforts.

What's next for Bendigo and Adelaide Bank?

The board and executive team are prioritising a broader uplift in non-financial risk maturity, particularly in response to regulators' feedback and evolving expectations around compliance. The bank says it will provide investors with cost estimates and more information on remediation plans as details are finalised.

In the near term, the bank is focused on constructive engagement with AUSTRAC, strengthening frameworks, and maintaining capital strength. Investors will be watching for more guidance as further regulatory outcomes emerge.

Bendigo and Adelaide Bank share price snapshot

Over the past 12 months, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank shares have declined 24%, trailing the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) which has risen 3% over the same period.

[TITLE]China's Xinjiang invests heavily in water conservancy project construction:
[TEXT]
URUMQI, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has accelerated construction of water conservancy projects since the beginning of this year, achieving a cumulative investment exceeding 40 billion yuan (about 5.67 billion U.S. dollars).

The regional government on Wednesday told media that Xinjiang has surpassed its annual investment target, reporting 40.03 billion yuan invested in water conservancy projects.

The Dashixia Water Conservancy Project began impounding water on Sept. 20, and Yulongkashi and other major projects met key milestones, according to Jiao Quanxi, deputy head of the regional water resources department.

Steady progress was also made in projects for flood control, rural drinking water supply, and ecological management of river basins, Jiao added.

[TITLE]Affinius Capital Provides $81M Construction Loan for Arizona State Student Housing – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Fields Holdings has secured $81.2 million to finance the construction of the Samuel, a 14-story student housing property that will boast 224 units on Arizona State University’s main campus in Tempe, Commercial Observer can first report.

Affinius Capital provided the construction financing, while CBRE’s Scott Williams arranged the transaction.

Affinius Capital Senior Vice President Tyler Figley described the Samuel in a statement as a “high-quality” student housing property that sits on a prime location within the sprawling Arizona State campus. Figley said the apartment complex will likely “capture demand” from the growing enrollment at ASU, which currently has roughly 56,000 students in Tempe.

“We look forward to working with Fields Holdings, which has the experience to execute on this caliber of project,” he added.

Located at 706 South College Avenue near Downtown Tempe, the Samuel will deliver 408 beds and also feature 8,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The units will be organized as studios to three-bedroom apartments, and the building will include a swimming pool, a basketball court, an outdoor courtyard, a fitness center, and several lounges with media spaces for students to access

Fields Holdings did not respond to requests for comment.

[TITLE]Bamburi Cement, Chinese Company Sign Ksh32 Billion Factory Construction Deal [Details]:
[TEXT]
Editor's Review Bamburi Cement has signed a Ksh32 billion Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with China-based Sinoma CBMI Construction Co., Ltd for the construction of a new clinkerisation factory in Matuga, Kwale County.

Bamburi Cement has signed a US$250 million (Ksh32 billion) Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with China-based Sinoma CBMI Construction Co., Ltd for the construction of a new clinkerisation factory in Matuga, Kwale County.

In a statement on Tuesday, December 16, the company said the project is part of Bamburi Cement’s strategy to expand its manufacturing operations, reduce reliance on imports, and support Kenya’s infrastructure development and economic transformation.

The clinkerisation plant will have a production capacity of 1.6 million tonnes per year and will incorporate advanced, carbon-neutral technologies aimed at reducing environmental impact.

Through the project, Bamburi Cement plans to more than double its clinker production from 1 million tonnes to 2.6 million tonnes, while cement production is expected to increase from 1.8 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes annually.

President William Ruto, who witnessed the signing of the agreement, said the government will support the Bamburi Cement project and other similar investments that promote value addition, job creation, and industrial growth.

"The Government of Kenya remains fully committed to supporting this project and similar investments that deepen value addition, create jobs, and strengthen our manufacturing base," he said.

Ruto stated that the cement industry plays a central role in Kenya’s economic development, noting that major infrastructure projects depend on a stable and competitive cement supply chain.

"The cement industry sits at the heart of our economic freedom agenda. Every road, power plant, dam, irrigation canal and factory depends on a reliable, competitive and sustainable cement value chain.

"Projects such as the Bamburi Clinker Line are not isolated investments, they are foundational catalysts for our national transformation," he added.

File image of President William Ruto speaking during the event

Ruto also highlighted the need for Kenya to reduce cement imports by utilizing its abundant local raw materials.

"It is not possible for us to continue importing cement, Kenya has an abundance of limestone and other raw materials for cement production," he further said.

The deal comes a year after Savannah Clinker Limited withdrew its offer to acquire Bamburi Cement.

In a statement on Wednesday, December 4, 2024, Capital Markets Authority (CMA) said it had approved the withdrawal of the offer, and gave Bamburi Cement shareholders, who had accepted the offer until Thursday to reconsider their decision.

"CMA would like to notify the shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc and the investing public that Savannah Clinker Limited has withdrawn its competing offer for the acquisition of the Bamburi Cement Plc shares today. CMA has also approved the withdrawal of the offer in line with the Capital Markets (Takeover and Mergers) Regulations, 2002.

"Following this development, shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc who had accepted the offer by Savannah Clinker Limited have until 5.00pm on Thursday, 5 December 2024 to reconsider their decision. Shareholders who do not change their decision will be deemed to have declined the offer by Amsons Industries (K) Limited and remain shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc," the statement read in part.

CMA further noted the only valid offer is the one from Amsons Industries (K) Limited which has already been approved by the Authority.

"Shareholders who had accepted either of the offers are free to withdraw their acceptance before the closure of the offer period at 5.00 pm on Thursday, 5 December 2024. Trading of Bamburi Cement Plc shares will be suspended from 9.00 am on 06 December 2024 to facilitate reconciliation," the statement concluded.

Savannah Clinker Limited's move to withdraw its offer came days after its Chairman, Benson Sande Ndeta, was arrested and subsequently arraigned in court.

Ndeta was arrested on charges of defrauding Absa Bank of $35 million, allegedly acting on behalf of Savannah Cement Limited.

He faced eight counts, including conspiracy to commit a felony and obtaining credit by false pretenses, which he denied.

After spending the weekend in custody, the High Court ordered his unconditional release, halting further prosecution pending a hearing set for January 30, 2025.

Deep-tech, by definition, takes many years to mature because of the nature of the technology and the times it takes to validate and commercialize.

[TITLE]Tennessee $7.4 Billion Smelter Deal Aims to Break China’s Grip on Critical Minerals:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump’s plans to strategically secure U.S. critical mineral supplies are moving forward at a rapid pace.

The Pentagon and the Commerce Department have announced plans to team up with a South Korean firm, Korea Zinc, on a $7.4 billion Tennessee smelter that will mass-produce critical defense minerals, including rare earths, copper, gallium, germanium, and antimony.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and the US government are backing Korea Zinc Co.’s planned $7.4 billion smelter in Tennessee that will supply critical minerals essential for chip-making, defense and aerospace. Korea Zinc — one of the world’s largest processors of the metal — said Monday it will establish a foreign joint venture called Crucible JV LLC to oversee the project. The venture will be comprised of Korea Zinc, the US government, and other unnamed investors, the company said. One of those investors is JPMorgan, which also advised the company on the public-private partnership, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified citing private details. The deal is the latest in a flurry of Trump administration measures aimed at establishing domestic supply chains for key minerals. China dominates the critical minerals sector, leaving US industries dependent on foreign imports of the material.

The plans are for the new facility to open in 2029, and for the Department of Defense War would have a 40% stake in the company.

An existing zinc refinery in Clarksville, Tennessee – roughly 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Nashville – will be bought from Trafigura’s Nyrstar, torn down and replaced by a larger facility that will open in 2029 and grow to annual output of 540,000 metric tons of critical minerals, including 300,000 tons of zinc, 35,000 tons of copper, 200,000 tons of lead and 5,100 tons of rare earths, officials said. “The Trump administration will continue to leverage every tool at our disposal to end America’s foreign dependence for critical minerals and restore working-class prosperity,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to Reuters that confirmed the investment. Under the plan, Korea Zinc will sell shares worth $1.9 billion to a joint venture controlled by the U.S. government and unnamed U.S.-based strategic investors, who would then control around 10% of the South Korean firm. The U.S. Department of Defense will hold a 40% stake in the venture, while Korea Zinc’s stake will be less than 10%. Korea Zinc will secure the remaining $5.5 billion for the plant through $4.7 billion in loans from the U.S. government and financial institutions as well as $210 million in subsidies from the U.S. Commerce Department under the CHIPS and Science Act.

The smelter and associated facilities are expected to create over 700 new jobs and significantly revive the regional economy.

As part of a White House deal to protect critical metals for the U.S., Korea Zinc announced Monday it will purchase Nyrstar Zinc in Clarksville and build a new $6.6 billion smelter. The site will also house the company’s U.S. headquarters, combined creating 420 new jobs in Montgomery County over the next five years. The move also includes a new production facility in Gordonsville, creating 320 jobs in Smith County. In Gordonsville, the company plans to reopen a former mine, bringing back lost jobs and industry to the community, according to a state news release. The announcement represents the company’s first U.S. locations and the largest single private corporate investment made in state history, the release said.

The Marine Corps has a new air defense system built to transform light vehicles into mobile weapons for shooting down drones and other aircraft.

The technology is intended to equip Marines with a new way to deal with drones and other aerial threats, the service announced this week. As the war in Ukraine has shown, the ability to counter these types of threats is critical in modern conflict.

The new Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, entered full-rate production earlier this fall after training and live-fire exercises. Placed on top of a pair of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, MADIS converts the vehicles into a single short-ranged ground-based air defense system.

The vehicles work together, with one focused on countering drones and the other geared toward helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. MADIS uses Stinger missiles and a 30mm cannon for those targets, and it also comes with radars and electronic warfare systems. Marines can also use MADIS while on the move, giving the service a mobile air defense option.

It's a capability boost over the service's Man-Portable Air Defense System, or MANPAD, which Marines would've had to equip themselves and leave vehicles to use. MADIS is also capable of being upgraded over time, depending on what types of threats Marines are facing and what weapons they need for specific missions.

MADIS, developed by the Norwegian firm Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, has undergone several iterations since its initial prototype. The Marine Corps said its full-rate production version has sensors, algorithms, and mobility that allow Marines to locate, target, and destroy threats faster and better than before. Its first live-fire exercise took place during joint US-Philippine military training earlier this year.

Marine Corps officials have said MADIS fills a gap in their air defense arsenal and is unique because it can complete the entire kill chain. Marines can use it to find and identify targets and then take them out rather than relying on several systems to do the same.

MADIS also addresses Marine Corps concerns around how to defeat small uncrewed aerial systems in a potential future war.

Since MADIS is mobile, it gives Marines a new way to defend forward-deployed forces — especially in a potential future fight against a sophisticated adversary like China.

As the Marine Corps reshapes its force for operations across the first island chain, from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines, it needs systems that can move quickly and deliver more firepower against a wide range of aerial threats.
