[TITLE]At $3 billion, retail sector deal value jumps 4x over last quarter: Report:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: India’s consumer and retail sector witnessed a decisive rebound in the Sept quarter, with deal volumes rising to 132 and values crossing $3.4 billion, nearly four times higher than previous quarter.The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel and accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce , Grant Thornton Bharat’s Q3 2025 Consumer and Retail Dealtracker report showed.A total of 97 PE/VC deals worth $1.3 billion were registered during the third quarter, more than doubling in value QoQ. Investors focused on festive-led categories — apparel, e-commerce, and consumer electronics — with notable rounds for VIP Industries, Zepto, Jumbotail, and Miko, it said.The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints. There were 24 M&A deals worth $955 million, led by domestic consolidation in food processing and apparel. Big-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue and Titan’s purchase of Damas Jewellery anchored the rebound, while outbound activity revived with five cross-border acquisitions.With policy tailwinds and festive demand, investor confidence remains strong across consumption-linked sectors. Six IPOs and five QIPs raised over $1.1 billion, led by Urban Company, Bluestone Jewellery, Tilaknagar, and Lenskart, reflecting renewed investor appetite for consumer names. Naveen Malpani, consumer industry leader Grant Thornton Bharat, said: “The festive quarter reaffirmed e-commerce’s role as a structural engine of consumption. Online festival sales have already crossed Rs 60,700 crore in the opening week, up about 29 % YoY, with more than half of the Rs 1.2 lakh crore projected festive GMV logged early.”

[TITLE]Consumer and retail sector recorded deal activity valued at $3.4 billion in September quarter:
[TEXT]
Consumer and retail sector witnessed robust deal momentum recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion in Q3 CY2025 marking a rebound.

According to Grant Thornton Bharat’s Consumer and Retail Dealtracker, the sector witnessed robust deal momentum in Q3 2025, recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion, up 6 per cent in volumes and 9 per cent in value compared to Q3 2024, including public market activity. Excluding public market deals, M&A and PE deal activity accounted for 121 deals worth $2.3 billion, marking a 168 per cent increase in value quarter on quarter, it added.

“The surge was driven by five high-value deals above $100 million and 26 deals above $10 million, together contributing $2 billion or 89 per cent of total deal value, signalling strong investor confidence in scale, brand strength, and growth-oriented consumer businesses,” it added.

Naveen Malpani, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat said, “Q3 marked a decisive rebound for India’s consumer and retail sector. The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel & accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce. These categories reflect the intersection of traditional strengths and digital disruption shaping India’s consumption story. The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints.”

Festive season

While textiles, apparel, and accessories remained a top focus, attracting significant M&A and private equity inflows, food processing and e-commerce segments benefited from festive season momentum, with online sales surging and quick commerce capturing growing consumer attention.

“The rise in average deal size to $18.8 million from $7.2 million in Q2 highlights a shift toward value-driven transactions, underpinned by larger, capital-intensive deals and selective strategic investments across the sector,” it added.

Meanwhile, food processing, FMCG and textile sector lead M&A deal activity. “These sectors drove deal activity, accounting for 67 per cent of volumes and nearly 94 per cent of values. Large-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue ($488 million) and Titan’s acquisition of Damas Jewellery ($283 million) anchored the rebound,” the report added.

[TITLE]Quadrant in Chelmsford and Braintree closes department stores:
[TEXT]
Department stores close after 144 years of trading

4 days ago Share Save Lewis Adams Essex Share Save

Peter Walker/BBC Quadrant's shop in Chelmsford city centre first opened in 1881

A pair of department stores have shut for the final time after 144 years in business, affecting the jobs of 51 people. Quadrant said its shops in Chelmsford and Braintree had been making "substantial and sustained losses" for years. Shoppers enjoyed weeks of heavily discounted goods, including furniture, clothing and electronics, before doors shut for the final time on Saturday. "Though this chapter has come to an end, the memories we've shared will always remain," the company said in a statement.

It thanked staff for their dedication during a "difficult few months", adding: "You've been the heart of our stores, and your teamwork and spirit made both branches so much more than just a place to shop. "To our loyal customers — thank you for your support over the years. Your smiles, stories, and friendship have meant the world to us." The closure came after the Chelmsford Star Co-op, a 158-year-old group that owned Quadrant, merged with the Central Co-Op. Its shop in Moulsham Street, Chelmsford, first opened under a different name in 1881, and successful trading then led to a second store opening in Braintree in 1991. However, local Co-op members voted to close the venues in May.

Reuters Quadrant spent weeks selling off its goods at heavily discounted prices

"The department store business has been making substantial and sustained losses for many years," a spokesman for Chelmsford Star Co-op said, in June. "These challenges have been made worse in recent years by shifts in consumer behaviour - particularly the move to online shopping which was further accelerated by the pandemic." The brand has been working with the retail union USDAW to support the 51 employees affected by the closures. Despite merging with Central Co-op, the Chelmsford Star trading name will continue to be used locally. The transfer to Central Co-op - which trades across the East Midlands and East Anglia - completed on 15 September.

Johnson backs Trump’s plans not to tap contingency dollars for food aid ahead of funding cliff

Politico ^ | 10/27/2025, 12:01pm ET | Meredith Lee Hill

Posted on by E. Pluribus Unum

The White House is warning 42 million low-income Americans will start to miss SNAP benefits Saturday if Democrats don’t vote for the funding stopgap this week.

Speaker Mike Johnson is siding with the Trump administration’s decision not to tap emergency funds to avert a lapse in food aid for 42 million Americans.

“I got a summary of the whole legal analysis, and it certainly looks legitimate to me,” Johnson said during a news conference Monday.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is due to run out of money Nov. 1 amid the government shutdown. President Donald Trump suggested Friday night he may shift around funding to avoid such a potentially catastrophic outcome.

But the administration also warned lawmakers in a memo Friday it could not and would not seek access to a range of emergency funds , putting millions of low-income families on track to lose food aid as the partisan government funding standoff continues.

Johnson said Monday a SNAP contingency fund, which currently contains $5 billion, is “not legally available to cover the benefits right now” because they represent “a finite source of funds.” Democrats, and privately some Republicans, have argued the administration always has the legal authority to tap those funds in an emergency.

He added that if the administration were to “transfer funds from these other sources, it pulls it away immediately from school meals and infant formula.”

SNAP food aid benefits have never lapsed in modern history, including during shutdowns. And the fallout would devastate both red and blue states, including vast swaths of rural America and Trump voters, along with the House GOP’s Hispanic-majority districts .

Some Senate Republicans are pushing for passage of a standalone SNAP funding bill if needed this week, including Appropriations Chair Susan Collins of Maine, but it’s unclear if GOP...

And, as others have pointed out, if the food covered by food stamps was restricted to the basics (i.e. fruits, vegetables, rice, inexpensive meats, etc.) the cost of the whole program could be drastically reduced. It would also provide greater incentive for recipients to get off their a*ses and find a job, find a better paying job, or work a few more hours a week. Another effective way to reduce dependence on food stamps is to have EBT cards only redeemable at government food banks, where just the basics are offered (i.e. no junk food or expensive luxury items). The left have made every effort to “reduce the stigma” of receiving food assistance. That’s part of the problem. EBT cards make it too easy to be on the dole without being noticed. There’s no shame in genuinely needing food assistance and there are private food banks that offer it. But making it too easy has caused a certain type of person to take it for granted and believe they’re entitled to it rather than being grateful for the helping hand that it is.

[TITLE]SNAP recipients told to buy shelf-stable food or go to food banks as funding deadline looms:
[TEXT]
Recipients of SNAP food assistance benefits across the country face a looming deadline: Come Nov. 1, their cards may not get refilled because of the government shutdown in Washington.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which serves nearly 42 million people each month, allocates money to states on a monthly basis. Benefits were largely uninterrupted over the past three weeks because funding for October was allocated to states before the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

But in a letter to SNAP state agency and regional directors on Oct. 10, the Department of Agriculture warned that there would not be enough funding to pay full SNAP benefits — also known as food stamps — in November if the shutdown persists.

Many states have announced that they plan to suspend SNAP benefits if the shutdown continues into next month. That could upend people’s ability to buy food on an unprecedented scale — the program has not lapsed during any government shutdown in recent history.

As Nov. 1 approaches, some state leaders are recommending that people turn to food banks or use their remaining benefits to buy non-perishable items.

“If you have accrued SNAP benefits from previous months on your account, use those funds now to buy shelf-stable foods that can last through November and beyond,” the Arkansas Department of Human Services says on its website.

But food banks say it will be impossible to fill the gap.

“There’s no way that our charitable food network or the system in this country can provide that much food overnight or quickly. It’s an impossible task,” said Catherine D’Amato, CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Her organization is already receiving calls from people asking where they can go to feed their families, she said. D’Amato estimated that suspending SNAP benefits would create a deficit of up to 56 million meals in Massachusetts in November.

At least one state, Pennsylvania, has already stopped issuing SNAP benefits. The state announced that “starting October 16, SNAP benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA.”

Texas, meanwhile, said next month’s SNAP benefits won’t be issued if the shutdown continues past Oct. 27. And in Wisconsin, SNAP recipients got a letter this week informing them that even their remaining funds from October may not carry over.

“Benefits may not be available in November,” the letter said. “This may include any funds remaining on your card at the end of October. You may want to use your benefits to stock up on food before the end of October.”

The state treasurers of Oregon and Massachusetts said Thursday on a press call that their states have no contingency plans for SNAP if the federal government doesn’t provide the funding. State budgets can’t afford to cover the full cost of people’s benefits, they added.

“At a time when the cost of groceries continues to go up, SNAP makes the difference between having enough and going hungry,” said Elizabeth Steiner, the Oregon state treasurer. “This decision on behalf of the federal government is an absolute abdication of its responsibility to families in Oregon and across the United States who are struggling to make ends meet.”

She added that “up until now, every administration, Republican or Democrat, has understood that feeding Americans is a fundamental responsibility of the federal government.”
