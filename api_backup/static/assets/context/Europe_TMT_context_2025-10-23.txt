NXGSAT raises euro 1.2M to accelerate rollout of interoperable 5G satellite modem

by Robert Schreiber

Berlin, Germany (SPX) Oct 22, 2025

Belgian spacetech company NXGSAT has secured euro 1.2 million in seed funding to advance development of its high-speed, standards-based 5G satellite modem, designed to bridge terrestrial and multi-orbit connectivity. The round was led by PMV and the imec.istart future fund, with proceeds directed toward product development, team expansion, and market rollout.

Traditional satellite networks remain largely closed systems, where user terminals are restricted to a single operator. NXGSAT's founder and CEO/CTO Alain Rolle drew a comparison: "Imagine that your smartphone would only connect to a single mobile network - that's the current reality of satellite communications. NXGSAT is on a mission to change that."

The company's modem architecture is compliant with the 3GPP 5G NR NTN (New Radio Non-Terrestrial Networks) standard, supporting interoperability across different constellations and ground systems. Entirely software-defined and built on commercial off-the-shelf hardware, it reduces the cost and complexity typically associated with proprietary satellite hardware.

NXGSAT's open-standards approach aligns closely with European connectivity initiatives, including IRIS, the EU's upcoming secure low- and medium-Earth orbit constellation. The company has already secured early contracts from both commercial and government clients within the satellite sector.

"This funding marks a pivotal step in our journey," said Rolle. "With the backing of PMV and imec.istart future fund, we can now scale our programs and strengthen both our technical and commercial capabilities. This will reinforce our ambition to make high-performance interoperable satellite connectivity a reality for tomorrow's users."

Kris Vandenberk, Managing Partner at imec.istart future fund, added: "NXGSAT is led by seasoned industry veterans redefining satellite communications through a software-defined, standards-based approach. Its technology embodies Europe's deep-tech strength and its vision for open, secure, and interoperable connectivity."

Roald Borre, Member of the Executive Committee at PMV, noted: "The international race for global connectivity determines who sets the digital tone. With NXGSAT, PMV is supporting Flemish technology that can make a real impact - and help determine the direction of both European and international satellite communications."

[TITLE]‘Serious concern’: Supervisor calls for hearing into Mayor Lurie’s $5.9M OpenGov deal:
[TEXT]
Jackie Fielder is questioning the contract after a Standard investigation found Lurie’s office may have given the tech firm preferential treatment.

Supervisor Jackie Fielder on Tuesday called for a public hearing into a multimillion-dollar contract Mayor Daniel Lurie’s office recently signed with a software company to streamline the city’s permitting process despite city staffers’ concerns over its cost and performance. An investigation by The Standard last week found that Ned Segal, one of the mayor’s top policy chiefs , took unusual steps to secure a one-year, $5.9 million contract with OpenGov, a San Francisco company that counts more than 2,000 government agencies across the country as clients. The company has ties to Lurie’s former nonprofit Tipping Point, with its founders collectively donating tens of thousands of dollars to the organization. In addition, Katherine August-deWilde, a member of OpenGov’s advisory board and leader of Lurie’s Partnership for San Francisco, has contributed as much as $2.85 million to his former nonprofit.

“My concerns around the OpenGov contract boil down to four elements: the cost, the quality, the procedure, and OpenGov’s relationships to the mayor,” Fielder, who is chair of the Government Audit and Oversight Committee, said in a statement. “Any one of them on their own [is] eyebrow-raising, but combined, they are cause for serious concern.” Other parts of City Hall are also scrutinizing the deal.

The city’s Civil Service Commission, which holds public hearings about contracts, hiring, and the treatment of employees, has launched an investigation into the OpenGov contract and whether it should have been reviewed by its members before receiving approval. Sandra Eng, the commission’s executive director, said there were plans for the OpenGov contract to go before the commission, but the city’s Department of Technology and the mayor’s office intervened. (According to the Civil Service Commission’s policies, certain software is exempt from commission approval.)

Eng said the investigation was launched after the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 21 made a complaint about the contract. “Too often we see millions of dollars wasted on private contracts that are unnecessary or overpriced,” said Sarah Perez, Local 21’s vice president, in a statement. “We’re alarmed and disturbed that the city had no intention to see if our existing staff could perform this work. Instead, they’re trying to sidestep the Civil Service Commission entirely.” In addition to $1.9 million in implementation fees, the OpenGov contract will cost the city $4 million annually to streamline permitting across roughly a dozen departments. Clariti, a company that city staff rated higher than OpenGov’s software, is already working with the Department of Public Works on a separate project. Records show that hiring Clariti to resolve the permitting issues would cost the city $1.6 million in implementation and $528,000 annually. Contracting experts and city staffers said that Segal’s role in securing the contract was unusual from the start and that his actions were perceived as an effort to steer the contract to OpenGov. Email records show Segal and OpenGov CEO Zac Bookman were in discussions more than a month before the city put out what’s known as a “request for information” to technology companies, an informal process to assess how vendors can help on a project.

[TITLE]Trump’s Australia Critical Minerals Deal Is a Move to Break China’s Monopoly:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump signed a critical minerals deal with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday, a team-up explicitly intended to break China’s near-monopoly on mining and refining the valuable resources.

The agreement committed the U.S. and Australia to invest over a billion dollars each over the next six months into mining projects and refineries. The deal also set a minimum price for critical minerals.

The White House said the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM Bank) would make up to $5 billion in financing available for mineral projects. Albanese said projects valued at roughly $8.5 billion would soon be up and running, giving the U.S.-Australian partnership access to mineral deposits worth up to $53 billion.

Albanese noted the agreement is more of an “action plan” than a binding agreement with “enforceable obligations,” but he and Trump predicted the allure of critical minerals was so great that American and Australian industries would require no government urging to exploit the opportunities created by the deal.

Washington took a major step in reshaping global strategic supply chains on Monday, as US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a rare earths and critical minerals agreement. The deal is aimed at securing a steady supply of these materials just as China tightens its control over global production.Trump said the agreement had been negotiated over four to five months , while Albanese described it as an $8.5 billion pipeline “that we have ready to go.” The full terms were not immediately disclosed, but both leaders indicated that the deal involves joint efforts in processing these critical minerals.Albanese added that Australia and the US would each contribute $1 billion over the next six months to fund collaborative projects.Rare earth minerals, often overshadowed by oil, gold or other headline-grabbing commodities, are the backbone of modern technology, from electric vehicles and wind turbines to semiconductors and advanced military systems.And China controls the tap.Seventy per cent of rare earths are mined in China, and 90 per cent are processed there. This concentration gives Beijing unprecedented leverage over global supply chains.China's latest move came on October 10, when China added five more metals -- holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium, to its export restrictions, bringing the total number of controlled elements to 12, out of 17.Foreign companies now need approval from China’s Commerce Ministry before buying rare-earth magnets or semiconductors containing even 0.1 per cent of these heavy metals, and must disclose detailed end-use plans.Australia, home to some of the world’s richest deposits of rare earths, sees an opening. With China’s rare earth restrictions in place and the country processing the majority of them domestically, Canberra believes it can be the West’s solution to a growing supply chain vulnerability, Bloomberg reports.Ahead of the Washington meeting, Australia’s Ambassador Kevin Rudd delivered a clear message to US policymakers: “Australia equals the periodic table,” he said. “Having it is one thing, knowing how to mine it, as mining is a high-tech business, is another, and we have the world’s biggest and best miners.”Rudd added that, with joint investment from Australia and the US, the country “can meet 30 to 40 of those [critical minerals] without much additional effort, most particularly in terms of processed rare earths.”The US tracks over 50 minerals considered critical for economic and national security, including 17 rare earths, strategic metals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese and graphite, as well as industrial and specialised metals such as copper, zinc, vanadium, titanium, tellurium, indium and germanium.This push comes amid mounting concern in Washington. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business last week: “This is China versus the world. They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world, and we’re not going to have it.”Across the Atlantic and in Asia, countries including Canada, India, and EU members are similarly scrambling to secure alternative sources of these strategic materials.The term “rare earth” is kind of misleading. These 17 elements -- 15 lanthanides, plus scandium and yttrium -- are not inherently scarce, in the manner that something like gold is. Rare earths are abundant in the Earth’s crust. What makes them rare is the difficulty of separating and refining them, according to the BBC.China recognised this decades ago, building an industrial ecosystem capable of extracting, processing, and magnetising these metals at scale. Today, the US sources 80 per cent of its rare earth imports from China; the EU, nearly 98 per cent.Australia, by contrast, has vast reserves but only a fraction of China’s processing capacity. Its deposits include neodymium, dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-strength magnets used in wind turbines and defence systems. The US Geological Survey estimates Australia’s critical mineral reserves at roughly one-seventh the size of China’s.However, companies like Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. are making headway. Its Kalgoorlie facility and a refining plant in Malaysia recently became the first outside China to separate heavy rare-earth elements like dysprosium and terbium.In October, US firm Noveon Magnetics partnered with Lynas to supply magnets to US defense contractors, sending Lynas’s share price to a 14-year high, according to Al Jazeera.The Australian government is also stepping in. Ahead of May’s parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Albanese announced a A$1.2 billion ($750 million) critical minerals reserve to boost domestic processing.Meanwhile, Iluka Resources is developing the Eneabba project in Western Australia, designed to come online by 2027 and targeting rare-earth oxides such as dysprosium and terbium for high-tech magnets. Over the years, Iluka has stockpiled more than $650 million worth of rare earths, but refining remains the bottleneck.Iluka CEO Tom O’Leary told shareholders last month that “the current industry is unsustainable, owing to China’s monopoly position and approach. It is a fact that rare earths are among very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to withhold supply to achieve political or strategic objectives.”“They’re chemically very similar, so separating them requires a huge number of stages,” Jacques Eksteen, chair of extractive metallurgy at Curtin University, told the BBC. “You also have residues and wastes to deal with, which is problematic. They often produce radioactive materials. It comes at a cost.”To address this, the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65 billion to build a refinery. As Iluka’s McGrath puts it: “Without the strategic partnership we have with the Australian government, a rare earths project would not be economically viable. We expect to be able to supply a significant proportion of Western demand by 2030. Our customers recognise that having an independent, secure, and sustainable supply chain outside of China is fundamental for the continuity of their business.”China’s dominance is no accident. The 2010 embargo against Japan, triggered by a territorial dispute over a detained Chinese fishing captain, disrupted global supply chains. Japanese executives appeared on national television, warning that their industries were running out of critical raw materials.The embargo lasted seven weeks, after which Beijing consolidated its mining sector under the state-controlled China Rare Earth Group, reported the New York Times.Japan responded by diversifying its sources, investing in Australia, including support for Lynas Rare Earths Ltd., which now mines and refines

[TITLE]Stocks Rally on Easing Trade Tensions and Solid Q3 Earnings:
[TEXT]
Wall street sign in New York City with American flags and New York Stock Exchange in background by kasto80 via iStock

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Monday closed up +1.07%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed up +1.12%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up +1.30%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) rose +1.12%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) rose +1.32%.

Stock index futures rallied on Monday and added to last Friday’s gains, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting 1-week highs, and the Dow Jones Industrials posting a 1.5-week high. Market sentiment has improved as US-China trade tensions eased after President Trump on Sunday said that “I think we’re going to be fine with China.” Stocks are also seeing support from optimism that Q3 earnings results will continue to surprise to the upside. Carry-over support from rallies in European and Japanese stocks to record highs on Monday also underpinned US stocks. Additionally, lower bond yields are supportive of stocks as the 10-year T-note yield fell -3 bp on Monday to 3.98%.

Treasury Secretary Bessent said the US and China will hold talks this week in Malaysia to prepare for President Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

Better-than-expected Chinese economic news is supportive of global growth prospects. China Q3 GDP rose +1.1% q/q and +4.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.8% q/q and +4.7% y/y. Also, China’s Sep industrial production rose +6.5% y/y, stronger than expectations of +5.0% y/y. In addition, China’s Sep jobless rate unexpectedly fell -0.1 to 5.2%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of no change at 5.3%.

The shutdown of the US government continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last three weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the Sep payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don’t align with President Trump’s priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

[TITLE]Eos Energy Executes Next Phase of Growth Strategy with U.S. Manufacturing Expansion and New Software Hub Under Project AMAZE:
[TEXT]
$24 million state-led economic development package underscores the shared commitment between Eos and Pennsylvania to advance U.S. manufacturing and job creation

Expansion reinforces the Company’s progress and transformation as Pennsylvania becomes a national hub for energy, technology, and manufacturing innovation

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) ("Eos" or the “Company”), an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced the next phase of its growth strategy with the expansion of its U.S. manufacturing footprint and the establishment of a new software hub strengthening American energy storage capacity, energy independence, and industrial job growth.

In partnership with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Allegheny County, the Company was awarded a joint $24 million economic development package to support U.S. manufacturing and the continued growth of 1,000 high quality American jobs. The incentive package will help the Company scale operations to meet growing market demand driven, in part, by AI infrastructure, while advancing energy innovation in Pennsylvania.

“Energy storage is the backbone of a modern energy system, and this significant milestone marks our progress to bring America’s battery to scale,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “Through Project AMAZE, we’re proving that you can make things in America again by building world-class capacity, pairing advanced manufacturing with innovative software, and doing it here in Pennsylvania to ensure a more energy-efficient and secure future. We thank Governor Shapiro, Allegheny County, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, and the Pittsburgh Technology Council for their unwavering support and shared vision for advancing Americas quest to lead in energy.”

Eos will expand its manufacturing capacity with a new state-of-the-art 432,000 sq. ft. facility in Marshall Township, PA, that will house additional production lines that complement the Company’s existing Turtle Creek manufacturing facility with plans to reach 8 GWh of annualized energy storage capacity. The new facility enables Eos to transition from single piece flow operations to high-efficiency, large-scale production, marking the culmination of years of process development designed to bring U.S. made energy storage to market at scale.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology. I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Eos will also establish a new software hub at Nova Place, Pittsburgh’s premiere technology and innovation center, that supports the Company’s growing workforce and proprietary battery management system, software, controls and analytics platform, DawnOSTM. Eos joins a thriving community of other advanced manufacturing, data/telecommunications, AI, electric utilities, and robotics leaders in Pittsburgh’s innovation headquarters.

As part of its expanding software and engineering focus, the Company plans to deepen its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, a leading institution in robotics, AI, computer science, and engineering to further develop a state-of-the-art workforce to work in Eos’ software hub.

“Carnegie Mellon University is thrilled to celebrate this milestone with Eos, and we are looking forward to the many opportunities it unlocks – for Pittsburghers, our students, and America’s bright future in manufacturing,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. “On behalf of the CMU community, I extend my sincere congratulations to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo and their teams for leading the way in strengthening Western Pennsylvania’s roles as an innovation engine for the nation and as a driver of the talent that will power it.”

“Pennsylvania has an extensive history of being at the forefront of innovation. We’re proving that in Pittsburgh you can not only build products in America but also offer world class education and intellectual capabilities to grow emerging industries,” said Pranesh Rao, Eos Senior Vice President of Storage System Engineering. “Building our software hub in Pittsburgh—surrounded by talented workers and a fast-growing innovation ecosystem—is both a strategic move and a catalyst to propel Eos to the next level.”

[TITLE]Vicor steps up its IP licensing practice:
[TEXT]
ANDOVER, Mass., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vicor Corporation (NASDAQ: VICR) Intellectual Property (IP) stemming from Vicor’s development of high-density power system technology is key to performance in high growth markets such as AI. Licensed access to foundational IP, including to 800V, 48V and 12V bus converters and Vertical Power Delivery (VPD), is necessary to ensure supply chain resilience and scalability. Without a license, computing, automotive and industrial systems are subject to importation bans or injunctions because of patent infringement by copycat power module makers and contract manufacturers.

In 2025 the International Trade Commission issued a Limited Exclusion Order (LEO) banning importation into the US of infringing bus converters, and computing systems containing the same, covered by certain Vicor patents. The LEO remains in force for the life of infringed patents and applies to all infringing computing systems made by contract manufacturers which, as Respondents in the ITC investigation, were found to infringe. The LEO has led to settlements and licensing agreements by leading OEMs and hyper-scalers resulting in nearly $300 million in expected contribution to Vicor’s revenues through 2026.

Having established licensing as a pillar for growth, Vicor is stepping up its IP licensing practice, headed by Andrew D’Amico, General Counsel for Intellectual Property and supported by Vicor’s in-house licensing team and outside counsel, including law firms partnering with Vicor to assert its IP.

Commenting on the success of Vicor’s licensing practice, Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Vinciarelli stated: “Q3 licensing revenues surpassed Vicor’s quarterly investment in R&D. At 18% of revenues, Vicor’s R&D far exceeds the R&D percentage of revenues of infringing power module makers and contract manufacturers, reflecting differences between antithetical business models respectively focused on innovation and copying.

As high-density power systems pioneered by Vicor, including bus converters and VPD, are on the critical path to high performance computing, Vicor’s IP licensing practice may grow to a greater fraction of Vicor’s module business. Leveraging its first ChiP™ foundry and the high current density of 5th generation ChiPs and 2nd Generation VPD, Vicor’s module business is also expected to grow substantially apart from and as a result of its related IP licensing practice. OEMs and hyperscalers need a license, need to renew their license or need to expand its scope. Vicor is pursuing additional actions to curtail access to infringing computing systems sourced from infringing contract manufacturers relying on infringing power module makers.”

In today’s industry news roundup: Vodafone Group and partner Vodafone Ukraine are building a subsea cable in the Black Sea to link Ukraine with Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia; T-Mobile US is looking to capitalise on its nationwide 5G-Advanced rollout with a ‘private network-like’ service offering; Iliad’s owner Xavier Niel is keen to increase his influence over Belgium’s national operator Proximus, it seems; and much more!

The Vodafone Group and Vodafone Ukraine – which is not part of the Vodafone Group, despite the name – are to invest €100m in the deployment of a new high-capacity submarine cable system, dubbed Kardesa, across the Black Sea. It will connect Bulgaria, Georgia, Turkey and Ukraine. The claim is that Kardesa, which is set to boast 500 TBit/s of data capacity, will help improve the diversity of digital routes across the region and “create a modern digital corridor between Europe and Asia”. The first landing for the new festoon will be in Bulgaria in 2027 with subsequent landings in Turkey, then Georgia and then Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, work on the new system in war-torn Ukraine will only take place in “internationally recognised safe zones”. London, UK-based subsea networks specialist Xtera will design and deliver the €100m turnkey project. While there is a lot of excitement currently

[TEXT]
The French technology group Positive acquired Surfer, the popular content optimization tool. The acquisition helps Positive create a “full-funnel” brand visibility solution together with its marketing and CRM tools.

The acquisition of Surfer extends Positive’s reach from marketing software to AI-based brand visibility. Positive described the deal as part of a European AI strategy that supports jobs and protects data. Positive’s revenue has grown fivefold in the past five years, rising from €50 million to an expected €70 million in 2025.

Surfer SEO

Founded in 2017, Surfer developed SEO tools based on language models that help marketers improve visibility on both search engines and AI assistants, which have become a growing source of website traffic and customers.

Sign Of Broader Industry Trends

The acquisition shows that search optimization continues to be an important part of business marketing as AI search and chat play a larger role in how consumers learn about products, services, and brands. This deal enables Positive to offer AI-based visibility solutions alongside its CRM and automation products, expanding its technology portfolio.

What Acquisition Means For Customers

Positive Group, based in France, is a technology solutions company that develops digital tools for marketing, CRM, automation, and data management. It operates through several divisions: User (marketing and CRM), Signitic (email signatures), and now Surfer (AI search optimization). The company is majority-owned by its executives, employs about 400 people, and keeps its servers in France and Germany. Surfer, based in Poland, brings experience in AI content optimization and a strong presence in North America. Together, they combine infrastructure, market knowledge, and product development within one technology-focused group.

Lucjan Suski, CEO and co-founder of Surfer, commented:

“SEO is evolving fast, and it matters more than ever before. We help marketers win the AI SEO era. Positive helps them grow across every other part of their digital strategy. Together, we’ll give marketers the complete toolkit to lead across AI search, email marketing automation, and beyond.”

According to Mathieu Tarnus, Positive’s founding president, and Paul de Fombelle, its CEO:

“Artificial intelligence is at the heart of our value proposition. With the acquisition of Surfer, our customers are moving from optimizing their traditional SEO positioning to optimizing their brand presence in the responses provided by conversational AI assistants. Surfer stands out from established market players by directly integrating AI into content creation and optimization.”

The acquisition adds Surfer’s AI optimization capabilities to Positive’s product ecosystem, helping customers improve visibility in AI-generated answers. For both companies, the deal is an opportunity to expand their capabilities in AI-based brand visibility.

[TITLE]Meta Announces Joint Venture With Funds Managed by Blue Owl Capital to Develop Hyperion Data Center:
[TEXT]
Meta announces joint venture with funds managed by Blue Owl Capital to finance the development and conduct the operations of the Hyperion data center campus in Richland Parish, Louisiana

On October 21, 2025, Meta and funds managed by Blue Owl Capital entered into a joint venture agreement which will develop and own the Hyperion data center campus. Meta will provide construction management and property management services for the project.

This innovative partnership was designed to support the speed and flexibility required for Meta’s data center projects and long-term AI ambitions. Meta has 15 years of experience developing, constructing and operating world class data center facilities. Blue Owl Capital complements this joint venture with its ability to deliver substantial capital at scale, along with deep expertise in digital infrastructure investment — enabling the rapid execution of mission-critical data center projects for hyperscalers.

Funds managed by Blue Owl Capital will own an 80% interest in the joint venture, while Meta will retain the remaining 20% ownership. The parties have committed to fund their respective pro rata share of the approximately $27 billion in total development costs for the buildings and long-lived power, cooling, and connectivity infrastructure at the campus.

In connection with the creation of the joint venture, Meta contributed certain land and construction-in-progress assets relating to the campus development which were previously classified as held-for-sale. The funds managed by Blue Owl Capital made a cash contribution of approximately $7 billion to the joint venture, and Meta received a one-time distribution from the joint venture in the amount of approximately $3 billion.

Doug Ostrover and Marc Lipschultz, Co-CEOs of Blue Owl Capital said, “We’re proud that our funds are partnering with Meta on the development of the Hyperion data center campus — an ambitious project that reflects the scale and speed required to power the next generation of AI infrastructure. Blue Owl’s ability to deliver substantial capital at scale, combined with our deep experience supporting hyperscalers, makes us uniquely positioned to help bring mission-critical digital infrastructure to life. We look forward to continuing our work with Meta and contributing to the long-term growth of the Richland Parish community.”

Susan Li, CFO, Meta said, “Our AI ambitions will be realized through our ability to deliver the infrastructure to support it. Our partnership with Blue Owl Capital to develop the Hyperion Data Center is a bold step forward — combining Meta’s deep expertise in building and operating world-class data centers with Blue Owl’s strength in infrastructure investment.”

Rachel Peterson, VP, Data Centers, Meta, said, “We are proud to be part of the Richland Parish community and we look forward to continuing to strengthen our partnership for years to come. Construction is well underway with thousands of construction workers on site and, once online, the project will support over 500 operational jobs.”

Meta entered into operating lease agreements with the joint venture for use of all of the facilities of the campus once construction is complete. These lease agreements will have a four-year initial term with options to extend, providing Meta with long-term strategic flexibility.

To balance this optionality in a cost-efficient manner, Meta also provided the joint venture with a residual value guarantee for the first 16 years of operations whereby Meta would make a capped cash payment to the joint venture based on the then-current value of the campus if certain conditions are met following a non-renewal or termination of a lease.

A portion of capital raised by Blue Owl will be funded by debt issued to PIMCO and select other bond investors through a private securities offering.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to Meta in connection with this transaction and served as sole bookrunner in connection with the private securities offering. Latham & Wakins LLP served as legal counsel to Meta on the transaction and Eversheds Sutherland advised Meta on leasing matters. Arthur D. Little LLC acted as commercial due diligence advisor to Meta. Marsh provided Meta project risk analysis and insurance services. Arup provided technical and environmental independent engineer services to Meta. Kirkland & Ellis LLP served as legal counsel to the Blue Owl Capital funds on the transaction. Milbank LLP served as legal counsel to Morgan Stanley on the securities offering.

About Meta

Meta is building the future of human connection, powered by artificial intelligence and immersive technologies. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward experiences that foster deeper connections and unlock new possibilities.
