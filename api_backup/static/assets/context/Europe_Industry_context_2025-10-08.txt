[TITLE]War for Ukraine Day 1,320: Sumy & Kharkiv Under Attack:
[TEXT]
(Image by NEIVANMADE)

I want to take a few minutes and address the different targeting strategies that Ukraine and Russia are utilizing. Ever since the second or third week of the war, Russia has been targeting civilian infrastructure: civilian housing, schools, hotels, restaurants, agricultural facilities and structures, Ukraine’s power grid and power generation facilities, civilian government facilities, bridges, roads, railroads, dams, hospitals, houses of worship, heritage sites, and civilian themselves. Once Putin realized his forces weren’t going to be able to take Kyiv in three days, kill the Zelenskyys and the other legitimate elected and appointed Ukrainian officials, and have his captured pet Ukrainian officials publicly and formally sign surrender and capitulation documents on live TV, Russia’s targeting strategy has been as much

ЕU's Von der Leyen 'Signed Surrender of Europe to Trump' – National Rally Leader

Sputnik International

By inking an unfavorable trade deal with US President Donald Trump in July, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen effectively "signed surrender of Europe to Trump," Jordan Bardella, president of the right-wing National Rally party, said on Monday.

Bardella proposed a motion of no confidence in von der Leyen on Monday, which will be debated by the European Parliament on Thursday alongside a similar motion filed by Manon Aubry of the left-wing France Unbowed party. Von der Leyen faces bids to remove her from office for the second time in three months. In late July, Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Trump signed a trade deal that subjected most EU exports to the United States to a 15% tariff. Under the deal, the European Union will purchase $750 billion in US energy and make investments of $600 billion in the US by 2028, bolstering the US economy and manufacturing capabilities.

[TITLE]Notion Capital raises $130 million for European growth fund:
[TEXT]
Notion Capital, a London-based venture capital firm, has announced the close of a new $130 million growth fund. The fund will focus on supporting growth-stage startups across Europe in sectors like AI, defense, and supply chain logistics. Stephen Chandler, managing partner at Notion Capital, emphasized the importance of the new fund in addressing the shortage of growth-stage capital in Europe.

“This opens up a chance for firms like ourselves to become real European champions,” Chandler said. The fund, called Growth Opps III, will target areas of rising demand such as sovereignty, resilience, and artificial intelligence. Chandler described AI as a “super cycle” that is reshaping the industry.

Notion Capital will concentrate on applications of AI to multiply its market reach. Notion Capital has already begun deploying funds into ventures like Upvest, a stock trading API, Kraken, a builder of unmanned surface vessels, and Nelly, a developer of financial products for the medical sector. A dedicated team of fund partners will handle these growth deals and source new opportunities outside the existing portfolio.

Notion Capital secures new funding

The firm has also introduced new leadership with Growth Opps III. Partner Stephanie Opdam will drive the growth strategy alongside Jessica “Jess” Bartos, who joined from Salesforce Ventures as Notion’s first external partner hire.

Europe has historically struggled with a shortage of institutional capital, particularly from pension schemes. However, reforms like France’s Tibi initiative and the UK’s Mansion House Accord are starting to create incentives for long-term capital mobilisation. Reflecting its pan-European ambitions, the fund is denominated in euros and domiciled in Luxembourg, making it less dependent on UK regulation.

Around 85% of its capital came from institutional investors across Europe, the UK, MENA, and the United States. Since its founding, Notion Capital has invested in over 150 companies, including notable names like Currencycloud, GoCardless, Mews, Paddle, and Quantum Systems. Their established relationships with founders serve as a competitive advantage, particularly at the growth stage.

With Growth Opps III, Notion Capital is positioning itself as a key player in Europe’s evolving venture landscape. The firm plans to make about a dozen investments from the new fund, continuing to support ambitious European founders as they scale to global prominence.

[TITLE]Evantic Capital debuts with $400 million to fund B2B AI startups across Europe and beyond:
[TEXT]
Evantic Capital, a new London-based venture capital firm, has launched with over €341 million in capital to support B2B AI innovators across Europe, the United States, and Israel.

Why it matters: The substantial funding underscores the importance of investing in AI technologies that hold the promise of revolutionizing how businesses operate and deliver value, contributing to the competitiveness and dynamism of the European tech landscape.

The details:

Evantic Capital aims to identify and nurture groundbreaking AI startups that demonstrate strong potential in transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics.

The investment fund will provide financial support, strategic guidance, and industry connections to help these startups scale and achieve their transformative goals.

The firm’s launch is seen as a significant boost for the European AI startup ecosystem, which continues to garner global attention for its innovation and growth.

The firm is backed by an exclusive network of 140 seasoned founders, operators, and investors collectively known as “The Legends,” designed to create direct alignment between startup success and stakeholder involvement by allocating up to 50% of investment carry to those Legends who actively support the portfolio companies.

What they’re saying:

“Our Legends are senior leaders—experienced founders, operators, and executives—who bring a deeper level of involvement to our portfolio companies,” explains Matt Miller, Founder and Managing Partner of Evantic Capital.

“This creates a true partnership model: our Legends are not only motivated by goodwill or networking, but by a real alignment of interests. It ensures that when a founder engages with a Legend, they’re interacting with someone who is deeply invested in helping them succeed, both emotionally and economically.”

The other side: The rise of AI technologies presents a myriad of opportunities and challenges.

What’s next: Evantic Capital has already invested in five AI-focused startups and has two more commitments underway, with its current portfolio including Fireworks, Listen Labs, and Nexos.

[TITLE]TechZity hub set to crown Lithuania's bustling startup scene – DW – 10:
[TEXT]
Lithuania's startups are on the rise with fintechs showing the way. There's hope the sector could become an economic backbone. But more young tech companies will need to take the leap.

In the Baltic country of Lithuania, the startup sector has great ambitions — but achieving them might not be that straightforward.

A construction site in the south of the country's capital, Vilnius, will be key to the plan.

Dozens of workers were bustling
