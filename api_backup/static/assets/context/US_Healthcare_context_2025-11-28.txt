New York, USA, Nov. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy Treatment Market Poised for Strong Growth Throughout the Forecast Period (2025–2034) Amid Rising Chemotherapy Adoption | DelveInsight

The chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy market is emerging as a high-value market opportunity driven by the lack of approved therapies and the significant unmet clinical need. Rising global chemotherapy usage, especially with neurotoxic agents, continues to expand the patient pool. Additionally, the launch of emerging therapies such as Halneuron (Wex Pharmaceuticals), ATX01 (AlgoTx), ART-123 (Asahi Kasei Pharma/Veloxis Pharmaceuticals), WST-057 (WinSanTor, Inc.), and others will further fuel the CIPN market growth.

Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy Market Summary

The total CIPN treatment market size is expected to grow positively by 2034 in the leading markets.

The United States accounts for the largest market size of CIPN, in comparison to EU4 (Germany, Italy, France, and Spain), the UK, and Japan.

In 2024, the United States showed the highest incident cases of CIPN, accounting for ~40% of total cases in the 7MM. These cases are expected to increase by 2034 by a decent CAGR.

Key Factors Driving the Growth of the CIPN Market

Rising Cancer Incidence & Chemotherapy Usage

The increasing incidence of cancer worldwide, fueled by aging populations, changing lifestyles, and environmental factors, leads to greater use of chemotherapy treatments. As more patients survive cancer due to improved detection and therapy, prolonged and repeated chemotherapy raises the risk and awareness of CIPN.

Broader Adoption of Multimodal and Non-Pharmacological Therapies

Complementary approaches, such as acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and other non-pharmacological interventions, are increasingly accepted as part of comprehensive care to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.

Emergence of Novel CIPN Drugs

A few emerging therapies, such as Halneuron (Wex Pharmaceuticals), ATX01 (AlgoTx), ART-123 (Asahi Kasei Pharma/Veloxis Pharmaceuticals), WST-057 (WinSanTor, Inc.), and others, are in late-stage clinical development.

Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy Market Analysis

At present, no approved treatments exist specifically for CIPN. Management largely relies on off-label medications aimed at easing symptoms. Although numerous agents commonly used for neuropathic pain have been evaluated, none have shown clear effectiveness in preventing CIPN.

Patients experiencing CIPN symptoms are generally prescribed off-label drug classes such as alpha-2-delta ligands (anticonvulsants), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), opioids, and topical analgesics, all of which are standard options for neuropathic pain relief.

Several late-stage investigational therapies, including HALNEURON (tetrodotoxin/TTX), ATX01, and ART-123, are progressing through advanced clinical trials. The introduction of these new treatments between 2025 and 2034 is expected to reshape the CIPN landscape across the 7MM, potentially driving a shift toward disease-modifying therapeutic strategies and boosting market growth.

[TITLE]Understanding the challenges of healthcare transition in the context of HIV-related stigma for young adults with perinatal HIV in Thailand:
[TEXT]
The healthcare transition during adolescence and young adulthood has consistently been reported as a critical period for attrition and adverse health outcomes. The study assessed HIV-related stigma and transition experiences among young people living with perinatal HIV (YPHIV) in Thailand. We conducted a mixed-methods cross-sectional study at two research sites in Chiang Mai and Bangkok, Thailand from December 2023 to February 2024. We recruited YPHIV aged between 18–30 years who remained under care in pediatric HIV clinics (group A), those who had transitioned to adult care from those clinics (group B), and caregivers of group B participants (group C). We assessed HIV-related stigma using the validated 8-item Thai Internalized HIV-related Stigma Scale brief (Thai-IHSS brief) and transition-related experiences through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Thirty YPHIV (median age 23 years [IQR 22–26]) and ten caregivers were enrolled. The Thai IHSS brief score revealed a low level of internalized stigma in the study participants (median score 14; IQR 11–17). Anticipated negative thoughts and negative self-thoughts were common. HIV-related stigma experiences of YPHIV and caregivers were grouped into 3 themes: internalized, anticipated, and enacted stigma/discrimination. Transition experiences of YPHIV in both groups included hesitation to navigate care in adult clinics and feeling unprepared, perceived loss of support, and demotivation from being in care. Anticipated stigma and social problems were expressed by YPHIV and caregivers. In the focus groups, YPHIV indicated their need to learn
