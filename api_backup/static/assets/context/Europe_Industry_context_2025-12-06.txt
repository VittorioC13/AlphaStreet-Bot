[TITLE]The Circular Battery Economy Set to Surge to Nearly $78 Billion:
[TEXT]
The sector is currently navigating a "feedstock gap" where recycling capacity is expanding faster than the immediate supply of end-of-life batteries, but government policies like the IRA are providing crucial support and incentivizing domestic recovery.

Battery recycling has evolved from an environmental initiative to a geopolitical necessity, with Western nations pushing to localize supply chains to reduce dependence on foreign processing.

The global circular battery economy is projected to grow from $23.29 billion in 2024 to nearly $78 billion by 2032, driven by the need to secure critical minerals.

As the global energy transition accelerates, the race to secure critical minerals is shifting from remote mines to battery recycling facilities.

A new report projects the global circular battery economy will surge from $23.29 billion in 2024 to nearly $78 billion by 2032. However, this aggressive growth forecast comes amid a turbulent period for the industry, characterized by volatile commodity prices and a race to build infrastructure before a tidal wave of spent electric vehicle (EV) batteries hits the market.

From Environmental Niche to Strategic Necessity

The shift toward a circular battery economy, where materials are recovered, recycled, and reintroduced into the supply chain—, no longer viewed merely as an environmental initiative. It has become a geopolitical imperative.

With more than 70 percent of the world’s cobalt and 60 percent of lithium processing concentrated in a handful of countries, Western nations are increasingly viewing recycling as a matter of national security. The United States and European Union are aggressively pushing to localize supply chains to reduce dependence on foreign processing.

According to the report, this "urban mining" sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.28 percent through 2032. The primary driver is the urgent need to bridge the widening gap between the soaring demand for EV batteries and the finite supply of virgin raw materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt.

The Feedstock Gap and Industry Growing Pains

While the long-term trajectory is bullish, the industry faces immediate hurdles. The sector is currently navigating a "chicken-and-egg" dilemma: recycling capacity is expanding rapidly, often outpacing the current availability of feedstock.

Most EVs currently on the road are relatively new, meaning the anticipated deluge of end-of-life batteries has not yet fully materialized. Data indicates that by 2030, approximately 1.4 million tons of EV battery waste will enter the recycling stream, a figure expected to balloon to 8 million tons by 2040. Until then, recyclers are fighting for limited scrap material, squeezing margins.

This volatility has impacted major players.

For instance, Li-Cycle Holdings Corp., a prominent name in the sector, paused construction on its massive Rochester Hub in New York amidst rising costs, highlighting the capital-intensive nature of scaling these technologies. Meanwhile, competitors like Redwood Materials and Glencore plc continue to scale operations, securing partnerships with major automakers to lock in future feedstock.

Policy Tailwinds Driving Investment

Despite short-term headwinds, government policy is providing a massive floor for the market. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has allocated billions to clean tech manufacturing, explicitly incentivizing domestic material recovery.

The U.S. market alone contributed 38 percent of the global circular battery economy in 2024, valued at $8.8 billion. With federal incentives pushing for domestic content in EV batteries, automakers like Tesla, BMW, and Toyota are mandating minimum recycled content targets. This regulatory pressure is forcing a rapid maturation of the "black mass" market—the intermediate product resulting from shredded batteries that contains valuable metals.

Technological Evolution: Closing the Loop

Technologically, the market is dominated by lithium-ion battery recycling, which accounted for 64 percent of total revenue in 2024. As the industry matures, the focus is shifting toward hydrometallurgical processes (chemical leaching). Unlike older smelting methods, hydrometallurgy allows for recovery rates of up to 95 percent of critical minerals, making it the preferred route for producing battery-grade materials that can compete with virgin mining.

Future Outlook

The circular battery economy is poised to define the next decade of the energy transition. By 2032, recycled materials are expected to supply a significant portion of global demand, with some projections suggesting recycled lithium could meet a quarter of the world’s needs.

As the first generation of mass-market EVs begins to retire in the coming years, the recycling sector will face its true test: proving it can scale efficiently enough to turn a mounting waste problem into a sustainable energy solution.

[TITLE]AST SpaceMobile surges on 2 major expansion sites:
[TEXT]
AST SpaceMobile surges on 2 major expansion sites

The satellite company’s new Texas and Florida manufacturing facilities send stock soaring amid production plans

AST SpaceMobile delivered news Thursday that sent its stock climbing nearly 15%, proving that big bets on satellite manufacturing can capture Wall Street’s imagination. The space-based cellular connectivity company announced plans to establish two new production facilities that will dramatically scale up manufacturing of its next-generation BlueBird satellites, marking a significant expansion of American-based satellite production capabilities.

The stock traded up 14.96% by midday Thursday, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm that has seen the company’s shares swing from $52.20 to $70.58 over recent weeks. This volatility reflects both the speculative nature of space-based technology investments and growing confidence in AST SpaceMobile’s ability to execute on ambitious plans that could reshape how cellular connectivity reaches underserved areas globally.

1. Texas and Florida become satellite production hubs

AST SpaceMobile’s decision to plant manufacturing flags in both Texas and Florida represents more than simple geographic expansion. The company is betting heavily on US-based production for its BlueBird satellite constellation, devices designed to drastically improve space-based cellular broadband connectivity. These aren’t incremental improvements over existing technology. The new BlueBird satellites promise higher bandwidth capacity and faster data transmission speeds that could make reliable cellular service available in remote locations where traditional tower infrastructure proves economically unfeasible or physically impossible to build.

The mass production approach signals that AST SpaceMobile has moved beyond prototype phases into genuine commercial-scale operations. Establishing dedicated manufacturing sites rather than relying on contracted production demonstrates confidence in sustained demand and suggests the company expects to produce satellites at a pace that justifies the overhead costs of running its own facilities.

2. Investment banks raise their expectations

The expansion announcement comes amid a broader reassessment of AST SpaceMobile‘s value by major financial institutions. Deutsche Bank recently elevated its price target to $81 while maintaining a Buy rating, signaling strong conviction in the company’s growth trajectory. Clear Street went even further, boosting its target to $87 following positive third quarter results. These aren’t minor adjustments. They represent substantial votes of confidence from analysts who spend their careers evaluating space and telecommunications companies.

The timing of these upgrades alongside the manufacturing expansion suggests that institutional investors see concrete progress rather than empty promises. For a company operating in the speculative realm of space-based infrastructure, earning Buy ratings from established banks provides validation that can attract additional capital and partnership opportunities.

Financial reality behind the growth story

AST SpaceMobile’s third quarter 2025 financial results paint a picture of a company experiencing dramatic revenue growth while still navigating the expensive reality of building space infrastructure. Revenue jumped to $14.7 million from just $1.1 million the previous year, though the figure fell short of the $19.9 million analysts expected. The company posted a net loss of $0.45 per share, an improvement from the $1.10 loss per share a year earlier but still firmly in negative territory.

What provides comfort to investors despite continued losses is the company’s substantial financial cushion. With $3.2 billion in cash and liquidity, AST SpaceMobile possesses the resources needed to transform ambitious satellite deployment plans into operational reality. Building and launching satellites requires enormous upfront capital before generating returns, making that cash reserve essential for surviving the long runway to profitability.

European partnership adds international dimension

Beyond American manufacturing expansion, AST SpaceMobile‘s collaboration with telecommunications giant Vodafone adds an important international component to its strategy. The partnership will establish a Satellite Operations Centre in Germany, positioning Europe to assert greater digital independence through space-based connectivity infrastructure. This strategic decision fits within broader European Union goals of launching satellite networks focused on mobile broadband service, particularly for regions underserved by traditional cellular infrastructure.

Choosing Germany for this operations center brings AST SpaceMobile into alignment with European industrial policy while opening access to a market that values technological sovereignty. The Vodafone partnership also provides credibility, as established telecommunications companies typically conduct extensive due diligence before committing to infrastructure partnerships with emerging space technology firms.

What this means for the satellite industry

AST SpaceMobile’s expansion reflects broader momentum in the space-based connectivity sector. As launches become more affordable and satellite technology improves, the economic case for providing cellular service from orbit strengthens. Traditional telecommunications infrastructure requires massive capital expenditure to build tower networks across vast territories, particularly in rural or developing regions where subscriber density doesn’t justify the investment. Satellites bypass this limitation by providing coverage from above, potentially serving customers in locations that would never support ground-based infrastructure.

The company’s commitment to American manufacturing also aligns with national priorities around maintaining domestic space industry capabilities. As satellite constellations become increasingly important for both commercial and national security purposes, producing these systems domestically rather than relying on foreign manufacturing has strategic implications beyond simple business decisions.

[TITLE]EU plan would boost ESMA powers over crypto and capital markets:
[TEXT]
The European Commission has proposed expanding the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) over crypto and broader financial markets in a bid to narrow the competitive gap with the United States.

Published Thursday, the package would transfer “direct supervisory competences” for key pieces of market infrastructure, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), trading venues and central counterparties, to ESMA and strengthen its coordination role in the asset management sector.

The proposal still needs approval from the European Parliament and the Council, where it is under negotiation.

If adopted, ESMA’s role in overseeing EU capital markets would more closely resemble the centralized framework of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

EU proposal aims to streamline markets and strengthen ESMA’s authority. Source: finance.ec.europa.eu

In September, France became the third European country to call for the Paris-based ESMA to take over supervision of major crypto firms, joining Austrian and Italian securities regulators.

The move followed growing criticism of Malta’s crypto licensing regime. In July, ESMA released a peer review of the Malta Financial Services Authority’s authorization of a crypto service provider, saying that the regulator only “partially met expectations.”

Due to concerns over more lenient regulations in some jurisdictions, France has also threatened to block the “passporting” of European licenses obtained from member states, raising enforcement gaps

[TITLE]Integrated capital markets and centralised supervision key to urgent investments in Europe:
[TEXT]
Today, the European Commission has presented its new legislative package to promote further integration of capital markets and to centralise supervision in the EU. The Socialists and Democrats welcome it as an important, necessary step to reap the full benefits of the single market and ensure the urgently needed massive investments in Europe.

Over a year ago, Mario Draghi, former Italian prime minister and president of the European Central Bank, warned in his report on competitiveness that Europe needs €800 billion in annual investments, an amount that cannot be met through bank financing alone. He also emphasised the need to improve European competitiveness through measures such as supervisory simplification.

The S&D Group has long called for further integration and completion of the EU’s Capital Markets Union, including giving European supervisory authorities direct oversight of large cross-border financial firms.

This is crucial, as the persistent national fragmentation in Europe’s capital markets severely limits the benefits that can be gained from the EU’s single market. According to the International Monetary Fund, internal barriers in financial services alone act as the equivalent to a tariff of over 100 percent.

[TITLE]Calystron Capital Announces Strategic Global Expansion Across Europe and Asia:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Calystron Capital today announced a new phase of international expansion, marking an important milestone in the firm’s long-term vision to build a global investment presence supported by advanced technology and cross-market expertise. This initiative centers on deepening the firm’s footprint in Europe—particularly in Spain and Germany—while simultaneously accelerating entry into key Asian markets including Singapore and Japan. Together, these regions represent growing financial hubs with increasing investor demand, regulatory openness to innovation, and strong alignment with Calystron Capital’s technology-driven investment philosophy.

Christopher Ellington, Chief Investment Advisor of Calystron Capital, emphasized that globalization is not only a strategic choice but a natural extension of the firm’s core competencies. With more than thirty years of experience across major financial centers, Ellington noted that global markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, making cross-regional diversification a requirement rather than an option. “Our clients need access to opportunities beyond their home markets,” Ellington said. “Global allocation is no longer optional. It is essential for risk management, resilience, and long-term performance. A truly modern investment architecture must operate across borders.”

Calystron Capital’s expansion is anchored by two defining advantages. The first is the firm’s technology-driven investment infrastructure, which integrates the Calystron Quant Framework™ with the Calystron AI Trading System™. Together, these systems generate data-rich strategies, multi-market liquidity intelligence, high-frequency analytics, and adaptive execution models capable of responding to rapidly shifting environments. This technological backbone allows the firm to monitor global capital flows, cross-asset behavior, and macroeconomic transitions with precision, enabling more sophisticated portfolio construction for clients across diverse regions.

The second advantage lies in Calystron Capital’s approach to combining localized expertise with global oversight. By establishing specialized teams in European and Asian markets, the firm aims to directly understand local investor behavior, evolving regulations, and emerging sector opportunities—while still applying the disciplined standards and risk framework developed in the U.S. institutional market. This blend of local insight and international perspective is designed to create a more robust, diversified investment ecosystem that can adapt to global and regional cycles alike.

As part of its global strategy, Calystron Capital also intends to guide U.S. investors toward broader international diversification—especially in fast-growing European and Asian industries—while helping international investors gain access to the depth, liquidity, and stability of U.S. capital markets. According to Ellington, this two-way flow of capital is becoming increasingly important. “We want to build a bridge between markets,” he said. “Our role is to help clients navigate that bridge with clarity, discipline, and intelligent technology. The future of capital management lies in global mobility and intelligent allocation.”

Looking ahead, the firm expects its expansion to accelerate over the coming year as new research hubs, trading nodes, and advisory teams begin operations across Europe and Asia. With technology and financial expertise serving as its dual engines, Calystron Capital aims to position itself as a central connector between intelligent capital and the world’s major financial regions, shaping a future where innovation and global access define long-term wealth creation.

[TITLE]Ikea’s Hawke’s Bay pine tree expansion sparks fears residents will be left to pay:
[TEXT]
‘Dumbest thing NZ has done in agriculture’

To better understand the scale of this land-use change, Pōrangahau farmer James Hunter and pilot Joe Faram flew RNZ over thousands of hectares of new pine trees that now cover what had been traditional farmland for generations.

“This is the dumbest thing New Zealand has done in agriculture,” Hunter said.

He wants New Zealanders to witness the extent of farmland being planted in forestry.

“It’s not just one farm, it’s farm after farm, and I think it’s the scale of it that people don’t understand,” he said.

“Suddenly we’ve got a district that’s been swallowed, and this is apparently good for the country.”

More than 1.8 million hectares of New Zealand are planted in pine trees, with many farms having been converted since 2008 to earn carbon credits after the Emissions Trading Scheme was introduced.

This resulted in more “carbon farming”, where forests are planted for carbon credits and permanently locked up rather than being harvested for timber.

Swedish furniture company Ikea has bought 28,000ha of New Zealand farmland since 2021, with another 10,000 pending approval in Northland.

However, Ikea told RNZ none of its trees have been planted for carbon credits, although they may look at “some form of offsetting in the future”.

A recent report from the Climate Change Commission estimated another 900,000ha of land will be converted to forestry by 2050.

Most of Ikea’s 4300ha of forestry in Central Hawke’s Bay is near the village of Pōrangahau, where

[TITLE]The Circular Battery Economy Set to Surge to Nearly $78 Billion:
[TEXT]
The sector is currently navigating a "feedstock gap" where recycling capacity is expanding faster than the immediate supply of end-of-life batteries, but government policies like the IRA are providing crucial support and incentivizing domestic recovery.

Battery recycling has evolved from an environmental initiative to a geopolitical necessity, with Western nations pushing to localize supply chains to reduce dependence on foreign processing.

The global circular battery economy is projected to grow from $23.29 billion in 2024 to nearly $78 billion by 2032, driven by the need to secure critical minerals.

As the global energy transition accelerates, the race to secure critical minerals is shifting from remote mines to battery recycling facilities.

A new report projects the global circular battery economy will surge from $23.29 billion in 2024 to nearly $78 billion by 2032. However, this aggressive growth forecast comes amid a turbulent period for the industry, characterized by volatile commodity prices and a race to build infrastructure before a tidal wave of spent electric vehicle (EV) batteries hits the market.

From Environmental Niche to Strategic Necessity

The shift toward a circular battery economy, where materials are recovered, recycled, and reintroduced into the supply chain—, no longer viewed merely as an environmental initiative. It has become a geopolitical imperative.

With more than 70 percent of the world’s cobalt and 60 percent of lithium processing concentrated in a handful of countries, Western nations are increasingly viewing recycling as a matter of national security. The United States and European Union are aggressively pushing to localize supply chains to reduce dependence on foreign processing.

According to the report, this "urban mining" sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.28 percent through 2032. The primary driver is the urgent need to bridge the widening gap between the soaring demand for EV batteries and the finite supply of virgin raw materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt.

The Feedstock Gap and Industry Growing Pains

While the long-term trajectory is bullish, the industry faces immediate hurdles. The sector is currently navigating a "chicken-and-egg" dilemma: recycling capacity is expanding rapidly, often outpacing the current availability of feedstock.

Most EVs currently on the road are relatively new, meaning the anticipated deluge of end-of-life batteries has not yet fully materialized. Data indicates that by 2030, approximately 1.4 million tons of EV battery waste will enter the recycling stream, a figure expected to balloon to 8 million tons by 2040. Until then, recyclers are fighting for limited scrap material, squeezing margins.

This volatility has impacted major players.

For instance, Li-Cycle Holdings Corp., a prominent name in the sector, paused construction on its massive Rochester Hub in New York amidst rising costs, highlighting the capital-intensive nature of scaling these technologies. Meanwhile, competitors like Redwood Materials and Glencore plc continue to scale operations, securing partnerships with major automakers to lock in future feedstock.

Policy Tailwinds Driving Investment

Despite short-term headwinds, government policy is providing a massive floor for the market. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has allocated billions to clean tech manufacturing, explicitly incentivizing domestic material recovery.

The U.S. market alone contributed 38 percent of the global circular battery economy in 2024, valued at $8.8 billion. With federal incentives pushing for domestic content in EV batteries, automakers like Tesla, BMW, and Toyota are mandating minimum recycled content targets. This regulatory pressure is forcing a rapid maturation of the "black mass" market—the intermediate product resulting from shredded batteries that contains valuable metals.

Technological Evolution: Closing the Loop

Technologically, the market is dominated by lithium-ion battery recycling, which accounted for 64 percent of total revenue in 2024. As the industry matures, the focus is shifting toward hydrometallurgical processes (chemical leaching). Unlike older smelting methods, hydrometallurgy allows for recovery rates of up to 95 percent of critical minerals, making it the preferred route for producing battery-grade materials that can compete with virgin mining.

Future Outlook

The circular battery economy is poised to define the next decade of the energy transition. By 2032, recycled materials are expected to supply a significant portion of global demand, with some projections suggesting recycled lithium could meet a quarter of the world’s needs.

As the first generation of mass-market EVs begins to retire in the coming years, the recycling sector will face its true test: proving it can scale efficiently enough to turn a mounting waste problem into a sustainable energy solution.

[TITLE]Deloitte Top 200: Company of the year:
[TEXT]
Neutron is already being booked for launches - at around US$55m per pop, from the Electron’s US$7.5m - contributing to Rocket Lab’s bulging order-book for future flights that now stands at more than US$500m.

This year has also seen Rocket Lab spend US$275m to acquire Geost, an Arizona-based maker of missile-tracking systems - the better to position itself for US President Trump’s envisioned “Golden Dome” defence - and US$75m to buy Mynaric, a German maker of laser communication systems in its first push into Europe.

At Rocket Lab’s third-quarter results briefing - where a record US$155m revenue was reported for the three months to September 30, Beck said Neutron would unlock the ability to launch Rocket Lab’s own satellite constellation. That is, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Starlink. It would no longer be a technical or logistical debate, only whether it was the right commercial strategy for the Kiwi-American firm.

Rocket Lab founder and chief executive Sir Peter Beck in the Neutron's fairing.

Rocket Lab’s Nasdaq-listed shares have already shot to the stratosphere. It’s stock -owned by more than 32,000 New Zealanders through fractional ownership sites like Sharesies has doubled for a recent market cap of US$21 billion ($37b) with Beck becoming a fixture on the likes of Fox Business and CBNC.

Rare global leadership position

“It’s very rare for a New Zealand company to truly achieve a global leadership position within its field, but that is what Rocket Lab has achieved,” the Deloitte 200 judges said.

“Its commercial success and creation of shareholder value is outstanding.

“But what makes it particularly special is that it has achieved this success within the space industry – surely one of the most aspirational fields of endeavour."

The judges added: “The achievement of Rocket Lab is hugely beneficial for New Zealand’s long-term success, inspiring our next generation of young engineering and science talent.

They cost around US$120,000 ($201,000) each. Photo / Jason Oxenham

“Rocket Lab exemplifies world-class innovation, ambition, and commercial execution, the judges said.”

Beck’s think-global ethos saw him win key US backing in Rocket Lab’s early days, including its first major contract - with Darpa (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and venture capital firms in Silicon Valley.

But even as his firm has expanded organically and through acquisitions across North America, it now has operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, Mississippi, New Mexico, Toronto, Washington DC and Virginia - it continues to expand in his home country too.

Rocket Lab machining and fabrication manager Scott Heslop previously held a similar role for Oracle Team USA, building satellites and America's Cup boats involved shared skills, from working with advanced carbon composites to high-tech CNC manufacturing. Photo / Jason Oxenham

Rocket Lab was recently advertising for 58 more staff in New Zealand, with roles running from software engineers in Auckland to a “Neutron composite technician” in Warkworth - where Beck’s firm took on Sir Russell Coutts’ SailGP plant and its 50 staff after Coutts decamped his operation to Spain. Beck was able to use their expertise in carbon composites - the material used in not just SailGP and America’s Cup yachts but Rocket Lab rockets too.

This year has seen a record number of launches from Mahia - which Beck says will always appeal because of New Zealand’s relatively empty skies and seaways.

Rocket Lab has also recently expanded its Mt Wellington factory - which was already assembling Electron rockets - for research and development work on Neutron, plus a new production line producing thousands of reaction wheels, used for keeping satellites in the correct orientation.

Beck’s firm has also had a halo effect. “Rocket Lab has helped create an entirely new multi-company industry for New Zealand,” the judges said.

It has fostered and inspired dozens of aerospace startups - some of which have had seed funding from Beck, or have been established by ex-Rocket staff, including Kea Aerospace, founded by Mark Rocket.

Kiwis now sought-after in global aerospace industry

More broadly, the rise of Rocket Lab has prompted a change in the way the global aerospace industry sees NZ.

“New Zealand is now recognised globally as a serious space player,” Beck tells the Herald.

“World-class space industry talent now sees New Zealand as a serious and ambitious place to work, and similarly, Kiwis are highly sought after internationally,” Beck said.

“Likewise, investors know Kiwis can do space well - so that fuels the local ecosystem.

“But most importantly, I think Rocket Lab’s success has convinced others in the space industry, and beyond, in the wider start-up industry, that it’s not only okay but encouraged to get overseas early, attract international investment, secure international customers, grow international teams and expand footprints beyond our shores, fast.

“We are a nation of wildly talented and driven people. We should protect and celebrate that, but also recognise that in order to grow and truly flourish we need to think and act globally.”

No longer just rocket launches

How has Rocket Lab grown and diversified its revenue over the past year?

“Most people know us as a launch company, but we’ve expanded far beyond this an end-to-end space company with revenue diversified across launch, satellite manufacturing and operation, and satellite components and subsystems supplied at constellation volumes,” Beck told the Herald.

“Electron demand is accelerating faster than ever before, and that momentum continues to build upon our largest launch backlog yet with 49 launches on contract. We’ve just launched our 18th mission this year, equalling last year’s launch record.

“We’ve opened up new markets with existing products, such as enabling hypersonic test launches with Electron rockets tweaked slightly to serve different mission profiles. Then we’re also unlocking more TAM [total addressable market] with Neutron, enabling us to soon launch larger spacecraft and constellations.”

Beck said his company had continued to make strategic acquisitions to diversify revenue, “But also to unlock supply chain bottlenecks, enabling us to increase vertical integration to drive cost and speed efficiencies.”

His vision is for Rocket Lab to be a one-stop destination - able to design, launch and build any spacecraft its customers require.

How could New Zealand foster more Rocket Labs?

“Encourage our people and businesses to go global,” Beck says.

“To be a global success, you have to think bigger than NZ in terms of investment, talent, operations, customers and more.

“We should celebrate businesses that do this, not lament them expanding offshore.”

Finalist: The a2 Milk Company

“A2 Milk has been something of a comeback story and one that highlights that adapting to change is a key driver of long-term success,” the judges said.

“A2 Milk has clearly worked hard to strengthen its distribution chain, particularly into the critical China market, but also expanding into other important geographies, including Australia and North America.

“The company continues to focus on its premium core – liquid milk and infant nutrition.

“It does what it does very well and off the back of real investment in research, product development and marketing, a2 Milk has seen an excellent return to revenue growth and improved margins and strong cashflows”.

Chief executive and managing director David Bortolussi was highly respected for his role in returning a2 Milk to strong growth after the disruption of the pandemic years, the judges said.

In August, a2 Milk announced a major change in direction, which involved selling its interest in Mataura Valley Milk and buying Yashili New Zealand’s plant at Pōkeno.

The judges noted that as of mid-November, a2 Milk was the top-performing stock on the NZX over the past year, up 100.8%. It was a strong conjunction from last year’s “most-improved” performance," the judges said.

A2 had achieved a 30% annual shareholder return over the past decade as it had “carved out a premium niche in the global dairy market through its unique a2 protein proposition and strong consumer trust.”

There had been sustained investment in marketing, product development, and scientific research, reinforcing a2 Milk’s global differentiation.

There had also been a focus on long-term brand equity, supply chain integrity, and premium product quality, supporting continued global momentum.

The firm’s performance was also recognised through CFO David Muscat being named a finalist for the Deloitte 200 CFO of the Year.

“It’s been a massive year for us,” Muscat told the Herald.

“We’ve executed effectively three complex transactions in order to unlock pretty significant value for the organisation.

“Now, it’s ‘how do we, in a disciplined way, execute those transactions and deliver against the strategy to unlock some pretty significant value for the organisation’.”

The Pōkeno transaction had enabled additional products to be registered in China, Muscat said.

“Product registration in China contributed to a2’s higher valuation. It’s a difficult achievement,” the Deloitte 200 judges said.

Strategic acquisitions had expanded market access in China, the judges said. “A2 is now the fourth largest brand in the Chinese infant milk formula market.”

At its annual meeting on November 20, a2 Milk has upgraded its 2026 revenue guidance because of stronger-than-expected trading in infant formula, other nutritionals, milk and a weaker New Zealand dollar.

The company said it now expects revenue growth in the low double-digit percentages, compared with 2025, from continuing operations.

A2 said its profit is expected to be slightly up on 2025’s reported profit of $209.9 million.

Finalist: Fonterra

“Fonterra was a very worthy winner of the 2024 Deloitte Top 200 Company of the Year award, and this year has been a continuation of clear strategic leadership and operational excellence, resulting in another record year for farmer returns and that helps underpin the New Zealand economy,” the judges said.

“The obvious highlight for the year has been the very successful sale of its consumer brands division, enabling the company to focus on its higher-margin ingredients and nutrition products.”

The sale releases significant capital back to its farmer shareholders, together with strengthening its own balance sheet for future growth, the judges said.

The judges added, “Fonterra’s performance this year has been the realisation of a multi-year strategy that has been executed without fault.”

Continued strong milk payouts to farmers reflected sound operational management and high global demand for New Zealand dairy, resulting in another record year for the milk payout reaching $10.16 per kg milk solids, the judges said.

Fonterra’s ongoing success was closely linked to the strategic leadership of Chairman Peter McBride and strong execution by Miles Hurrell and his team, the judges said.

Fonterra had a banner FY2025 (the 12 months to July 31), with revenue up 15% to $26 billion, cash returns to shareholders up 30.6% to $16 billion and operating profit up 13% to $1.8b.

The $4.2b sale of Fonterra’s consumer brands, including Anchor and Mainland, to French company Lactalis, announced on October 30, was structured to deliver a tax-free capital return to farmers of $2 per share from the transaction, equivalent to $3.2b or about $400,000 in total for an average farmer.

The remaining $1 billion will be invested in Fonterra’s foodservice business.

Fonterra says the capital tied up in its consumer business - while profitable - is better directed to its Ingredients and Foodservice businesses, which offer better returns on the capital employed.

The performance also saw Hurrell named as a finalist for the Deloitte 200 CEO of the Year.

[TEXT]
TEL AVIV, Israel , Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUB Cyber Security Ltd. (Nasdaq: HUBC) (“HUB” or the “Company”), a global leader in confidential computing and secured data fabric technologies, today announced a significant new commercial licensing software agreement with one of the world’s most prominent aerospace and defense manufacturers, marking another major step in HUB’s expansion across mission-critical and sovereign-grade environments.

This multi-year agreement is expected to provide meaningful six-figure revenues with strong potential for growth as additional systems and fleets adopt HUB’s platform.

The agreement includes a perpetual license and multi-year support package for FavoWeb FRACAS, HUB’s advanced reliability-intelligence platform used by global aerospace leaders to manage real-time failure tracking, predictive reliability analytics, and corrective-action workflows across complex fleets and high-performance systems. FavoWeb will serve as a critical digital-reliability layer supporting one of the most advanced aerospace development programs currently underway, enabling faster development cycles, improved system availability, and significant lifecycle savings across the platform’s multinational operations.

The manufacturer selected FavoWeb following an extensive, multi-phased technical evaluation that assessed HUB’s ability to meet the stringent reliability, safety, and traceability requirements associated with next-generation aviation systems. Over the course of the evaluation, HUB’s engineering and product teams worked closely with the client to validate performance at scale and ensure seamless integration into the company’s global engineering processes.

This partnership extends HUB’s growing presence in the global aerospace and defense industry, joining the ranks of leading avionics manufacturers and defense integrators that rely on HUB solutions to support their long-term engineering and operational infrastructure.

“This engagement is a powerful confirmation of the direction in which HUB is moving. When one of the world’s most sophisticated aerospace manufacturers chooses HUB to underpin reliability and mission-critical performance, it reflects both the strength of our technology and the trust in our team,” said Noah Hershcoviz, CEO of HUB Cyber Security. “We take great pride in providing software and reliability systems to some of the world’s leading aviation companies. This new partnership reinforces our role as a strategic layer in the engineering stack of the most demanding programs. We expect this relationship to expand substantially as the program grows.”

HUB continues to experience accelerating demand for its secured data fabric and reliability-engineering solutions across aerospace, defense, financial services, banking, energy, and other highly regulated sectors.

[TITLE]BlackRock expects AI to continue dominating markets in 2026 despite risks:
[TEXT]
By Naomi Rovnick

LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, expects AI to continue dominating markets in 2026 and anticipates ​a turbulent ride for investors as speculative trading and leverage raise ‌the risks of a repeat of last month's sharp selloff.

Helen Jewell, BlackRock's CIO of fundamental equities ‌EMEA, said on Thursday returns from AI-linked investments would stay on an upward trend, with some periods of doubt over sector valuations or outlook that would keep stocks volatile.

"Do I expect an upward trend of AI growth returns? Yes, ⁠these are incredible capital spends ‌being driven by companies with incredible amounts of cash," Jewell told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in London.

CROWDING ‍IN MARKET, LEVERAGE LIKELY TO SPUR MARKET SWINGS

"Do I think that there is likely to be a rocky ride as we go there. Also yes," she said, citing ​crowding and leverage as key reasons for market fluctuations.
