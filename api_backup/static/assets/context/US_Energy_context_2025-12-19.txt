[TITLE]U.S. Weighs New Oil Sanctions on Russia if Putin Rejects Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
The United States is considering a fresh barrage of sanctions against Russia’s oil exports if Russian President Vladimir Putin rejects a peace agreement for Ukraine, anonymous sources with knowledge of the plans told Bloomberg on Wednesday.

Earlier this week, the U.S. and Ukraine both signaled progress in negotiations about a peace agreement during talks in German capital city of Berlin. Washington is now reportedly offering Ukraine security guarantees modeled on NATO’s Article 5 mutual defense pledge.

However, key issues about territory remain unresolved, and Putin has signaled he wants all occupied territory.

U.S. President Donald Trump is said to be pushing for a U.S.-brokered deal by Christmas.

On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a U.S.-brokered draft deal to end the war could be presented to Russia within days. It is not certain how Russia would react—it has rejected all drafts so far insisting on its own territorial claims and conditions.

Now the U.S. is already considering how to escalate the sanctions. The Treasury could target additional vessels of the Russian shadow fleet transporting oil, as well as traders found to have facilitated such transactions, according to Bloomberg’s sources.

The sanctions could be announced later this week, some of these sources told Bloomberg.

The previous round of U.S. sanctions – the Trump Administration’s first against Russia – are still reverberating through the global oil markets as they upended trade flows. The sanctions designated Russia’s top two producers and exporters, Rosneft and Lukoil, and sent Indian buyers scrambling for non-sanctioned crude and Lukoil’s international assets fighting for U.S. waivers to continue normal operations and negotiate asset sales.

Asked to comment on Bloomberg’s report that the U.S. readies additional sanctions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today that “Any sanctions harm the fostering of relations, that is obvious,” as carried by Russian news agency Interfax.

[TITLE]Netanyahu approves a $35 billion natural gas export deal to Egypt, the biggest in Israeli history:
[TEXT]

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he has approved a $35 billion natural gas export deal to Egypt, the biggest gas deal in Israeli history. The agreement could also help repair relations between the two countries strained during the two-year war in the Gaza Strip.

The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron, a key owner of the gas field off Israel’s coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Half of the proceeds are expected to go to Israel’s state coffers.

In a recorded video statement, Netanyahu said the deal “greatly strengthens Israel’s position as a regional energy power, and it contributes to stability in our region.”

Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, has served as a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinian militant Hamas group leading up to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that was agreed on in October. Cairo has also has been a vocal critic of Israel’s offensive, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction in Gaza.

Egypt did not immediately confirm Netanyahu’s announcement.

Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a close Netanyahu ally, previously held up the deal with Egypt, claiming the terms were not favorable to Israel. His delays prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel a trip to Israel in October.

But Cohen stood alongside Netanyahu during the Wednesday evening announcement and said he supported the final terms of the deal.

Israel discovered sizeable natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast in the early 2000s and began exporting gas — first to Jordan and later to Egypt — nearly a decade ago.

In a separate development, German lawmakers approved an expansion of a defense agreement for Israel’s sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defense system, Israel’s defense ministry said Wednesday.

The expansion brings the value of the deal from $3.5 billion to $6.5 billion, making it the largest Israeli defense export deal ever, according to the ministry. Germany moved to buy Arrow 3 from Israel as it seeks to strengthen its air defenses against Russia.

The government has notified the new Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, bringing into force a modern regulatory framework aimed at attracting investment and improving ease of doing business in the oil and gas sector.The rules, issued under the recently approved Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025, replace the earlier system of multiple licences with a single petroleum lease covering exploration, development and production of all hydrocarbons, including shale, according to a gazette notification.The new framework provides lease tenures of up to 30 years, extendable for the full economic life of a field, with terms protected from adverse changes. Criminal penalties for violations have been removed and replaced with higher financial penalties of Rs 25 lakh, plus Rs 10 lakh per day for continuing breaches. The rules also allow lessees to share infrastructure to improve operational efficiency.Environmental provisions have mandated time-bound plans for zero gas flaring and reduced greenhouse emissions.Applications for petroleum leases must now be decided within 180 days, and disputes may be resolved through an expedited mechanism, including a neutral arbitration seat for foreign investors.The Oil Industry Safety Directorate has been designated as the competent authority for offshore safety, audits and standard-setting in exploration and production operations.Commenting on the move, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, "In a landmark moment today, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 2025, have been amended to offer ease of business and operations".With a broader spectrum of rights under one petroleum lease, the lessees will have the right to carry out all types of mineral oil operations under one petroleum lease, he said, adding that they may undertake decarbonisation and comprehensive energy projects at oilfields.Application for the grant of a petroleum lease will be decided within 180 days. Long-term leases of up to 30 years may be granted and may be extended up to the economic life of the field, allowing the lessee to make a planned investment decision.Lessees will make an annual declaration to the government of the installed, utilised and excess capacity of the infrastructure facilities owned by it, he said.The new rules permit lessees to jointly develop or share infrastructure facilities by mutual agreement.Seat of arbitration of lease and contractual disputes, where all lessees or contractors are companies incorporated in India, will be New Delhi. Where any member is a foreign company as defined in the Companies Act, a neutral seat of arbitration may be opted for.Rules require NOCs to promptly notify all existing and new discoveries, submit field development plans within prescribed time limits, obtain central government approval for development areas, and regularly report development and production activities. Vedanta Group chairman Anil Agarwal said, "Notifying the landmark reforms to India's oil and gas regulatory framework" is "a truly historic development"."The world has long recognised India's vast untapped hydrocarbon potential, and these new rules finally create the environment needed to unlock it," he said."India produces some of the most affordable oil and gas globally. These reforms will directly benefit consumers - especially the poorest - by enabling greater domestic production and reducing dependence on imports."He said this is the kind of bold, inclusive policy that transformed the United States from a major importer into an energy surplus nation."I never imagined I would witness such a reform in my lifetime. Our energy security is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity. With these changes, I am confident that India can produce at least 50 per cent of its energy domestically."

[TITLE]The Unbelievable Rise of Heat Pumps in the Coldest Places on Earth:
[TEXT]
For years, heat pumps were seen as the fragile heroes of mild climates, efficient in theory but unreliable when the mercury dropped. That narrative has now collapsed under the weight of experience. From the frozen lakes of Finland to the prairies of Canada, heat pumps are thriving where they were once thought impossible.

The data from the multiple past winters tells the story clearly. Even in subzero temperatures, installations are growing faster than almost any other clean heating technology. This shift is more than a technical achievement; it is a cultural one. It challenges long-held assumptions
