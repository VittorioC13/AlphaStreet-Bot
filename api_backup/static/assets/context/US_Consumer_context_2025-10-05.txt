[TITLE]Most Americans continue to rate the U.S. economy negatively as partisan gap widens:
[TEXT]
U.S. adults’ ratings of the national economy continue to be more negative than positive: 26% now say economic conditions are excellent or good, while 74% say they are only fair or poor.

These overall ratings are mostly unchanged during the past three years. But Republicans and Democrats have shifted considerably over this period:

44% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now rate the economy as excellent or good – up 8 percentage points from April . This is Republicans’ most positive assessment since President Donald Trump’s first administration.

. This is Republicans’ most positive assessment since President Donald Trump’s first administration. 10% of Democrats and Democratic leaners now say the economy is in excellent or good shape – unchanged since April, but considerably lower than throughout Joe Biden’s presidency.

Around three-quarters of Americans (74%) describe economic conditions as only fair or poor – similar to the 72% who said this in January 2024. That includes 56% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats, according to a new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Sept. 22-28 among 3,445 U.S. adults.

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to assess American’s views of the economy. For this analysis, we surveyed 3,445 U.S. adults from Sept. 22 to 28, 2025. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education, presidential vote (among voters) and other factors. Read more

[TITLE]Malls swap bulk buys for gourmet treats as hypermarkets struggle:
[TEXT]
Urban shoppers are steadily turning away from hypermarkets, once considered the anchor tenants of India’s malls, and gravitating towards gourmet and premium retail formats. Rising demand for speciality food, beauty, fitness and personal care is reshaping the tenant mix inside malls, forcing developers to rethink their leasing strategies.

Nexus Select Trust, which operates 19 malls across 15 cities and records over 131 million annual visitors, is already reallocating space from hypermarkets to categories that are drawing stronger traction. “Gourmet is doing very well. Hypermarkets, overall, have been impacted by quick commerce, but the gourmet segment within that is still attracting consumers,” said Pratik Dantara, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Head of Strategy, Nexus Select Trust. The REIT is also rebalancing space between multiplexes and family entertainment zones, and doubling down on jewellery, beauty, personal care, and fitness tenants.

The shift comes as hypermarket operators struggle with a combination of rising rents, high utility costs and intensifying competition from quick-commerce players that deliver groceries and essentials in minutes. Smaller basket sizes, driven by changing consumer habits and economic pressures, have further eroded the appeal of big-box formats. “Most hypermarkets are grocery-driven, and grocery is now available across quick commerce,” said Dantara.

Anuj Kejriwal, CEO & MD of ANAROCK Retail, noted that the old volume-driven model is losing relevance. “Indians often prefer buying smaller amounts of goods rather than stocking up in bulk, which reduces basket sizes. At the same time, complicated logistics, inventory shrinkage and differing state-level tax structures have also weighed on profitability,” he said.

The challenges are not new. Between 2013 and 2018, many hypermarket chains expanded aggressively, but their economics remained fragile. “Margins were thin at around 20–23 per cent, and if a competing hypermarket opened nearby, sales could drop by as much as 40 per cent, crashing profitability,” said Angshuman Bhattacharya, Partner and National Leader, Consumer Products and Retail, EY-Parthenon. By contrast, speciality and premium retailers generate much higher margins per square foot, making them a more attractive bet for mall operators.

As a result, malls are rethinking their anchors. While hypermarket footprints may shrink, the space they vacate opens up possibilities for food halls, entertainment centres, and even coworking hubs—formats that sustain both foot traffic and rental yields. “A diverse tenant mix and varied lease structures help keep mall valuations strong,” said Kejriwal.

The outcome is clear: India’s malls are evolving from value-driven, grocery-heavy formats into hubs for premium retail and experience-led consumption. For hypermarkets, the sheen may be fading, but for gourmet, speciality and lifestyle retail, the runway looks long.

[TITLE]Georgia Tech reportedly inks massive nine-figure apparel deal to ditch Adidas:
[TEXT]
Georgia Tech is going to have a new apparel partner and it comes with a big time price tag. According to ESPN’s Pete Thamel, the Yellow Jackets have agreed to a 10-year deal with Under Armour to become the school’s official apparel provider, starting July 1, 2026.

Source: Georgia Tech and Under Armour have agreed to a new 10-year deal for UA to become the official apparel provider, effective July 1 of 2026. The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that GTech is getting from current adidas deal. pic.twitter.com/MeZfbDkuTU — Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) October 3, 2025

The deal is expected to be nearly six-times more than the average annual amount that Georgia Tech is getting from the current Adidas deal, according to Thamel and Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Chad Bishop.

"Tech was receiving an average of $3.11 million annually from Adidas in cash and product over its original six-year contract that was signed in 2018," Bishop said. This figure puts the reported value of Georgia Tech's new deal with UA at $186.6 million over ten years.

Georgia Tech’s previous deal with Adidas was set to expire in the summer of 2024, but the two sides put together a new two-year deal. However, the short-term fix wasn't enough to keep the Yellow Jackets from looking elsewhere.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Under Armour, an organization that shares our commitment to excellence, innovation, amplifying the Georgia Tech brand across the globe and enhancing the student-athlete experience, including through innovative NIL opportunities," GT's Vice president and director of athletics Ryan Alpert said in a statement. "Our partnership with Under Armour will play a big part in Georgia Tech continuing to move forward in the new era of collegiate athletics and reaching our ambitions of competing for championships at the highest levels of collegiate athletics.”

For Under Armour, this deal puts the outfitter back on the map in the new era of college athletics.

“As we mark our 30th anniversary next year, we’re thrilled to team back up with Georgia Tech, our first collegiate client, to experience our commitment to enhancing athletic performance." Under Armour's VP of the Team Division Craig Cummings said in a statement. "We are energized by the momentum in Atlanta and look forward to amplifying our presence in the community through meaningful activations and shared purpose.”

Georgia Tech had worn Russell Athletic for over two decades before switching to Under Armour in 1996. They migrated to Adidas and now the two brands will be reunited after thirty years apart.

The Yellow Jacket's first time officially back in the UA branding will come against Deion Sanders and Colorado in Atlanta on Sept. 5, 2026.
