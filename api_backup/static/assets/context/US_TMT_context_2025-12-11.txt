[TITLE]Gogo makes a strategic investment in Farcast to support new cutting-edge user terminal technology to enhance inflight connectivity for business, military, and government aviation:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farcast , a San Francisco-based startup building advanced satellite user terminals, announces that it has received strategic equity investment from Gogo (Nasdaq: GOGO), a leading in-flight communications provider for business, military, and government aviation, to evolve a new class of aviation user terminals for Gogo customers.

The investment will support the development of core technology needed for new antennas to support optimized cabin connectivity, expanding crew and passenger use cases. Farcast’s single-aperture, full-duplex flat panel antenna, FPA, will deliver reduced size, weight, power, and cost, SWaP-C, for operators while simultaneously increasing bandwidth. Installation of the compact terminal on existing aircraft real estate will also extend connectivity reach for more aircraft categories.

Farcast has already developed a unique technology that can simultaneously transmit and receive data from the same aperture in a flat panel antenna, FPA. The proprietary Active Electronically Scanned Antenna (AESA) technology uses electronic beam scanning to compensate for the movement of satellites from a single aperture, enabling the full-duplex FPA to lower SWaP-C.

The next-gen technology will complement the existing Gogo portfolio and support the company’s strategy of delivering a multi-band, multi-orbit connectivity experience from a compact terminal, enhancing the value proposition for Gogo customers.

“We recognized Farcast’s innovative approach to resolving some of the most complex challenges we have faced regarding the development and deployment of aviation user terminals. Farcast has developed a technology that will substantially reduce key SWaP-C constraints aviation faces, including scalability, while retaining and improving performance in a small form factor design,” says Chris Moore, CEO, Gogo. “We are confident this technology can be a real game changer for Gogo and our aviation customers.”

“We know that the aviation sector increasingly expects powerful in-flight connectivity and we’re excited to work with Gogo to demonstrate the value of integrating our reduced SwaP-C technology into its portfolio to elevate its offering to its diverse customer portfolio,” says Siamak Ebadi, CEO, Farcast. “We are extremely excited

[TITLE]Deus Ex Machina Capital announces two complementary research papers on AI-assisted software development and AI productivity.:
[TEXT]
San Francisco, CA, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Deus Ex Machina Capital announced the release of two research papers examining why AI-assisted productivity gains are diverging across organizations. The papers were authored by Francesco Bisardi, an independent researcher who leads the firm’s research program. The work argues that AI agents and modern developer tooling can create step-change execution speed when teams redesign workflows rather than layering AI on legacy processes.

Bisardi said:

“Over the next five years, the binding scarce asset will not be access to UI-based chat models, but the capability to redesign human workflows into agentic systems and apply them to mispriced surfaces still anchored to human labor or legacy R&D cost assumptions.”

The first paper, “An Approach to High-Velocity Development through Systematic Context Engineering: A Case Study,” introduces a context architecture designed for fast AI-native software development. The approach, based on a four-pillar framework, combines:

A declarative rule layer that encodes architectural, process, and quality invariants

A programmatic Repo Model Context Protocol (MCP) layer that exposes live project structure, data, and tools to AI assistants and agents

In roughly fifteen part-time weeks, two researchers built a production-grade research artifact (Bizie.app) that reproduces a representative set of features found in mature event-productivity software, illustrating the practical implications of the proposed context architecture. The paper serves as a case study and a practical guide for aspiring entrepreneurs, clearly defining the distinction between vibe-coded prototypes and production-grade applications.

The second paper, “The LLM Productivity Cliff: Threshold Productivity and AI-Native Inequality,” addresses a central tension in the AI narrative: widespread access to LLMs has not produced uniform productivity gains. Based on early empirical evidence, the researchers argue that:

There is a threshold productivity level below which additional AI assistance has limited impact and above which returns become sharply non-linear.

The decisive variable is AI architectural literacy: the steepest gains accrue to teams with the skills to re-engineer human and UI-based workflows into agentic systems, while organizations that simply add AI tools on top of legacy stacks and processes see only marginal improvements.

Private capital targets mission-critical software power and platforms in new space economy

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Dec 09, 2025

Axle Point Capital and Balerion Space Ventures are directing new private capital into companies that build core infrastructure for the expanding U.S. space and defense economy, from mission software and guidance systems to deployable microreactors and high-temperature reactors. Axle Point's first transaction is a strategic equity investment in Odyssey Space Research LLC, a flight software and engineering firm that supports NASA and defense programs, while Balerion has taken stakes in Antares Industries, Samara Aerospace, and Valar Atomics, three companies focused on spacecraft platforms and nuclear energy systems for defense and industrial users.

Odyssey Space Research develops and sustains flight software and guidance, navigation and control (GN and C) systems for missions that range from small satellites to large human-rated spacecraft. Its work covers flight software development, simulation, mission analysis, avionics integration and test, spaceflight simulation and analysis, and human spaceflight operations, using software frameworks and tools that support configurable mission solutions. Odyssey's teams contribute to missions that include proximity operations such as rendezvous and docking, and support both uncrewed and crewed spacecraft operating in the vicinity of the International Space Station and in other complex orbital regimes.

A key growth driver for Odyssey is NASA's RPOC V contract, a five year award that extends the company's role in integrated GN and C assessments and trajectory and flight software integration. Under RPOC V, Odyssey supports commercial cargo and crew vehicles that approach and depart the ISS, as well as GN and C and trajectory work for Orion program missions. The contract continues a workload where Odyssey's analysis and software integration tasks must meet NASA human spaceflight certification and safety requirements, reinforcing its position as a supplier of mission-critical software and engineering to U.S. government customers.

Axle Point Capital, based in Newport Beach, completed the Odyssey transaction in partnership with the ONE Bow River National Defense Fund, which provided equity capital for the acquisition. The deal establishes Odyssey as a platform investment for Axle Point as it pursues additional aerospace, defense, and government services opportunities with institutional co investors. The firm's strategy centers on hard-to-access sectors such as space and defense, where programs often require long-term technical support, regulatory approval, and specialized engineering capabilities.

"Axle Point Capital was founded to identify and unlock value in hard-to-access sectors like space and defense," said Gerik Degner, CFA, Managing Partner. "We are thrilled to partner with ONE Bow River and the exceptional team at Odyssey and look forward to leveraging our sector expertise to help accelerate its growth and expand its impact on vital national space programs."

"Odyssey represents the very best of innovation in spaceflight software and guidance, navigation, and control systems for manned and unmanned spaceflight and robotics. The Odyssey team is stellar from top to bottom," added Kevin O'Neil, Chief Investment Officer of ONE Bow River. Steven Joanis, Senior Managing Director, added, "It is a privilege to partner with Axle Point, whose market understanding, strategic vision, and raw tenacity were pivotal in architecting this transaction and bode well for the valuation acceleration to come. This investment underscores our shared commitment to advancing technologies that are vital to our nation's capabilities in space."

Balerion Space Ventures is pursuing a parallel thesis across frontier technology, announcing investments in Antares Industries, Samara Aerospace, and Valar Atomics as part of a portfolio designed around systems that build, power, and operate critical space and industrial infrastructure. Antares is developing modular, transportable microreactors intended for rapid deployment in contested or remote environments to provide autonomous, resilient power for defense operations and critical infrastructure. These systems target growing demand for local, secure energy as defense spending increases and policymakers place more emphasis on energy security and grid resilience.

Samara Aerospace is building high precision spacecraft platforms that use advanced attitude control technologies to deliver agile on-orbit performance. Its satellite buses are aimed at missions that require fine pointing and maneuverability, including next-generation Earth observation and other constellations that depend on accurate pointing and rapid retasking. As government and commercial operators expand orbital infrastructure, platforms like those developed by Samara are positioned as enabling assets for imaging, data relay, and other services that rely on stable, responsive spacecraft.

Valar Atomics is focused on nuclear systems for heavy industrial power and hydrocarbon fuel production, and reports that it is the first U.S. nuclear startup to reach criticality at its Utah testing site. The company is advancing high-temperature reactors designed to provide industrial heat and support clean fuel production, and has achieved cold criticality under Project NOVA and been selected for U.S. Department of Energy efforts such as the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program and Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Program. Valar has begun construction of Ward 250, its first nuclear test reactor in Utah, after completing Ward Zero, a non nuclear prototype facility, and is working with partners including the Philippines Nuclear Research Institute as it develops TRISO-fueled, helium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor technology for industrial users and AI infrastructure that require high reliability power.

"Launch costs are collapsing. Defense budgets are rising. Dual-use technologies are being adopted at a record pace," said Phil Scully, Co Founder and General Partner at Balerion Space Ventures. "The companies we're backing are building the foundational systems that will power the next trillion-dollar economy. Agile spacecraft, advanced nuclear systems, and deployable microreactors - these are the technologies that will determine who leads in space, defense, and domestic manufacturing over the next decade as we enter a new industrial era driven by mass access to space. Balerion is excited to back the companies developing the infrastructure that will power the space economy."

"These companies are building the enabling infrastructure that the broader space and defense ecosystem will rely upon for decades," said Daniel Wallman, Partner at Balerion. "As capital pours into the sector, our focus remains disciplined on backing mission-critical platforms with real technical depth and scalable economics. Antares, Samara, and Valar exemplify the kind of durable enterprise value being created at the frontier of this asset class."

Balerion states that the funding will support product development, facility build out, and progress toward commercial milestones at each of the three portfolio companies as they expand work with defense, civil, and commercial customers. The firm plans to discuss the investments and its view of the market at its annual general meeting in Bentonville, Arkansas.

[TITLE]State legislators seek release of BEAD non-deployment funds:
[TEXT]
More than 100 state legislators from both parties have sent a letter to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick asking that the remaining non-deployment funds from the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program be released.

The letter was signed by more than 160 state legislators. The vast majority of signatories were Democrats.

The letter, which was also sent to Arielle Roth — the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) — said that it was Congress’ “clear intent” to release non-deployment BEAD funds and that it is required to do so under Section 60102(f) of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

The letter says that non-deployment funds are used for tasks such as building artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, streamlining permitting and pole attachment processes, developing the telecom workforce, improving middle mile and cellular networks, enhancing cybersecurity and emergency services, expanding telehealth and education opportunities, and fostering broadband adoption and affordability.

The letter does not say how much money collectively is meant for non-deployment uses. The pot is huge, though. Two states — Texas and North Carolina — have more than $1 billion available and most will have access to hundreds of millions of dollars.

“The scale of non-deployment will allow states to improve virtually every aspect of their connectivity,” according to the letter. “This unprecedented opportunity was created in direct response to NTIA’s call for efficiency. To now deny states the funds their efficiency generated would penalize success and undermine BEAD’s purpose.”

This is far from the first time that questions have been raised about BEAD non-deployment funds. For instance, in late August, ten members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to Lutnick and Roth asking for clarification on how the funds would be managed.

[TITLE]The Free Market Can Connect Rural America Faster Than the Government:
[TEXT]
Elon Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink, announced a new milestone in November: 8 million users worldwide, up from its previous high-water mark of 7 million in August. Many of these users would otherwise have no connection at all. For decades, reliable internet service has been out of reach for too many, with traditional fiber-optic broadband rollout slow, challenging, and costly. Starlink and new innovators are changing that, revolutionizing how we connect rural America.

A service of SpaceX, Starlink delivers broadband through a constellation of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, a technology unconstrained by the traditional "last mile" problem of physically connecting homes to high-speed networks. Each terminal links directly to satellites, providing high-speed internet worldwide. Because Starlink's satellites orbit roughly 340 miles above Earth, versus
