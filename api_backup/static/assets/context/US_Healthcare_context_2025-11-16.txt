[TITLE]OMRON Healthcare Announces Second Investment in Tricog Health to Advance AI-Powered Cardiac Care in India:
[TEXT]
KYOTO, Japan, Nov. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- OMRON Healthcare Co., Ltd. today announced additional investment in India-based AI medtech startup TRICOG HEALTH INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED. This is OMRON Healthcare’s second wave of investment in Tricog, following an initial investment in March 2023, further strengthening the partnership to accelerate business growth.

India’s pressing cardiovascular challenges

According to WHO data, cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases are the No. 1 and No. 2 causes of death in India[1], and against the backdrop of changing lifestyles and a rapidly aging population, patient numbers are only expected to continue increasing. Meanwhile, healthcare providers face multiple constraints: Per capita, India has far fewer certified cardiologists than Japan or the United States, leading to a severe shortage of specialists qualified to analyze ECG data. Furthermore, not all medical facilities have access to the specialist equipment required for advanced diagnostics such as ECG testing.

To address these needs, and facilitate the timely provision of preventive care for those who need it, Tricog Health fuses cutting edge AI analysis built from more than a decade of ECG data, with the human expertise of over 100 in-house clinical specialists. Together, these strengths provide the platform for the development of devices and services tailored to frontline clinical workflows.

Remote monitoring collaboration for heart-failure care

Since 2023, OMRON Healthcare and Tricog Health have been working together on the development and launch of KeeboHealth, a remote monitoring service for heart-failure patients that integrates Tricog’s AI-based ECG analytics with OMRON’s connected electrocardiograph devices. By analyzing home-recorded ECG and blood pressure data, and sharing the results with physicians, the service improves diagnostic efficiency and helps prevent post-treatment recurrence.

Deepening the partnership toward Going for ZERO

Through this new investment, OMRON Healthcare will further strengthen its strategic partnership with Tricog Health, setting ambitious joint goals to introduce solutions aligned with local clinical needs in India, while advancing the development and delivery of ever-higher-value devices and services. This collaboration is also an important component of OMRON Healthcare’s corporate mission, Going for ZERO, which sets the ambitious goal of a future in which adverse cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events are a thing of the past.

Quote from Dr Charit Bhograj, CEO Tricog Health:

“Together, we will accelerate a hospital-to-home rollout, pairing OMRON’s world-class medical devices with Keebo™ AI-powered, guideline-aware workflows, to streamline diagnosis, improve cardiovascular management, and reduce avoidable healthcare costs across Asia, Africa and other key international markets.”

Quote from Ayumu Okada, President and CEO, OMRON HEALTHCARE Co., Ltd.

“India is at a pivotal moment when it comes to facing cardiovascular disease, and we are proud to deepen our partnership with Tricog Health to bring advanced remote patient monitoring services and early detection to patients nationwide. We take a proactive approach to strategic partnerships, working with collaborators who help us move faster and innovate further. Combining Tricog’s AI-driven cardiology platform with OMRON’s medical technology will improve outcomes, reduce risk and bring us closer to our global vision of ‘Going for ZERO’ cardiovascular events.”

[TITLE]Ramsey Theory Group CEO Dan Herbatschek Announces New Enhancements to Its AI-Driven Healthcare Delivery System Erdos Medical and Increased Adoption in Los Angeles:
[TEXT]
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ramsey Theory Group, the applied-mathematics-driven software and AI innovation firm, today announced new enhancements to its flagship healthcare delivery platform, Erdos Medical. CEO Dan Herbatschek stated that the update introduces advanced interoperability, AI-assisted patient engagement, and expanded compliance architecture designed to help healthcare providers securely connect with patients through a unified, user-friendly virtual ecosystem.

In Los Angeles County alone, virtual care visits grew by over 60% in 2024, yet most providers still face compliance gaps and data fragmentation.

“Los Angeles County has been an exceptionally strong market for us this year, while Erdos Medical has proven to successfully bring AI-driven and secure automation to human-centered healthcare nationwide,” said Dan Herbatschek, CEO of Ramsey Theory Group. “These new enhancements make it easier for providers to scale virtual operations, reduce administrative friction, and deliver better outcomes—without the security gaps or inefficiencies that have long plagued legacy telehealth systems.”

[TEXT]
Strategic transaction supports the advancement of Decoy’s rapid computational design and manufacturing of innovative peptide conjugate therapeutics through its IMP3ACT™ platform

Combined company has pro forma cash of $14 million following merger and closing of recent public offering

HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SLRX) (“Salarius” or the “Company”) and Decoy Therapeutics (“Decoy”) announce the completion of their strategic merger with the combined company now focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

“I’d like to thank both the Salarius and Decoy teams for their hard work and dedication in completing this transaction, which supports the advancement of next-generation therapeutics through our proprietary IMP3ACT Platform,” said Frederick “Rick” Pierce, Chief Executive Officer of Salarius and former Chief Executive Officer of Decoy. “By combining artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and high-speed synthesis techniques, we rapidly design, engineer and manufacture peptide conjugate drug candidates that target serious unmet medical needs. Our technology and innovations in manufacturing allow for advancing new therapies from lab to clinic to commercialization with unprecedented speed. We anticipate multiple value-creating inflection points in the coming year, initially targeting unmet needs in respiratory infectious diseases and gastroenterology (GI) oncology indications.”

Prior to this merger, Decoy attracted financing from institutional investors as well as significant non-dilutive capital from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Seed Fund, the Google AI startup program and the NVIDIA Inception program, among other sources. Decoy also received QuickFire Challenge award funding provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) through BLUE KNIGHT™, a legacy collaboration between Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS and BARDA within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

Then new company will be renamed Decoy Therapeutics. In addition to Decoy’s Co-founder Mr. Pierce serving as Chief Executive Officer, the new company is led by Decoy’s Co-founder Chief Scientific Officer Barbara Hibner, by Decoy’s Chief Business Officer Peter Marschel, by Decoy’s Chief Technology Officer Mike Lipp and by Decoy’s acting Chief Medical Officer and Scientific Advisory Board Chair Shahin Gharakhanian, M.D. Salarius’ current Chief Financial Officer and former acting Chief Executive Officer Mark Rosenblum will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company.

Merck to acquire Cidara in $9.2 billion transaction

The pharmaceutical giant is strengthening its respiratory drug portfolio ahead of losing patent protection for Keytruda, its blockbuster cancer treatment.

The pharmaceutical giant is strengthening its respiratory drug portfolio ahead of losing patent protection for Keytruda, its blockbuster cancer treatment.

Merck has agreed to purchase biotechnology company Cidara Therapeutics for $9.2 billion, marking the latest in a series of strategic acquisitions designed to fortify the pharmaceutical giant’s pipeline before it loses exclusive rights to its most profitable drug. The deal represents a significant premium for Cidara shareholders and underscores the urgency with which major drugmakers are seeking new revenue sources.

The New Jersey based pharmaceutical company announced Friday it would pay $221.50 per share for the San Diego biotech firm, a price that more than doubles Cidara’s closing stock price of $105.99 from the previous day. The substantial premium reflects both the value Merck places on Cidara’s assets and the competitive landscape for promising drug candidates in the respiratory disease space.

A strategic bet on flu prevention

At the heart of the acquisition lies CD388, Cidara’s leading drug candidate that has captured Merck’s attention and investment. The antiviral agent is currently advancing through Phase 3 clinical studies, where researchers are evaluating its effectiveness in preventing influenza infections among individuals facing elevated risk of serious flu complications. Success in these trials could position the drug as a significant commercial product in a market where prevention options remain limited.

The transaction is expected to finalize during the first quarter of 2026, giving both companies time to navigate regulatory approvals and integration planning. For Cidara shareholders, the deal offers immediate and substantial returns, with shares surging to $215.50 in premarket trading following the announcement, more than doubling their value overnight.

Building a respiratory powerhouse

This acquisition follows closely on the heels of another major purchase in the respiratory disease arena. Just last month, Merck completed a roughly $10 billion acquisition of Verona Pharma, gaining access to Ohtuvayre, a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The back to back deals signal a clear strategic direction as Merck positions itself as a leader in respiratory therapeutics.

Chief Executive Rob Davis has characterized CD388 as a potentially important growth driver for the coming decade, expressing confidence that the acquisition will deliver meaningful value to shareholders. His optimism reflects broader industry trends showing increased investment in respiratory diseases, particularly following heightened awareness of airborne illness prevention in recent years.

The Keytruda challenge

The aggressive acquisition strategy stems from a looming financial challenge that keeps pharmaceutical executives awake at night. Merck faces a 2028 patent cliff for Keytruda, its enormously successful cancer immunotherapy that generated nearly $29.5 billion in sales last year alone. When patent protection expires, generic competitors will enter the market, inevitably eroding Merck’s revenue from what has been its most lucrative product.

Davis has been transparent

[TITLE]Ramsey Theory Group CEO Dan Herbatschek Announces New Enhancements to Its AI-Driven Healthcare Delivery System Erdos Medical and Increased Adoption in Los Angeles:
[TEXT]
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ramsey Theory Group, the applied-mathematics-driven software and AI innovation firm, today announced new enhancements to its flagship healthcare delivery platform, Erdos Medical. CEO Dan Herbatschek stated that the update introduces advanced interoperability, AI-assisted patient engagement, and expanded compliance architecture designed to help healthcare providers securely connect with patients through a unified, user-friendly virtual ecosystem.

Erdos Medical has quickly become one of Ramsey Theory Group’s most transformative products—empowering clinics, hospitals, and private practices to deliver patient-centered virtual care without compromising compliance, privacy, or data integrity. According to the American Hospital Association, more than 76% of U.S. hospitals now offer telehealth services, but only 38% fully integrate virtual workflows with EHR systems. In Los Angeles County alone, virtual care visits grew by over 60% in 2024, yet most providers still face compliance gaps and data fragmentation.

“Los Angeles County has been an exceptionally strong market for us this year, while Erdos Medical has proven to successfully bring AI-driven and secure automation to human-centered healthcare nationwide,” said Dan Herbatschek, CEO of Ramsey Theory Group. “These new enhancements make it easier for providers to scale virtual operations, reduce administrative friction, and deliver better outcomes—without the security gaps or inefficiencies that have long plagued legacy telehealth systems.”

[TITLE]OMRON Healthcare Announces Second Investment in Tricog Health to Advance AI-Powered Cardiac Care in India:
[TEXT]
KYOTO, Japan, Nov. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- OMRON Healthcare Co., Ltd. today announced additional investment in India-based AI medtech startup TRICOG HEALTH INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED. This is OMRON Healthcare’s second wave of investment in Tricog, following an initial investment in March 2023, further strengthening the partnership to accelerate business growth.

India’s pressing cardiovascular challenges

According to WHO data, cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases are the No. 1 and No. 2 causes of death in India[1], and against the backdrop of changing lifestyles and a rapidly aging population, patient numbers are only expected to continue increasing. Meanwhile, healthcare providers face multiple constraints: Per capita, India has far fewer certified cardiologists than Japan or the United States, leading to a severe shortage of specialists qualified to analyze ECG data. Furthermore, not all medical facilities have access to the specialist equipment required for advanced diagnostics such as ECG testing.

To address these needs, and facilitate the timely provision of preventive care for those who need it, Tricog Health fuses cutting edge AI analysis built from more than a decade of ECG data, with the human expertise of over 100 in-house clinical specialists. Together, these strengths provide the platform for the development of devices and services tailored to frontline clinical workflows.

Remote monitoring collaboration for heart-failure care

Since 2023, OMRON Healthcare and Tricog Health have been working together on the development and launch of KeeboHealth, a remote monitoring service for heart-failure patients that integrates Tricog’s AI-based ECG analytics with OMRON’s connected electrocardiograph devices. By analyzing home-recorded ECG and blood pressure data, and sharing the results with physicians, the service improves diagnostic efficiency and helps prevent post-treatment recurrence.

Deepening the partnership toward Going for ZERO

Through this new investment, OMRON Healthcare will further strengthen its strategic partnership with Tricog Health, setting ambitious joint goals to introduce solutions aligned with local clinical needs in India, while advancing the development and delivery of ever-higher-value devices and services. This collaboration is also an important component of OMRON Healthcare’s corporate mission, Going for ZERO, which sets the ambitious goal of a future in which adverse cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events are a thing of the past.

Quote from Dr Charit Bhograj, CEO Tricog Health:

“Together, we will accelerate a hospital-to-home rollout, pairing OMRON’s world-class medical devices with Keebo™ AI-powered, guideline-aware workflows, to streamline diagnosis, improve cardiovascular management, and reduce avoidable healthcare costs across Asia, Africa and other key international markets.”

Quote from Ayumu Okada, President and CEO, OMRON HEALTHCARE Co., Ltd.

“India is at a pivotal moment when it comes to facing cardiovascular disease, and we are proud to deepen our partnership with Tricog Health to bring advanced remote patient monitoring services and early detection to patients nationwide. We take a proactive approach to strategic partnerships, working with collaborators who help us move faster and innovate further. Combining Tricog’s AI-driven cardiology platform with OMRON’s medical technology will improve outcomes, reduce risk and bring us closer to our global vision of ‘Going for ZERO’ cardiovascular events.”
