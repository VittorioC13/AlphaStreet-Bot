[TITLE]Netflix Faces Tough Regulatory Mountain to Climb in Getting Warner Bros. Deal Done:
[TEXT]
In a call with investors on Friday morning, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos went into hard-sell mode, saying management was “highly confident in the regulatory process” and “running full speed” toward approval of its $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming businesses.

“This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it’s pro-creator, it’s pro-growth, and our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but we’re really confident that we’re going to to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Sarandos added. “These two businesses are complementary, and they’re also loved businesses, which is really fantastic.”

Sarandos and Netflix could be alone in that opinion.

That’s because Netflix will almost certainly face antitrust scrutiny from the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, with the president largely favoring Paramount Skydance as the acquirer.

Also in play are European regulators who could throw up roadblocks and the potential for a legal challenge from state attorneys general on opposite sides of the political spectrum in key states like California, New York, Georgia and Texas, underscoring the potentially wide coalition of parties opposing the deal.

This regulatory scrutiny would come on top of an already vocal opposition from those in the Hollywood community who expressed their fears to TheWrap that Netflix’s takeover of Warner Bros. and HBO could pose an existential threat to the theatrical business and lead to fewer opportunities in a business already decimated by consolidation.

“A very strong regulatory challenge is inevitable here,” Third Bridge analyst John Conca told TheWrap. “With so many different stakeholder groups pushing back against this, from competitors to exhibitors, Netflix faces an uphill battle convincing regulators to approve a deal like this. There are definitely concerns

[TITLE]Netflix–Warner Bros. deal sets up $72 billion antitrust test:
[TEXT]
Netflix Inc. has won the heated takeover battle for Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. Now it must convince global antitrust regulators that the deal won’t give it an illegal advantage in the streaming market.

The $72 billion tie-up joins the world’s dominant paid streaming service with one of Hollywood’s most iconic movie studios. It would reshape the market for online video content by combining the No. 1 streaming player with the No. 4 service HBO Max and its blockbuster hits such as Game Of Thrones, Friends, and the DC Universe comics characters franchise.

That could raise red flags for global antitrust regulators over concerns that Netflix would have too much control over the streaming market. The company faces a lengthy Justice Department review and a possible US lawsuit seeking to block the deal if it doesn’t adopt some remedies to get it cleared, analysts said.

“Netflix will have an uphill climb unless it agrees to divest HBO Max as well as additional behavioral commitments — particularly on licensing content,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. “The streaming overlap is significant,” she added, saying the argument that “the market should be viewed more broadly is a tough one to win.”

By choosing Netflix, Warner Bros. has jilted another bidder, Paramount Skydance Corp., a move that risks touching off a political battle in Washington. Paramount is backed by the world’s second-richest man, Larry Ellison, and his son, David Ellison, and the company has touted their longstanding close ties to President Donald Trump. Their acquisition of Paramount, which closed in August, has won public praise from Trump.

Comcast Corp. also made a bid for Warner Bros., looking to merge it with its NBCUniversal division.

The Justice Department’s antitrust division, which would review the transaction in the US, could argue that the deal is illegal on its face because the combined market share would put Netflix well over a 30% threshold.

The White House, the Justice Department and Comcast didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

US lawmakers from both parties, including Republican Representative Darrell Issa and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren have already faulted the transaction — which would create a global streaming giant with 450 million users — as harmful to consumers.

“This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare,” Warren said after the Netflix announcement. Utah Senator Mike Lee, a Republican, said in a social media post earlier this week that a Warner Bros.-Netflix tie-up would raise more serious competition questions “than any transaction I’ve seen in

[TITLE]Would Donald Trump Try to Block Netflix’s Takeover of Warner Bros.?:
[TEXT]
The seismic deal Netflix inked to buy Warner Bros. — with an eye-popping $83 billion value — will need to get approval from regulators in the U.S. and abroad. And domestically, there’s one individual whose opinion on the matter, President Donald Trump, is of central importance given the control he has exerted over federal agencies.

Trump has not publicly weighed in on a Netflix deal for Warner Bros. But the notion that Netflix would have excessive market power through its acquisition of HBO Max and Warner Bros.’s studios biz has gained traction in the White House — as well as among Republican and Democratic legislators.

On Friday, an unidentified senior official in the Trump administration said the White House has “heavy skepticism”

[TITLE]Electric Motor Market Set to Triple by 2032:
[TEXT]
The market is geographically dominated by Asia-Pacific, which accounted for over 40% of global revenue in 2022, while the LAMEA region is forecast to have the fastest growth rate at 10.6% due to rapid urbanization.

The automobile-traction motor segment is identified as the most aggressive growth vector, projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 14.8% through 2032, representing a fundamental shift in the auto industry away from the internal combustion engine.

The global electric motor market is projected to reach $373.9 billion by 2032, driven by regulatory pressure from governments to meet energy efficiency standards, which are forcing industries to upgrade from aging induction motors.

The machinery that powers the modern world, from industrial assembly lines to the cooling systems of data centers, is undergoing a massive, capital-intensive overhaul.

According to a new analysis by Allied Market Research, the global electric motor market is projected to reach $373.9 billion by 2032, nearly tripling its 2020 valuation of $142.1 billion.

The data reveals a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.5% from 2023 to 2032. But beyond the growth percentages, the report outlines a structural change in how the global economy consumes energy.

As nations and corporations pledge "efficiency" and "decarbonization," the burden of delivering those promises falls on the hardware. The result is a forced retirement of legacy infrastructure and a surge in demand for premium, high-efficiency motor systems.

The Engine of Efficiency

For decades, the industrial motor has been a static component of the global grid. Today, it is a focal point of regulatory pressure.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that electric motor systems account for approximately 53% of global electricity use. As governments in the European Union and North America tighten Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), the industrial sector is being forced to upgrade.

The report highlights that the "prime determinants of growth" are not merely organic demand, but a systemic push for energy efficiency. The market is witnessing a replacement cycle where aging induction motors are swapped for advanced systems capable of meeting Net Zero targets.

This is not a cheap transition. The analysis notes that the "high initial cost" of these advanced motors remains a primary restraint on the market. Efficiency lowers operating costs over decades, but it demands significant upfront capital—a dynamic that favors large industrial incumbents over smaller players.

Rewiring the Automotive Supply Chain

The most aggressive growth vector identified in the report is the automobile-traction motor segment.

Projected to grow at a CAGR of 14.8% through 2032, this segment represents the physical dismantling of the internal combustion engine economy.

Set OilPrice.com as a preferred source in Google here

As automakers pivot to electric vehicles (EVs), the demand for traction motors is reshaping the supply chain for copper, rare earth magnets, and steel laminations.

This shift is more than a consumer trend; it is an industrial imperative to "safeguard the environment by reducing carbon emissions," according to the report. The traction motor is becoming the new engine block, driving a wedge between the automotive industry and its traditional fossil-fuel reliability.

The Grid and the Factory

The report breaks down the market into two distinct technological architectures, each serving a different function in the modern state.

Alternate Current (AC) Motors: These remain the workhorses of the grid. Accounting for three-fourths of the market share in 2020, AC motors dominate the heavy industrial landscape. They are utilized in substations and generating stations—critical infrastructure connected directly to the bus bars that stabilize power factors across the electrical network.

Direct Current (DC) Motors: While smaller in volume, this segment is forecast to grow at 9.9% annually. These motors are the precision instruments of the economy, mechanically commutated and essential for high-speed applications in robotics and medical equipment. As the healthcare and automation sectors expand, their reliance on these specialized motors deepens.

Geopolitics of Production

The geography of this boom confirms where the world’s industrial capacity truly resides.

Asia-Pacific dominated the market in 2022, accounting for more than 40% of global revenue. The region’s control is anchored by the massive manufacturing sectors of China and India, along with agricultural and pharmaceutical industries that rely heavily on motor-driven pumps, compressors, and fans.

However, the fastest growth is emerging elsewhere. The LAMEA region (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa) is projected to witness a CAGR of 10.6%. Rapid urbanization in nations like Brazil and Argentina is driving demand for consumer appliances and home electronics, expanding the grid’s load in the global south.

The Outlook

The surge in electric motor valuation serves as a barometer for the wider energy transition. The "electrification of everything" requires more than just software code or policy papers; it requires millions of tons of copper and steel, wound into the machines that actually do the work.

As the data makes clear, the transition to a greener economy is expensive, resource-intensive, and mechanically complex. The green arrows on the stock charts may measure sentiment, but the backlog for electric motors measures the actual build-out of the future infrastructure.

[TITLE]Analysis-From 'Icarus bug' to flawed panels: Airbus counts cost of relying on single model:
[TEXT]
By Tim Hepher, Allison Lampert and David Shepardson

PARIS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - This week, Airbus got a brutal reminder that even the world’s most-delivered jet - the A320 - isn’t immune to shocks as disparate as solar flares and flawed metal.

Days after recalling 6,000 A320-series planes over a software glitch linked to cosmic radiation, the European giant was ​forced to slash delivery targets when defects surfaced in some of their fuselage panels.

The twin setbacks - one rooted in astrophysics, the other in basic metallurgy - underscore how fragile success ‌can be for a planemaker that dominates the busiest corner of aviation and is on track to outpace Boeing for a seventh straight year.

"As we put one thing behind us, we have another," CEO Guillaume Faury told Reuters as he ‌weighed how many aircraft could be affected by problems with the thickness of panels.

"ICARUS BUG"

Last Friday, Airbus issued surprise instructions to airlines to revert to a previous version of software in a computer that directs the nose angle on some jets, several weeks after a JetBlue A320 tilted downwards, injuring

[TITLE]Stocks Pressured by Higher Bond Yields and Chip Stock Weakness:
[TEXT]
Wall Street sign in New York in the evening by FotorafieLink via iStock

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) is down up by -0.06%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down by -0.11%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down by -0.38%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) are down -0.12%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) are down -0.39%.

Stock indexes are under pressure today amid higher bond yields, with the 10-year T-note yield up +2 bp to 4.08%. Today’s decline in initial jobless claims to a 3-year low was hawkish for Fed policy and pushed T-note yields higher. Also, a Reuters report today said the BOJ is likely to raise interest rates this month and that the government would tolerate the move, pushing Japan JGB yields to an 18-year high and undercutting T-note prices. In addition, weakness in chip makers is weighing on the broader equity market.

Some positive corporate news today is supportive for stocks. Dollar General is up more than +8% after boosting its full-year comparable sales forecast. Also, Hormel Foods is up more than +3% after reporting stronger-than-expected Q4 EPS. In addition, Meta Platforms is up more than +3% after CEO Zuckerberg said he plans to cut the metaverse group’s budget by up to 30% next year.

US Nov Challenger job cuts rose +23.5% y/y to 71,321, a smaller increase than expectations of +48.0% y/y but still the highest in three years for the month of November.

US weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell by -27,000 to a 3-year low of 191,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 220,000.

President Trump said on Tuesday that he will announce his selection for the new Fed Chair in early 2026. Bloomberg reported last week that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is seen as the likely choice to succeed Powell. The Fed’s independence would come into question, as Hassett supports President Trump’s approach to cutting interest rates at the Fed.

Market attention this week will focus on the US economic news. Later today, Sep factory orders are expected to rise by +0.3% m/m. On Friday, Sep personal spending is expected to increase by +0.3% and Sep personal income is expected to climb +0.3% m/m. Also on Friday, the Sep core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, is expected to climb by +0.2% m/m and +2.8% y/y. Finally, the University of Michigan's Dec consumer sentiment index is expected to climb by +1.0 to 52.0.

The markets are discounting a 91% chance of another -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on December 9-10.

Q3 corporate earnings season is drawing to a close as 475 of the 500 S&P companies have released results. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 83% of reporting S&P 500 companies exceeded forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Q3 earnings rose +14.6%, more than doubling expectations of +7.2% y/y.

Overseas stock markets are mixed today. The Euro Stoxx 50 climbed to a 2.5-week high and is up +0.49%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.06%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 rose to a 3-week high and closed up sharply by +2.33%.

Interest Rates

March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) today are down by -7 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is up by +1.9 bp to 4.083%. T-note prices are under pressure today amid negative carryover from a plunge in Japanese 10-year JGB bond prices to an 18-year low, as prospects for a BOJ rate hike later this month improved. T-notes added to their losses today after US weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell to a 3-year low, a hawkish factor for Fed policy. Rising inflation expectations are also undercutting T-notes after the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a 2-week high today at 2.274%.

European government bond yields are mixed today. The 10-year German bund yield climbed to a 2-month high of 2.775% and is up by +2.2 bp to 2.769%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell to a 1-week low of 4.418% and is down by -1.3 bp to 4.435%.

Eurozone Oct retail sales were unchanged m/m, right on expectations.

ECB Executive Board member Cipollone said, "The Eurozone economy has been resilient, risks around inflation seem balanced, and our central scenario seems more and more credible."

Swaps are discounting a 1% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on December 18.

US Stock Movers

The weakness in chip makers is a negative factor for the overall market. Micron Technology (MU) is down more than -3% to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100. Also, Intel (INTC) and ON Semiconductor (ON) are down more than -2%. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), ASML Holding NV (ASML), NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI), Lam Research (LRCX), and GlobalFoundries (GFS) are down more than -1%.

Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks are under pressure today with Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) down more than -1%. MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are down more than -2%. Also, Coinbase Global (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR) are down more than -1%. In addition, Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY) is down -0.74%

[TITLE]Why Analysts Say ASML Is the Top Semiconductor Pick Heading Into 2026:
[TEXT]
ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the AI Stocks in Focus This Week. On December 1, Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock with a €1,000.00 price target. The firm is optimistic on the stock driven by positive momentum for lithography demand.

Analysts have labeled ASML as its Top Pick in European semiconductors as demand strengthens across memory and logic, and new EUV tool cycles and DRAM transitions signal healthier margins heading into 2026.

DRAM cycle and foundry spending are anticipated to support ASML’s order book and sales through fiscal years 2026 and 2027. A recent Asia trip by the firm has further reinforced its belief regarding a memory supercycle and likely near-term upside for ASML’s orders.

Analysts have also highlighted "unprecedented memory demand" with limited DDR5 inventory visibility and DDR4 tightness. ASML is well-positioned to benefit from continued DRAM demand, including commodity DRAM, strong memory pricing, and DRAM technology transitions to HBM4.

It has also been confirmed that TSMC will add 3nm capacity in Taiwan instead of Japan. This implies increased foundry spending and is likely to translate into more 3600d shipments in fiscal year 2026 and provide near-term EUV sales upside for ASML.

ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) develops and sells advanced semiconductor equipment, including lithography, metrology, and inspection systems for chip manufacturing.

While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Nexperia’s standoff puts a core part of the chip supply chain under strain — U.S export controls and red tape may threaten consumer continuity without governance:
[TEXT]
Nexperia’s position in the semiconductor space has rarely drawn mainstream attention. The Dutch-headquartered firm specializes in the kind of components that disappear into circuit boards by the billions. Yet, its devices sit inside automotive powertrains, industrial controllers, consumer chargers, and virtually every category of electronics.

When the Netherlands moved in October to suspend the authority of Nexperia’s Chinese ownership under its emergency economic-security rules, it set off a sequence of actions in Washington and Beijing, pushed European carmakers into a fresh scramble for parts, and raised wider questions about how long a firm with global roots can operate across competing jurisdictions without becoming a diplomatic flashpoint.

Nexperia was once part of Philips and later NXP, before being acquired privately by China’s Wingtech Technology in 2018. That transaction placed a European industrial supplier within a Chinese electronics conglomerate with links to government-backed investment programmes. Wingtech grew aggressively after the acquisition, and by 2025, Nexperia was producing roughly 110 billion parts per year across its fabs in Hamburg and Manchester and its assembly centres in Asia.

These were not cutting-edge processors, but high-volume power semiconductors, regulators, and discrete logic. They underpin far more sophisticated systems built by others. In sectors such as automotive, a vehicle can contain hundreds of these devices, and the failure of even one category of them cascades into production delays.

That backdrop set the scene for a major reaction when the U.S. added Wingtech to the Entity List in late 2024. The controls did not immediately apply to Nexperia, but Washington made clear that any effort to route restricted technology through its European subsidiary would be treated as a violation. The following summer, the U.S. introduced its “affiliates” rule, extending those restrictions to any majority-owned unit of a listed entity. That swept Nexperia into the same category.

A national intervention with international consequences

(Image credit: Intel)

On 30 September 2025, the Dutch government invoked the Emergency Goods Availability Act to prevent what it called the “possible relocation” of critical assets and to stabilise Nexperia’s operations inside the EU. The statute had been dormant for decades and had never been used for a semiconductor firm. It allowed The Hague to suspend the authority of Nexperia’s then-CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, who also founded Wingtech, and to transfer voting rights on behalf of the parent company to a court-appointed administrator while an investigation into management practices was opened.

Within days, the provisional measures were upheld by the Dutch courts, and the newly installed leadership halted shipments from Nexperia Europe to its Chinese arm, citing uncertainty over export compliance. Chinese state media responded by arguing that Europe was politicizing a commercial dispute. Beijing then introduced export restrictions on certain finished semiconductors produced by Nexperia’s Chinese subsidiaries and, crucially, on contract manufacturers that handled assembly for European-bound parts. The restrictions came with carve-outs only after several weeks of negotiation.

Several major carmakers warned of renewed shortages of basic power components. In 2021 and 2022, the automotive industry had already become a case study in how a lack of cents-worth parts could stall production of systems costing tens of thousands of dollars. This time, the shortages were rooted not in pandemic shutdowns but in the regulatory limbo created by overlapping national controls. Suppliers scrambling for substitute components reported lead times stretching into the following year. European regulators noted that Nexperia’s parts are embedded across hundreds of platforms, and a sudden loss of even a small share of output would propagate across multiple production lines.

A long build-up

The dispute did not materialise out of nowhere. Nexperia’s 2021 acquisition of Newport Wafer Fab in Wales had already drawn scrutiny from UK officials. Although the deal initially cleared without a review — the UK’s national-security screening regime had not yet begun — it was later called in under the National Security and Investment Act.

In late 2022, the UK ordered Nexperia to divest most of its stake under national security legislation. Nexperia appealed, saying it was "shocked" by the order and arguing that Newport was a mature-node facility with no access to sensitive R&D, and that its acquisition secured local jobs. The standoff remains unresolved. While the UK case is separate from the Dutch intervention, the two episodes show how a firm that once operated quietly across Europe has found itself pulled into a widening set of national priorities.

By 2025, that picture had shifted again. Chinese industrial policy had elevated Wingtech as a model of integration across design, manufacturing, and final assembly. European authorities, faced with their own efforts to strengthen chip supply under the EU Chips Act, regarded this consolidation with more caution. At the same time, the U.S. sought to close what it saw as gaps in its export-control regime. When China responded to the Dutch measures by restricting Nexperia’s outbound shipments, the overlap of these positions hardened.

What this means for the supply chain

The core technical challenge revealed by the Nexperia dispute is that the semiconductor supply chain remains deeply interdependent even in areas considered low risk. Power transistors, diodes, and level shifters do not sit at the centre of geopolitical strategy papers. They are manufactured on older processes, with tooling that predates the EUV era by decades. Because they are simple, they have long been viewed as interchangeable. The past four years have demonstrated that this assumption is fragile. Production is concentrated in a small number of companies, and for certain categories, Nexperia is one of only a handful of suppliers with the scale to support global automotive platforms.

Those characteristics complicate efforts to localise supply or insulate operations from political pressure. When the Dutch government intervened in Nexperia’s management, China’s countermeasures did not target rare earths or advanced lithography equipment, but the output of subcontracting facilities handling packaging and test. It was a reminder that the finishing stages of semiconductor production are often outsourced. Even when front-end wafer capacity sits in Europe, back-end work can be vulnerable to administrative decisions thousands of miles away.

The U.S. sanctions add a further layer. Under the affiliates rule, Nexperia could face the same restrictions as its parent on receiving U.S.-origin technology. This rule is currently suspended for a year as part of the U.S.-China trade deal, but there are no guarantees for the future.

A new normal for cross-border chipmakers?

The partial suspension of the Dutch order in November created space for negotiations, but it did not unwind the deeper issues. The court-appointed administrator remains in place while the mismanagement inquiry continues, and the U.S. has shown no sign of relaxing its sanctions.

China carved out exemptions for automotive-grade parts after weeks of pressure and a growing cash-flow risk, yet the episode highlighted how quickly supply can be weaponized in both directions. For companies in adjacent segments — analog components, sensors, power modules — it seems that ownership structures now carry operational risk, even for those that don’t handle cutting-edge or strategically important tech.

This is the environment in which Nexperia will operate for the foreseeable future. The firm has the manufacturing scale and customer base to remain central to global electronics, but its position between European regulators, a Chinese parent, and U.S. export controls has narrowed the room for manoeuvre.

The question is whether a long-term governance structure can emerge that satisfies all three camps while preserving the continuity that its customers depend on. Until that happens, the full implications of the 2025 intervention will continue to reverberate across one of the most fundamental layers of the semiconductor supply chain.

[TITLE]RWA: AT&T/UScellular license deal part of the “death of mobile wireless competition”:
[TEXT]
The Rural Wireless Association (RWA) today criticized the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Wireless Telecommunications Bureau’s approval earlier this week of AT&T’s acquisition of spectrum licenses from Array Digital Infrastructure (known as UScellular at the time of the deal).

The $101.8 billion deal, which was announced in early November 2024, is part of Array Digital Infrastructure’s effort to divest itself of licenses that were not included in the company’s acquisition by T-Mobile. The licenses are in the lower 700 MHz and 3.45 GHz ranges. T-Mobile had agreed to purchase UScellular’s operations and some of its licenses early in May 2024.

The FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau portrayed the deal as posing little risk and agreed that a significant upside potential exists.

“Based on our review of the record and our competitive analysis, we conclude that the risk of public interest harm is low. We find it unlikely that the proposed acquisition of 700 MHz and 3.45 GHz spectrum would allow AT&T to foreclose entry, raise rivals’ costs, or otherwise harm the public interest,” the decision reads.

“In addition, we substantially credit the Applicants’ claims that the instant transaction will produce public interest benefits including the provision of additional products and services to AT&T’s customers, faster customer speeds, and a better overall customer experience.”

[TITLE]Americans are losing jobs at an alarming rate: Tech, telecom, retail hit hardest:
[TEXT]
Layoffs in America

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

Telecom and technology: Automation and restructuring lead the wave

Retail, food, and services: Shifts in demand and economic pressures

Non-profits and media: The impact of funding cuts and economic uncertainty

Drivers of job cuts: Restructuring, AI, and policy decisions

Hiring slows as companies brace for a leaner future

A labour market in transition

As 2025 nears its close, the US labour market is revealing a stark reality: The year has been defined by unprecedented layoffs and a cautious approach to hiring. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, employers announced 71,321 job cuts in November, a 24% increase over the same month last year and the highest November tally since 2022. While this figure is significantly lower than October’s 153,074 cuts, it signals a labour market in recalibration, with both economic conditions and technological disruptions reshaping employment landscapes.Year-to-date, 1,170,821 layoffs have been recorded, marking a 54% rise over 2024 and the highest since 2020, when the pandemic triggered over two million cuts, according to the report. Historically, November has rarely seen layoffs surpass 70,000, with spikes only during major economic crises such as the 2001 recession, the 2009 financial crisis, and the 2020 pandemic. This pattern underscores the gravity of current trends. The data has been presented by Challenger, Gray & Christmas report.The most affected sectors highlight the structural shifts transforming the economy. Telecommunication providers, led by Verizon, announced 15,139 layoffs in November, bringing the sector’s total to 38,035 for the year, a staggering 268% increase over 2024. These cuts reflect a broader recalibration as telecom companies optimize networks for AI integration, 5G expansion, and rising operational costs.The technology sector continues to dominate private-sector layoffs, with 12,377 announced in November and a yearly total of 153,536, up 17% from last year. Firms cite restructuring, AI-driven efficiency gains, and cost management as primary reasons. The irony is pronounced: The very sector driving innovation is simultaneously reducing its workforce at scale, highlighting the disruptive potential of automation.Beyond tech and telecom, traditional sectors are also experiencing pronounced turbulence. Retailers cut 3,290 jobs in November, taking the annual total to 91,954, a 139% jump from 2024. The combination of softening consumer demand, tariff uncertainties, and evolving shopping habits has forced companies to recalibrate workforce levels.Similarly, the food processing sector, particularly meat and beef handlers, recorded 6,708 layoffs in November, totaling 34,165 for the year, a 26% increase from 2024. Rising supply costs and global market fluctuations have left companies with little choice but to streamline operations.The services sector, encompassing cleaning, staffing, and outsourcing firms, also faced pressure, announcing 5,509 layoffs in November and 69,089 for the year. These numbers illustrate that even the support backbone of the economy is vulnerable when corporate demand slows.The non-profit sector has borne the brunt of shrinking government support, rising operational costs, and declining donations. Through November, these organizations announced 28,696 layoffs, up 409% from last year, reflecting the sector’s growing vulnerability to policy shifts and fiscal constraints.Media companies recorded 17,163 cuts in 2025, an 18% increase from last year, though newsrooms specifically reported 2,254 layoffs, down 50% from 2024. This highlights the sector’s uneven recovery, as digital transformation and advertising revenue pressures reshape content creation and distribution.A closer look at the reasons behind layoffs reveals a complex interplay of corporate strategy and macroeconomic pressures. Restructuring led November’s layoffs, accounting for 20,217 cuts, bringing the year-to-date total to 128,255. Companies continue to realign their operations to manage costs and boost efficiency.Artificial Intelligence is now an explicit driver, responsible for 6,280 layoffs in November and 54,694 for the year. Since 2023, AI has triggered 71,683 announced cuts, highlighting its transformative effect on the workforce.Economic conditions, including softening demand, tariffs, and market uncertainty, contributed to 15,755 layoffs in November, totaling 245,086 for the year. Meanwhile, government-led initiatives, tracked under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), remain the leading cause of 2025 layoffs, with 293,753 planned reductions, including 20,976 downstream cuts impacting contractors and non-profits.Amid the surge in layoffs, hiring intentions are declining sharply. Employers announced 497,151 planned hires through November, down 35% from last year and the lowest year-to-date figure since 2010. Seasonal hiring is at its lowest level since 2012, with no new plans reported in November, highlighting a cautious approach as companies prioritize efficiency over expansion.The data paints a portrait of an economy at a structural crossroads. High-profile sectors like technology and telecom are reshaping their workforce around AI and automation. Traditional sectors such as retail, food, and services are recalibrating in response to changing demand and costs. Meanwhile, nonprofits and government-dependent entities face cascading cuts due to funding constraints.The real narrative extends beyond raw numbers: The US is moving toward a labour market where efficiency, automation, and strategic realignment increasingly outweigh workforce expansion. For workers, this presents both a challenge and an urgent call to adapt to a rapidly evolving employment landscape.The question facing the nation is clear: As layoffs and hiring freezes persist, how will the American workforce navigate the twin pressures of technological disruption and economic recalibration in 2026?

[TITLE]AST SpaceMobile surges on 2 major expansion sites:
[TEXT]
AST SpaceMobile surges on 2 major expansion sites

The satellite company’s new Texas and Florida manufacturing facilities send stock soaring amid production plans

AST SpaceMobile delivered news Thursday that sent its stock climbing nearly 15%, proving that big bets on satellite manufacturing can capture Wall Street’s imagination. The space-based cellular connectivity company announced plans to establish two new production facilities that will dramatically scale up manufacturing of its next-generation BlueBird satellites, marking a significant expansion of American-based satellite production capabilities.

The stock traded up 14.96% by midday Thursday, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm that has seen the company’s shares swing from $52.20 to $70.58 over recent weeks. This volatility reflects both the speculative nature of space-based technology investments and growing confidence in AST SpaceMobile’s ability to execute on ambitious plans that could reshape how cellular connectivity reaches underserved areas globally.

1. Texas and Florida become satellite production hubs

AST SpaceMobile’s decision to plant manufacturing flags in both Texas and Florida represents more than simple geographic expansion. The company is betting heavily on US-based production for its BlueBird satellite constellation, devices designed to drastically improve space-based cellular broadband connectivity. These aren’t incremental improvements over existing technology. The new BlueBird satellites promise higher bandwidth capacity and faster data transmission speeds that could make reliable cellular service available in remote locations where traditional tower infrastructure proves economically unfeasible or physically impossible to build.

The mass production approach signals that AST SpaceMobile has moved beyond prototype phases into genuine commercial-scale operations. Establishing dedicated manufacturing sites rather than relying on contracted production demonstrates confidence in sustained demand and suggests the company expects to produce satellites at a pace that justifies the overhead costs of running its own facilities.

2. Investment banks raise their expectations

The expansion announcement comes amid a broader reassessment of AST SpaceMobile‘s value by major financial institutions. Deutsche Bank recently elevated its price target to $81 while maintaining a Buy rating, signaling strong conviction in the company’s growth trajectory. Clear Street went even further, boosting its target to $87 following positive third quarter results. These aren’t minor adjustments. They represent substantial votes of confidence from analysts who spend their careers evaluating space and telecommunications companies.

The timing of these upgrades alongside the manufacturing expansion suggests that institutional investors see concrete progress rather than empty promises. For a company operating in the speculative realm of space-based infrastructure, earning Buy ratings from established banks provides validation that can attract additional capital and partnership opportunities.

Financial reality behind the growth story

AST SpaceMobile’s third quarter 2025 financial results paint a picture of a company experiencing dramatic revenue growth while still navigating the expensive reality of building space infrastructure. Revenue jumped to $14.7 million from just $1.1 million the previous year, though the figure fell short of the $19.9 million analysts expected. The company posted a net loss of $0.45 per share, an improvement from the $1.10 loss per share a year earlier but still firmly in negative territory.

What provides comfort to investors despite continued losses is the company’s substantial financial cushion. With $3.2 billion in cash and liquidity, AST SpaceMobile possesses the resources needed to transform ambitious satellite deployment plans into operational reality. Building and launching satellites requires enormous upfront capital before generating returns, making that cash reserve essential for surviving the long runway to profitability.

European partnership adds international dimension

Beyond American manufacturing expansion, AST SpaceMobile‘s collaboration with telecommunications giant Vodafone adds an important international component to its strategy. The partnership will establish a Satellite Operations Centre in Germany, positioning Europe to assert greater digital independence through space-based connectivity infrastructure. This strategic decision fits within broader European Union goals of launching satellite networks focused on mobile broadband service, particularly for regions underserved by traditional cellular infrastructure.

Choosing Germany for this operations center brings AST SpaceMobile into alignment with European industrial policy while opening access to a market that values technological sovereignty. The Vodafone partnership also provides credibility, as established telecommunications companies typically conduct extensive due diligence before committing to infrastructure partnerships with emerging space technology firms.

What this means for the satellite industry

AST SpaceMobile’s expansion reflects broader momentum in the space-based connectivity sector. As launches become more affordable and satellite technology improves, the economic case for providing cellular service from orbit strengthens. Traditional telecommunications infrastructure requires massive capital expenditure to build tower networks across vast territories, particularly in rural or developing regions where subscriber density doesn’t justify the investment. Satellites bypass this limitation by providing coverage from above, potentially serving customers in locations that would never support ground-based infrastructure.

The company’s commitment to American manufacturing also aligns with national priorities around maintaining domestic space industry capabilities. As satellite constellations become increasingly important for both commercial and national security purposes, producing these systems domestically rather than relying on foreign manufacturing has strategic implications beyond simple business decisions.

Five takeaways from the blockbuster Netflix-Warner Brothers deal

1 day ago Share Save Natalie Sherman , Business reporter , Danielle Kaye , Business reporter and Christal Hayes , Los Angeles senior reporter Share Save

Warner Brothers Discovery Netflix is buying Warner Brothers' streaming services, including HBO, known for shows like Game of Thrones

It sounds like a simple merger deal, but it's got all the ingredients of a Hollywood drama: a rich and powerful suitor, political intrigue, and plenty of cliff-hangers. Netflix's deal to buy Warner Brothers Discovery's storied movie studio and popular HBO streaming networks, is a real-life tale of a conquering giant. But with regulators and rivals still waiting in the wings, it's probably just the start of the saga. As the story unfolds, here are five key things to look out for.

1. Netflix is becoming even more powerful

Netflix has been pulling ahead in Hollywood for years now, ranking as the world's biggest streaming subscription service and largest producer of new content in California. But this deal - the biggest in the industry for years - would confirm its position at the head of the pack, handing the company a catalogue with nearly a century's worth of titles and beefing up its already formidable production capacity. That's not to mention its sheer subscriber might, as Netflix prepares to add some of HBO's 128 million subscribers to its already more than 300 million-strong base. "Netflix is already the biggest streaming service and now you add HBO Max to that and it becomes arguably untouchable," said Mike Proulx, vice president at research firm Forrester.

The deal will unite beloved historic franchises like Looney Tunes, Harry Potter and Friends and HBO hits like Succession, Sex and the City and Game of Thrones under the same roof as Netflix's less conventional output, including Stranger Things and KPop Demon Hunters. The purchase also includes TNT Sports outside the US.

2. It could mean prices go up.... or down

Netflix said it hopes to complete the deal in the next year to 18 months. But executives are coy

[TITLE]What’s up with… Lumen Technologies, Euro AI funds, HPE:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: US long-distance operator Lumen Technologies is losing its CTO Dave Ward but has a new head of tech starting in January; European AI gigafactory hopefuls will need to wait until next year to apply for EC funding; HPE sees total revenues climb but server sales fall in its fiscal fourth quarter; and more!

US long-distance data network operator Lumen Technologies has appointed Jim Fowler as chief technology and product officer starting 5 January 2026: He will be responsible for Lumen’s global technology and product strategy, including the continued evolution of the company’s network, digital platforms and product portfolio. Fowler, who joins from Nationwide Insurance, where he is CTO, has been on the Lumen board since 2023 but will step down from that role with immediate effect. Prior to Nationwide Insurance, Fowler has worked at General Electric, Accenture and AT&T. “Lumen has a unique opportunity to strengthen its position as the trusted network for AI,” stated Fowler. “I’ve seen firsthand as a board member and a customer the work this team has done to design a next-generation roadmap for the network and products. I’m excited to roll up my sleeves, partner with our engineers and product managers to ensure continued innovation and execute Lumen’s roadmap with urgency for our customers and shareholders.” Fowler replaces Dave Ward, who is leaving Lumen to become chief architect at Salesforce: Ward will remain at Lumen in an advisory capacity until 23 January to help Fowler bed into his new role. Lumen’s CEO, Kate Johnson, was full of praise for Ward, who is a veteran of the data networking world. “Dave’s visionary leadership has laid a foundation that will influence Lumen’s trajectory for years ahead, and we thank him for his service.” She added: “Invention is where value is born. Execution is where value is realised. Jim is uniquely suited to lead our technology and product teams as we unlock the value of Dave’s contributions, solidifying our transformation progress and returning Lumen to revenue growth.”

Europe says it’s in a hurry to develop sovereign cloud and AI infrastructure but the region’s lawmakers aren’t helping to speed things up, as the process that enables companies to apply for European Commission (EC) funding for AI gigafactory developments, originally expected before the end of 2025, has now been pushed into next year. The EC and the European Investment Bank Group (EIB Group) have signed a memorandum of understanding to support the development and deployment of AI gigafactories across the European Union: The agreement “establishes a framework to accelerate the financing and development of the AI gigafactories that will anchor Europe’s future AI infrastructure,” noted the EC in this announcement. “Beyond unlocking investment, this partnership aims to translate Europe’s AI vision into concrete, large‑scale facilities that can power innovation, strengthen technological sovereignty, and position the EU as a global leader in artificial intelligence,” it added. “The EIB Group will provide tailored advisory support to consortia that responded to the commission’s informal Call for Expression of Interest,” continued the EC, before noting that “this guidance will help turn ambitious concepts into bankable projects that can be submitted in the formal call for the establishment of AI gigafactories planned for early 2026, paving the way for potential EIB co-financing.” The EC has a €20bn facility to support the development of up to five AI gigafactories as part of its InvestAI initiative. Among the companies expected to submit bids along with partners are Deutsche Telekom – see this report from 1 December – and Telefónica.

HPE reported revenues of $9.7bn, up 14% year on year, for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year that ended 31 October but also recorded a slight operating loss of $8m compared with an operating profit of $247m a year earlier. “HPE finished a transformative year with a strong fourth quarter of profitable growth and disciplined execution,” stated president and CEO Antonio Neri. “During the year, we completed the Juniper Networks acquisition, further scaled our AI and cloud businesses, and accelerated innovation across our portfolio, giving HPE momentum to advance our strategic priorities in fiscal 2026.” Of some concern, though, will be the 5% year-on-year dip in server revenues to $4.5bn at a time when demand for server products is high. Networking revenues, though, grew 150% to $2.8bn thanks to the impact of the Juniper acquisition.

Netflix has struck a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to acquire Warner Bro, including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO, in a deal that values the WBD assets at $82.7bn. The transaction is set to close after the previously announced separation of WBD’s global networks division, Discovery Global, into a new publicly traded company, a move that is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2026. The WBD deal will add TV shows and movies, such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe to the Netflix stable. “Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies – from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends – with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we’ll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.”
