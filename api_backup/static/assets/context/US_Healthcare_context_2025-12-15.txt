[TITLE]U.S. FDA approves AKEEGA® as the first precision therapy for BRCA2-mutated metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with 54% reduction in disease progression vs standard of care*:
[TEXT]
HORSHAM, PA, December 12, 2025/PRNewswire/ – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for AKEEGA® (niraparib and abiraterone acetate dual-action tablet) plus prednisone for the treatment of patients with BRCA2-mutated metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).1 Patients with BRCA mutations often have more aggressive forms of prostate cancer leading to poor prognosis, representing a significant unmet need not addressed by previously available therapies.2

“There remains an urgent need for novel therapies for patients with BRCA2-mutated mCSPC, who face significantly faster disease progression and often shorter survival compared to those without the mutation,” said Bradley McGregor, M.D., Director of Clinical Research for the Lank Center of Genitourinary Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “AMPLITUDE is the first study to show that this precision medicine combination of a PARP inhibitor with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor delays both radiographic and symptomatic disease progression.”

The approval is based on positive results from AMPLITUDE (NCT04497844), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 clinical study. In patients with BRCA2-mutated mCSPC, treatment with AKEEGA® plus prednisone and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 54 percent (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.32–0.66) compared to placebo/abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT, which is the current standard of care.1 AKEEGA® plus prednisone and ADT also significantly prolonged the time to symptomatic progression by 59 percent (HR 0.41; 95 percent CI, 0.29–0.65).1

The observed safety profile of the combination of AKEEGA® plus prednisone was consistent with the known safety profile of each FDA-approved monotherapy. In the AMPLITUDE clinical study, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocytes, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, decreased platelets, increased alkaline phosphatase, constipation, hypertension, nausea, decreased neutrophils, increased creatinine, increased potassium, decreased potassium, decreased aspartate aminotransferase, fluid retention/edema, increased bilirubin, respiratory tract infection and arrhythmia.1

“This expanded indication for AKEEGA reflects our commitment to push the boundaries of science and deliver more personalized, effective treatment options across the prostate cancer continuum,” said Mahadi Baig, M.D., M.H.C.M., Vice President, Head of Solid Tumors, U.S. Medical Affairs, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “Supported by strong clinical data, AKEEGA is now the first and only PARP-based precision medicine combination treatment in BRCA2-mutated mCSPC, offering patients hope for more time with a new way to potentially delay their cancer from progressing.”

Johnson & Johnson is committed to helping patients access our treatments. Once a patient and their doctor have decided that AKEEGA® is right for the patient, J&J withMe provides a simple, comprehensive patient support program offering cost support and educational resources, at no cost to the patient.

[TITLE]Milestone Receives FDA Approval of CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) as First and Only Self-Administered Nasal Spray for Adults with Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):
[TEXT]
First FDA approved treatment in 30+ years for more than 2 million Americans with PSVT

Novel nasal spray designed to rapidly resolve episodes of PSVT and restore sinus rhythm

FDA approval in PSVT enables development of AFib-RVR under sNDA pathway

Milestone well-capitalized to launch and commercialize CARDAMYST with existing capital and royalty financing

Conference call and webcast December 15, 8:00 a.m. ET

MONTREAL and CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milestone® Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first commercial product, CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) nasal spray, a prescription medication for the conversion of acute symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to sinus rhythm in adults. This approval marks the first time that more than two million Americans with PSVT will have a rapid-acting treatment option they can self-administer outside the emergency department or other healthcare setting. CARDAMYST is expected to be available in retail pharmacies in the first quarter of 2026.

CARDAMYST nasal spray is a novel and rapid-acting calcium channel blocker delivered when needed to treat often highly symptomatic and unpredictable episodes of PSVT. With CARDAMYST, adults with PSVT can be prepared wherever and whenever episodes occur, providing them with active management and a greater sense of control of their condition.

“CARDAMYST is a novel at-the-ready treatment option that addresses the unpredictable impact of PSVT by offering patients the freedom to manage episodes anytime and anywhere,” said Joseph Oliveto, President and Chief Executive Officer of Milestone Pharmaceuticals. “The FDA approval of CARDAMYST is a watershed moment for Milestone and a gratifying event for our team members, patients, clinical investigators, and health care providers who participated in the development program, all of whom I sincerely thank for their dedication, counsel, and collaboration toward this important achievement.”

“Some people with PSVT have endured years of anxiety, fearing their next episode and the stress and disruption of emergency department visits,” said James Ip, M.D., FACC, FHRS, an etripamil investigator. “CARDAMYST will give many of them the ability to administer a medication themselves that can quickly stop their PSVT episode and potentially avoid a hospital trip or a call to emergency services.”

CARDAMYST Clinical Data

The FDA approval of CARDAMYST is supported by a robust clinical trial program based on safety data from more than 1,800 participants and more than 2,000 episodes of PSVT. This includes the successful Phase 3 RAPID trial, a global, randomized, double-blind comparison of CARDAMYST vs. placebo, published in The Lancet in 2023. In clinical studies, participants using CARDAMYST were two times more likely to convert symptomatic PSVT to sinus rhythm and did so more than three times faster compared with placebo. The RAPID trial achieved its primary endpoint with 64% of those who self-administered CARDAMYST (N=99) converting from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) to sinus rhythm within 30 minutes compared to 31% on placebo (N=85) (HR = 2.62; p<0.001). At one hour, the benefit was demonstrated in 73% of participants. In addition, significant reductions in time to conversion in those who took CARDAMYST were evident early and durable, with a median time to conversion of 17 minutes (95% CI: 13.4, 26.5) for those treated with CARDAMYST vs. 54 minutes (95% CI: 38.7, 87.3) for those treated with placebo.

A consistent safety profile and treatment effects were observed across all subgroups, including participants concurrently on beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. The most frequent adverse events occurring in ≥5% of participants in randomized clinical trials were mild-to-moderate and transient in nature, including local-site nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, and epistaxis. Less than 2% of trial participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events.

MONTREAL and CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milestone® Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first commercial product, CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) nasal spray, a prescription medication for the conversion of acute symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to sinus rhythm in adults. This approval marks the first time that more than two million Americans with PSVT will have a rapid-acting treatment option they can self-administer outside the emergency department or other healthcare setting.

CARDAMYST Clinical Data

The FDA approval of CARDAMYST is supported by a robust clinical trial program based on safety data from more than 1,800 participants and more than 2,000 episodes of PSVT. This includes the successful Phase 3 RAPID trial, a global, randomized, double-blind comparison of CARDAMYST vs. placebo, published in The Lancet in 2023. In clinical studies, participants using CARDAMYST were two times more likely to convert symptomatic PSVT to sinus rhythm and did so more than three times faster compared with placebo.

At one hour, the benefit was demonstrated in 73% of participants. In addition, significant reductions in time to conversion in those who took CARDAMYST were evident early and durable, with a median time to conversion of 17 minutes (95% CI: 13.4, 26.5) for those treated with CARDAMYST vs. 54 minutes (95% CI: 38.7, 87.3) for those treated with placebo.

A consistent safety profile and treatment effects were observed across all subgroups, including participants concurrently on beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. The most frequent adverse events occurring in ≥5% of participants in randomized clinical trials were mild-to-moderate and transient in nature, including local-site nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, and epistaxis. Less than 2% of trial participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events.

[TITLE]What is the new toxin for wrinkles?:
[TEXT]
What is the New Toxin for Wrinkles?

The latest advancement in wrinkle reduction features DaxibotulinumtoxinA (Daxxify), a novel neuromodulator that offers longer-lasting results compared to traditional treatments, significantly reducing the frequency of injections needed.

Introduction: The Evolution of Wrinkle Reduction

For decades, botulinum toxin injections, often known by brand names like Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin, have been the gold standard for temporarily reducing the appearance of wrinkles. These treatments work by blocking the signals between nerves and muscles, causing the muscles to relax and softening wrinkles. However, these effects are temporary, typically lasting three to four months. The quest for longer-lasting solutions has led to the development of new formulations, most notably DaxibotulinumtoxinA (marketed as Daxxify). What is the new toxin for wrinkles? It’s a step towards sustained wrinkle reduction with fewer injections.

Understanding DaxibotulinumtoxinA (Daxxify)

DaxibotulinumtoxinA represents a significant advancement in neuromodulator technology. Unlike other botulinum toxin products, Daxxify uses a peptide instead of a human or animal-derived protein as its stabilizer. This difference contributes to its prolonged duration of effect.

How Daxxify Works: The Science Behind the Results

Like other botulinum toxin products, Daxxify works by blocking the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that signals muscles to contract. By inhibiting acetylcholine release, Daxxify causes the targeted muscles to relax, softening the appearance of wrinkles. The key difference lies in the peptide excipient that Daxxify uses, which is believed to contribute to its extended efficacy.

Benefits of Daxxify Compared to Traditional Botulinum Toxins

Longer-lasting results: Studies have shown that Daxxify can provide results lasting up to six months or even longer for some patients. This is a significant improvement compared to the typical three to four months seen with traditional botulinum toxin injections.

Studies have shown that Daxxify can provide results lasting up to six months or even longer for some patients. This is a significant improvement compared to the typical three to four months seen with traditional botulinum toxin injections. Reduced treatment frequency: Because Daxxify lasts longer, patients require fewer injections per year to maintain their results, potentially saving time and money.

Because Daxxify lasts longer, patients require fewer injections per year to maintain their results, potentially saving time and money. Comparable safety profile: Clinical trials have demonstrated that Daxxify has a safety profile similar to that of other botulinum toxin products.

The Daxxify Injection Process: What to Expect

The Daxxify injection process is similar to that of other botulinum toxin treatments.

Consultation: The process begins with a consultation with a qualified healthcare provider to discuss your goals and determine if Daxxify is right for you. Treatment Planning: The provider will assess your facial muscles and wrinkles to determine the appropriate injection sites and dosage. Injection: Daxxify is injected into the targeted muscles using a fine needle. The procedure is typically quick and relatively painless. Post-Treatment Care: After the injection, you may experience mild redness or swelling at the injection sites, which usually resolves within a few hours. You should avoid rubbing or massaging the treated areas for 24 hours.

Who is a Good Candidate for Daxxify?

Ideal candidates for Daxxify are individuals who:

Are looking to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, such as frown lines, forehead lines, and crow’s feet.

Are generally healthy and do not have any neuromuscular disorders.

Have realistic expectations

[TITLE]Cycle Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Applied Therapeutics:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLT; “Applied”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to creating transformative treatments for rare diseases, today announced a definitive agreement for Cycle Group Holdings Limited (“Cycle”) to acquire Applied Therapeutics.

Applied Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the development of novel drug candidates against validated molecular targets in rare diseases. Applied’s lead drug candidate, govorestat, is a novel central nervous system (CNS) penetrant Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) for the treatment of CNS rare metabolic diseases, including Classic Galactosemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency (CMT-SORD) and phosphomannomutase 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG).

“We are confident that Cycle has the resources and capabilities to move govorestat forward towards the ultimate goal of bringing a life-changing treatment to the patients suffering from Classic Galactosemia, CMT-SORD and PMM2-CDG, who have always been at the center of everything we do at Applied,” said Les Funtleyder, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Applied. “I want to thank the entire Applied team for their perseverance and commitment. We are also grateful to the investigators and patients who have contributed to the development of govorestat.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cycle will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock for a per share price of $0.088 per share in cash payable at closing plus one non-transferrable contingent value right (CVR) that entitles the holder to receive potential additional payments.

The CVR provides payments based on the following:

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for any galactosemia indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for the CMT-SORD indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.20 per CVR in cash payable upon the first achievement of worldwide net sales of any product covered by the CVR by Cycle, its affiliates or licensees equal to or exceeding $200 million dollars in any four-quarter fiscal period prior to the tenth anniversary of closing.

Each CVR holder will also be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any cash of Applied in excess of $500,000 at closing (capped at $1.5 million) (“Closing Cash Payment”).

Each such CVR and Closing Cash Payment will be paid only once, if at all.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions contained in the merger agreement that will be filed with the SEC, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock. The merger agreement does not include a financing condition. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions. If the tender offer closes, then Cycle would acquire untendered shares of Applied through a second-step merger for the same consideration.

Applied also issued a Promissory Note (the “Promissory Note”) to Cycle. The Promissory Note is unsecured and enables Applied to receive loans aggregating up to $8.5 million from Cycle, to fund Applied’s working capital needs under an approved budget. Cycle’s funding obligations cease, and amounts borrowed immediately becomes repayable, if the transaction is terminated for certain reasons. Absent funds provided by Cycle under the Promissory Note or from another source, Applied would be unable to continue to fund its activities for more than a limited number of days and Applied would anticipate proceeding to wind down operations.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Applied Board of Directors following an extensive evaluation of strategic alternatives. This evaluation process included numerous discussions with potential counterparties. The Applied Board of Directors determined that entering into the merger agreement with Cycle represented the path that best advanced the interests of Applied and its stockholders.

For Cycle, Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as legal counsel. For Applied, Aquilo Partners, L.P. provided a fairness opinion, and Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel.

The price target hike follows the company’s agreement to acquire Bluejay Therapeutics for $620 million in cash. With the acquisition, the company gains worldwide rights to brelovitug, a monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis D, a rare and aggressive liver condition.

“This acquisition fits squarely with what we do best—advancing high-impact medicines for patients with rare diseases through disciplined development, regulatory innovation, and commercial excellence,” Mirum CEO Chris Peetz said in the release.

The acquisition of Brelovitug comes on the heels of 100% HDV RNA response in Phase 2 clinical trials, with Phase 3 results expected in the second half of next year.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley have also reiterated an Overweight rating on Mirum Pharmaceuticals with an $81 price target. The investment bank views the deal as a smart strategic move for Mirum, saying it bolsters the company’s position in rare liver diseases while offering clear synergies with its current commercial setup. The firm also projects that the enlarged pipeline could generate more than $4 billion in peak sales.

Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIRM) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering treatments for rare and debilitating liver diseases, especially those affecting children, by transforming scientific discoveries into therapies such as their key drug LIVMARLI (maralixibat) for cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC).

While we acknowledge the potential of MIRM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]U.S. FDA approves AKEEGA® as the first precision therapy for BRCA2-mutated metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with 54% reduction in disease progression vs standard of care*:
[TEXT]
HORSHAM, PA, December 12, 2025/PRNewswire/ – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for AKEEGA® (niraparib and abiraterone acetate dual-action tablet) plus prednisone for the treatment of patients with BRCA2-mutated metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).1 Patients with BRCA mutations often have more aggressive forms of prostate cancer leading to poor prognosis, representing a significant unmet need not addressed by previously available therapies.2

“There remains an urgent need for novel therapies for patients with BRCA2-mutated mCSPC, who face significantly faster disease progression and often shorter survival compared to those without the mutation,” said Bradley McGregor, M.D., Director of Clinical Research for the Lank Center of Genitourinary Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “AMPLITUDE is the first study to show that this precision medicine combination of a PARP inhibitor with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor delays both radiographic and symptomatic disease progression.”

The approval is based on positive results from AMPLITUDE (NCT04497844), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 clinical study. In patients with BRCA2-mutated mCSPC, treatment with AKEEGA® plus prednisone and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 54 percent (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.32–0.66) compared to placebo/abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT, which is the current standard of care.1 AKEEGA® plus prednisone and ADT also significantly prolonged the time to symptomatic progression by 59 percent (HR 0.41; 95 percent CI, 0.29–0.65).1

The observed safety profile of the combination of AKEEGA® plus prednisone was consistent with the known safety profile of each FDA-approved monotherapy. In the AMPLITUDE clinical study, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocytes, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, decreased platelets, increased alkaline phosphatase, constipation, hypertension, nausea, decreased neutrophils, increased creatinine, increased potassium, decreased potassium, decreased aspartate aminotransferase, fluid retention/edema, increased bilirubin, respiratory tract infection and arrhythmia.1

“This expanded indication for AKEEGA reflects our commitment to push the boundaries of science and deliver more personalized, effective treatment options across the prostate cancer continuum,” said Mahadi Baig, M.D., M.H.C.M., Vice President, Head of Solid Tumors, U.S. Medical Affairs, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “Supported by strong clinical data, AKEEGA is now the first and only PARP-based precision medicine combination treatment in BRCA2-mutated mCSPC, offering patients hope for more time with a new way to potentially delay their cancer from progressing.”

Johnson & Johnson is committed to helping patients access our treatments. Once a patient and their doctor have decided that AKEEGA® is right for the patient, J&J withMe provides a simple, comprehensive patient support program offering cost support and educational resources, at no cost to the patient.

*The hazard ratio [HR] 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.32–0.66) compared to standard of care, AKEEGA® plus prednisone and ADT also significantly prolonged the time to symptomatic progression by 59 percent (HR 0.41; 95 percent CI, 0.29–0.65).1

[TITLE]Milestone Receives FDA Approval of CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) as First and Only Self-Administered Nasal Spray for Adults with Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):

Milestone well-capitalized to launch and commercialize CARDAMYST with existing capital and royalty financing

Conference call and webcast December 15, 8:00 a.m. ET

MONTREAL and CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milestone® Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first commercial product, CARDAMYST™ (etripamil) nasal spray, a prescription medication for the conversion of acute symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to sinus rhythm in adults. This approval marks the first time that more than two million Americans with PSVT will have a rapid-acting treatment option they can self-administer outside the emergency department or other healthcare setting. CARDAMYST is expected to be available in retail pharmacies in the first quarter of 2026.

CARDAMYST nasal spray is a novel and rapid-acting calcium channel blocker delivered when needed to treat often highly symptomatic and unpredictable episodes of PSVT. With CARDAMYST, adults with PSVT can be prepared wherever and whenever episodes occur, providing them with active management and a greater sense of control of their condition.

“CARDAMYST is a novel at-the-ready treatment option that addresses the unpredictable impact of PSVT by offering patients the freedom to manage episodes anytime and anywhere,” said Joseph Oliveto, President and Chief Executive Officer of Milestone Pharmaceuticals. “The FDA approval of CARDAMYST is a watershed moment for Milestone and a gratifying event for our team members, patients, clinical investigators, and health care providers who participated in the development program, all of whom I sincerely thank for their dedication, counsel, and collaboration toward this important achievement.”

“Some people with PSVT have endured years of anxiety, fearing their next episode and the stress and disruption of emergency department visits,” said James Ip, M.D., FACC, FHRS, an etripamil investigator. “CARDAMYST will give many of them the ability to administer a medication themselves that can quickly stop their PSVT episode and potentially avoid a hospital trip or a call to emergency services.”

CARDAMYST Clinical Data

The FDA approval of CARDAMYST is supported by a robust clinical trial program based on safety data from more than 1,800 participants and more than 2,000 episodes of PSVT. This includes the successful Phase 3 RAPID trial, a global, randomized, double-blind comparison of CARDAMYST vs. placebo, published in The Lancet in 2023. In clinical studies, participants using CARDAMYST were two times more likely to convert symptomatic PSVT to sinus rhythm and did so more than three times faster compared with placebo. The RAPID trial achieved its primary endpoint with 64% of those who self-administered CARDAMYST (N=99) converting from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) to sinus rhythm within 30 minutes compared to 31% on placebo (N=85) (HR = 2.62; p<0.001). At one hour, the benefit was demonstrated in 73% of participants. In addition, significant reductions in time to conversion in those who took CARDAMYST were evident early and durable, with a median time to conversion of 17 minutes (95% CI: 13.4, 26.5) for those treated with CARDAMYST vs. 54 minutes (95% CI: 38.7, 87.3) for those treated with placebo.

A consistent safety profile and treatment effects were observed across all subgroups, including participants concurrently on beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. The most frequent adverse events occurring in ≥5% of participants in randomized clinical trials were mild-to-moderate and transient in nature, including local-site nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, and epistaxis. Less than 2% of trial participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events.
