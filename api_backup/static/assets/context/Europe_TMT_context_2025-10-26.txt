[TITLE]When AI writes code, humans clean up the mess:
[TEXT]
AI coding tools are reshaping how software is written, tested, and secured. They promise speed, but that speed comes with a price. A new report from Aikido Security shows that most organizations now use AI to write production code, and many have seen new vulnerabilities appear because of it.

The study surveyed 450 professionals across the US and Europe, including developers, application security engineers, and security leaders. The results show that AI is moving fast inside software teams, but the security guardrails have not caught up.

AI code is now part of the stack

This investment comes at a time when the company is expanding its quick commerce arm, Amazon Now.

In a conversation with ET in August, Amazon India country manager Samir Kumar said the company will not hold back on investing in quick commerce, a segment which requires high burn to gain market share.

Its patented tech, used by DLF, the Tata Group, and others, captures particulate matter at the source—a feat that won it the ET Startup Award 2025 in the ‘Social Enterprise’ category Chakr’s next act is riskier, but potentially more rewarding. It is developing aluminium air batteries as a cleaner, cheaper alternative to lithium-ion, hoping to tap into India’s aluminium reserves and reduce reliance on China. The company is in the early stages of commercialisation.Building hardware in India remains difficult. “We are great at building software, but our ability to build prototypes, commercialise and manufacture hardware is very limited,” Srivastava said. Beyond capital, Chakr is constrained by a patchy manufacturing ecosystem and limited prototyping infrastructure.A survey of 2,500 CIOs by global tech research firm Gartner shows that half of them expect changes in cloud vendors due to regional factors .

[TITLE]Finovate Global Mexico: Plata Doubles Valuation; Revolut, SumUp Announce Expansion; and More!:
[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global examines recent fintech news from Mexico.

Earlier this month, ResearchAndMarkets.com published its Mexico Embedded Finance Databook Report for 2025. The 230-page report noted that the embedded finance market in Mexico is expected to reach more than $18 billion this year and top $22 billion by the end of 2030. Among the key takeaways from the report is the increasing traction of embedded credit products such as Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), and the growth of embedded payments in mobility, food delivery, and social commerce driven by growing smartphone use and government support for digital, real-time payments options. Embedded finance solutions such as lending are enabling non-fintech businesses in Mexico to leverage APIs and BaaS to expand their offerings, the report notes. This is helping bring more financial services to underserved communities in the country. It is also creating greater competition for companies in both the lending and payments spaces.

Mexican Fintech Plata Double Valuation on Latest $250 Million Fundraise

Mexican digital financial platform Plata has secured $250 million in new equity funding. The round, which includes both a primary equity raise and a secondary equity transaction, was led by Kora and featured participation from Moore Strategic Ventures, Audio Ventures, Spice Expeditions, Hedosophia, as well as several US and European family offices. The funding builds on an earlier investment by Televisa-Univision and boosts Plata’s valuation to $3.1 billion.

“The growth we have achieved in such a short time demonstrates a clear strategy and a shared conviction: build a strong institution from its foundations,” Plata CEO and Co-Founder Neri Tollardo said. “This transaction reflects investors’ confidence, the strength of our technological model, and the talent we have assembled. We set out to create a digital bank built on innovation, operational excellence, compliance, and efficiency—and today, we are seeing the results of that effort.”

Plata received its banking license in December 2024 and is waiting for authorization to begin banking operations. The company boasts its own technological and operational infrastructure, including a core banking system that enables a fully digital, branchless model with automated risk management and 24/7 personalized customer service. Over the past 30 months, Plata has topped the two million mark in terms of active credit customers, making it one of the fastest-growing digital financial platforms in Latin America. The company’s Plata Card gives users two months to pay without interest and up to 15% of cash back in real money.

“We believe Plata represents the new standard for digital banking in emerging markets,” Kora Co-Founder Nitin Saigal said. “In a very short time, the company has demonstrated impressive execution, combining technological innovation with a clear vision for financial inclusion. We are excited to continue strengthening our partnership and to support Plata in this new phase of growth.”

Revolut obtains Mexican banking license; SumUp goes live

This week we learned that two Finovate alums—Revolut and SumUp—are actively exploring opportunities in Mexico. Revolut announced this week that it has received final regulatory approval to initiate banking operations in Mexico. The authorization came from the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), with approval of the Bank of Mexico. Now a Multiple Banking Institution in Mexico, Revolut is the first independent digital bank to directly apply for and complete the full licensing and approval process in the country.

“We are exceptionally proud of our team and the bank we have built here in Mexico,” Revolut Bank S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple CEO Juan Miguel Guerra said. “We are very grateful to the authorities for this vote of confidence and their commitment to fostering competition in the industry, and we are confident that our offering will benefit millions of people across the country.”

Revolut is a digital banking and financial services platform that offers a wide range of solutions, including multi-currency accounts with real-time exchange rates; stock, cryptocurrency, commodity, and ETF investing and trading; as well as business accounts, corporate cards, and expense management tools. Founded in 2015, Revolut serves as a financial services “super app” for more than 65 million customers around the world.

Meanwhile, payments platform SumUp announced its official launch in Mexico this week. The company has introduced its SumUp Go card reader to the Mexican market, enabling merchants to accept payments anytime, anywhere, with no monthly fixed costs. The card reader is compatible with all major credit and debit cards and features both exceptional battery life and unlimited 4G cellular connectivity due to its built-in SIM.

“Expanding into Mexico marks a pivotal step in SumUp’s strategic growth across Latin America,” SumUp North America CEO Andrew Helms said. “We see remarkable potential in the region and recognize a strong demand for accessible, user-friendly payment solutions that streamline business operations. At SumUp, our mission is to simplify business for our merchants and we’re delighted to bring this commitment to Mexico.”

Founded in 2012, SumUp counts more than four million merchants in 37 markets as users of its payment processing solutions and business management tools. These include mobile card readers and point-of-sale (POS) systems, as well as solutions for sales tracking and inventory management, customer loyalty programs, and financial reporting and analytics.

Revolut has been a Finovate alum since its debut at FinovateEurope 2015. SumUp won Best of Show in its Finovate debut at FinovateEurope 2013. Both companies are headquartered in London.

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

Scope: This TWTW begins with a discussion of an effort by the UN to establish a global carbon tax. TWTW presents some responses from GROK AI to questions like why do many physicists object to quantum mechanics? TWTW discusses some weaknesses in a new paper from members of the CERES project and it discusses a report on crossing tipping points. TWTW concludes with a discussion of a paper on the world record surface temperature and a UK master food plan.

*********************

Global Carbon Tax: For years, some commentators have speculated why the UN was so emphatic in creating fear of carbon dioxide, which is essential for life on Earth. In the 1850s Earth was coming out of the Little Ice Age when famine was a widespread problem in temperate regions when crops did not ripen. A bit of warming was a blessing that permitted crops to ripen. The UN ignored this history.

In their efforts to create fear, the UN relied on computer models with questionable assumptions. When tested against atmospheric temperatures the models clearly fail, significantly overestimating the warming of the atmosphere, where the greenhouse effect occurs. The UN ignored this fact and many others in making questionable claims

[TITLE]Eos Energy Executes Next Phase of Growth Strategy with U.S. Manufacturing Expansion and New Software Hub Under Project AMAZE:
[TEXT]
$24 million state-led economic development package underscores the shared commitment between Eos and Pennsylvania to advance U.S. manufacturing and job creation

Expansion reinforces the Company’s progress and transformation as Pennsylvania becomes a national hub for energy, technology, and manufacturing innovation

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) ("Eos" or the “Company”), an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced the next phase of its growth strategy with the expansion of its U.S. manufacturing footprint and the establishment of a new software hub strengthening American energy storage capacity, energy independence, and industrial job growth.

In partnership with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Allegheny County, the Company was awarded a joint $24 million economic development package to support U.S. manufacturing and the continued growth of 1,000 high quality American jobs. The incentive package will help the Company scale operations to meet growing market demand driven, in part, by AI infrastructure, while advancing energy innovation in Pennsylvania.

“Energy storage is the backbone of a modern energy system, and this significant milestone marks our progress to bring America’s battery to scale,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “Through Project AMAZE, we’re proving that you can make things in America again by building world-class capacity, pairing advanced manufacturing with innovative software, and doing it here in Pennsylvania to ensure a more energy-efficient and secure future. We thank Governor Shapiro, Allegheny County, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, and the Pittsburgh Technology Council for their unwavering support and shared vision for advancing Americas quest to lead in energy.”

Eos will expand its manufacturing capacity with a new state-of-the-art 432,000 sq. ft. facility in Marshall Township, PA, that will house additional production lines that complement the Company’s existing Turtle Creek manufacturing facility with plans to reach 8 GWh of annualized energy storage capacity. The new facility enables Eos to transition from single piece flow operations to high-efficiency, large-scale production, marking the culmination of years of process development designed to bring U.S. made energy storage to market at scale.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology. I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Eos will also establish a new software hub at Nova Place, Pittsburgh’s premiere technology and innovation center, that supports the Company’s growing workforce and proprietary battery management system, software, controls and analytics platform, DawnOSTM. Eos joins a thriving community of other advanced manufacturing, data/telecommunications, AI, electric utilities, and robotics leaders in Pittsburgh’s innovation headquarters.

As part of its expanding software and engineering focus, the Company plans to deepen its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, a leading institution in robotics, AI, computer science, and engineering to further develop a state-of-the-art workforce to work in Eos’ software hub.

“Carnegie Mellon University is thrilled to celebrate this milestone with Eos, and we are looking forward to the many opportunities it unlocks – for Pittsburghers, our students, and America’s bright future in manufacturing,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. “On behalf of the CMU community, I extend my sincere congratulations to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo and their teams for leading the way in strengthening Western Pennsylvania’s roles as an innovation engine for the nation and as a driver of the talent that will power it.”

“Pennsylvania has an extensive history of being at the forefront of innovation. We’re proving that in Pittsburgh you can not only build products in America but also offer world class education and intellectual capabilities to grow emerging industries,” said Pranesh Rao, Eos Senior Vice President of Storage System Engineering. “Building our software hub in Pittsburgh—surrounded by talented workers and a fast-growing innovation ecosystem—is both a strategic move and a catalyst to propel Eos to the next level.”

U.S. and China trade cyberattack allegations as tensions escalate

China has been named as the culprit behind a significant cyber-attack on U.S. national security networks, with the potential to disrupt critical infrastructure such as power grids, water supplies and fuel refineries. The attack is part of a broader strategy to exploit internal chaos and unrest in the United States and there are even rumors of a potential military invasion by Chinese troops.

China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) has accused the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of orchestrating a years-long cyberattack against China's National Time Service Center. The MSS claims the NSA infiltrated the center's systems, stole sensitive data and attempted cyber sabotage, raising concerns

[TITLE]Revolut Backer Shifts Focus to Existing Deals:
[TEXT]
One of Europe’s top venture capital (VC) firms is reportedly closing to external investors.

Lakestar, which has backed tech giants like Revolut and Spotify, is now focusing on its existing deals, the Financial Times reported Thursday (Oct. 23).

The VC firm, led by veteran investor Klaus Hommels, plans to focus on its current investments such as defense technology groups Helsing and Auterion, while still backing a new generation of European start-ups.

“Going forward both Lakestar’s and my focus will be on maximizing the potential of the existing portfolio and we will not raise any new generalist venture funds as we have in the past,” Hommels wrote in a letter sent to limited partners — the institutional groups that have funded the company thus far — and seen by the FT.

The report notes that Lakestar is joining other VC groups including Vy Capital — a key investor in Elon Musk’s companies — in pulling back from raising external capital after big windfalls. This strategy is aimed at letting the company focus solely on maximizing gains with more flexibility to spend its own capital, without the constraints and time commitment of raising outside funds.

Hommels wrote that his firm will also “seed promising ventures initiated by talented members of the Lakestar team as they embark on their own entrepreneurial journeys.”

In addition to Revolut and Spotify, Lakestar has also invested in procurement platform Vertice, which raised $50 million in a Series C funding round earlier this year.

[TITLE]FO° Talks: Who Controls the Internet? Decoding Privacy, AI and Global Regulation:
[TEXT]
Fair Observer’s Communications and Outreach officer, Roberta Campani, speaks with Nuno Guimarães, a professor of Computer Sciences at ISCTE-University Institute of Lisbon. They discuss the complex relationship between technology, privacy, artificial intelligence and global regulation. Guimarães examines how technological progress transforms social structures and individual behavior. Campani notes how digital tools have become both pervasive and intrusive, opening a broader reflection on privacy, power and human agency in the digital era.

Digital privacy

Guimarães traces the evolution of technology from the early days of personal computing — when systems like MS-DOS offered limited, local control — to today’s connected world. He explains that the same connectivity that empowers users also allows corporations to commodify their attention and data. Concentrated control over platforms, he argues, is not a conspiracy but the natural consequence of network effects. Artificial intelligence intensifies these dynamics, and privacy remains possible only at significant cost. For most users, convenience and dependence on digital systems outweigh privacy concerns, which raises questions

[TITLE]Digital Colonialism and the Theft of Rights:
[TEXT]
Germany’s Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer is doubling down in his war with U.S. tech giants. Undeterred by allegations that his own Weimer Media Group may have committed mass-scale copyright violations, the minister is pushing ahead with a punitive “digital tax.”

These days, psychology could be taught just by observing German politics. Weimer offers a textbook case of cognitive dissonance. On one hand, he runs The European, a magazine whose business model allegedly relied on publishing unauthorized texts for years. On the other, the same man is now fanning the flames of a transatlantic trade dispute -- without even a hint of awareness
