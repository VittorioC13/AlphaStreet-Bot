Does enCore Energy Corp. (EU) Make a Good Investment Amid a Renewed Interest in Nuclear?

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of uranium resource properties in the United States.

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) extracted 203,798 pounds of uranium in the second quarter of 2025, up by a significant 79% from Q1. These numbers are expected to pump after the company announced the acquisition of a 5,900 acre parcel of private land located immediately adjacent to its Alta Mesa uranium project in Texas.

enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) also received a significant boost recently after it was reported that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has dismissed a review petition against permits for its Dewey Burdock uranium project. enCore said the project remains on a federal fast-track permitting program.

Following a resurgence of the American nuclear energy sector under the Trump administration and the recent increase in the price of uranium, the stock of enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU) has surged by more than 180% over the last six months.

[TITLE]Greenland’s leader urges EU to invest in its mineral resources and renewable energy:
[TEXT]
BRUSSELS (AP) — Greenland’s leader on Wednesday thanked the European Union for being “a trusted friend” and urged the 27-nation bloc to invest in his country’s mineral resources, renewable energy, airports and internet services.

In a speech to the European Parliament, Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that “2025 has been an eventful if not dramatic year for Greenland.” He noted the challenge posed by climate change but did not mention President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing the Arctic island.

“We need cooperation and partnerships with like-minded countries and institutions who share our values. The EU has been a stable, reliable and important partner for Greenland for more than 40 years,” the 34-year-old premier said in Strasbourg, France.

He extended “a heartfelt thank you” to the EU “for your strong support for Greenland during challenging times we are going through right now. You have stood by us as a friend and partner. We will never forget this.”

Greenland was a colony under Denmark’s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later, Greenland became a self-governing entity. It remains part of the Danish realm.

Denmark, which also currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, and Greenland have rejected Trump’s offers to buy the island. He hasn’t ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich territory.

When asked by a reporter before his speech about relations with the Trump administration, Nielsen said that U.S.-Greenland ties should be managed “in mutual respect, with respect for international law.”

“We seek to have more and better cooperation also with the U.S.A., when we can fulfill the respectful tone,” he said.

During the speech, Nielsen said that Greenland has most of the critical raw minerals that the EU is seeking, but that mining these resources is “capital intensive.” He also urged the bloc to invest in the untapped hydroelectricity potential provided by the island’s rivers and glaciers.

Nielsen also called for financial support to develop telecommunications networks, particularly in the poorly connected north, and to build two regional airports.

“It is essential for us that those who operate telecommunications in Greenland are trusted and reliable actors. This is vital to ensure the stability of the infrastructure, and to prevent unauthorized parties from disrupting and compromising connections,” he said.

Lawmakers gave Nielsen a standing ovation as he said “thank you for being a trusted friend of Greenland.”

[TITLE]How grand plans to restart oil drilling off Santa Barbara's coast hit California's green wall:
[TEXT]
Sable Offshore Corp.'s Harmony oil platform off the coast of Refugio State Beach. (Michael Owen Baker / For The Times)

When a Texas oil company first announced controversial plans to reactivate three drilling rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara County, investor presentations boasted that the venture had "massive resource potential" and was "primed for cash flow generation."

But now, less than two years later, mounting legal setbacks and regulatory issues are casting increasing doubt on the project's future.

Most recently, the California attorney general filed suit against Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp., accusing it of repeatedly putting "profits over environmental protections." The lawsuit, filed last week in Santa Barbara County Superor Court, accuses Sable of continually failing to follow state laws and regulations intended to protect water resources.

Sable, the lawsuit claims, “was at best misinformed, incompetent and incorrect" when it came to understanding and adhering to the California Water Code. "At worst, Sable was simply bamboozling the Regional Water Board to meet a critical deadline," according to the lawsuit.

The action comes less than a month after the Santa Barbara County district attorney's office filed criminal charges against the company, accusing it of knowingly violating state environmental laws while working on repairs to oil pipelines that have sat idle since a major spill in 2015.

The company also faces legal challenges from the California Coastal Commission, environmental groups and even its own investors.

These developments now threaten the company's ability to push forward on what has become an increasingly expensive and complicated project, according to some experts.

Clark Williams-Derry, an analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said there are still ways Sable could get off the ground and begin oil sales, but the repeated setbacks have become what he called "cumulative risk" for investors, who are key to funding the restart.

"Sable is at risk of burning through its cash, and lenders are going to have to make a decision

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

Scope: This TWTW begins with comments on what is meant when a greenhouse gas is said to be saturated. TWTW discusses a new edition of Climate at a Glance and discusess marine heat waves. TWTW presents an essay by Steven Koonin on political conformity in the reports by National Academies on climate and concludes with a report on the biases demonstrated by internet search engines.

*********************

What Is Meant by Saturation?: For most purposes, the concept of saturation means that no more can be absorbed. For example, when a sponge of a given size cannot absorb any more water, it is said to be saturated with water. If the size of the sponge is doubled, it can absorb twice the amount of water. The limiting factor is the size, quantity, of the sponge. But the same concept does not apply to saturation when dealing with greenhouse gases absorbing and emitting infrared radiation (IR) from Earth.

For example, TWTW has frequently stated that the capability of carbon dioxide (CO2) to absorb infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth is saturated. But here the meaning is different. It is that all the infrared radiation (IR) that carbon dioxide can readily absorb is already being absorbed. Additional carbon dioxide can absorb only a little more infrared energy from Earth. The limiting factor is not the quantity of carbon dioxide, but the quantity of infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth. Adding more carbon dioxide (CO2) has little effect on Earth’s surface temperatures, but what has significant effect on Earth’s surface temperatures is the solar radiation hitting Earth’s surface, either by increasing solar intensity or decreasing Earth’s albedo (decreasing cloudiness or other reflectivity).

The greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide (and water vapor) delays rapid cooling of the Earth at night by reducing the emission of infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth to space. The extent of infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth is calculated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law which states that the infrared radiation is proportion to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Here we see a stunning inconsistency that must be included when making calculations of the greenhouse effect. A large increase in the greenhouse effect (a reduction of infrared radiation from Earth to space) from carbon dioxide is necessary to cause a small increase in Earth’s temperatures because the increase in radiation from Earth is a function of the absolute temperature raised to the fourth power. In today’s atmosphere a slight increase in carbon dioxide (and water vapor) has little effect in increasing Earth’s temperatures because the infrared radiation (IR) in the frequencies (or wave lengths) in which these gases readily absorb infrared radiation (IR) is already being absorbed.

Professor William van Wijngaarden and Professor Emeritus William Happer produced a paper that describes what they mean by saturation. Unfortunately, the paper is a bit mathematical. But the results of their calculations can be described verbally and displayed graphically.

Their graphics and calculation are below, assuming the surface temperature of Earth is 60ºF (16ºC), it would be 16ºF (-9 ºC) without greenhouse gases. Max Planck refined the Stefan-Boltzmann law to develop the top (smooth) curve showing the radiation emitted by Earth’s surface. Karl Schwarzschild developed the method for calculating the lower (jagged) curve showing the Earth’s actual radiation to space, now calculated from satellite measurements. The difference between the two curves is Earth’s greenhouse effect due to atmospheric gases. The calculations of the greenhouse effect assume no clouds because there is no adequate theory of the formation and dissipation of clouds.

The understanding of saturation is so important to understanding the real greenhouse effect that TWTW is presenting it the way that van Wijngaarden and Happer did, rather than trying to give a short, condensed summary.

START QUOTE:

Figure 1: Radiation flux to space, ˜ Z(ν,C), from the top of the atmosphere as a function of spatial frequency ν (waves per cm) of the thermal radiation. The calculated values are for a summertime, temperate latitude, and a surface temperature of 288.7 K. We have noted the spatial frequencies where the atmospheric opacity is dominated by the five major greenhouse gases, water vapor, H2O, carbon dioxide, CO2, ozone O3, methane, CH4, and nitrous oxide, N2O. The black curve is the solution to the Schwarzschild equation for radiative transfer for C = 400 parts per million (ppm) of CO2, close to the present concentration. The red curve is for double that amount, C = 800 ppm, but for the same profiles of atmospheric temperature and other greenhouse gases concentrations. The green curve is for no CO2 at all. The smooth blue curve is the Planck flux for the same temperature, that is, the radiation that would reach space if there were no greenhouse gases at all and the surface had maximum thermal emissivity, ϵ = 1.

We can define the total radiative forcing, F(C), due to a concentration C of CO2 as

From (2)–(5) we see that three explicit values of the forcing are:

A simple empirical formula for the forcing, F = F(C), that fits detailed calculation of the forcing well for 1 ppm < C < 10,000 ppm is

Figure 2: The blue curve is the radiative flux to space, Z(C), given by (12), versus the concentration C of carbon dioxide. The flux decreases rapidly with C for the first 100 ppm of CO2, but the rate of decrease slows down for higher concentrations. The vertical red lines show the flux decreases caused by 50 ppm increases of C for the sequence of values, [C0,C1,C2,C3, . . .] = [0, 50, 100, 150, . . .] ppm. Each additional 50 ppm increase has less effect than the previous one. For example, we see from the figure that the height of the first red bar, characterized by i = 2, is approximately 300 W m−2. So, increasing the CO2 concentration from C1 = 50 ppm to C2 = 100 ppm decreases the flux to space by 300 W m−2/100 = 3 W m−2, in agreement with (5), since CO2 concentrations have doubled.

Using (8) to set F = 30 W m−2, C = 400 ppm and (5) to ΔF = 3 W m−2, we solve (10) for Co to find

We use (6) and (10) to approximate the flux to outer space as

In Fig. 2 we have plotted (12) as the blue line, and we have plotted increments Z(C−ΔC)− Z(C) = F(C) − Z(C − ΔC) for equal increments ΔC = 50 ppm of CO2 concentration as the vertical red lines. The literature is replete with plots similar to the red vertical lines, but the blue line, the flux to space with no suppressed zero, is little known, and may clarify how small the forcing change is when the CO2 concentration increases from 400 ppm to 800 ppm. [Boldface added]

Note that we are plotting fluxes and flux changes in Fig. 2, not temperature changes. This has the advantage that our results are almost the same as the most carefully calculated results of the climate-alarm establishment [1]. So, it would be awkward for the establishment to deny that “instantaneous,” very large changes of CO2 concentration cause very small changes of flux to space.

But people are interested in temperature changes, not flux changes. This is where all the mischief from positive feedback arises. Without huge positive feedbacks, ΔF = 3 W m−2 of clear-sky forcing only gives

[TITLE]Morning Bid: Markets claw back amid looping narratives:
[TEXT]

-What matters in U.S. and global markets today

By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Finance and Markets

The stories driving markets appear to be moving in loops faster than investors can make significant adjustments, with Friday's dramatic China trade threats seemingly reversed by Sunday and the French Prime Minister who resigned last Monday now reappointed and forming another cabinet.

Wall Street plummeted almost 3% and gold surged again on Friday after President Donald Trump lambasted China's latest rare earth export curbs and vowed to slap 100% tariffs on Beijing, sending the S&P 500 to its worst weekly loss since May. However, futures regained about half of that daily percentage loss before Monday's bell after Trump on Sunday appeared to row back on the move saying, "Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it."

Trade Representative Jamison Greer said tensions rose after Washington reached out to China for a phone call following last week's announcement of expanded rare earths export curbs, only for Beijing to defer. What's not clear is what the latest spat means for rolling over the existing bilateral trade deal on November 10 or whether an expected Trump-Xi summit will now take place.

Meantime, China said export growth bounced back more than forecast in September while it rekindled lost U.S. trade elsewhere. Exports to the U.S. fell by 27% year-on-year but shipments bound for the European Union, Southeast Asia and Africa grew by 14%, 16% and 56% respectively.

The full fallout from the weekend's whiplash will be difficult to parse with the U.S. government still in shutdown, the Columbus Day holiday closing the Treasury market and stock markets bracing for the onset of the U.S. corporate earnings season from tomorrow. Two and 10-year Treasury yields plunged to their lowest in almost a month on Friday's jolt and the dollar recoiled - but the latter has regained some ground on Monday.

With the IMF/World Bank meetings taking place in Washington this week and a closely watched appearance from Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell due on Tuesday, there was continued warnings about overextended market valuations and the risks of a sharp correction. "Valuations could now be at odds with the uncertain economic and geopolitical outlook, leaving markets susceptible to a disorderly adjustment," Financial Stability Board Chair Andrew Bailey told G20 ministers in a letter.

* After Friday's tech-led slump, Asia opened lower butstabilized as Wall Street futures rebounded and hopes flickeredfor a tariff truce extension, even as Beijing defended rareearth export curbs. The dollar firmed against the yen and francafter Friday's safety rush, while bullion set another recordabove $4,070 as investors hedged policy and geopolitical risk.The near-term risk skew for AI, EV and defense supply chainsremains sensitive to any tit-for-tat escalation. * Political anxiety in Europe eased somewhat as French PrimeMinister Sébastien Lecornu was reappointed by President EmmanuelMacron and is now about to appoint a new cabinet, keeping RolandLescure at finance and underscoring policy continuity despite adivided parliament and a tricky 2026 budget path. Europeanequity benchmarks steadied after Friday's selloff, with futuresand cash markets edging higher to start the week. * Earnings season kicks off Tuesday with JPMorgan, GoldmanSachs, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, and the market wants proofthat roughly 8.8% y/y S&P 500 EPS growth can support stretchedmultiples. JPM and Wells are slated to release results around7:00 AM ET (calls at 8:30 AM and 10:00 AM), Goldman at 7:30 AM(call 9:30 AM), and Citi at 8:00 AM (call 11:00 AM).

[TITLE]Sentiment steadies after Trump cools rhetoric on China trade, gold at record highs:
[TEXT]
By Dhara Ranasinghe and Wayne Cole

LONDON (Reuters) -World markets found steadier ground on Monday after being whipsawed by broadsides in the U.S.-China trade war, while gold hit new record highs in a sign that uncertainty remained high.

While U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened 100% tariffs on China from November 1 and Beijing threatened countermeasures, he sounded more conciliatory on Sunday, posting that everything would be fine and the U.S. did not want to "hurt" China.

European shares opened higher, while U.S. stock futures also firmed although trading was subdued by a holiday in Japan and the United States.

In Europe, focus was on France with reappointed prime minister Sebastien Lecornu facing pressure to get a budget deal across the line.

And in a sign that global uncertainties remained strong, gold hit fresh record highs above $4,000 an ounce, while Asia stocks fell sharply.

"The stabilisation in markets is encouraging," said Rory McPherson, chief investment officer at Wren Sterling in London.

"Given everything that is going on with the (U.S. government) shutdown, and political turmoil in France and Japan, markets have been strong. A pullback would be healthy."

Beijing defended on Sunday its curbs on exports of rare earth elements and equipment as a response to U.S. aggression, but stopped short of imposing new levies on U.S. products.

Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said that while he still expected an extension of the current tariff pause, recent developments suggested a wider range of outcomes was now possible.

JAPANESE LEADERSHIP NOW IN DOUBT

Many world leaders, including Trump, are due to meet in Egypt on Monday to discuss ceasefire plans for Gaza.

Japanese markets had their own problems with the ascension of new LDP leader Sanae Takaichi to prime minister now in doubt, contributing to a sharp rebound in the yen and a 5% dive in Nikkei futures on Friday.

Japan's Nikkei was closed on Monday, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbled 1.5%.

Chinese blue chips fell 0.5%, though the rare earth and semiconductor sectors both firmed. Data pointed to some resilience in trade with exports rising 8.3%, almost twice the forecast, and imports up strongly.

U.S. stock futures pointed to a rebound when Wall Street reopens on Tuesday, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock futures up more than 1% each.

Earnings season kicks off this week with major banks reporting, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

S&P 500 companies overall are expected to have increased earnings by 8.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to LSEG IBES, and strong results will be needed to justify the market's high valuations.

[TITLE]New Australian fossil fuel site could have major impact on people and the planet:
[TEXT]

A new fossil fuel site approved for development off Western Australia's coast is estimated to contribute 876 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions over the course of its lifetime, according to new research led by The Australian National University (ANU) in collaboration with the ARC Center of Excellence for the Weather of the 21st century.

The level of emissions from the Scarborough project—with liquefied natural gas production from the site expected to start in 2026 and continue for at least the next 31 years—will cause, on average, 0.00039 degrees Celsius of additional global warming.

The findings, appearing in npj Climate Action, reinforce how each new investment in coal and gas extraction causes long-term environmental and social harm. The research provides a framework for scientists to quantify the consequences of additional greenhouse gas emissions from each new individual fossil fuel project.

The researchers argue that although this level of additional warming may seem small on paper, it would have major consequences for Australia and the world.

According to the research findings, an increase of 0.00039 degrees Celsius in additional global warming would:

Expose an additional 560,000 people around the world to unprecedented heat.

Leave an additional 356,000 people globally outside the human climate niche (this is defined as the climate conditions in which human societies have historically thrived and is defined by the distribution of the human population with respect to mean annual temperature).

Cause an additional 484 heat-related deaths in Europe and 118 additional lives lost in Europe by the end of this century under a middle-of-the-road emissions pathway.

Cause additional thermal exposure in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) that would result in an additional 16 million coral colonies lost in every future GBR bleaching event, which would occur with more frequency due to global warming as a consequence of emissions from the Scarborough project.

"The majority of Australia's new fossil fuel projects describe their anticipated greenhouse gas outputs as 'negligible' in the context of global emissions and claim they're unable to measure contributions to global warming, while also ignoring expected impacts," study co-author Professor Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, from ANU, said.

"The site's developers claim it is not possible to link greenhouse gas emissions from Scarborough with climate change or any particular climate-related impact given that the estimated emissions associated with Scarborough are negligible in the context of existing and future predicted global greenhouse gas concentrations.

"But our research shows emissions output from this new project is far from negligible."

The researchers calculated that by 2049, the anticipated Australian emissions from the Scarborough project alone will comprise almost half (49%) of Australia's entire annual CO 2 emissions budget.

Co-author Dr. Nicola Maher, also from ANU, said that beyond 2050 all emissions from the Scarborough project would require durable CO 2 removal from the atmosphere if Australia is to meet its emissions reduction targets.

"That would require a huge increase in the effectiveness and scale of carbon capture and storage technology. For example, in 2023, human activities to move carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into storage amounted to only 0.04 million tons of carbon dioxide globally, which is equivalent to just 0.6% of the planned annual Australian emissions from the Scarborough project," Dr. Maher said.

[TITLE]Power sector opening up for new players: DG AIDA:
[TEXT]
Opening of the power distribution sector to more than one player in an area, if accepted, may take India’s electricity sector to a more competitive region. “You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up for private,” said former Power Secretary Alok Kumar, who is currently the Director General of All India Discoms Association (AIDA). In the draft amendment proposal to the Electricity Act, recently put out by the government for stakeholders’ comments, there is a move to have multiple players operating in the same area, and the player can be from private sector, too. Kumar shares the challenges that exist and the way forward. Edited excerpts:

The government has released draft amendments to the Electricity Act that propose opening up electricity distribution to private companies and refined regulatory mechanism. How different is it from the existing regulations and norms?

You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up the segment for new players. In privatisation, it is at the discretion of the present owner — the State government — whenever they want to rope in private sector into the business. What the draft Bill is attempting, in my understanding, is that it is allowing more than one player to operate in an area, and it can be a private player or a government company. The law itself provides for what we normally call a parallel licence, or second or subsequent licence.

In Section 14 of the Act, it provides that any person who fulfils the conditions laid down by the government can apply to the Regulatory Commission for a second or a new licence in the same area in which there is already a licence. Earlier, the new entrant was mandated to build their own distribution network. But now it will not be mandated under the proposed draft. The entrant can use the network of the existing licensee. As regards the proposed electricity authority, in simple terms, it will work to build consensus on reforms on the lines of the GST Council.

Recently, the apex court ordered clear-cut guidelines on the creation and amortisation of regulatory assets. It has mandated the clearance of accumulated regulatory assets (past dues) within four years, with new assets to be liquidated within three years. What is your take on this?

Rules and Tariff Policy already provide for this. The Court has ordered time-bound compliance. If this is followed, it will make tariffs cost reflective. The tariff policy made an exception in some cases — in case there is a natural calamity or something else, it is not possible to immediately raise the tariffs. You can create a regulatory asset, but it has to be very expeditiously liquidated. However, there are State regulators who have not liquidated these regulatory assets for very long. We must acknowledge that non-compliance increases interest cost on consumers, and the subsequent political regime will never like to raise tariff to clear past regulatory assets.

The Supreme Court has only affirmed the situation, and has directed the regulatory commissions to follow the law. It is a very good development. I know some have gone to the Supreme Court, asking for some time. Meanwhile, Rajasthan has already taken a step forward to liquidate regulatory assets.

Is capacity-swapping a doable solution for bettering continued availability? How does it work for discom health?

Traditionally, in our Power Purchase Agreements, three aspects were bundled — you buy capacity, you also buy your right on energy, and you also buy ancillary services required. But now, the penetration of renewable energy is creating mismatch in demand and supply. So, in that context, you must have sufficient capacity to meet the demand in any scenario — more than expected demand or less than expected generation. So, that available capacity can be swapped as per the need of the players. Energy can be purchased from such capacity through markets. There is a urgent requirement to have a separate capacity market framework, and the utilities must be bound to enter into contracts for adequate capacity. This will minimise stranded fixed costs.

Is the grid ready to take the energy mix. What is your take on it?

We have robust grid and reached a stage where General Network means once you are connected, you can sell your electricity anywhere in India. However, now the energy mix is changing because of the increased penetration of variable generation sources. So, we need more flexible resources like battery storage or pump storage capacity to take care of variations in demand and supply. In addition, we need digitisation to make the grid work because we need a lot of data in near real time or for operations and for future forecasts.

Is there a mechanism to work on a comfortable tariff that is suitable to all stakeholders?

The word comfortable is not appropriate. What we should aim at is a tariff based on efficient costs. Efficient cost of generation, efficient cost of transmission, efficient cost of distribution. So, if these activities are taken efficiently, whatever is the cost, that has to be reflected into the tariff. There is no other way to sustain this power sector. For example, if you keep on adding generation plants, it is not efficient cost. Some of the very peak demand can be met through demand response at a much lesser cost using digital technologies and efficient market.

So, tariffs should be based on efficiency in generation, transmission and distribution, and in markets. Whatever is the efficient cost, it should be passed through tariff. More importantly, the tariff is an outcome of a process of allocation of cost to different consumers. There is a pool of cost which you have incurred. Allocation happens in two stages. First, the determination of the demand charges and energy charges. And then you give some cross subsidies to the different consumer categories. So, my take is the allocation of cost should be very fair and transparent.

To make tariff comfortable, the State government already have a discretion by giving subsidy the needy consumers.

[TITLE]Power sector opening up for new players: DG AIDA:
[TEXT]
Opening of the power distribution sector to more than one player in an area, if accepted, may take India’s electricity sector to a more competitive region. “You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up for private,” said former Power Secretary Alok Kumar, who is currently the Director General of All India Discoms Association (AIDA). In the draft amendment proposal to the Electricity Act, recently put out by the government for stakeholders’ comments, there is a move to have multiple players operating in the same area, and the player can be from private sector, too. Kumar shares the challenges that exist and the way forward. Edited excerpts:

The government has released draft amendments to the Electricity Act that propose opening up electricity distribution to private companies and refined regulatory mechanism. How different is it from the existing regulations and norms?

You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up the segment for new players. In privatisation, it is at the discretion of the present owner — the State government — whenever they want to rope in private sector into the business. What the draft Bill is attempting, in my understanding, is that it is allowing more than one player to operate in an area, and it can be a private player or a government company. The law itself provides for what we normally call a parallel licence, or second or subsequent licence.

In Section 14 of the Act, it provides that any person who fulfils the conditions laid down by the government can apply to the Regulatory Commission for a second or a new licence in the same area in which there is already a licence. Earlier, the new entrant was mandated to build their own distribution network. But now it will not be mandated under the proposed draft. The entrant can use the network of the existing licensee. As regards the proposed electricity authority, in simple terms, it will work to build consensus on reforms on the lines of the GST Council.

Recently, the apex court ordered clear-cut guidelines on the creation and amortisation of regulatory assets. It has mandated the clearance of accumulated regulatory assets (past dues) within four years, with new assets to be liquidated within three years. What is your take on this?

Rules and Tariff Policy already provide for this. The Court has ordered time-bound compliance. If this is followed, it will make tariffs cost reflective. The tariff policy made an exception in some cases — in case there is a natural calamity or something else, it is not possible to immediately raise the tariffs. You can create a regulatory asset, but it has to be very expeditiously liquidated. However, there are State regulators who have not liquidated these regulatory assets for very long. We must acknowledge that non-compliance increases interest cost on consumers, and the subsequent political regime will never like to raise tariff to clear past regulatory assets.

The Supreme Court has only affirmed the situation, and has directed the regulatory commissions to follow the law. It is a very good development. I know some have gone to the Supreme Court, asking for some time. Meanwhile, Rajasthan has already taken a step forward to liquidate regulatory assets.

Is capacity-swapping a doable solution for bettering continued availability? How does it work for discom health?

Traditionally, in our Power Purchase Agreements, three aspects were bundled — you buy capacity, you also buy your right on energy, and you also buy ancillary services required. But now, the penetration of renewable energy is creating mismatch in demand and supply. So, in that context, you must have sufficient capacity to meet the demand in any scenario — more than expected demand or less than expected generation. So, that available capacity can be swapped as per the need of the players. Energy can be purchased from such capacity through markets. There is a urgent requirement to have a separate capacity market framework, and the utilities must be bound to enter into contracts for adequate capacity. This will minimise stranded fixed costs.

Is the grid ready to take the energy mix. What is your take on it?

We have robust grid and reached a stage where General Network means once you are connected, you can sell your electricity anywhere in India. However, now the energy mix is changing because of the increased penetration of variable generation sources. So, we need more flexible resources like battery storage or pump storage capacity to take care of variations in demand and supply. In addition, we need digitisation to make the grid work because we need a lot of data in near real time or for operations and for future forecasts.

Is there a mechanism to work on a comfortable tariff that is suitable to all stakeholders?

The word comfortable is not appropriate. What we should aim at is a tariff based on efficient costs. Efficient cost of generation, efficient cost of transmission, efficient cost of distribution. So, if these activities are taken efficiently, whatever is the cost, that has to be reflected into the tariff. There is no other way to sustain this power sector. For example, if you keep on adding generation plants, it is not efficient cost. Some of the very peak demand can be met through demand response at a much lesser cost using digital technologies and efficient market.

So, tariffs should be based on efficiency in generation, transmission and distribution, and in markets. Whatever is the efficient cost, it should be passed through tariff. More importantly, the tariff is an outcome of a process of allocation of cost to different consumers. There is a pool of cost which you have incurred. Allocation happens in two stages. First, the determination of the demand charges and energy charges. And then you give some cross subsidies to the different consumer categories. So, my take is the allocation of cost should be very fair and transparent.

To make tariff comfortable, the State government already have a discretion by giving subsidy the needy consumers.

Gurugram-based renewable energy player ACME Group is diversifying into sponge iron manufacturing using green hydrogen by setting up a 1.2 million tonne per year plant, said chairman Manoj Kumar Upadhyay. He declined to provide investment details for the project.People in the know said setting up a plant of this scale for producing direct reduced iron (DRI), also known as sponge iron, typically requires an investment of $500-600 million (₹4,442-5,331 crore). ACME is currently into clean power generation and green hydrogen, among other areas.DRI is produced by removing oxygen from iron ore. This can be done using either hydrogen or carbon, and the DRI can subsequently be used in electric arc furnaces to make steel, effectively making it green steel.This has major potential for decarbonising the steel industry, which contributes over 7% to annual global greenhouse gas emissions.The plant will also produce hot briquetted iron (HBI), a premium form of direct reduced iron.ACME will be using the green hydrogen it is already producing, while pellets will be sourced either locally or from Brazil, Upadhyay told ET in an interview.“We are leveraging the green hydrogen we produce. We have a (green hydrogen) plant coming up in Odisha, and we have a project in Oman. So, this plant will be co-located wherever we are producing green hydrogen,” he said.ACME Group has already tied up with Vietnam’s Stavian Industrial Metal, which will procure 800,000 tonnes of DRI and hot briquetted iron from the company as part of a 10-year contract, said Upadhyay.For the remaining 400,000 tonnes of DRI and HBI, the group is in talks with customers in Europe and is hopeful that this output will also be tied up over the next 3-4 months.The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism regulation in Europe — which will come into effect from 2026 — will heavily tax imports of products with high carbon emissions into the region. This will effectively encourage products such as steel, cement, and fertilisers to move to having lower carbon emissions.“In India, companies that are more focused on exports of steel will need the HBI from us,” said Upadhyay.Producing 1.2 million tonnes of HBI and DRI will need about 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen, which is currently at around $3.5 per kilogram.“We are starting off at a smaller scale in the first phase, but we aim to reach around 10 million tonnes (of DRI) in the next five-seven years,” Upadhyay said. “But we first need to demonstrate technology, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness before getting into the second phase.”

[TITLE]Call for clarity on Ireland's data centre policy:
[TEXT]
Tens of billions of euro of investment is being diverted to other countries due to uncertainty around Ireland's data centre policy, according to Digital Infrastructure Ireland.

There has been an effective moratorium on new data centre connections since late 2021, while the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities is currently reviewing its policy on large energy users.

DII has called for a firm timeline from the CRU on the publication of that policy - and says a fresh wave of investment is now at stake.

"You cannot get a connection off the grid now from either ESB Networks, Eirgrid or Gas Networks Ireland," said Maurice Mortell, chairman of Digital Infrastructure Ireland. "We're still waiting for the CRU policy decision on large energy users to come out - we're four years now in a defacto moratorium on any new investments."

As part of the National Development Plan, the Government committed €3.5 billion to upgrading and securing the energy network - key to addressing the current bottleneck in the system.

Mr Mortell welcomed this, but said this did not resolve the uncertainty that persists.

"I think it's welcome... I think the reality is, though, that's going to take time to deliver," he said. "If you look at the level of investment that we've lost over the past 12 months - billions of dollars of AI has gone into the UK, the Nordics, central Europe, the Mediteranian.

"They're 10 year investments - we won't see that again for a while."

[TITLE]Data centres costing €5.6bn have planning approval but no electricity, industry warns:
[TEXT]
New data centres costing €5.6 billion have planning approval but no electricity to power them, an industry chief has said as the sector urges Ministers to tackle restrictions that have left big investments “marooned”.

Data-centre access to electricity and gas has been limited for years because of the risk of blackouts set off by the sector’s surging demand for power.

Although the Coalition promised in the programme for government in January to accelerate energy generation, several big projects remain stalled due to a lack of power and policy uncertainty.

[ Data centres could consume 'as much electricity as two million Irish homes' by 2030Opens in new window ]

“It is a serious stain on Ireland’s foreign direct investment record as a welcoming, pro-business destination that data centres have been built and rightly expected connections, but have been marooned,” said Maurice Mortell, chairman of Digital Infrastructure Ireland (DII), a group representing large data-centre providers.

“This needs to be rectified by Government as a matter of urgency. Some €5.6 billion of data centres have planning but no power, with a further €7.8 billion in a pipeline for Ireland.”

Despite the State being a significant beneficiary of the internet economy in the first quarter of the century, data-centre curbs have led to anxiety that it has missed out on the first wave of notable investment in artificial-intelligence (AI) technology.

Ireland has seen a sharp increase in the amount of data centres in operation in recent years, but are they necessary for economic growth? Video: Enda O'Dowd

Data centres are buildings that house highly energy-intensive computer systems for storing internet, business and AI data. Restrictions were imposed in 2021 and 2022 after the sector’s electricity demand added the equivalent of 140,000 households to the national grid over four successive years.

Constraints on the electricity network have implications beyond data centres, retarding accommodation delivery and other business investment.

[TITLE]Renewable surge stalled: India adds 26.8 GW power but grid expansion lags:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India’s race to expand clean energy is running into a transmission bottleneck. Even as new power generation capacity has nearly tripled to 26.8 GW so far this fiscal year, expansion of the transmission backbone is faltering. Just 1,998 circuit kilometers (ckm) of new lines were added till August, 30% less than a year ago, against a full-year target of 15,382 ckm, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).

The gap between generation and transmission is already stranding projects. A JMK Research study estimates that nearly 50 GW of renewable capacity nationwide cannot be evacuated because of inadequate infrastructure, inflating per-unit transmission costs, weakening project viability and deterring private investment.

Developers such as ACME Solar and AMPIN Energy have petitioned the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) seeking compensation for financial losses from delayed transmission connections.

Of the 26.8 GW installed this year, renewable energy accounts for 20.1 GW, followed by coal or other thermal projects of 3.6 GW, hydro capacity of 2.4 GW and nuclear power of 700 MW. While the ramp-up in clean power is critical for India’s target of 500 GW non-fossil capacity by 2030, the absence of robust evacuation infrastructure risks slowing its impact.

Unlike coal, solar and wind are intermittent and require stronger networks to assure stability of the grid and the power system.

Ironically, parts of the existing transmission system remain underused even as new projects wait for grid access. Analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicates that up to 71% of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) corridors operate below 30% utilisation, underscoring a mismatch between where lines exist and where power flows are required.

Last year, only 8,830 ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253 ckm, a 42% shortfall, with ISTS additions at their lowest in a decade.

From April to August this year, state utilities built 1,263 ckm of lines and central government-backed companies added 708 ckm, both falling short of their targets of 1,444 ckm and 717 ckm, respectively. The private sector, with a smaller share, met its target of 27 ckm during the period.

Private sector interest rises amid delays Despite the shortfall, private interest is rising: in the first half of 2025, more than 30 power sector firms, mostly transmission companies and infrastructure investment trusts, were incorporated amid slackening growth in capacity addition.

The Centre has been making efforts to accelerate transmission line expansion in the country as the deadline of 500 GW non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030 draws closer. According to the CEA’s National Electricity Plan, India will need an additional 191,000 ckm of transmission lines by FY32, requiring a cumulative investment of
