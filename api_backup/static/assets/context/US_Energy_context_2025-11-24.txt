[TITLE]EIB backs Edison’s energy transition with major financing:
[TEXT]
BAKU, Azerbaijan, November 22. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is providing up to €800 million to support Edison’s investment plan aimed at promoting Italy’s energy transition, Trend reports via the EIB.

The funding will be structured through several loan agreements, with the first €200 million agreement signed today at Palazzo Edison during a meeting between EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti and Edison CEO Nicola Monti.

The financing will support Edison’s development in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and public lighting. Thanks to the significant contribution of the projects to REPowerEU objectives, the EIB will cover up to 75% of project costs, exceeding the standard 50% threshold under its Energy Lending Policy.

The investments align with Edison’s strategy as a responsible operator and Italy’s national energy and climate plan. In 2023, Edison formalised its commitment to ensure 75% of its investments comply with the EU taxonomy by 2030. In 2024, over half of Edison’s EBITDA came from renewables, flexibility instruments, customer solutions, and services.

The favorable financial terms of the EIB loans, supported by the Bank’s AAA credit rating, will underpin Edison’s sustainable growth and energy transition ambitions.

[TITLE]This Little-Known Nuclear Energy Stock Is ‘the Most Important Company in America’:
[TEXT]
Nuclear energy’s resurgence and defense investments are trending across global headlines. That broader push has elevated Amentum Holdings (AMTM), a relatively under-the-radar nuclear energy stock. The company now oversees nearly 90% of America’s nuclear infrastructure for the Department of Energy.

That footprint is why Andrew Left of Citron Research recently called it “the Most Important Company in America” and flagged its unique national security role. Following this bullish note, its shares rose by 17%.

Left notes that AMTM's efforts align with President Donald Trump's emphasis on energy independence and military modernization. These priorities also include aggressive funding for nuclear innovation . Trump himself called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, “It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.” They continue to shape America’s strategic approach today.

Will this little-known stock translate policy tailwinds and government demand into lasting value for shareholders? Let’s find out what Amentum is really about.

Strong Performance Propels AMTM Into the Spotlight

Amentum Holdings delivers advanced nuclear management and engineering services for the U.S. government, overseeing $5.3 billion in market cap. The stock is trading at $24.99 as of early afternoon on Nov. 21, with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 18% and a 52-week performance of only 0.36%.

Its forward price-to-earnings is 10.97x against the sector median of 19.86x, and its price-to-sales sits at 0.47x compared to a sector median of 1.68x. That reflects a significant discount for a firm leading nearly 90% of America’s nuclear infrastructure stewardship.

Amentum’s latest quarterly earnings , published Aug. 5, highlight a business running at scale. This quarter, Amentum reported $3.6 billion in revenues, a 2% increase on a pro forma basis, which illustrates stability. This net income of $10 million signals positive margins in a sector known for enormous capital intensity. The adjusted EBITDA reached $274 million.

This underscores the firm’s strong operational leverage and ability to convert revenue into core earnings. The most recent result for diluted earnings per share stands at $0.04, with adjusted diluted earnings per share at $0.56. This difference points to notable add-backs common in the industry’s reporting.

This operating cash flow totaled $106 million for the quarter. That gives the company the liquidity necessary to invest and compete for high-value government programs. The free cash flow of $100 million confirms disciplined capital management and prudent expenditure. This extensive backlog sits at $44.6 billion, which anchors revenue visibility far into the future.

It highlights persistent demand for the company’s mission-critical services. The year-to-date book-to-bill ratio matches 1.0x, balancing new contract wins with revenue recognition, which indicates sustainable execution. This period also saw net debt trimmed to $3.8 billion. That brought net leverage to 3.5x, a clear sign of Amentum’s improving balance sheet.

Major Federal Wins Cement AMTM’s Role

Amentum stands out for turning headline contracts into strategic momentum. This year, the company secured the Space Force Range Contract , a United States Space Force agreement worth up to $4 billion over ten years. The win is not just

[TITLE]Oil Prices Sink 2.6% After Zelenskyy Agrees to Work on Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices dropped again on Friday morning, bogged down by fresh news that Ukraine's Zelenskyy agreed to work with Washington on a peace plan, a development that could ultimately add fresh barrels into an already fragile market.

At the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate for December delivery had slipped by 2.51% to $57.52 per barrel...

WTI price

Brent crude, for its part, had fallen 2.19% to $61.99...

A continued pullback would mark the third consecutive daily decline for WTI, putting the U.S. benchmark on track for a weekly loss of over 4%, a reflection of broader concerns over global supply growth and a weakening demand outlook

News of Zelenskyy considering the peace proposal comes on the same day that new U.S. sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil officially take effect, targeting key subsidiaries in an effort to restrict Kremlin revenue from fossil-fuel sales. While those sanctions should tighten supply, that has largely been baked into markets at this point.

Russian Urals crude, already discounted due to sanctions, has been trading as much as $23 per barrel below other global grades, evidence that sanctions are having an effect.

In the U.S., crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell by 3.4 million barrels last week on the back of strong refinery activity. But the bullish inventory surprise failed to lift prices as traders remained focused on the geopolitical picture.

Energy markets also faced macro-driven pressure, with Asian stocks declining sharply after Thursday’s U.S. employment data clouded expectations for imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts, boosting the dollar and intensifying risk-off sentiment.

A stronger greenback, the currency hit a broad rally against major and commodity-linked currencies, further weighed on dollar-priced crude.

OPEC+ remains a fundamental force in the overall bearishness of oil markets, with the group committed to boosting production in December before halting output increases in early 2026. If oil prices continue to tumble, then markets will look to the group to rein in its output.

In the short term, markets will remain fixated on Kyiv and Washington for the next major signal, one that could determine the trajectory of crude heading into December.

Oil prices extended their decline for a third straight session on Friday as the U.S. pushed for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal that could bring more oil supplies onto the global market, while uncertainty over U.S. interest rate cuts curbed investor risk appetite. Brent crude futures fell 71 cents, or 1.12%, to $62.67 a barrel by 0212 GMT after slipping 0.2% in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $58.29 a barrel, down 71 cents, or 1.20%, after closing 0.5% lower on Thursday.Both contracts are set to fall more than 2% this week on oversupply concerns.Market sentiment turned bearish this week as Washington pushed for a peace plan between Ukraine and Russia to end the three-year war, even as sanctions on top Russian oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil are supposed to come into effect on Friday. Lukoil has until December 13 to sell its huge international portfolio."With Ukraine yet to formally reject the deal, the slim odds of an agreement are weighing on prices, as it would remove much of the war's geopolitical risk premium baked into crude," IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said in a note.A stronger greenback was also depressing oil prices as it makes the commodity more expensive for holders of other currencies.The dollar was on track for its best week in over a month on Friday as investors wagered the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates next month.

[TITLE]Norwegian billionaire left to rue Mainstream Renewable deal as losses hit €1.2bn:
[TEXT]
Mainstream has racked up huge losses amid turbulence in its main market Chile and challenges in the green energy development sector

For Aker ASA, the Norwegian industrial powerhouse that began life as a boat builder, a deal to buy Eddie O’Connor’s Mainstream Renewable Power in January 2021 was a springboard to float one of its portfolio companies weeks later.

“Combining Mainstream’s global organisation and renewable assets with Aker’s 180-year track record of building and developing industrial companies is another step in line with our long-term strategy for value creation,” said Øyvind Eriksen, chief executive of Aker ASA.

Aker Horizons, the unit going through the initial public offering (IPO), was handed Mainstream, after the group agreed to buy a 75 per cent stake, in a deal that valued the Irish business at €900 million.

A 20 per cent spike in Aker ASA’s own shares within days of the Mainstream deal suggested investors in Oslo thought it had snapped up a bargain in the wind and solar energy developer, with projects spanning Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific.

But it was a moment many of the 600 wealthy Irish individuals who backed O’Connor when he set up the company in 2008 – with hopes he could replicate the stunning €1.8 billion achieved for Airtricity, his previous venture – had long doubted would ever arrive.

Theirs had been a hair-raising ride. The financial crisis battered initial plans, and for a decade the company survived by selling developments early – and on the cheap – to keep the lights on. Things finally turned with the transformational sale of a large wind farm project off the coast of Scotland for more than €600 million in 2018.

For O’Connor, who died early last year, the 2021 deal delivered a fifteenfold gain on the €30 million he had put into Mainstream. He and a handful of others rolled over a 25 per cent stake.

However, 60 cent of the small Irish investors opted to sell out entirely in 2021, rather than reinvest some money in the Aker Horizons deal – walking away with

[TITLE]Don't fall for it: Blaming datacenters for rising electricity costs * WorldNetDaily * by Paul Steidler, Real Clear Wire:
[TEXT]
Left unchecked, early November 2025 will go down as the Rubicon when datacenters became the scapegoats for higher electricity costs. The messaging campaign has been aggressively launched and is gaining traction.

The reality, however, is fundamentally different.

Electricity prices were already on an upward tear before President Trump took office and implemented policies to accelerate the growth of datacenters. In fact, the widespread expansion of datacenters over the next decade can catalyze the substantial reduction of electricity costs while also improving grid reliability, thereby lessening service outages.

According to the Federal Reserve, nationwide electricity prices rose 31.6% from January 2021 to January 2025, compared with underlying inflation of 21.4% in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Thus, electricity prices rose 48% more than other goods and services.

From January to September 2025, the latest period for which figures are available, the Federal Reserve reports a 5.0% increase in electricity prices, also above the CPI. While high, it is hardly a new trend. That has not stopped some from looking to pin the blame on datacenters.

In an October 21 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Jonathan Kanter, the former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Enforcement in the U.S. Department of Justice during the Biden Administration, warned, “Energy power is going to be an extremely important area of focus for antitrust enforcers” because “datacenters consumer power at the expense of local communities and businesses.”

On Monday, November 10, five U.S. Senators wrote to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios. The Senators bluntly attacked datacenters for electricity costs saying, “American families face soaring electricity bills caused by the Trump Administration’s sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies.”

The charge does not hold muster, based on several factors.

First, datacenters take years to build. And while more than a thousand additional datacenters will be needed to help Americans thrive with AI, there simply has not been enough time in the Trump Administration to bring new ones online, or to cause changes in power markets and prices.

The primary issues affecting most electricity consumers in 2025 are as follows.

Much of your electric bill is not for electricity. A typical electric bill involves costs for fuel (e.g., the natural gas used), transmission (the process of delivering electricity from power plants to your home), and an assortment of government taxes and fees. The latter can be 25% of a typical bill and include sales taxes, subsidies for renewable energy, and other opaque purposes. Cutting these electricity taxes is an immediate and direct way for politicians to lower electric costs.

Much of the transmission grid is old – and it is expensive to replace it. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 70% of the electric grid is more than 25 years old. For decades, improvements have been put off, and the costs have risen substantially today to improve the grid.

Much more power generation is needed. With more fuel or power produced, the supply will increase and prices will fall. However, many areas, especially in the Northeast, have shut down large coal and nuclear plants while energy demand grows. In many areas, this is a significant structural issue that must be addressed.

Datacenters, in addition to the vast number of jobs and economic activity they bring to a region, can also be both the catalyst and central force in improving the delivery of electricity. They also help communities harvest the vast benefits of AI better.

As large users of electricity that will operate 24/7 for years in a community, datacenters often look to enter into multi-year power purchase agreements with utilities. This provides a stable, long-term source of investment capital that can and should facilitate the new generation coming online and the improvement of the transmission grid. Public utility commissions will assess such agreements to make sure they benefit the public, and it is local leaders who are directly accountable.

Datacenters also have the option of developing their own power sources. Communities that push datacenters towards that risk losing out on massive investments that will improve their electric grid, and defray costs to households.

Just as communities can decide whether they want datacenters, so too can the companies investing in datacenters determine where they want to locate. Many cities and states are courting companies investing in datacenters. Those who demagogue datacenters for electricity costs should take that to heart, as they could push these engines of prosperity out of their state to neighboring ones.

[TITLE]Xcel Energy seeks $355.5M revenue hike, increasing residential bills nearly 10% on average:
[TEXT]
Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has asked state regulators for an increase of $355.5 million to its rate base, which would boost the average residential electric bill by nearly 10% per month.

Xcel filed the proposal Friday with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which will take testimony from the company and various intervening parties and hold a public hearing. If approved, the increase would take effect in September 2026.

Xcel Energy-Colorado President Robert Kenney said the utility’s last increase to the rate base was in 2022. The average residential bill rose by 3.2%, according to an Xcel statement after an agreement was reached with all the parties

The rate base is a utility’s investments to provide services and on which it’s allowed to earn a regulated rate of return.

“This rate case is to recover costs associated with investments that we’ve made over the last three years,” Kenney said.

The Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, said the proposed increase is “too big of an increase.”

“It’s an especially large increase given the context of the economic times,” said Joseph Pereira, UCA deputy director.

The increase is largely related to Xcel’s expanded capital spending on distribution, transmission and generation, Pereira said.

“It’s unclear to parties in the UCA that the company is prioritizing investments that are the biggest bang for the buck, that increase reliability and that adopt an intelligent approach to how they’re using the grid,” Pereira said. “It still appears that the company is using a crude blanket approach to replacing and investing in new infrastructure.”

Kenney said Xcel has invested in safety, reliability, making the system more resilient, electrifying transportation and buildings, meeting increased demands from growth and taking steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Xcel has said it has reduced carbon emissions by 57%. The state’s target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.

Xcel is upgrading its electric grid with a $1.7 billion transmission project. The Colorado Power Pathway includes transmission lines, power substations and other equipment stretching over 12 counties, mostly in eastern Colorado.

“We’ve added a tremendous amount of renewable energy over the last several years,” Kenney said. “And we’ve done all of this while keeping bills as low as possible.”

Xcel has faced criticism from the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, and customers over the past few years for what the UCA has called “a pancaking of rate increases.”

The criticism of Xcel and other regulated utilities heated up in 2023 after a cold winter and high natural gas prices sent costs soaring statewide. A legislative committee held hearings and approved a bill intended to protect customers against future price shocks and level what some see as a playing field tilted in the utilities’ favor.

Kenney said Xcel Energy’s rates have been well below state and national averages for approximately the last 10 years. But, he added, the company recognizes that some customers face challenges to paying their bills. He said Xcel is expanding its programs to help people struggling to pay their bills and adding $10 million in assistance. People can also call 800-895-4999.

In the past, Xcel required people to show proof of income to apply for help, but now will accept their statements of need. And those receiving other aid, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will be automatically eligible.

Under Xcel’s proposed rate hike, the average monthly residential bill would rise 9.9%; small commercial bills would go up 9.3%-9.4% per month; and large commercial monthly bills would increase 7.3%-8.6%.
