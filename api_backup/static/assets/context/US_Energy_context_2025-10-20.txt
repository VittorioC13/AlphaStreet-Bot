Cenovus Energy has acquired approximately 21.7 million common shares of MEG Energy, bolstering its position ahead of a merger vote.

Since 8 October, Cenovus has acquired approximately 8.5% of MEG’s 254.4 million outstanding shares and is permitted to purchase up to 9.9% of MEG shares prior to the merger vote, as outlined in a revised standstill agreement between the two companies.

MEG’s board has approved Cenovus’ bid of C$8.6bn ($6.11bn), including debt.

However, the deal requires support from at least two-thirds of investors to proceed, reported Reuters.

The MEG shareholder meeting has been rescheduled from 9 October to 22 October, allowing investors more time to review the amended proposal.

Cenovus recently raised its bid to outpace Strathcona Resources in acquiring MEG.

The revised bid values MEG at approximately C$29.80 per share, which Cenovus has declared as its “best and final” offer.

Strathcona’s previous offer valued MEG at C$30.86 per share.

Despite Strathcona owning 14% of MEG, Cenovus’ board urged shareholders to reject Strathcona’s bid, labelling it as “fundamentally unattractive”.

Cenovus has revised its offer structure, moving from 75% cash and 25% stock to an even 50-50 split of cash and shares. The change is intended to give MEG investors more potential upside in the merged entity.

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 (Q4 2025).

Strathcona has withdrawn its takeover bid for MEG, ending its months-long contest with Cenovus.

The takeover saga commenced in May when Strathcona initiated a hostile bid of C$5.93bn for MEG, prompting Cenovus to respond with a more lucrative cash-and-stock offer valued at C$7.9bn in August.

A successful acquisition of MEG, which produces roughly 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, would strengthen Cenovus’ presence as a major operator in Alberta’s Christina Lake region.

Cenovus reported upstream production of around 832,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q3 2025.

[TITLE]OPEC Chief: The World Needs $18.2 Trillion in Oil and Gas Investment:
[TEXT]
OPEC highlights the International Energy Agency's (IEA) shift in narrative regarding new oil and gas investments, while consistently advocating for timely investments to meet growing demand and offset decline rates.

Primary energy demand is expected to increase by 23% by 2050, with oil still accounting for 30% of total global energy consumption, necessitating $18.2 trillion in oil industry investment.

OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais emphasizes the critical need for continued investment in oil and gas, projecting their substantial role in the global energy mix until 2050.

The world needs more investment in oil and gas as they will continue to account for a large part of the global energy mix in 2050, OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais said on Wednesday, reiterating the cartel’s view that investment in new supply will be needed in the foreseeable future.

Primary energy demand will jump by 23% by 2050, Al Ghais said in remarks to the Russian Energy Week conference in Moscow, as carried by Reuters.

And oil will still represent 30% of total global energy consumption in 2050, OPEC’s Secretary General said.

Growing economies, urbanization, and rising population numbers lead “to one clear signal that the world will need much more energy than it is consuming today,” Al Ghais added.

Earlier this year, OPEC said in its annual World Oil Outlook (WOO) that oil demand is set to continue rising through 2050, with consumption expected at 123 million barrels per day (bpd) then, up from about 104 million bpd this year.

The world needs global oil industry investment of $18.2 trillion out to 2050, Al Ghais wrote in a foreword to the outlook.

“It is vital that these investments are made for consumers and producers everywhere, as well as for the effective functioning of the global economy at large,” he added.

Last month, OPEC noted the “cautionary tale” of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The agency said in a new report that the world needs to develop new oil and gas resources just to keep output flat amid faster declining rates at existing fields, in a major shift in its narrative from 2021 that ‘no new investment’ is needed in a net-zero by 2050 scenario.

Acknowledging the IEA’s U-turn, OPEC said that “However, the IEA has not referenced how its own advocacy of its Net Zero Emissions Scenario or its own prognosis of peak oil demand have discouraged investments and contributed to uncertainty about long-term oil demand.”

“In contrast to the IEA’s U-turning on this important issue, OPEC has consistently advocated for timely investments in the oil industry to account for decline rates and meet growing demand,” OPEC said, commenting on the IEA’s new stance.

“It is vital that all stakeholders are consistent in recognizing this and do not return to rhetoric that there should be no investment in new oil projects.”

[TITLE]Clean energy jobs boom to bring thousands of new jobs:
[TEXT]
Government publishes first ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy mission, with over 400,000 extra jobs by 2030

31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and welders are particularly in demand

5 new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges to train next generation of workers, as part of government’s drive for two-thirds of young people to be in higher-level learning

Energy Secretary to set out measures ensuring companies receiving public grants and contracts need to deliver good jobs across the clean energy sector

A generation of young people across Britain will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, under new plans announced by the government today as part of the clean energy superpower mission

Backed by record government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK – with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, government will today (Sunday 19 October) publish a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90’s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen. Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders. This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said:

We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation. Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change.

The government’s clean energy mission is already delivering for the UK, with the certainty and stability of the government’s mission having galvanised over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

The government has also given Sizewell C the green light, which will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, announced Rolls Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs, and kickstarted the Acorn and the Viking projects in Scotland and the North East that is estimated to support a combined 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships. This builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers - 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans - Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

Upskill existing workers - Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50% today.

With at least 1 in 6 ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 60,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future. Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC , said:

After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy - as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

Crucially, it puts decent work at the heart of our energy system. And it shows that when government makes a plan with unions and workers, the whole country can benefit. Whether it’s welders in Wrexham or pipefitters on Teesside, the firm commitment to clean energy jobs being good union jobs is one which will improve working lives the country over. We now look forward to government delivering a similarly robust and funded plan for the North Sea transition, which safeguards jobs and livelihoods.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at the GMB, said:

GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs. GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions and their members will be at the heart of this. We need fair work agreements and taxpayers’ cash has to be spend where good jobs are going to be created. Today’s plan not only sets out that expectation but crucially, how good jobs can be measured.

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary of the RMT , said:

RMT welcomes the government’s commitment to closing loopholes in maritime and offshore employment law, which should in turn create domestic opportunities in coastal communities that support the entirety of the offshore wind supply chain. This plan has the potential to create hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the UK, offering real opportunities for those wishing to transition from oil and gas and for a new generation of workers in their own communities.

Christina McAnea, General Secretary of UNISON said:

Clean, homegrown energy is essential in tackling climate change and delivering economic growth. This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs. Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles. Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.

Alasdair McDiarmid, Assistant General Secretary of Community, said

After long years of managed decline and neglect under previous governments, we now have an ambitious government which is serious

[TITLE]Europe’s Aging Grids Buckle Under Renewable Energy Demands:
[TEXT]
The world’s power grids need a major upgrade to keep pace with growing rates of electrification and the ever-increasing energy demands of big data. A cleaner energy landscape means a whole lot more electricity demand, as we switch from gas-powered vehicles and appliances to newer, cleaner models that need to plug into the grid to charge. This means that expanding grid capacity and making our aging grids smarter and more flexible will be essential to maintaining energy security for the future – but grid infrastructure remains woefully neglected, and we’re already starting to see some of the fallout.

“To achieve countries’ national energy and climate goals, the world’s electricity use needs to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one,” states a 2023 report from the International Energy Agency. As a result, grids need to expand at an unprecedented rate. “Reaching national goals also means adding or refurbishing a total of over 80 million kilometres of grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid,” the report goes on to say.

Failure to prioritize investing in grid modernization and expansion poses a major threat to the clean energy transition and to energy security as grids become increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy are variable, meaning that their production levels wax and wane according to factors that have nothing to do with demand trends. Plus, energy production is increasingly dispersed, especially so thanks to the proliferation of residential solar panels. These factors introduce an extra level of complexity for grids that were designed with just a few major utilities in mind, and with only one direction of energy flow.

All of this is already leading to some hiccups for grid stability. In Europe, where renewable expansion and EV adoption have soared, critical grid congestion and catastrophic blackouts have become an increasing issue. At the end of April, cascading grid failures in Spain and Portugal resulted in the worst blackout in European history, and highlighted how woefully insufficient grid investment has been to date. At the time, Eurelectric reported that the “extraordinary event” in Iberia served as “a stark reminder that the grid is the backbone of our society. With electricity playing an increasingly important role in our society, we need to create all the conditions to enable a secure electricity supply.”

Unfortunately, many countries are now facing the consequences of failing to create all of those conditions. In the Netherlands, massive success with clean energy capacity installation and EV adoption without commensurate grid infrastructure expansion has resulted in a new norm of power cuts and energy consumption austerity measures. And it’s going to take a lot of money and time to fix the issue.

"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this," Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, recently told the BBC. The problem is causing ripples throughout the Netherlands economy. New housing, for example, is now facing long waiting lists in order to connect to grids that are already operating over maximum capacity.

But the issue is not limited to the Netherlands. Much of Europe has neglected to properly invest in grid infrastructure as a part of national clean energy planning. "We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate," Ernst went on to say.

[TITLE]Why Microgrids Are the Backbone of the Next Energy Revolution:
[TEXT]
Microgrids are becoming an increasingly attractive means of supplying rural areas with energy, particularly as renewable energy sources can be used to power small grids in unconventional energy-producing regions. These small grids can be developed alongside a comprehensive transmission network or in parts of the world where electricity access is limited, to boost access. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. It can operate in connection to a broader electricity grid or independently. Microgrids vary significantly in size, from small applications, such as rooftop solar power, to wide-scale (often renewable) energy projects. Some incorporate battery storage to ensure a stable energy supply, while others may rely entirely on the energy source, such as solar panels that only work when the sun is shining.

Microgrids can be beneficial as they can operate independently from the main grid, meaning that they can be used to connect hard-to-reach areas, such as rural regions, to electricity sources. They can also be used independently in the case of a power outage on the main supply. This can make them useful to critical infrastructure, such as medical facilities and grocery stores, to ensure they do not lose power during a blackout.

More companies are now exploring the potential of developing microgrids as higher investment is being seen in renewable energy projects worldwide, signalling a new era of energy infrastructure development. In addition, many now view microgrids as useful for supplying energy in unserved or underserved areas, particularly in developing countries.

In regions of Yemen that have long experienced regular blackouts, leading them to rely on diesel-fuelled generators, the UNDP has invested in “Renewable Energy to Improve Access to Health Services and Livelihood Opportunities” (HEAL) Project across five governorates, with funding from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. The agency has developed solar microgrids to “provide energy to low-income youth and marginalized individuals who are the primary breadwinners for their families” to encourage economic empowerment. Beneficiaries are expected to reach around 205,000 individuals.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), most electricity comes from hydropower, and despite government efforts to expand the national grid, it has not kept pace with population growth. In 2020, around 1.6 million of the DRC’s 10 million households had access to electricity. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), the International Finance Corporation, and the International Development Association have partnered with the private sector to develop Africa’s largest mini-grid project to accelerate access to electricity. MIGA has provided a guarantee of $50.3 million to Congo Energy Solutions Limited, which is expected to expand its operations to provide energy to up to five million people by 2025.

In the United States, some companies are developing microgrids to decrease risks associated with energy delivery. For example, the U.S. utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is increasingly developing remote grids in wildfire-prone regions to reduce the risk of fire associated with main transmission lines. As the price of solar panels, batteries, and backup generators declines, microgrids are becoming more accessible. To date, the utility has installed just around a dozen systems in the Sierra Nevada high country, however this could provide the blueprint for future development in certain regions of the U.S. PG&E aims to develop over 30 remote grids by the end of 2027.

The region’s energy regulator approved the development of remote grids by the utility in 2023, which could potentially spur a new era of microgrid development. However, at present, the cost of installing and operating the solar panels and batteries and maintaining and fuelling the generators must be lower than what the firm would have spent on conventional power lines for PG&E to consider installing a microgrid.

The move follows the forced bankruptcy of the utility in 2019, after its transmission lines were linked to the starting of California’s deadliest-ever wildfire, as the state has mandated PG&E to prevent future disasters. California’s utilities have spent billions on burying key power lines, clearing trees and underbrush, and protecting overhead lines to prevent wildfires. However, this investment has forced utilities to increase consumer costs. This has led several utilities to seek out alternative ways to deliver clean, safe power to consumers, such as through the rollout of microgrids.

The new generation of technology is expected to improve microgrid efficiency. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) can help manage the balance between different energy sources, such as solar, battery storage and generators. AI can be used to analyse current and projected energy production and demand to optimise energy flows and ensure efficient energy distribution. This is expected to reduce waste and ensure a stable supply of energy. It can also be used to improve microgrid sustainability to optimise the use of renewable energy sources.

[TITLE]Europe’s Aging Grids Buckle Under Renewable Energy Demands:
[TEXT]
The world’s power grids need a major upgrade to keep pace with growing rates of electrification and the ever-increasing energy demands of big data. A cleaner energy landscape means a whole lot more electricity demand, as we switch from gas-powered vehicles and appliances to newer, cleaner models that need to plug into the grid to charge. This means that expanding grid capacity and making our aging grids smarter and more flexible will be essential to maintaining energy security for the future – but grid infrastructure remains woefully neglected, and we’re already starting to see some of the fallout.

“To achieve countries’ national energy and climate goals, the world’s electricity use needs to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one,” states a 2023 report from the International Energy Agency. As a result, grids need to expand at an unprecedented rate. “Reaching national goals also means adding or refurbishing a total of over 80 million kilometres of grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid,” the report goes on to say.

Failure to prioritize investing in grid modernization and expansion poses a major threat to the clean energy transition and to energy security as grids become increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy are variable, meaning that their production levels wax and wane according to factors that have nothing to do with demand trends. Plus, energy production is increasingly dispersed, especially so thanks to the proliferation of residential solar panels. These factors introduce an extra level of complexity for grids that were designed with just a few major utilities in mind, and with only one direction of energy flow.

All of this is already leading to some hiccups for grid stability. In Europe, where renewable expansion and EV adoption have soared, critical grid congestion and catastrophic blackouts have become an increasing issue. At the end of April, cascading grid failures in Spain and Portugal resulted in the worst blackout in European history, and highlighted how woefully insufficient grid investment has been to date. At the time, Eurelectric reported that the “extraordinary event” in Iberia served as “a stark reminder that the grid is the backbone of our society. With electricity playing an increasingly important role in our society, we need to create all the conditions to enable a secure electricity supply.”

Unfortunately, many countries are now facing the consequences of failing to create all of those conditions. In the Netherlands, massive success with clean energy capacity installation and EV adoption without commensurate grid infrastructure expansion has resulted in a new norm of power cuts and energy consumption austerity measures. And it’s going to take a lot of money and time to fix the issue.

"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this," Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, recently told the BBC. The problem is causing ripples throughout the Netherlands economy. New housing, for example, is now facing long waiting lists in order to connect to grids that are already operating over maximum capacity.

But the issue is not limited to the Netherlands. Much of Europe has neglected to properly invest in grid infrastructure as a part of national clean energy planning. "We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate," Ernst went on to say.

[TITLE]Why Microgrids Are the Backbone of the Next Energy Revolution:
[TEXT]
Microgrids are becoming an increasingly attractive means of supplying rural areas with energy, particularly as renewable energy sources can be used to power small grids in unconventional energy-producing regions. These small grids can be developed alongside a comprehensive transmission network or in parts of the world where electricity access is limited, to boost access. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. It can operate in connection to a broader electricity grid or independently. Microgrids vary significantly in size, from small applications, such as rooftop solar power, to wide-scale (often renewable) energy projects. Some incorporate battery storage to ensure a stable energy supply, while others may rely entirely on the energy source, such as solar panels that only work when the sun is shining.

Microgrids can be beneficial as they can operate independently from the main grid, meaning that they can be used to connect hard-to-reach areas, such as rural regions, to electricity sources. They can also be used independently in the case of a power outage on the main supply. This can make them useful to critical infrastructure, such as medical facilities and grocery stores, to ensure they do not lose power during a blackout.

More companies are now exploring the potential of developing microgrids as higher investment is being seen in renewable energy projects worldwide, signalling a new era of energy infrastructure development. In addition, many now view microgrids as useful for supplying energy in unserved or underserved areas, particularly in developing countries.

In regions of Yemen that have long experienced regular blackouts, leading them to rely on diesel-fuelled generators, the UNDP has invested in “Renewable Energy to Improve Access to Health Services and Livelihood Opportunities” (HEAL) Project across five governorates, with funding from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. The agency has developed solar microgrids to “provide energy to low-income youth and marginalized individuals who are the primary breadwinners for their families” to encourage economic empowerment. Beneficiaries are expected to reach around 205,000 individuals.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), most electricity comes from hydropower, and despite government efforts to expand the national grid, it has not kept pace with population growth. In 2020, around 1.6 million of the DRC’s 10 million households had access to electricity. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), the International Finance Corporation, and the International Development Association have partnered with the private sector to develop Africa’s largest mini-grid project to accelerate access to electricity. MIGA has provided a guarantee of $50.3 million to Congo Energy Solutions Limited, which is expected to expand its operations to provide energy to up to five million people by 2025.

In the United States, some companies are developing microgrids to decrease risks associated with energy delivery. For example, the U.S. utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is increasingly developing remote grids in wildfire-prone regions to reduce the risk of fire associated with main transmission lines. As the price of solar panels, batteries, and backup generators declines, microgrids are becoming more accessible. To date, the utility has installed just around a dozen systems in the Sierra Nevada high country, however this could provide the blueprint for future development in certain regions of the U.S. PG&E aims to develop over 30 remote grids by the end of 2027.

The region’s energy regulator approved the development of remote grids by the utility in 2023, which could potentially spur a new era of microgrid development. However, at present, the cost of installing and operating the solar panels and batteries and maintaining and fuelling the generators must be lower than what the firm would have spent on conventional power lines for PG&E to consider installing a microgrid.

The move follows the forced bankruptcy of the utility in 2019, after its transmission lines were linked to the starting of California’s deadliest-ever wildfire, as the state has mandated PG&E to prevent future disasters. California’s utilities have spent billions on burying key power lines, clearing trees and underbrush, and protecting overhead lines to prevent wildfires. However, this investment has forced utilities to increase consumer costs. This has led several utilities to seek out alternative ways to deliver clean, safe power to consumers, such as through the rollout of microgrids.

The new generation of technology is expected to improve microgrid efficiency. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) can help manage the balance between different energy sources, such as solar, battery storage and generators. AI can be used to analyse current and projected energy production and demand to optimise energy flows and ensure efficient energy distribution. This is expected to reduce waste and ensure a stable supply of energy. It can also be used to improve microgrid sustainability to optimise the use of renewable energy sources.

[TITLE]Big Tech's AI ambitions are remaking the US power grid. Consumers are paying the price.:
[TEXT]
This past week, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market monitor for PJM Interconnection, filed a brief with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission arguing that the federal regulator should reject a recently signed transmission agreement between Pennsylvania utility PECO Energy and Amazon's ( AMZN ) Data Services division.

While it is unclear whether utilities had begun to spend money building out connections for those projects, it is evidence of the potential threat that TD Cowen analysts attributed to an oversupply of the computers that power AI technology.

Microsoft ( MSFT ), one of the largest data center developers in the country, decided in March to walk away from proposed data center projects in the US and Europe with a combined 2-gigawatt load, according to Bloomberg.

AI has pushed a bevy of tech companies into deals with utilities across the country, but some cracks have started to show in these best-laid plans as the AI boom rapidly evolves.

Should demand ultimately fall short of estimates, utilities can be stuck with stranded assets generating no revenue. Their options then are to find a way to pass that cost — which averages around $102 per kilowatt, or $102 million for a 1-gigawatt load — on to ratepayers or write down the loss themselves.

When a utility receives a power load request, such as from a tech company looking for, say, 2 gigawatts for a new data center, the utility spends millions buying the equipment, materials, and hiring the personnel to make it happen.

But the speed-at-all-costs approach has its risks. "What are the long-term business models? How much compute will those services actually require? [There's] just huge amounts of uncertainty
