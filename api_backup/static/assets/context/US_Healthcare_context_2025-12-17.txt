Charter Medical Group is planning to invest €85m in a new capital plan that will include a €50m investment in its Mullingar private hospital facility and a new ambulatory surgery centre to be located in central Dublin.

The private healthcare group expects the new plan will see current group revenues – at €50m in 2025, up from €41m in 2024 – double on foot of the investment. Overall group jobs numbers are expected to grow from 370 to 700 with the expansion, it said.

The healthcare provider said it is planning a €50m investment over two years in Charter Medical Private Hospital at Ballinderry in Mullingar and this would be “a transformative step in expanding healthcare capacity in the Midlands”.

“The hospital in Mullingar plays a significant role in supporting the public hospitals in the Midlands region where it serves to reduce pressure on the health system and deliver ease of access to services that are in critical demand,” said the group in a statement.

The two-year plan for the Westmeath hospital will create 100 new jobs in 2026 followed by another 100 roles in 2027, adding to the hospital’s current workforce of over 300, it said.

Commencing in January 2026, the capital plan for the hospital comprises new theatres, new endoscopy suites, additional surgical and medical beds and an investment in what the group said would be “leading-edge technology to enhance patient care”.

The plan will also include investment in its existing facilities in Dublin, as well as the new central Dublin surgery centre, details of which would be announced in early 2026.

Charter Medical Group’s facilities currently treat 80,000 patients a year and it is the second-largest provider to the National Treatment Fund (NTPF) nationally.

'The hospital in Mullingar plays a significant role in supporting the public hospitals in the Midlands region' the group said

“Charter Medical Group is entering an exciting phase of growth,” said Charter Medical Group chairman Tom Byrne.

“Our €85m capital programme for 2026 and 2027 will see the addition of a third facility in central Dublin, complementing our existing sites in Dublin and Westmeath.

This expansion underscores our commitment to delivering world-class care to more patients and supporting the national healthcare system at scale.”

The group said in a statement that the new roles it plans to create would include nursing staff and clinical nursing specialists, health and social care specialists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, specialist medical and surgical registrars, respiratory physiologists and a clinical innovation team to develop new services and integrate new technologies.

It also plans to create new senior managerial and administration roles, it said.

Millions of Americans could see a massive spike to their health insurance premiums with federal subsidies for people who use the Affordable Care Act marketplace set to expire at the end of the 2025 as lawmakers on Capitol Hill remain deadlocked on a deal. The Democrats' plan would have allowed the vast majority to keep their benefits for three more years while the Republicans wanted to scrap them in favor of boosting health savings accounts, but both bills failed.

[TITLE]Cycle Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Applied Therapeutics:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLT; “Applied”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to creating transformative treatments for rare diseases, today announced a definitive agreement for Cycle Group Holdings Limited (“Cycle”) to acquire Applied Therapeutics.

Applied Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the development of novel drug candidates against validated molecular targets in rare diseases. Applied’s lead drug candidate, govorestat, is a novel central nervous system (CNS) penetrant Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) for the treatment of CNS rare metabolic diseases, including Classic Galactosemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency (CMT-SORD) and phosphomannomutase 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG).

“We are confident that Cycle has the resources and capabilities to move govorestat forward towards the ultimate goal of bringing a life-changing treatment to the patients suffering from Classic Galactosemia, CMT-SORD and PMM2-CDG, who have always been at the center of everything we do at Applied,” said Les Funtleyder, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Applied. “I want to thank the entire Applied team for their perseverance and commitment. We are also grateful to the investigators and patients who have contributed to the development of govorestat.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cycle will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock for a per share price of $0.088 per share in cash payable at closing plus one non-transferrable contingent value right (CVR) that entitles the holder to receive potential additional payments.

The CVR provides payments based on the following:

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for any galactosemia indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for the CMT-SORD indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.20 per CVR in cash payable upon the first achievement of worldwide net sales of any product covered by the CVR by Cycle, its affiliates or licensees equal to or exceeding $200 million dollars in any four-quarter fiscal period prior to the tenth anniversary of closing.

Each CVR holder will also be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any cash of Applied in excess of $500,000 at closing (capped at $1.5 million) (“Closing Cash Payment”).

Each such CVR and Closing Cash Payment will be paid only once, if at all.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions contained in the merger agreement that will be filed with the SEC, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock. The merger agreement does not include a financing condition. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions. If the tender offer closes, then Cycle would acquire untendered shares of Applied through a second-step merger for the same consideration.

Applied also issued a Promissory Note (the “Promissory Note”) to Cycle. The Promissory Note is unsecured and enables Applied to receive loans aggregating up to $8.5 million from Cycle, to fund Applied’s working capital needs under an approved budget. Cycle’s funding obligations cease, and amounts borrowed immediately becomes repayable, if the transaction is terminated for certain reasons. Absent funds provided by Cycle under the Promissory Note or from another source, Applied would be unable to continue to fund its activities for more than a limited number of days and Applied would anticipate proceeding to wind down operations.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Applied Board of Directors following an extensive evaluation of strategic alternatives. This evaluation process included numerous discussions with potential counterparties. The Applied Board of Directors determined that entering into the merger agreement with Cycle represented the path that best advanced the interests of Applied and its stockholders.

For Cycle, Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as legal counsel. For Applied, Aquilo Partners, L.P. provided a fairness opinion, and Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel.

The price target hike follows the company’s agreement to acquire Bluejay Therapeutics for $620 million in cash. With the acquisition, the company gains worldwide rights to brelovitug, a monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis D, a rare and aggressive liver condition.

“This acquisition fits squarely with what we do best—advancing high-impact medicines for patients with rare diseases through disciplined development, regulatory innovation, and commercial excellence,” Mirum CEO Chris Peetz said in the release.

The acquisition of Brelovitug comes on the heels of 100% HDV RNA response in Phase 2 clinical trials, with Phase 3 results expected in the second half of next year.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley have also reiterated an Overweight rating on Mirum Pharmaceuticals with an $81 price target. The investment bank views the deal as a smart strategic move for Mirum, saying it bolsters the company’s position in rare liver diseases while offering clear synergies with its current commercial setup. The firm also projects that the enlarged pipeline could generate more than $4 billion in peak sales.

Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIRM) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering treatments for rare and debilitating liver diseases, especially those affecting children, by transforming scientific discoveries into therapies such as their key drug LIVMARLI (maralixibat) for cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC).

While we acknowledge the potential of MIRM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Healthcare AI Exits Pilot Phase, Enters Production Deployment:
[TEXT]
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity-Insider.com News Commentary – Healthcare organizations are setting the pace for enterprise AI adoption as operational automation moves from experimentation to production scale across hospital systems[1]. The shift reflects a fundamental change in how healthcare leaders view AI technology, with deployment projected to expand the global healthcare AI market from $17.2 billion in 2025 to $77.2 billion by 2035[2]. Five publicly traded companies are positioned at the intersection of this operational transformation, delivering infrastructure that turns AI capabilities into measurable workflow improvements and financial returns: VentriPoint Diagnostics (TSXV: VPT) (OTCPK: VPTDF), Doximity, Inc. (NYSE: DOCS), Oscar Health, Inc. (NYSE: OSCR), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), and Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ: CERT).

Industry data shows 80% of hospitals now deploy AI for operational efficiency and patient care, marking a decisive break from the pilot project era that dominated 2023 and early 2024[3]. Healthcare systems are prioritizing agentic AI platforms that automate complex workflows across clinical documentation, administrative processes, and enterprise systems, creating conditions where early infrastructure providers can establish durable competitive positions before the market matures[4].

Ventripoint Diagnostics (TSXV: VPT) (OTCPK: VPTDF) just announced a partnership with Nisg̱a'a Valley Health Authority that establishes a global model for delivering advanced cardiac imaging to remote and Indigenous communities. The collaboration centers on Ventripoint's VMS+ system, which transforms standard 2D ultrasound images into 3D volumetric models with MRI-level accuracy. This technology enables precise cardiac assessments at the point of care, reducing costs and eliminating the need for time-consuming MRI scans.

The model follows a hub-and-spoke design where a central hub with advanced cardiac capabilities supports connected sites in smaller, remote, and Indigenous communities. Local healthcare providers can acquire ultrasound scans and transmit them digitally to specialists at the hub for rapid interpretation. The Nisg̱a'a Valley Health Authority will serve as the first remote site in this network, linked to a regional center with tertiary and quaternary care capabilities.

"Through our collaboration with the Nisg̱a'a Nation, we are creating a scalable model of heart care that can extend from the Arctic to the Amazon, ensuring that everyone, regardless of geography, has access to advanced diagnostics," said Hugh MacNaught, CEO of Ventripoint.

Future phases are intended to include additional First Nations communities across Canada, Arctic regions, and rural communities worldwide, including areas in the Amazon, Africa, and India where MRI access is limited. The model delivers advanced cardiac imaging directly to patients without the need for long-distance travel, high costs, or extended wait times.

"Partnering with Ventripoint allows us to explore innovative tools that support more accurate diagnoses, faster treatment decisions, and truly patient-centred care right here at home," said Corinne McKay, CEO of Nisga'a Valley Health Authority. "For NVHA, this collaboration is
