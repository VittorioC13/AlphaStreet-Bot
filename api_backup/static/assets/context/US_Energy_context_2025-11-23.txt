[TITLE]Oil Slides on Peace Deal Pressure:
[TEXT]
Oil fell as traders assessed the prospect of a Ukraine-Russia peace deal that would add supply to a saturated market, with reports emerging that the US threatened to stop supporting Kyiv unless it agrees to a pact that favors Moscow.

[TITLE]Oil Prices Sink 2.6% After Zelenskyy Agrees to Work on Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices dropped again on Friday morning, bogged down by fresh news that Ukraine's Zelenskyy agreed to work with Washington on a peace plan, a development that could ultimately add fresh barrels into an already fragile market.

At the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate for December delivery had slipped by 2.51% to $57.52 per barrel...

Brent crude, for its part, had fallen 2.19% to $61.99...

A continued pullback would mark the third consecutive daily decline for WTI, putting the U.S. benchmark on track for a weekly loss of over 4%, a reflection of broader concerns over global supply growth and a weakening demand outlook

News of Zelenskyy considering the peace proposal comes on the same day that new U.S. sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil officially take effect, targeting key subsidiaries in an effort to restrict Kremlin revenue from fossil-fuel sales. While those sanctions should tighten supply, that has largely been baked into markets at this point.

Russian Urals crude, already discounted due to sanctions, has been trading as much as $23 per barrel below other global grades, evidence that sanctions are having an effect.

In the U.S., crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell by 3.4 million barrels last week on the back of strong refinery activity. But the bullish inventory surprise failed to lift prices as traders remained focused on the geopolitical picture.

Energy markets also faced macro-driven pressure, with Asian stocks declining sharply after Thursday’s U.S. employment data clouded expectations for imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts, boosting the dollar and intensifying risk-off sentiment.

A stronger greenback, the currency hit a broad rally against major and commodity-linked currencies, further weighed on dollar-priced crude.

OPEC+ remains a fundamental force in the overall bearishness of oil markets, with the group committed to boosting production in December before halting output increases in early 2026. If oil prices continue to tumble, then markets will look to the group to rein in its output.

In the short term, markets will remain fixated on Kyiv and Washington for the next major signal, one that could determine the trajectory of crude heading into December.

Oil prices extended their decline for a third straight session on Friday as the U.S. pushed for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal that could bring more oil supplies onto the global market, while uncertainty over U.S. interest rate cuts curbed investor risk appetite. Brent crude futures fell 71 cents, or 1.12%, to $62.67 a barrel by 0212 GMT after slipping 0.2% in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $58.29 a barrel, down 71 cents, or 1.20%, after closing 0.5% lower on Thursday.Both contracts are set to fall more than 2% this week on oversupply concerns.Market sentiment turned bearish this week as Washington pushed for a peace plan between Ukraine and Russia to end the three-year war, even as sanctions on top Russian oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil are supposed to come into effect on Friday. Lukoil has until December 13 to sell its huge international portfolio."With Ukraine yet to formally reject the deal, the slim odds of an agreement are weighing on prices, as it would remove much of the war's geopolitical risk premium baked into crude," IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said in a note.A stronger greenback was also depressing oil prices as it makes the commodity more expensive for holders of other currencies.The dollar was on track for its best week in over a month on Friday as investors wagered the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates next month.
