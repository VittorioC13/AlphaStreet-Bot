[TITLE]Taconic Capital Sells LIC Hotel Site to Palette Hotels for $26M:
[TEXT]
Alternative investment manager Taconic Capital Advisors has offloaded a former Long Island City, Queens, hotel building just four years after buying it.

Taconic, through the entity Z Hotel LIC Principal, sold the former Z NYC Hotel at 11-01 43rd Avenue to hotel owner-operator Palette Hotels, which used the entity PH LIC Partners, for $25.5 million, according to city records made public Monday.

Erin Rota, deputy general counsel at Taconic, signed the deal for the seller, while Palette Hotels CEO Richard Lou signed for the buyer, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. Taconic declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Palette Hotels did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

News of the deal comes after Taconic bought the 11-story building between 11th and 12th streets in Long Island City’s Hunters Point neighborhood for $38.4 million in May 2021, as Commercial Observer previously reported. Taconic acquired the property from Merchants Hospitality, which had purchased the asset in 2018 with plans to reposition it into a mixed-use development with retail, coworking space and art galleries.

It’s unclear what happened to both Merchant Hospitality and Taconic’s plans for the property, but Palette Hotels is expected to turn the site into a cash-generating venture, PincusCo reported. New York-based Palette Hotels owns 25 hotels across 20 U.S. cities, according to its website.

Developed in 2011, the 100-key Z NYC Hotel closed during the COVID pandemic and was later leased to apartment rental company Sonder, which terminated its lease agreement at the building in 2020.

But the former hotel still has some current retail tenants, including cocktail bar Lost in Paradise Rooftop and speakeasy The Newsroom.

[TITLE]Blackstone Secures $800M Investment From Realty Income Corp. for Las Vegas Portfolio:
[TEXT]
Blackstone Real Estate just scored a major equity investment into one of its prime assets in Las Vegas, according to law firm Simpson Thacher, which represented Blackstone in the deal.

The private equity giant announced Monday that it secured an $800 million preferred equity investment from Realty Income Corporation, a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in single-tenant commercial properties like Walgreens, 7Eleven and Dollar Tree, into its ownership portion of CityCenter, the 18 million-square-foot mixed-use urban campus on the Las Vegas Strip.

Blackstone owns Aria Resort & Casino and Vdara Hotel & Spa, two hospitality, retail and entertainment complexes managed by MGM Resorts International that feature a total of 5,500 rooms and 500,000 square feet of convention space in the greater CityCenter development, which spans 67 acres and includes six buildings.

The deal allows Blackstone to retain 100 percent common equity ownership of the properties, but carries with it the stipulation that Realty Income Corporation expects to receive an annual unlevered rate of return of 7.4 percent on the two assets that hold a 26-year triple-net lease (with MGM covering operational costs). The lease comes with annual rent escalators (capped for Realty Income after five years), and carries three 10-year extension options.

The deal also includes the carve-out that once Realty Income has redeemed the $800 million common equity investment, if it has not received an 8.32 percent unlevered return on that same amount, it will receive a make-whole payment from Blackstone for the total owed.

Sumit Roy, Realty Income’s president and CEO, in a statement called the deal an “immediately accretive investment … with a favorable initial yield and IRR profile,” and added that it reflects his firm’s size, scope and diversified portfolio.

“We are pleased to build on our strategic relationship with Blackstone Real Estate to invest in one of the Las Vegas Strip’s iconic properties,” he added.

Jacob Werner, co-head of Americas acquisitions for Blackstone Real Estate, noted that his firm had previously secured a preferred equity investment from Realty Income on a joint venture to acquire the Bellagio Las Vegas in 2023

“This preferred equity investment is a terrific outcome for our investors as it returns significant capital while preserving our ownership in a world-class resort at the heart of the Las Vegas Strip,” said Werner.

The deal is expected to close Dec. 9.

[TITLE]How America’s Biggest Retailers Are Rethinking Their Businesses And Their Stores:
[TEXT]
America’s biggest department stores are changing, and changing fast.

In the past quarter, for instance, Target has piloted a new store model in Chicago, where it’s begun segmenting some stores into more backroom operations and fulfillment for online orders, while high-foot-traffic locations will prioritize in-person shopper engagement and on-shelf inventory availability. The company plans a major remodel of its store footprints next year.

Best Buy, meanwhile, introduced a third-party marketplace in August for online sellers that carry items not sold in stores. The marketplace has onboarded more than 1,000 sellers and already carries 11x more products than are in Best Buy stores, CEO Corie Barry told investors last week.

And, of course, big retailers like Target, Best Buy and Walmart now prize their advertising and media businesses as the connective tissue for the company overall.

Advertisers are friends

For big retailers, advertising and retail media isn’t just a revenue line; it’s a deeply interwoven part of the business and incorporates important outside partners.

Take Best Buy. Earlier this year, the chain launched a social media ad-buying extension to its ads business, which it calls Social+. For now, the “social” element is a bit of a misnomer, since the product exclusively works with one partner – Meta’s Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns.

Barry also noted that Best Buy is doing a big marketing push, citing ESPN as a publisher it’s targeting for a big streaming campaign to promote its NFL sponsorship. Plus, Best Buy Media has a major new store takeover ad offering that begins in January. The first sponsors are ESPN and Meta.

Retail media network businesses can often create relationships on one side of a business as either a market or publisher that can then flip from spending to earning revenue.

In an interview with AdExchanger from October, for example, Mark Grether, who now leads the PayPal Ads business, cited the company’s work with Ulta. Right now, that means PayPal is helping Ulta spend its marketing budgets by targeting PayPal shoppers. However, if that partnership takes off, it could include PayPal generating ad revenue for Ulta.

When retail media players link up, there is no fixed position where one is supply and the other demand. It can be a nebulous relationship in which one party is sometimes spending, sometimes earning.

Similarly, Klarna, PayPal and Capital One Shopping, the credit card company’s data-driven media business, are new non-endemic advertising clients for Best Buy Media. They are also potential or current payment partners for the retailer.

The new marketplace

Third-party marketplaces have a similar effect for retailers, since they contribute greatly to the ads business and connect back to store performance. Walmart, Target and Best Buy, as of Q3, are the first of the US chains to adopt Amazon’s third-party marketplace model.

“During the quarter, we launched our self-serve platform, My Ads, which is particularly important for our new marketplace sellers,” Barry told investors of Best Buy’s new third-party marketplace.

Target said gross merchandise sales for its Target Plus marketplace were up almost 50% year over year, with mid-teens growth in ad sales through Roundel, the company’s retail media business. This growth is “demonstrating the breadth and growing relevance of our digital ecosystem,” CEO Doug McMillon told investors last month. Just as importantly, he added, advertising and marketplace sales are a key way to influence traffic, since they can be used to direct pickup ecommerce orders to one location, say, while the other is built primarily to serve in-store guests but might not fulfill online orders as quickly.

Walmart cited its ability to sell through inventory more effectively than it has in the past. For big shopping occasions like Halloween and back-to-school, Walmart has made it a priority “that we end clean and we move on to the next season,” said John Furner, EVP and CEO of Walmart US, who’ll become Walmart CEO next year. That’s partly due to more judicious selections of what to carry and how much to stock. But retail media plays a role, too, by ramping spend up or down to clear inventory in particular markets.

“We continue to get better at putting our data to work,” Furner said.

Halloween is a good example, especially considering the outrageous cost of chocolate. A store stuck with unsold candy that must be offloaded at huge discounts could be saddled with painful losses. So chains need to be able to effectively use their Hershey’s retail media spend, for instance, to clear out that inventory.

Need for speed

What do shoppers want for Christmas?

Speed.

Not the drug, mind. But super-quick ecommerce fulfillment options.

In China, where Walmart’s business is 50% ecommerce, almost four out of five online orders arrive within one hour, McMillon said.

About a third of Walmart’s US ecommerce orders are now delivered within three hours, Furner said. And the company’s fastest-growing channel is for orders delivered within one hour.

Walmart+, the retailer’s paid membership program (i.e., its alternative to Amazon Prime), had its biggest quarter of new sign-ups.

“There are really a couple of things that are driving that,” Furner said of the subscription growth. “The first is delivery and delivery speed.”

Best Buy is “focusing on delivery and speed of delivery in particular” to pick up new sales from customers in duress (which is not emotional or physical duress, but retail jargon for when, like, someone’s washing machine breaks) said Chief Financial and Strategy Officer Matthew Bilunas.

Best Buy has traditionally been about premium products, and its stores have been places to research and choose options, which are then delivered. Best Buy is trying to convert more of that intentful demand it sees showing up, often online, by creating offers for people to pick up and leave with an item from the store that very day or hour.

“Really, what we have to do is shift our model a little bit,” Bilunas said.

[TITLE]Walgreens Real Estate Is Up for Grabs:
[TEXT]
Three months after Walgreens’ nearly century-long run as a public company ended, the real estate fate for several of the pharmacy chain’s stores is up in the air amid an uncertain time for the retail sector.

Walgreens, which was founded in 1901 and first went public in 1927, officially became a private company in late August when private equity firm Sycamore Partners completed its acquisition of Walgreens Boots Alliance. The deal has put Sycamore in the driver’s seat of a number of Walgreens corner stores around the country, setting the stage for potential repositionings to other uses such as mini grocery stores, discount retailers or urgent care facilities.

Bryn Feller, senior vice president and managing director in the Chicago office of capital markets firm Northmarq, said Sycamore was largely driven by real estate opportunities when it made the deal with Walgreens. Feller noted that Walgreens went from around an $80 billion market cap in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic to one of less than $20 billion in a few short years, due to around a third of its fleet losing store revenue.

“The challenge that Walgreens has is they signed very long-term 20- and 25-year leases at rents that were reflective of a different retail era,” Feller said. “I think Sycamore is really thinking through a number of creative approaches to try and solve that challenge.”

Walgreens and Sycamore did not return requests for comment.

Around a decade ago, Walgreens owned

[TITLE]Why Taiwan is Asia’s underrated food capital for travellers and foodies:
[TEXT]
Centuries of systematic marginalisation means you won’t easily stumble upon indigenous fare in Taiwan, but search and you can find. The eastern city of Hualien is home to the Taiwan Indigenous Peoples’ Cooks’ Alliance, a group within the Slow Food movement, which promotes and protects traditional indigenous culinary cultures. Its night market Dongdamen has a row dedicated to indigenous food stalls. Look for abai – purple rice, millet, minced pork and bitter herbs wrapped in perilla leaves, sticky rice steamed inside bamboo, smoked sweet potato and millet wine.

Indigenous cuisine is also appearing in fine-dining settings, such as at Akame in rural Pintung County and at Taipei restaurant Embers.

China’s culinary fingerprints

Migration from certain parts of China has a huge influence on Taiwanese cuisine. Hakka people were early migrants and today 20% of the population claim Hakka ancestry. In the banqueting room of Hakka restaurant Shi-Ting in Hualien we feasted on a never-ending stream of specialties emerging from a humble kitchen: smoked pork, steamed chicken with kumquat sauce, thick rice noodles, pork cooked in fermented red yeast rice and delicate peanut mochi, freshly made from a heavy ball of sticky dough by the lady of the house at an empty table in the main dining room.

Hokkien fare from China’s southern Fujian province also stars in Taiwan cuisine with some of the most popular street foods – oyster omelette, beef noodle soup, braised pork on rice, bawan (sticky rice balls or rolls stuffed with savoury fillings) and the famously pungent chou doufu (stinky tofu). If you don’t at least try the latter, did you even visit Taiwan?

Taiwan has a melting pot of cuisines. Photo / Unsplash

Ditch cereal for a unique breakfast

Fu Hang Soy Milk is one of Taipei’s favourite brekkie spots and places like it can be found all over. The fresh, hot soy milk (dou jiang) is the signature dish – watch it being made from scratch and served up from steaming vats, piping hot and sweet, and dunk youtiao (fried bread sticks) into it. Also order fresh bing – filled breads either thick and baked in a tandoor-like oven (hu jiao bing) or crepe thin and fried (dan bing) with various savoury fillings.

Michelin Guide night markets

Taiwan is blessed with night markets aplenty and Taipei’s Roahe market, lit like a fairground, is one of the biggest and best, boasting six stalls recognised by the Michelin Guide. Among the must-try items are Fuzhou black pepper buns, fried taro balls stuffed with cheese, giant crisp chicken cutlets, Taiwanese sausage, and grilled squid with garlic and Thai basil. Have a sweet tooth? Don’t miss desserts like mango shaved ice, tanghulu (candied fruit skewers) and, my favourite, fried milk, a delicious enigma that is crispy on the outside, custardy on the inside.

World-famous dumplings

In 1949 the retreat of the Kuomintang Government saw up to two million political emigres arrive in Taiwan, bringing with them foods from all over China, including Shanghai. Din Tai Fung, the cult restaurant brand built on Shanghainese xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) was born in Taipei and today boasts branches around the globe including 11 in Taiwan. At popular branches such as Taipei 101 (do go to the top of the tower while there for the most incredible view), you must book or you’ll queue forever. Of course, order the xiaolongbao and plenty of them, but also order prawn dumplings in spicy sauce, crunchy cucumber salad, fried rice with truffle sliced across it at the table, and save room for dark chocolate dumplings.

Where bubble tea began

Taiwanese teahouse Chun Shui Tang claims to have invented bubble tea (aka boba, pearl milk tea) when some clever person added tapioca pearls to iced milk tea in its Taichung store in 1987. Today it boasts branches all over the island; visit for classic pearl milk tea, made with only natural ingredients and designed to be just right at “full sweet” (a level which might shatter your teeth at some places). As was the tradition with teahouses, food is also served – excellent salty and spicy snacks like spicy tofu, kung fu noodles and spicy chicken feet.

...and where proper tea flourishes

Speaking of tea, Taiwan produces it: oolong, green, white and black. A 40-minute drive out of central Taipei in the forested hills of Xizhi, the Shi-Yang is a tranquil retreat, an architecturally designed teahouse and restaurant. We began with a hyper-seasonal degustation of ten beautifully presented small dishes, then climbed the stairs to be welcomed into a tea ceremony with cha shui (tea master) Ms Chen.

[TITLE]India’s e-commerce growth continues to outpace global market: Elara Capital:
[TEXT]
India’s e-commerce continued to outperform global markets in the September quarter, according to analysis by Elara Capital. It noted that while US online sales grew by about 5-6 per cent year-on-year while Indian online sales continued to grow double-digit.

Karan Taurani, Executive Vice-President, Elara Capital noted in a sector update report, “India’s digital commerce flywheel continues to outperform global markets, with e-commerce and quick commerce growing faster than in the US. While US online sales rose ~5-6 per cent YoY, India continues in double digits with robust trajectory fuelled by quick commerce channel driving user expansion and regional penetration.

He added that advertising is also shifting in India to digital mediums as brands chase high-ROI performance channels, directly benefiting ad-tech players such as Affle, with direct customer relations.

“Despite solid momentum, India’s category penetration is far below US levels, offering one of the largest multi-year growth runways globally across apparel, electronics, GM and beauty,” he added.

Taurani added that India’s e-commerce maturity curve trails the US and China by 10–12 years. “ This offers a compelling long-term growth as these mature markets growth plateaus. In the near term, India’s e-commerce expansion will be driven by the rise of quick commerce and mass-commerce,” he added.

Global e-commerce was steady in the third quarter of CY25, with US online sales being 5 per cent year-on-year with penetration at about 16-17 per cent, the report noted.

[TITLE]EXCLUSIVE: Eileen Fisher, Reformation and Everlane Join Aii to Foster Change from Ground Up:
[TEXT]
Everleenformation? Referlanefisher? Susan Scow, sustainability impact specialist at Eileen Fisher, doesn’t have a snappy portmanteau for the three-way tie-up between Everlane, Reformation and her brand, but she’s open to suggestions.

While collaboration is far from an off-piste phenomenon in fashion—think Skims x Nike, Levi’s x Barbour and Uniqlo x Marimekko, to name a few—this one is. For one thing, it isn’t a marketing grab to try and sell more clothing. For another, it takes place far further upstream in the supply chain than retailers are wont to link arms. The partnership could even supply a blueprint for a new way of working to help the industry hit its climate goals when money and resources are under strain from a turbulent and unpredictable market.

It was the Apparel Impact Institute, a San Francisco-headquartered nonprofit that seeks to identify, fund and scale proven solutions that can decarbonize apparel and footwear manufacturing, that first suggested in 2024 that the three companies tag-team on a handful of strategic suppliers they had in common, in effect co-sponsoring six emissions-reduction programs involving target-setting and low-hanging-fruit tweaks like automating shut-offs to conserve energy and insulating hot water pipes and steam valves.

The idea, Scow said, was to reduce initiative fatigue, both for the suppliers and the brands wrestling with a burgeoning number of regulatory and reporting requirements, not to mention mounting public scrutiny over what they’re doing to combat global warming. Factories are regularly inundated with buyer requests to make their processes more energy efficient by changing light bulbs, upgrading outdated machinery or installing solar panels, all of which come with a hefty initial monetary outlay. By pooling together their leverage and access to capital, and applying them in a streamlined manner, the brands hoped to alleviate some of those burdens in a way they hadn’t been able to before.

“If we were not collaborating with other brands, we would not be able to access these deeper tiers of the supply chain and make the business case for investing in their decarbonization,” she said. “Without this, I’m not even sure how much we’d be able to engage with Tiers 2 and 3.”

With Foshan Chicley Textile Co., a dyeing and finishing facility that works with mostly cotton, linen and man-made cellulosic fabrics at the heart of the Pearl River Delta in southern China, Eileen Fisher, Everlane, Reformation have agreed to go a step further, by co-funding deeper decarbonization interventions with technical guidance from Aii and its partners, including Reset Carbon, a Hong Kong-based consultancy, and BluWin, a “high-impact” carbon solutions provider from the United Kingdom.

“I think that this is a really novel approach, not just to co-nominate these facilities in the first place, like in the in the assessment and the build-up of what the potential is, but taking this next step of coming together to co-invest in the real piece that’s very capital intensive,” said Katina Boutis, senior director of sustainability at sourcing at Everlane. “This is the way that we can actually have really meaningful, tangible, long-term changes. And we’ve certainly heard from suppliers about how tough the industry, especially right now. It takes a lot to get funding mechanisms at a supplier level to be able to transform or make this type of capital improvement.”

That fashion has fewer than five years to reach its Science Based Targets, coupled with ever-contracting budgets due to the continuing volatility of the geoeconomic landscape, drove a high sense of urgency to put the industry’s talk about collective action into practice, said Andrés Bragagnini, Aii’s senior manager of strategic management.

He didn’t have to look very far, however, to find a group of brands that shared the same abhorrence of green window dressing: Eileen Fisher has committed to reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 100 percent and its Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent by the end of the year; Everlane plans to lower its emission per product by 2030; and Reformation wants to be climate positive by 2025, removing more carbon from the atmosphere than it generates, and fully circular by 2030.

“We were completely flexible to how the brands wanted to approach this from a funding and engagement perspective,” he said. “Once we had a list of factories, we agreed on budgets, and then they provided the outreach to the facility, the buy-in, the commitment to the facility, and then everything is handed over to our programs team to enroll engineers, measure capacity and start the program calendar from assessing all the way to building the deliverables.”

If Scope 3 is where the overwhelming majority of a retailer’s emissions lie, it’s the material processing phase, or Tier 2, of its supply chain that remains the highest source of pollution at 55 percent of total greenhouse gases because of the tremendous energy and chemistry needed to transform fiber into a yarn or a finished fabric, according to Aii. This is followed by raw material extraction (Tier 4) at 21 percent, raw material processing (Tier 3) at 15 percent and finished goods assembly (Tier 1) at 9 percent.

But a brand’s influence, which is strongest at the cutting-and-sewing, or Tier 1, phase, waters down the further up the supply chain it goes. At wet-processing facilities, for instance, brands have no real ownership or influence aside from a volume-driven perspective.

“Before, we were only using the leverage and relationships that Reformation had as an individual brand,” said Carrie Freiman Parry, the It Girl label’s senior director of sustainability. “Now, we’re able to credibly say, ‘Hey, it’s not only Reformation that is asking for this,’ and make a real case for why it’s needed at an industry level.”

For Victor Li, general manager at Foshan Chicley Textile Co., engaging with three brands at the same time is new territory. The three brands have slightly different emphases in their decarbonization strategies—he described Eileen Fisher with a laugh as being “extreme sustainable”—which makes it more time-consuming to arrive at a consensus. Having a single set of deliverables in this pre-competitive space, however, makes things easier to manage.

“If everyone’s asking for their own decarbonization project, I’ll work myself to death,” he said. “Some brands may want to do certain things first; others may want to do a little bit later.”

This “coming together” also places suppliers in the center, making them more likely to acquiesce to a decarbonization roadmap, Bragagnini said. Having key buyers align on their sustainability approaches, fundraising and engagement, he said, has been a “huge one” that gets suppliers to buy in quicker than when presented with proposals from individual brands.

“There’s been a lot of fill in this questionnaire, fill in this other digital assessment, fill in this other tool,” he said. “So this has helped reduce that data fatigue and move at an accelerated pace.”

Staying clear of anti-trust concerns by setting up certain boundaries has been easy, as far as Scow is concerned. Nobody divulges what percentage of their volume a supplier might encompass, saying instead whether a factory is strategic for them or not. Everyone in the sustainability teams also has a degree of separation from the product development and design departments, which helps them sidestep potentially sensitive IP, such as products or fabrications. Perhaps one of the biggest hurdles? “Scheduling, literally,” she said. “It’s so hard; we all manage so many different things.”

“On the flip side, it helps to have someone pick up the slack,” Scow added. “If I’m overwhelmed and exhausted and working on something completely over here in this other corner of my work, especially related to human rights, then the ladies from Reformation and Everlane often step in and say, ‘Hey, we dropped the ball collectively. Let’s get something on the calendar.’”

Parry said that broader industry challenges, such as supply chain and sourcing needs, along with team bandwidth, are all things they have to navigate. Identifying potential future opportunities and partners, too, is something that requires effort because not everyone is a Reformation or an Eileen Fisher or an Everlane. By allowing engagement to be brand-led, Aii is also free to do what it’s good at—technical implementation—rather than spending time “working with each brand in a silo and acting as a go-between,” she said.

“We’d love to invite more brands to participate; at some point, we’ll exhaust our list of shared suppliers,” Parry said. “We’ll need more brands to join the collaboration so that we can continue these streamlined decarbonization projects across different supply chains.”

And it’s not only the three brands that will benefit. All the retailers who buy from the suppliers their collaboration covers will get a boost as well. It may sound counterintuitive to help out a rival at your own cost, but finding opportunities to create much wider social and environmental impacts “fortifies and strengthens our industry,” particularly during lean times, Boutis said.

“We’ll be able to quantify within our own product carbon footprints, but it will also be a much more meaningful ripple effect across the rest of the industry,” she said. “I keep reminding myself and anybody that I talk to about this that we all work in a shared supply chain in one way or another, and I think that is what’s driving this work—and what’s most important. So hopefully this is a highly replicable thing, and if we can do it, I think anyone can do it.”
