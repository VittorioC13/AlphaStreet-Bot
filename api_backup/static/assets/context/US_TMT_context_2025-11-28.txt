[TITLE]Nvidia’s Q3 earnings call says the AI boom is the future. Here’s how it could reshape your money, job and life:
[TEXT]
Nvidia’s Q3 fiscal 2026 earnings didn’t just mark another monster quarter, they marked a turning point. The company used its earnings call to make something very clear: the AI surge isn’t slowing, and it isn’t a hype-fueled bubble. It’s the start of a multi-year infrastructure build-out that could reshape the global economy.

Revenue hit $57 billion, up 62% year over year, and a record sequential revenue growth of $10 billion. Nvidia’s newest AI platforms is so strong that CFO Colette Kress said, “Demand for AI infrastructure continues to exceed our expectations” (1). Behind the numbers, the company outlined a future where AI hardware is becoming as essential as roads, utilities and cloud computing.

CEO Jensen Huang went even further, saying the shift from generative AI to “agentic” and physical AI will be “revolutionary,” powering new industries, new business models and entirely new kinds of applications. Nvidia now sees more than $500 billion in visibility for its next-generation GPUs through 2026, not just from Big Tech, but from governments, enterprises and AI factories around the world.

For Americans trying to understand what all this means, Nvidia’s message lands with real implications. If the company is right, AI will quietly run the systems that touch your job, your money and your daily routines — not years from now, but starting now.

AI boom, not a bubble

To Nvidia, the AI boom isn’t inflating toward a burst, it’s the foundation of an AI infrastructure cycle that’s only just beginning.

CEO Jensen Huang said, “The transition to generative AI is transformational and necessary, supercharging existing applications and business models. The transition to agentic and physical AI will be revolutionary, giving rise to new applications, companies, products, and services.”

The scale is staggering. Nvidia says it now has roughly $500 billion of visibility for its Blackwell and Rubin GPU platforms through 2026, showing strong demand not just from cloud giants but also from broader enterprise projects (2). Basically, the company is laying the foundation for AI infrastructure as essential as roads or power grids.

It’s not just about tech companies getting richer. AI is quietly running behind the scenes in medicine, banking, transportation, and retail, automating workflows and making decisions (3). Nvidia sees a future where intelligent systems are woven into entire industries.

[TITLE]TPG Telecom says disaster roaming deal with Telstra and Optus is close:
[TEXT]
TPG Telecom has told the parliamentary triple zero inquiry into a fatal emergency call service outage last month that it is close to finalising an agreement with its two main rivals for temporary disaster roaming.

Both TPG Telecom and Telstra revealed that they have tested the technology which could boost efforts to ensure that individuals in defined service outage areas can roam onto other networks for limited periods of time in an emergency.

“Mutual assistance arrangements are being advanced, and TPG Telecom is participating in industry discussions to finalise a memorandum of understanding with Telstra and Optus,” TPG Telecom wrote in its submission.

The two carriers also revealed some detail of their efforts to test temporary disaster roaming in their submissions to the inquiry, only made public for the first time earlier today.

TPG Telecom said it is progressingtemporary disaster roaming with testing in production environments scheduled to go ahead “shortly”.

Similarly, Telstra said technical simulations of temporary disaster roaming carried out in February last year had shown that it was feasible.

However, while the two carriers were in harmony on the potential benefits of temporary disaster roaming, Telstra told the committee that challenges for it remained.

“These include ensuring any surviving network is not overloaded from an influx of traffic causing it to fail, which would be an even worse outcome for the impacted community,” it told the committee.

Industry cooperation around the technology also remained a potential obstacle, Telstra said.

“Importantly, temporary disaster roaming will only work if there is participation by all of Australia’s MNOs [mobile network operators] and appropriate support from government and emergency service stakeholders," Telstra said.

"We continue to engage with them on these matters.”

Satellite’s role

Telstra also flagged the possibility of a bigger role for satellite communications to replacing terrestrial mobile services in emergency call service provision.

“We are cognisant that satellite to mobile services will, in the near future, also improve the ability for customers to stay connected using their mobile devices even when the terrestrial network goes down,” it said.

In particular it, said low earth orbit (LEO) satellite to mobile (STM) services were still in a nascent phase but promised “an exciting future of ubiquitous outdoor mobile connectivity”.

“We note that it is not currently possible to send an SMS to triple zero, and we would welcome the opportunity to continue working with the Government to develop this capability,” Telstra said.

However, in the same breath, the carrier warned that satellite to mobile emergency calling would depend on carrier access to spectrum and satellite and handset technology advances.

Under the current regulations, it said, satellite to mobile could not be introduced without emergency service capability being included in the technology.

“The Telecommunications (Emergency Call Services) Determination 2025 requires that any carrier offering a public mobile telephone service must include capability to access the emergency call service," Telstra said.

“Thus, according to legislation, calls to triple zero will be made available when satellite to mobile voice is introduced.

"Or, to put it another way, satellite to mobile voice will not be introduced without the ability to call triple zero, because doing so would be in breach of carrier obligations."

[TITLE]Comcast to pay $1.5M fine for vendor breach affecting 270K customers:
[TEXT]
Comcast will pay a $1.5 million fine to settle a Federal Communications Commission investigation into a February 2024 vendor data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 275,000 customers.

The breach occurred in February 2024, when attackers hacked into the systems of Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collector Comcast had stopped using two years earlier.

The FCBS data breach was initially believed to have affected 1.9 million people in total, but the tally was raised to 3.2 million in June and, finally, to 4.2 million in July.

FBCS, which filed for bankruptcy before revealing a data breach in August 2024, notified Comcast on July 15 (five months after the attack) that customer data had been compromised, affecting 273,703 Comcast customers. Previously, it had assured Comcast in March that the breach did not affect any of its customers.

The threat actors stole personal and financial information between February 14 and February 26, including the names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and Comcast account numbers of affected current and former customers. Affected customers had used Comcast's Xfinity-branded internet, television, streaming, VoIP, and home security services.

Under the consent decree announced by the FCC on Monday, Comcast has also agreed to implement a compliance plan that includes enhanced vendor oversight to protect data and ensure customer privacy, ensuring its vendors properly dispose of customer information they no longer need for business purposes, as required by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984.

The telecommunications giant must also appoint a compliance officer, conduct risk assessments of vendors handling customer data every two years, file compliance reports with the FCC every six months over the next three years, and report any material violations within 30 days of discovery.

However, Comcast said in a statement to Reuters that it "was not responsible for and has not conceded any wrongdoing in connection with this incident," noting that its network wasn't breached and that FBCS was contractually required to comply with security requirements.

A Comcast spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer.

Comcast is an American mass media, telecommunications, and entertainment multinational company, and the fourth-largest telecom firm in the world by revenue, after AT&T, Verizon, and China Mobile.

It also has over 182,000 employees, hundreds of millions of customers worldwide, and reported revenues of $123.7 billion in 2024.

[TITLE]Naoris Ventures Outlines Cross-Sectoral Mission to Drive Real-World Deployment of Post-Quantum Technology:
[TEXT]
Porto, Portugal / Wilmington, DE , Nov. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Naoris Ventures , the acceleration venture of Naoris Protocol , the first in production quantum-resistant blockchain and cybersecurity mesh architecture, has unveiled its roadmap to accelerate real-world deployment of post-quantum technology in high-impact sectors including robotics, smart cities, energy, finance, defense, and AI.

The European Commission and EU Member States recently released a coordinated roadmap to transition the bloc’s digital infrastructure to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), recognizing the threat quantum computers pose to existing encryption. The plan sets a unified timeline: all Member States must begin national PQC strategies and initial migration steps by 2026; critical infrastructure and other high-risk sectors must adopt quantum-resistant encryption by 2030; and, by 2035, the PQC transition should be completed for all systems that can feasibly be upgraded.

Against this backdrop, Naoris Ventures is actively investing in, building with, and integrating alongside companies creating secure, resilient, and post-quantum-ready solutions across these critical industries.

Across industries, the practice of Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) has quietly become one of the most pervasive cybersecurity threats of the decade. Malicious actors are systematically collecting and storing encrypted data today, from sensitive financial transactions to patient health records, personal identifiers, and corporate communications, with the intent of decrypting it once quantum computing becomes commercially viable. This threat is particularly acute in data-rich sectors such as telecommunications, finance, and healthcare, where vast volumes of encrypted information are routinely transmitted and archived. Even if this data is currently protected by conventional cryptography, once quantum computers achieve sufficient processing power, the encryption algorithms underpinning today’s digital world could be rendered obsolete, exposing decades of stored data to retroactive exploitation.

Naoris Ventures recognizes that this looming vulnerability demands proactive innovation rather than reactive defense. By leveraging decentralized, quantum-resistant encryption architectures, Naoris can neutralize the Harvest Now, Decrypt Later threat by ensuring that even data harvested today remains secure in a post-quantum world. This not only safeguards sensitive assets like financial data, patient records, and personal communications but also establishes a resilient digital foundation for enterprises navigating the quantum era.

Last month Naoris Protocol was cited in a research submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the reference model for quantum-resistant blockchain infrastructure in its Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework (PQFIF). Within this framework, Naoris Protocol is recognized as a proven, evidence-based implementation model for industry-wide adoption.

Buoyed by Naoris Protocol’s landmark SEC citing, Naoris Ventures will accelerate initiatives that strengthen resilience, trust, and efficiency in an increasingly automated and interconnected world, with a view to partnering with visionary founders building solutions that secure the foundations of the next technological era.

Founders joining the Naoris Ventures ecosystem will benefit from access to the protocol’s deep research and engineering capabilities, advanced cybersecurity knowledge, and post-quantum infrastructure. Combined, these elements form a secure foundation for innovation to grow without sacrificing integrity. In the weeks ahead, Naoris Ventures will be unveiling new partnerships, co-developed proof-of-concepts, and initiatives aimed at strengthening resilience across high-impact industries.

“Naoris Ventures has a clear mandate to be the capital and coordination layer of a new global standard for digital trust,” said Regan Melin, Managing Partner of Naoris Ventures. “Today we are setting out our ambitious roadmap to scale secure and intelligent systems across critical industries such as robotics, smart cities, energy, finance, defense, and AI systems. We are just getting started”

Since launching its testnet in January, Naoris Protocol has recorded significant growth, with over 104 million post-quantum transactions processed, over 3.3 million wallets onboarded, over 1M security nodes and over 600 million cyber threats mitigated as well as 31 active projects under development across sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, defense, and IoT.
