[TITLE]National Oil Companies Quietly Set The Pace For The Next Decade:
[TEXT]
The prevailing structural theme right now is that national oil companies (NOCs), in some cases and across some segments, are moving faster than the majors, outspending them, beating them in locking up supply chains, and building cash cows faster for the future. You can see it directly in upstream spending trends highlighted by the IEA Oil 2025 report, and the money is shifting this way because the NOCs have political backing, lower lifting costs, and much clearer mandates than the big listed companies.

Wood Mackenzie has warned that tighter capital conditions are forcing oil and gas companies to become more selective in business development. Neivan Boroujerdi has said this will require a more nimble and creative approach as budgets tighten. In practice, that environment favors national oil companies with the balance sheets and mandates to secure gas, chemicals, and integrated assets early, rather than defer decisions. This is no longer hypothetical. Capital is already moving in that direction.

Similarly, OPEC’s latest medium-term outlook assumes that most incremental supply growth will come from countries with state-backed producers and low-cost reserves, suggesting we will be relying on NOCs for more long-cycle investment through the decade. Rystad Energy’s recent upstream and LNG analysis shows that the majority of newly sanctioned long-life projects are either led by NOCs or depend on them as anchor partners, while IOC capital remains concentrated in shorter-cycle or brownfield work. The IEA has also been explicit that future supply security hinges on investment decisions by national producers willing to commit capital beyond typical shareholder-return horizons.

Combined, these views indicate that capacity growth and control over future supply are increasingly being set by national companies rather than listed majors.

Asia: Adding Gas, Chemicals and Transition Materials

Asia’s NOCs are not easing off hydrocarbons, but they’re tightening their grip on those parts of the supply chain that will matter most over the next decade: gas, chemicals, metals and trading. PetroChina is a case in point: It has been pulling more capital toward downstream and gas while upgrading refineries for higher-margin products, as reported by Caixin.

The LNG side of things tells a similar story. PetroChina has been layering long-term supply deals into the 2030s, according to China Daily, and then diversifying away from spot exposure with new procurement corridors.

And while Western outlets fixate on earnings, Asian media have been quicker to catch the shift into transition materials. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) notes that PetroChina wants exposure to the upstream of electrification just as much as it wants downstream oil and gas. It’s not really a transition as much as it is a hedge. They’re going for whatever powers Asian industry next.

China’s Sinopec is doing something similar, but the strategy is chemicals-heavy. As fuel demand flattens, Sinopec is putting more capital into petrochemicals, hydrogen, and CCUS. It’s also doubling down on long-term LNG to feed industrial boilers and heavy manufacturing that fall under its new policy mandates. The bigger refining margins in 2025 gave them the power to do this, according to SCMP.

CNOOC, as an outlier, is staying the course, focusing on upstream and LNG, but looking to scale both. Offshore output is rising again with new South China Sea projects being added on, and the company is buying into LNG projects up the chain rather than staying a pure buyer. The goal is straightforward: control more of the gas it needs for its power and industrial clients rather than relying on the spot market.

Petronas is expanding its LNG position and lining up more supply from projects in the Atlantic and Indian basins. At home, it is spending on gas, CCS, hydrogen and midstream work that supports the domestic power system.

India’s ONGC is adding to its overseas portfolio and increasing its access to gas. The Economic Times reports that ONGC Videsh has raised its spending outside India, and state buyers are now coordinating long term LNG procurement.

Across the region, NOCs are concentrating on the areas that support their revenue base: gas supply, refining output, chemicals and firm access to transport routes. They are securing these positions now while the opportunity is still visible.

Middle East / Gulf: Expanding Capacity and Integration

Gulf NOCs are expanding low-cost supply and increasing their integration across refining, petrochemicals and LNG.

Middle Eastern NOCs continue to take a larger share of global upstream spending, according to the IEA’s 2025 investment report. Global upstream totals are largely flat, but the region’s state producers are still increasing outlays. Most of this capital is going into long-life capacity and integrated projects rather than short-cycle additions, consistent with their role as the lowest-cost suppliers in the system.

ADNOC’s investment arm XRG has outlined the largest expansion plan in the region. It is targeting 20 to 25 million tonnes a year of gas and LNG capacity by 2035 and is adding assets in North American gas to support that target. Reuters reporting also shows ADNOC is moving its existing U.S. holdings into XRG and positioning the unit to lead further international gas and LNG deals, including in North America.

What we know for certain: ADNOC wants a larger operational and financial position in North American gas.

QatarEnergy is expanding LNG output through the North Field program and using longer-term contracts to secure demand in Europe and Asia. Based on public statements from the energy minister, Qatar expects tighter LNG balances later in the decade.

Finally, Saudi Aramco, the NOC that gets the most headline attention, is tying together upstream, downstream, gas and “new energies” into one roaring machine. Recent agreements in the United States on LNG, technology and services show Aramco placing capital directly inside key consuming markets.

The overriding Gulf strategy? Outspend everyone, integrate everything, and get as close to the customer as possible.

Latin America: Holding Output and Preserving Cash

Latin America’s state producers are trying to hold production steady while managing tight budgets and a very mixed bag of political situations.

Petrobras has more room than the others. The Brazilian NOC’s 2026 to 2030 plan shows lower headline capital spending, but the company still intends to grow pre-salt output and keep most of its money in projects that are already under way. Company filings confirm

[TITLE]Wall Street closes near record highs; precious metals rise:
[TEXT]
Dec ‌26 : Major U.S. stock indexes closed near record peaks on Friday, little changed from the start of a muted post-Christmas trading session, while expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and safe haven appeal pushed precious metals prices to all-time highs.

Public holidays kept markets closed in Australia, Hong Kong and most of Europe, but the bourses that were open pushed towards ending the year in positive territory, with Asian stocks rising to multi-week highs in their trading session earlier.

The benchmark S&P 500, ended 0.03 per cent lower than the open in New York, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.04 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.09 per cent. The small dips snapped a three-session rally but left all three higher on the week and still set ‌for double-digit yearly percentage gains.

Megacap tech companies have driven the S&P 500 higher in 2025, and investors have ‌been branching out to cyclical sectors including financials and materials, broadening the upswing and leaving the main U.S. indexes set for a third straight year of gains.

Data suggesting the U.S. economy is resilient, paired with the possibility that a new central bank chair to replace Jerome Powell could look to cut rates next year, is supporting markets. Recent pressure on AI stocks stemming from concerns over high valuations and profit-sapping capital expenditures has also lessened.

Traders watched for a "Santa Claus rally" which is declared if the S&P 500 advances through the last five trading days of the current year and the first two in January. This would be considered a good omen for stocks in 2026 ‍after a volatile year.

Geopolitical tensions enhanced the safe-haven appeal of precious metals the day after the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria. Silver hit an all-time high of $77.4 per ounce, on a 167 per cent year-to-date surge, supported by supply deficits and the metal's designation as a U.S. critical mineral.

A weaker dollar further burnished dollar-denominated gold's appeal for overseas investors, helping to send the metal to a record $4,549 per ounce. The gold price eased slightly in later trading but stayed 1.08 per cent higher.

Soojin Kim, commodities analyst at ​MUFG, said in a note the rally could continue, supported ‌by "major banks forecasting further gains into 2026, the strength of physical demand and persistent geopolitical and monetary uncertainties".

Oil prices settled more than 2 per cent lower, dragged down by the prospect of a global supply glut and possible progress on a Ukraine peace deal.

DOLLAR'S DECEMBER BLUES

Investors are preparing for 2026 focused ​on when the U.S. Federal Reserve might cut rates and by how much. Traders are pricing in at least two cuts over the year, but they do not expect the ⁠Fed to move before June.

The central bank has projected one more cut ‌next year but divisions among decision makers has left investors on edge about the policy outlook.

Markets are also waiting for President Donald Trump to nominate a Fed ​chair to replace Powell, whose term ends in May. Any signal of what Trump will decide could sway markets in the coming week.

The U.S. dollar has been under pressure as a result, pushing the euro, sterling and the Swiss franc to highs. The dollar index, which measures ‍the U.S. currency against six rivals, rose 0.08 per cent to 98.03 on Friday.

The Japanese yen softened against the dollar as investors remained on watch for potential intervention to shore up ⁠the currency. Analysts say year-end trading, when volumes are thin, provides an opportunity for authorities to take action.

The yen has weakened despite the Bank of Japan delivering a well-telegraphed interest rate hike last week. ​Data on Friday showed that core consumer ‌inflation in Japan's capital slowed in December but stayed above the central bank's 2 per cent target, bolstering the case for further rate hikes.

[TITLE]MEDIROM Partners with World:
[TEXT]
TOKYO, Dec. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MEDIROM Healthcare Technologies Inc. (Headquarters:Minato-ku, Tokyo; CEO: Kouji Eguchi; NASDAQ: MRM, MEDIROM or the “Company”), a diversified healthcare company, is collaborating with World Foundation and Tools for Humanity to deploy Proof of Human technologies such as World ID throughout Japan. The World project was co-created by Sam Altman and Alex Blania.

In preparation for the full-scale rollout of the World project in Japan, MEDIROM has entered into a Master Service Agreement (“MSA”) with Tools for Humanity (“TFH”) and World Foundation (“WF”). Under the MSA, the MEDIROM Group will be responsible for the operation of “Proof of Human” verification locations in Japan. This initiative is expected to contribute to MEDIROM’s revenue through operation fees and related services over time. Leveraging MEDIROM’s nationwide network of approximately 300 physical locations and operational expertise, the collaboration enables rapid and trusted deployment of Proof of Human technology at scale. To support this effort, MEDIROM will newly establish a dedicated special task force, the “MEDIROM World Proof of Human Task Force,” and will strengthen its organizational structure to promote the nationwide rollout of Proof of Human technology powered by World.

■ Background and Purpose of the Collaboration

In recent years, advances in generative AI have made it extremely difficult to distinguish between “humans” and “AI” online, creating a global challenge to establish trust online. To address this challenge, Sam Altman and Alex Blania co-created World. World aims to provide a mechanism, utilizing blockchain technology, that allows anyone worldwide to safely and fairly prove they are human (“Proof of Human”) without revealing their identity.

MEDIROM shares this vision and established a special task force, the “MEDIROM World Proof of Human Task Force.”

The Company will begin full-scale collaboration in Japan with TFH and WF to bring the World Proof of Human verification technology to people throughout Japan. MEDIROM will drive access across diverse fields beyond its existing footprint of relaxation and wellness retail locations. The Company expects such expansion to contribute to a future where everyone can participate in the digital society with confidence through the social implementation of “Proof of Human.”

■ Key Initiatives

・Availability of Orbs, an advanced camera deploying privacy-preserving technologies to verify humanness, in approximately 300 Re.Ra.Ku Group locations

・Establishment and operation of flagship locations offering Proof of Human verification services

・Deployment of Proof of Human verification pop-up stores in commercial facilities and public spaces

◼︎Comment from Koji Eguchi, President and CEO of MEDIROM

We are excited to launch this collaboration in Japan with Tools for Humanity and World Foundation. As generative AI rapidly permeates society, we firmly believe that this new social infrastructure for “proving one's humanness” will become an indispensable foundation for the future digital society.

Through this collaboration, we seek to broaden our reach with new approaches, such as establishing flagship locations and pop-up stores, to build an authentication environment that more people can use with confidence. We intend not only to grow this initiative into a new revenue model but also to contribute to building trust within Japan's digital society, further accelerating our evolution as a health tech company.

■ Comment from Tomoe Makino, General Manager of Japan at Tools For Humanity

“Japan has long been a global leader in adopting technology that improves everyday life, and we believe Proof of Human will become essential digital infrastructure in the age of AI,” said Tomoe Makino, General Manager of Tools for Humanity Japan. “By collaborating with MEDIROM, which has deep roots in communities across the country, we can bring World ID to people in trusted, familiar spaces and support a future where everyone can participate in the digital society with greater confidence.”

[TITLE]Hawaiʻi Farmers Are Fighting To Keep Their Soil From Flushing Out To Sea:
[TEXT]
From kalo to cacao, farmers are adapting to effects of a changing climate by fusing traditional Hawaiian practices with new, regenerative agricultural techniques to save soils, streams and reefs.

Hawaii Grown Hawaiʻi Farmers Are Fighting To Keep Their Soil From Flushing Out To Sea From kalo to cacao, farmers are adapting to effects of a changing climate by fusing traditional Hawaiian practices with new, regenerative agricultural techniques to save soils, streams and reefs.

Kaiaka Bay, located on the North Shore of Oʻahu, turns brown after rains wash the soil into the sea earlier this month. (Nathan Eagle/Civil Beat/2025)

On the Front Lines of Climate Change Editor’s Note: Here in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, signs that climate change has arrived are all around us. We see it in our disappearing beaches, the flooding of our homes, the ever-looming menace of wildfire. For us, climate change is more than a threat on the horizon and far bigger than an inconvenience. And we share this truth with our island neighbors across the Pacific, the region known as Oceania that stretches from Hawaiʻi to New Zealand. In this ongoing series, we tell the stories of people living on the front lines of climate change.

Young cacao trees stand in an unlikely spot on the northeastern slopes of the Waiʻanae Range, growing on a windswept point overlooking O‘ahu’s North Shore.

“Our soil, in the summer, becomes a powdery flour,” says Max Breen of Kamananui Cacao Farm. “A lot of runoff, a lot of blowing. … Challenging to plant a wind-sensitive crop up here.”

Breen is adapting. He planted his chocolate-bearing trees under a runway of black matting and mulch, interspersed with native and locally important saplings — gandules or pigeon peas, ‘a‘ali‘i and ‘ilie‘e. Those shrubs and plants will grow faster and protect the sensitive cacao from the harsh sun and ruthless coastal winds. The mulch and matting will help hold the soil in place against the wind and rain.

Kamananui Cacao Orchards’ Max Breen stands in his newly planted patch of land on Oʻahu’s North Shore, a project he is confident will begin to yield more award-winning cacao. The cacao trees are interplanted with other species, which protect the fragile juveniles in the earlier stages of growth against wind and rain. (Kevin Fujii/Civil Beat/2025)

Soil is paramount to crop health but especially important in historically productive areas such as central and northern Oʻahu. Farmers there were already contending with the repercussions of decades of plantation agriculture, which wrought almost irreparable damage on once-deep topsoils. Now, they’re trying to hold onto the light topsoil that’s left.

Climate change is only making that harder. The region is experiencing more intense periods of drought, which dries out the soil, followed by more intense periods of rain, which flushes it off the farm and muddies the coastal waters miles below.

Without soil on the land, farming is crippled. With soil in the water, sea life suffocates.

Farmers like Breen understand their soil was built over millions of years and is difficult to replace, and they recognize their farms have an influence on the entire watershed’s health — what happens in the mountains affects the reefs below. For this part of Oʻahu, that means Kaiaka Bay, which is showing elevated levels of sediments and contaminants across most metrics, including possible chemical pollutants.

[TITLE]Wild hogs wreak economic havoc for Mississippi agriculture:

John Parker Campbell describes the wild pigs on his family farm as “a constant headache.”

Hogs will eat up corn and peanuts that have just been planted, damaging acres of crops in a night. Some years the hog damage is worse than others but it has been a problem since his father started farming in Copiah County in the 1990s.

In Mississippi, wild hogs create around $60 million to $80 million in damage every year, including eating crops and damaging property. Farmers, researchers, the state and the federal government are trying to fight the infestation, but it’s a never-ending battle for landowners.

“Farmers have enough stress as it is. They don’t need this modern-day locust,” said Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson

Campbell and his father use traps and have an electric fence around their property to keep the hogs out. The fence has been effective, although the feral pigs have broken through parts of it before. However, it was expensive to initially put up and costs thousands of dollars each year to maintain.

“You have to know that they’re out there,” said Campbell. “We keep an eye on our fields but you can get busy and then go a couple days without looking and they can just do a tremendous amount of damage.”

The wild hog population has grown over the past 40 years, not just in Mississippi, but across the United States. In the 1980s they lived in 17 states, now they can be found in 35. Previously, it was thought they cost the U.S. $2 billion a year but new research indicates that number is actually over $3 billion.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on

Wild pigs are not native to the United States. The first population was escaped livestock brought to the Americas by European settlers. Later, Eurasian boars were imported for hunting and joined the wild hog population. With no natural predators and plenty of land, water and food, their numbers have grown.

While some owners successfully deterred pigs by using electric fences, the only way to manage the larger population is by killing the hogs.

Mississippi was the first state to launch a statewide wild hog-control program in 2020. The program provides education and traps to landowners.

The program operates with a budget of $183,000 a year which mainly goes to staff salaries and maintenance of smart traps and cameras. The program has four application cycles with each cycle receiving between 35 and 40 applications.

There are a number of ways to reduce the pig population, including using traps, aerial gunning and poison. While wild hogs are considered nuisance animals and can be hunted year round, hunting is relatively ineffective at controlling the larger population.

Aerial gunning in Mississippi is only used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It also has limited use as the pigs can easily run into the trees for cover, whereas in places like Texas, there is more open and flat land. While there is ongoing research into the use of poisons, including contraceptives, it’s challenging to make sure that other animals don’t eat them.

Trapping is one of the most common methods and is preferred as it requires less time and effort than other methods. A new study from Mississippi State University looked at the economic benefits of trapping.

The average landowner in the study had an estimated $20,000 in hog damages per year. It showed that reducing a local pig population can lead to less damage and $300-$4,000 in savings per pig the next year for land owners. But combating the wild hog problem is an expensive and constant battle.

The study involved intense, dedicated hog removal through Delta Wildlife, a conservation nonprofit.

Jody Acosta, Delta Wildlife’s nuisance-and invasive-species program manager, and his team set up and monitor traps around the Delta. While the team is experienced and knowledgeable, Acosta is clear that the job is not about the glory of hunting but about pest management.

Some of the trap doors will only close when a Delta Wildlife team member remotely pushes a button. So they work around the clock, often late at night, checking the live video feed of the traps. Once they successfully trap a group of pigs, a Delta Wildlife worker quickly makes their way to the trap so they can dispose of the pigs and reset the trap.

The study estimates that it would cost a land owner about $200 per pig if they outsourced every part of trapping. Strickland, one of the study’s authors, acknowledges that “it’s absolutely a big number” but says that the average landowner would likely pay less. Despite the initial sticker shock, Strickland said the study shows that pig removal results in a “positive return on investment” and that government programs are economically viable.

Long term, Strickland thinks it’s possible to reduce the wild pig population through a concerted effort and investment. He urges farmers and landowners to take wild pigs seriously even if there’s only a few on their property at the moment.

“The problem will only get worse and worse,” said Strickland.

[TITLE]Trump Taps Louisiana Governor as Special Envoy to Greenland:
[TEXT]
The Saga of Trump and Greenland continues with a new episode.

The last time I wrote about Greenland, the Danes had begun investing more money and interest in their semi-autonomous territory of Greenland. This was after the Greenlanders had voted for independent-minded leadership that also apparently rejected the advances of President Donald Trump’s team to partner more closely with our country.

However, Trump remains very interested in the Arctic island, for both American military strategy and potential natural resources. Therefore, he has named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as U.S. special envoy to Greenland. Landry will continue as governor.

“I am pleased to announce that I am appointing the GREAT Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, as the United States Special Envoy to Greenland,” Trump said through a post to his social media network Truth Social. “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” the president wrote. Landry will remain Louisiana governor while serving in his new role for Trump. “This in no way affects my role as governor of Louisiana!” he posted on the social media platform X.

This is a most intriguing appointment, as it is clear that Trump appears to be applying the Monroe Doctrine northward as well as southward.

“Russian subs would circle Greenland. The Chinese would pluck rare earths out of the Western Hemisphere. Then all of a sudden, we have the election of President Donald Trump. He comes in and says, you know what? The Monroe Doctrine is a real thing!” “We need to protect America’s interests in those countries and territories in the Western Hemisphere. And again, Europe’s just ignoring Greenland!” “We care about them. We’re the fastest security route to give them the security and the protection. It’s about an hour away from the United States. Three to four hours from the European continent.”

America’s liberals are in hysterics at this move. After all, per The New York Times, Landry is a foreign policy novice and a Trump loyalist.

In June, Mr. Landry led a state delegation to the International Paris Air Show, the world’s largest aerospace and aviation event, “to strengthen economic ties, attract new investment and showcase the state’s growing role in global industries,” according to his office. But when it comes to dealing with the Danish government, it’s hard to find anything on Mr. Landry’s résumé that relates to the matter. Mr. Trump, though, has a history of tapping people close to him to manage priorities in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and a handful of other issues.

🚨🇺🇸🇬🇱 TRUMP NAMES A GREENLAND ENVOY – AND IT’S A SITTING U.S. GOVERNOR This just got real. Trump has appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, the Danish-controlled Arctic island Trump has openly said the U.S. will “get.” Not a diplomat. Not a career… pic.twitter.com/db88lvV7ud — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 22, 2025

The appointment is fascinating, indicating that Trump has not forgotten his plans to develop closer ties with Greenland. Appointing a Special Envoy appears to be laying the groundwork for a more robust American presence on the island.

Special envoys are agents appointed as the personal representative of the president or the secretary of state, and are often appointed in response to congressional or public attention to a particular region or issue, according to Ballotpedia, a digital encyclopedia of American politics. Envoys are specifically made to function above the normal scope of an ambassador, serving as high-level, focused representatives for complicated subjects like regional wars or global concerns. There is no predetermined number of special envoys because they are a response to an administration’s demands, Ballotpedia said.

Back in Denmark, pearls are being clutched, and the U.S. Ambassador has been called in for a “discussion“.

“President Trump’s announcement about the appointment of a special envoy to Greenland – and in particular its statements about the purpose hereby – is completely unacceptable,” Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Monday in a Facebook post, which was translated by the social platform. “That’s why we are now convening the US ambassador to the Department of State for a discussion.” Landry was named by Trump on Sunday as his special envoy to Greenland, a territory owned by Denmark which Trump previously has sought to acquire as part of the United States.

In conclusion, unless the map of the Arctic changes significantly due to a seismic event, I suspect that the Trump administration will continue to give Greenland all the attention that it warrants…with or without Denmark’s approval.

I must admit, I am a little sorry not to have been asked to fill this role.

[TITLE]Turkey Makes Another $9 Billion Bet on Russian Nuclear Power:
[TEXT]
Turkey just took another very large, very deliberate step deeper into Russia’s energy orbit — and this time it comes with a $9 billion price tag.

Ankara says that Russia has provided $9 billion in new financing for the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, Turkey’s first-ever nuclear facility, which is being built by Russia’s state-owned Rosatom on the Mediterranean coast. According to Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar, the bulk of that money will be deployed in 2026 and 2027, with as much as $4–5 billion flowing next year alone. The plant is now expected to come online in 2026, after multiple delays.

While this may look like a straightforward infrastructure update, it’s more

Global green bond and loan issuance has reached a record $947 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

Investors have piled into climate-friendly assets this year despite policy and regulatory rollbacks in the US and Europe, as artificial intelligence drives a boom in energy infrastructure demand.

Global green bond and loan issuance has reached a record $947 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That's as stock market gauges for renewables are set for their first annual gains since 2020, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin, while shares of power-grid technology companies remain in favor.

The flows are notable in a year when US President Donald Trump backed fossil fuels and dismantled clean-energy subsidies and legislation. Europe also has rolled back some of its toughest environmental rules amid concerns

[TITLE]Abia enacts electricity law, unveils regulatory agency:
[TEXT]
The Abia State Government has enacted the Abia State Electricity Law, 2025, and established the Abia State Electricity Regulatory Authority to oversee electricity market activities within the state.

The new law, enacted pursuant to powers granted to states under the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the Electricity Act, 2023, empowers Abia to independently regulate electricity generation, transmission, distribution and trading within its territory.

Addressing journalists on Wednesday, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ASERA, Mr Emeka Onyegbule, said the authority had formally taken over regulatory oversight of the state’s electricity market following the issuance of a final transfer order by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Onyegbule said the ASERA board was inaugurated on April 30, 2025, in line with the provisions of the new law.

Onyegbule said, “The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, in the exercise of the powers conferred under the Electricity Act 2023, issued an interim Transfer Order no: NERC/2025/058 dated the 24th day of June 2025; formally transferring regulatory oversight of the Electricity Market in Abia State from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to the ASERA.

“The Interim Order elapsed after a six-month transition period, paving the way for the Final Transfer Order from the Commission that completely put the regulatory oversight of the state market under ASERA.”

He said the transition culminated in the issuance of a final transfer of regulatory authority order by NERC on December 24, 2025.

“With this transfer, all activities within the electricity value-chain, including generation, transmission, distribution and trading, fall under the direct oversight and regulation of the Authority effective from the date of the Transfer Order,” he said.

He assured licensees and stakeholders that ASERA would operate a fair, objective and transparent regulatory regime, guided strictly by the provisions of the law and its regulatory instruments.

Onyegbule said the authority would ensure compliance with licence terms and contractual obligations, while protecting consumer interests and promoting quality service delivery.

“We will ensure that stakeholders discharge contractual obligations to one another while upholding the terms of their licenses, and customers’ voices will be heard and respected, while we will focus on quality service delivery,” he stated.

Also speaking, the Commissioner for Information, Prince Okey Kanu, said the enactment of the electricity law paved the way for the establishment of ASERA as an independent regulator of the Abia electricity market.

Kanu noted that the transfer of regulatory powers from NERC to ASERA was in line with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2023, which allows states to regulate their electricity markets.

The Commissioner for Public Utilities, Mr Ikechukwu Uwanna, said the process began on March 17, following the enactment of the electricity law, describing it as a step towards building a world-class electricity market in the state.

Uwanna said the new regulatory framework would encourage investment, protect consumers and improve efficiency in electricity service delivery across Abia State.

[TITLE]Sweden's Vattenfall Seeks State Funding for New Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Sweden’s power giant Vattenfall announced on Tuesday it is applying for state aid for an investment in small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of a plan by industrial giants to bet on new nuclear power in the country.

Last month Sweden’s biggest industrial firms signed an agreement with Vattenfall to become shareholders in the power giant’s new company, Videberg Kraft AB, which plans to build SMRs in the country.

One of Europe’s top electric utilities, Vattenfall, created Videberg Kraft AB in April this year as a separate entity to be able to apply for government support.

Now the company and the industry organization, Industrikraft, plan joint investment and collaboration enabling the development of new nuclear power in Sweden.

Industrikraft, whose members include Volvo Group, Saab, Alfa Laval, and Hitachi Energy, will become a shareholder in Videberg Kraft with a 20-percent stake.

The government has previously announced that the state also intends to become a shareholder in the new company.

The Swedish government moved to phase out nuclear power completely in 1980, but that decision was reversed by Parliament in 2010. Five years later, four aging reactors were shut down. Six of 12 reactors remain in operation in Sweden today.

The country is now betting on SMRs to expand its nuclear fleet as Stockholm seeks to further reduce emissions with low-carbon 24/7 energy.

Sweden has tweaked its renewable energy policy, which had called for 100% renewable electricity by 2040, changing the terminology to “100% fossil-free” electricity, paving the way for the construction of more nuclear power plants.

Now Videberg Kraft’s CEO Desirée Comstedt has submitted an application for financing and risk-sharing to the Swedish Government.

When an agreement between the state and Videberg Kraft has been reached, the government may initiate a formal state aid process with the European Commission, Vattenfall said.

Videberg Kraft is planning a project with either five BWRX-300 reactors from GE Vernova Hitachi or three reactors from Rolls-Royce SMR, which will provide a total nuclear power output of about 1,500 MW. There is currently an intensive evaluation process of the two remaining suppliers, and a decision on the final supplier is planned for 2026.

[TITLE]Michigan Regulators Approve State’s First Hyperscale Data Center:
[TEXT]
Despite criticism that they were acting too fast, state utility regulators last week approved DTE Energy’s proposal to supply power for Michigan’s first hyperscale data center — while tacking on a host of conditions that aim to protect ratepayers from subsidizing the facility.

The approval, made over shouts of disapproval from onlookers gathered in a Lansing conference room, drew cheers from business interests and ire from skeptics who had called for a deeper public review of the 19-year deal.

Defending the decision, Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps told the gathered crowd that after reviewing them in detail, “I would put the contracts that are in front of us today on par or better with any that have been approved in the country.”

He and other commissioners said they had concluded the deal would save ratepayers money and would not sacrifice energy reliability.

But a wave of public speakers lined up to condemn the vote, raising concerns

[TITLE]What a Russia-Ukraine peace deal could mean for Europe's gas supplies:
[TEXT]
Europe is pressing ahead with plans to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027, effectively capping Moscow's energy future in the region and leaving a bevy of stranded assets in its wake. The dual Nord Stream 1 and 2 subsea pipelines were early casualties of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the infrastructure being sabotaged in late 2022 and the latter pipeline — costing $11 billion to build and aimed at doubling cheap Russian gas flows to Germany — never being certified for use. There had been speculation that the major energy infrastructure could eventually be resurrected if, or rather when, the war between Russia and Ukraine ends and there's a peace agreement between the parties. However, talks to try to establish the grounds for a ceasefire have been moving at a snail's pace with neither side willing to cross "red lines" regarding the permanent surrender of territory, be it sovereign or occupied. Speaking with British news website UnHerd, Vance said Monday that while the U.S. is going to "try to get this thing solved," he "wouldn't say with confidence that we're going to get a peaceful resolution." Hopes of a deal have led to questions over what economic and energy links between Russia and the rest of the world could be re-established and, when it comes to Europe, whether a ceasefire could lead to a reintegration of Russian gas and the resurrection of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Such a move would be highly contentious and divisive on the continent, given Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and attempts in the region to wean itself off cheaper Russian gas.
