[TITLE]From charter to creator: Refiners, SCI explore shipyard JV with Korean giants:
[TEXT]
The Shipping Corp. of India (SCI), along with public sector oil refiners, are in talks with three large South Korean shipyards to set up a shipbuilding facility in India, three people aware of the discussions said.

Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd are part of the discussions with South Korea's HD Hyundai, Samsung Heavy Industries and Hanwha Ocean, the people said on the condition of anonymity, adding the new yard may come up in Andhra Pradesh. In September, the four state-run companies, which plan to acquire dozens of crude and gas carriers over the next decade, had decided to form a joint venture to procure such vessels.

“Along with the consideration to procure vessels produced by these shipmakers, SCI and oil companies would join a shipbuilding entity, possibly through a joint venture as equity partners and remain dedicated buyers for ships being made in India," one of the three people said, adding this would provide assured demand for the yard and make investments financially viable earlier. Depending on the size and scale of the shipyard, investment can range widely between ₹1,500 crore and ₹15,000 crore.

Currently, Indian refiners charter foreign vessels for their requirements. However, an indigenous fleet is expected to provide support during times of turmoil, like the vessel scarcity that boosted freight rates in 2022. As India is one of the largest importers of energy, both crude and natural gas, supply chain issues may lead to a major impact on the economy and energy security.

An HD Hyundai spokesperson confirmed that the company was exploring various avenues of cooperation, but nothing has been finalized yet. "We signed a memorandum of understanding with Cochin Shipyard earlier this year in the commercial vessel sector and have since expanded discussions into naval vessels as well," the spokesperson said, adding Indian officials had visited Hyundai's offices where potential future cooperation was discussed.

Queries mailed to the ministries of petroleum and shipping, the state-run companies, Samsung and Hawnha Ocean remained unanswered.

While China is the world leader in shipbuilding, commanding

In brief A Bonk ETP has begun trading on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, issued by Bitcoin Capital.

The product lets retail and institutional investors access Solana-based meme coin BONK through standard brokerage platforms.

BONK is currently the seventh-largest meme coin by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.

Solana-based meme coin Bonk (BONK) has begun trading on Switzerland's third-largest stock exchange, through a newly launched exchange traded product, adding another regulated crypto offering to Europe's expanding digital asset market.

Swiss-based crypto ETP issuer Bitcoin Capital issued the BONK ETP on SIX Swiss Exchange, allowing investors to gain exposure to the token through traditional brokerage accounts, according to an announcement shared with Decrypt.

As a subsidiary of Swiss asset-management boutique FiCAS AG, Bitcoin Capital launched the world's first actively managed Bitcoin ETP in 2020.

Switzerland's regulatory framework and market infrastructure for admitting crypto ETPs made it the “preferred venue for the launching a BONK ETP,” Marcel Niederberger, Chief Executive Officer at Bitcoin Capital & FiCAS told Decrypt.

"Europe, and specifically the SIX Swiss Exchange offers a highly developed regulatory environment with consistent supervisory practices," he said.

“The product will reach both institutional and retail investors through established broker platforms,” Niederberger said, noting that regulated ETP access tends to boost investor confidence and liquidity, with most inflows across Bitcoin Capital’s existing products still coming from institutional desks.

He anticipates “continued expansion of regulated products referencing BONK” next year, as maturing European infrastructure and rising appetite for thematic digital assets open the door to “additional ETPs and structured notes.”

BONK sits near $0.0599, up 3.5% on the day, ranking as the seventh-largest meme coin by market value per CoinGecko data.

﻿

Dogecoin leads activity

The Bonk listing follows a surge of meme coin products entering regulated markets mainly in the United States, dominated by Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market cap.

In September, the Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF became the first U.S. fund to hold DOGE, while asset manager Grayscale launched its spot GDOG product last week, generating approximately $1.4 million in first-day trading volume.

REX Shares also filed for a BONK ETF in January, alongside other meme coin products.

Meanwhile, 21Shares unveiled a 2x leveraged Dogecoin ETF on the Nasdaq last week, while Bitwise's Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, received approval from NYSE Arca on Tuesday for listing and registration.

[TITLE]“Peace Railway” pushes forward amid the Israel-Hamas war, reshaping regional trade – NaturalNews.com:
[TEXT]
“Peace Railway” pushes forward amid the Israel-Hamas war, reshaping regional trade

A major new trade route, known as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), is being developed behind the scenes, even as the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza continues. Its key component is a "Peace Railway" linking the UAE to Israel.

This corridor aims to create a modern trade pathway: Goods would ship from India to the UAE, travel by train through Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and finally reach the Israeli port of Haifa for export to Europe and the U.S.

Despite the ongoing conflict, the project is advancing quickly. Israel, fearing it could be excluded from the deal, conducted a secret meeting with the UAE to revive its role, underscoring the project's high strategic priority.

The IMEC is a direct competitor to China's Belt and Road Initiative. It is designed to be more than just a railway; it also carries energy pipelines and communication cables to solidify a new global supply chain.

The situation creates a stark contrast, where the long-term economic planning for a new trade network continues relentlessly while a devastating humanitarian crisis and conflict are happening nearby.

While the world's attention is fixed on the devastating conflict in Gaza, a monumental infrastructure project, quietly advancing behind the scenes, promises to redraw the map of global trade and solidify a new Middle Eastern alliance.

The so-called "Peace Railway," a critical land link between the United Arab Emirates and Israel, has reportedly reached an "advanced stage," even as the war rages just miles from its proposed terminus.

This railway is not a standalone endeavor but the central artery of the ambitious India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).

The envisioned route is a modern Silk Road for the 21st century: goods would travel by sea from India's Mundra Port to the UAE, then be transferred to trains. From there, the cargo would move overland through Saudi Arabia and Jordan before finally arriving at the Israeli port of Haifa, poised for export to markets in Europe and the United States. The project's momentum has not been slowed by the ongoing war.

In a secretive move that underscores its strategic importance, Israeli Transportation Minister Miri Regev led an unpublicized delegation to Abu Dhabi recently. Using the cover of the Dubai Airshow, officials worked to revive coordination on the railway. This covert mission, taking place during the height of Israel's military offensive in Gaza, reveals the relentless priority placed on this economic objective.

Israel afraid of being left out

The urgency in Tel Aviv appears to be driven by more than just ambition; it is also fueled by fear of being excluded.

BrightU.AI's Enoch AI engine explains that France and Turkey are advancing a competing proposal that would reroute the corridor north from Jordan through Syria to a Lebanese port, effectively cutting Israel out of the new trade pathway entirely. This potential snub has left Israeli officials scrambling to secure their place in a project that continues to advance without them.

According to Israeli media, while Tel Aviv froze its political coordination during the war, the UAE pressed ahead with India, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, finalizing route planning and regional agreements. The result is that Israel is now in a frantic race to regain influence in an initiative that has steadily taken shape in its absence.

Senior Emirati and Israeli rail officials have already agreed to establish a joint administration to supervise the transit, even as the political landscape smolders.

Framed as a strategic maneuver to break Israel's economic isolation and reduce its dependence on a narrow set of partners, the corridor is far more than just a railway. It is designed to host communications cables, pipelines and energy transmission lines, cementing Israel's role as a pivotal hub in a new global supply chain intended to rival China's Belt and Road Initiative.

The stark contrast between the public destruction in Gaza and the private construction of this trade network paints a troubling picture.

As humanitarian crises deepen, the relentless pursuit of the "Peace Railway" demonstrates that for the governments involved, long-term economic and strategic gains are being prioritized, quietly reshaping alliances and trade routes while a conflict wages next door.

[TITLE]JPMorgan to build 3 million-square-foot, multibillion dollar tower in London’s Canary Wharf:
[TEXT]
JPMorgan Chase will build a tower in London’s Canary Wharf financial district, unveiling plans on Thursday to invest billions of pounds on the heels of a budget that sought to boost Britain’s finances and growth.

The bank said the project would contribute 9.9 billion British pounds ($13.1 billion) over six years to the local economy — including the cost of construction — and create 7,800 jobs.

“The UK government’s priority of economic growth has been a critical factor in helping us make this decision,” JPMorgan’s Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said, after praising UK finance minister Rachel Reeves’ budget on Wednesday that spared banks from fresh taxes.

3 A rendering of JPMorgan Chase’s planned multibillion dollar tower in London’s Canary Wharf financial district. via REUTERS

Reeves said the decision was a “multibillion pound vote of confidence in the UK economy.”

The planned 3 million-square-foot building will be more than double the floorspace of Britain’s current tallest building, The Shard in London, with around 1.3 million square feet.

It would also cover more space than JPMorgan’s recently-completed 2.5 million-square-foot global headquarters on New York’s Park Avenue.

A source familiar with the project said it would cost a few billion pounds to build and designs were still being finalized, including the height.

JPMorgan’s decision to remain in Canary Wharf is a big win for the financial district, which struggled to retain tenants after the COVID-19 pandemic. The area is now enjoying a rebound as more firms, including JPMorgan, push staff to return to the office. The bank has been among the most forceful, requiring staff to return five days a week.

Reuters reported last year the bank was weighing options in London after outgrowing its existing 33-story tower in Canary Wharf, including moving to the more central City of London.

The new tower will house up to 12,000 employees, JPMorgan said.

JPMorgan said the investment was still subject to the business environment remaining positive in the UK. Britain’s tax-raising budget reduced near-term uncertainty for the economy, but has not changed JPMorgan’s expectation that UK government bond yields would rise next year, its head of European rates strategy said separately on Thursday.

3 JPMorgan Chase chief Dimon praised UK finance minister Rachel Reeves’ budget that spared banks from fresh taxes. AP

If the investment goes ahead as planned, it would be a significant post-Brexit win for London after some financial firms were forced to move thousands of roles to the European Union to serve those clients.

JPMorgan is building the tower on a site known as ‘Riverside South’ that it bought in 2008 to the west of the Canary Wharf estate on the banks of the River Thames.

It had originally planned to build a new UK HQ on the site, but shelved those plans after the global financial crisis in favor of moving into Lehman Brothers’ old office.

JPMorgan has outgrown that 1.1 million-square-foot tower, partly due to the expansion of the British arm of retail bank Chase, which competes with local lenders like Lloyds and Barclays on current accounts and credit cards.

3 The planned tower in London would cover more space than JPMorgan’s recently-completed 2.5 million-square-foot global headquarters on Park Avenue in New York. Christopher Sadowski

The new tower will be designed by Foster + Partners, the practice founded by renowned architect Norman Foster, who also designed JPMorgan’s New York HQ.

Shobi Khan, CEO of Canary Wharf Group, or CWG, said it was a “defining moment” for the district, adding 2025 was set to be its best year for leasing in over a decade.

Most of the new construction work in Canary Wharf has been residential in recent years, and the office vacancy rate for the wider Docklands area of 15% is higher than the London average of 10.4%, according to CoStar data.

JPMorgan is being advised by former CWG Chairman George Iacobescu, who Reuters reported last week was also advising Qatar’s wealth fund on how to revamp the nearby HSBC tower once that bank moves out in 2027.

The new plans also include a public park and various amenities for JPMorgan’s staff including roof terraces, wellness spaces, nursing rooms, restaurants and cafes, the bank said.

Wall Street rival Goldman Sachs also said on Thursday it would expand its Birmingham office in Britain, hiring 500 staff there to double its workforce in the city in coming years.

[TITLE]JPMorgan to build new London headquarters in Canary Wharf:
[TEXT]
JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to build a new tower in Canary Wharf for its headquarters in the UK, a multibillion-pound endorsement of London’s status as a global financial center a day after Rachel Reeves delivered a budget that largely spared banks.

The office building would be London’s largest by far at three million square feet and could host as many as 12,000 employees, according to a statement from the investment bank Thursday. The construction is expected to take six years.

The property, which will be co-developed by Canary Wharf Group, is being designed by Foster + Partners, the British architecture practice that’s also responsible for the bank’s recently opened global headquarters in New York.

“This building will represent our lasting commitment to the city, the UK” and its staff, said JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. “The UK government’s priority of economic growth has been a critical factor in helping us make this decision.”

The plans are “subject to a continuing positive business environment in the UK and the firm receiving the necessary approvals,” according to a JPMorgan statement.

JPMorgan announces plans for massive Canary Wharf headquarters while Goldman Sachs doubles Birmingham workforce day after autumn budget spares banks from tax increases

JPMorgan Chase unveiled plans Thursday to build a massive new tower in London’s Canary Wharf financial district, committing what the bank estimates will be a 9.9 billion pound contribution to the local economy over six years. The announcement arrived just one day after Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered an autumn budget that spared banks from feared tax increases.

The Wall Street giant’s new headquarters will span three million square feet, more than double the floor space of Britain’s tallest building, The Shard. The tower will house up to 12,000 JPMorgan employees and serve as the bank’s largest office across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Goldman Sachs simultaneously announced plans to double its Birmingham workforce from 500 to over 1,000 employees in coming years. The coordinated announcements underscore renewed American banking confidence in Britain’s economic prospects despite ongoing Brexit complications.

Canary Wharf scores victory after pandemic struggles

The JPMorgan commitment represents a significant win for the Canary Wharf financial district, which struggled to retain major tenants after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted office usage patterns. Recent months have brought improved leasing activity as companies increasingly demand employees return to offices rather than working remotely.

JPMorgan purchased the Riverside South development site along the River Thames in 2008, originally intending to build headquarters there before the global financial crisis intervened. The bank instead moved into Lehman Brothers’ former 33 story tower on Bank Street after that firm’s collapse.

JPMorgan has since outgrown the 1.1 million square foot facility, partly due to launching and expanding Chase, its British retail banking operation competing with domestic lenders on current accounts and credit cards. The bank ranks among the most assertive large employers requiring staff to work from offices five days weekly, intensifying pressure on existing space.

Architecture mirrors New York headquarters

Foster and Partners will design the new tower, the same architecture firm that created JPMorgan’s recently opened global headquarters in New York. The practice was founded by renowned architect Norman Foster, whose portfolio includes numerous landmark financial district buildings worldwide.

Sources familiar with the project indicated construction costs would reach several billion pounds, though final designs remain under development including exact height specifications. The massive floor space will position it among Europe’s largest towers by usable area, far exceeding Germany’s Commerzbank Tower which covers approximately 1.3 million square feet.

Construction is expected to take six years pending necessary approvals. JPMorgan indicated the investment remains subject to the business environment staying positive in the UK, adding a caveat to what otherwise represents a strong vote of confidence in Britain’s economic future.

Budget timing shapes banking decisions

Chief executive Jamie Dimon emphasized that the UK government’s economic growth priority proved a critical factor in the decision. He appeared publicly supporting Reeves’ budget in rare remarks on budget day itself, signaling JPMorgan’s approval of fiscal policy direction.

Reeves told BBC Radio that major companies choosing Britain reflects approval of budget measures announced Wednesday. She suggested the investments demonstrate that global corporations appreciate the economic framework her budget established.

Banks escaped targeted tax increases that many industry participants had feared before the budget release. Reports earlier in the week indicated Reeves instead asked banks to express commitment to the UK and the budget, apparently receiving the desired response from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.

Post-Brexit wins remain crucial

The JPMorgan tower announcement marks a significant post-Brexit victory for London’s financial sector, which has lost some appeal since Britain exited the European Union. Some financial firms moved thousands of roles to EU nations to maintain direct access serving those clients.

London based staff will eventually relocate to the new tower upon completion. JPMorgan plans to consider options for its existing Canary Wharf office while the new headquarters takes shape. The project is expected to create 7,800 jobs including construction employment.

Goldman Sachs described its Birmingham expansion as part of efforts to deepen commitment to the UK economy. The doubling of workforce in Britain’s second largest city spreads financial sector employment beyond traditional London concentration.

What Is The Role Of Iron And Steel In Clean Energy Transitions?

Steel production is highly reliant on coal, which is primarily used as a reducing agent to extract iron from iron ore and to provide the carbon content needed in steel. Over the past decade, total CO2 emissions from the iron and steel sector have risen, largely owning to increases in steel demand. The direct CO2 intensity of crude steel production has decreased slightly in the past few years, but efforts need to be accelerated to get on track with the pathway in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.

Why Is Iron and Steel Important?

Driven by population and economic growth, global demand for steel has been growing strongly in recent years and is expected to continue to increase, especially because of economic expansion in India, ASEAN countries and Africa, even as demand in China gradually declines.

Types of Iron

As previously said, pure iron isn’t really useful since it’s very soft and reactive. However, its properties are greatly enhanced when it’s alloyed with other metals and non-metals. Thus, all materials that people broadly refer to as iron are actually different types of iron-based alloys. There are several types of iron:

Pig Iron — Pig iron is iron in its basic, raw form, which is molded into blocks, otherwise known as pigs.

— Pig iron is iron in its basic, raw form, which is molded into blocks, otherwise known as pigs. Cast Iron — cast iron is an alloy with very high carbon content, which is melted, poured, and allowed to cool and harden. It’s often used for producing structural shapes.

— cast iron is an alloy with very high carbon content, which is melted, poured, and allowed to cool and harden. It’s often used for producing structural shapes. Wrought Iron — wrought iron has a lower carbon content and plenty of impurities, which makes it softer than cast iron, allowing you to reheat and reshape the metal.

History of Iron Production

Iron was undoubtedly known to the ancient world, and one of the earliest examples is beads made from meteoritic iron ore dating back to 3,500 BC Egypt. Mankind didn’t extract iron from the Earth due to a lack of technological knowledge, so they associated this metal with heavenly origins. Egyptians continued to work with meteoritic iron until 2,500 BC.

At the same time, samples of smelted iron can be found in Asmar, Mesopotamia, and Syria, dating between 3,000 and 2,700 BC. The Hittites were among the first to smelt iron between 1,500 and 1,200 BC, and it’s likely that the practice of iron smelting spread throughout the rest of the ancient world, ushering in the Iron Age.

Cast iron first appeared in the 5th century BC in China but was hardly used in Europe until the medieval period. Cast iron eventually replaced wrought iron towards the end of the 18th century, when its use became incredibly widespread, furthering the development of construction, transportation, and numerous other industries.

Types of Steel

As an alloy, steel can be enhanced with different amounts of different chemical elements, resulting in more than 3,500 different steel grades, each with its unique properties. However, these grades are typically grouped into four different types of steel:

Carbon Steel : Carbon steel got its name because it’s primarily made of iron and carbon, with a minute and negligible traces of other elements. The resulting material is exceptionally strong but very susceptible to corrosion. Carbon steel is further categorized according to its carbon content into low-carbon or mild steel, medium-carbon steel, and high-carbon steel.

Green Hydrogen: An Alternative That Reduces Emissions And Cares For Our Planet

The decarbonisation of the planet is among the objectives that countries around the world have set for 2050. The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels.

Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen.

Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market

This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points:

100 % sustainable: green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production.

green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production. Storable: hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production.

hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production. Versatile: green hydrogen can be transformed into electricity or synthetic gas and used for commercial, industrial or mobility purposes.

However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind:

High cost: energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain.

energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain. High energy consumption: the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels.

the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels. Safety issues: hydrogen is a highly volatile and flammable element and extensive safety measures are therefore required to prevent leakage and explosions.

Impact of green hydrogen

Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future:

Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner.

Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter.

Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.
