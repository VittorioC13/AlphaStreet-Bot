European Energy has entered into a solar park operations agreement with Heartland, assuming responsibility for Gedmose solar park near Holstebro, Denmark, from January 2026.

This move marks the first time European Energy will operate a solar park it has not developed or owned, expanding its portfolio of operational activities within renewable energy.

The Gedmose solar park, owned by Heartland, was connected to the grid in 2021 and was Northern Europe’s largest at the time, with a capacity of 207MW.

Situated just outside Holstebro, the facility generates enough electricity to supply more than 50,000 households annually.

Under the new agreement, European Energy will further diversify its operational services.

The company currently is engaged in operational and asset management for 4GW of renewable energy capacity.

Electricity produced by the Gedmose solar park is sold to BESTSELLER, Normal, Nemlig.com, and Faerch under a power purchase agreement.

Heartland communications head Kasper Reggelsen said: “Gedmose solar park was established as part of our ambition to invest responsibly and with a long-term perspective in the green transition.

“In recent years, we have been reminded of the importance of a robust energy infrastructure that benefits everyone. We are pleased to gain a skilled partner to handle the day-to-day operations and ensure that the park continues to contribute efficiently to Denmark’s energy supply.”

European Energy plans to further expand its asset management and operations activities both in Denmark and across international markets.

European Energy asset management and operations EVP Jacob Saust Jacobsen said: “A key part of our strategic shift in asset management has been to offer our services to third-party owners – not only to the parks we develop ourselves.

“In recent years, we have also developed new technological solutions that enable us to optimise electricity production at a lower cost. Our ambition is for asset management to become a significant revenue driver for the company, and this agreement marks an important step forward in that direction.

“We therefore look forward to taking over the operations of Gedmose solar park and providing the owners with a stable and efficient partner.”

Last month, European Energy agreed to sell a 50% stake in its Saldus project in Latvia to Sampension, a Danish pension fund.

[TITLE]The Final Score At COP30 — Fossil Fuels: 1600, Earth: 0:
[TEXT]
I have been covering the annual Conference Of Parties climate action meetings sponsored by the United Nations for CleanTechnica since the now famous Paris conference in 2015. What a time of hope that was! For one shining moment, it seemed the people of the world had come together to finally address the issue of carbon dioxide pollution and the impact it had on the Earth’s climate.

Then, just a year later, the US elected a know-nothing tyrant who promptly abdicated on all the promises the country had made to the other nations of the world in Paris. Those other nations took notice and their ardor for climate action cooled considerably. “If the US was giving everyone else the finger, why should we hold to our own commitments?” became the prevailing attitude.

Since then, every year has brought a new COP conference and every year much is expected but little is accomplished. The backsliding and flight from the lofty principles outlined by the climate hosts has become so predictable that the results of each conference can be predicted with unerring accuracy months in advance.

That is precisely what happen in Brazil this year. In all, more than 1600 lobbyists for fossil fuel companies were on hand to twist arms and preach the wisdom of going slow in addressing a problem that is growing faster with every passing year, month, and day. The end result for those advocating for an end to burning fossil fuels was a big fat goose egg — nada, zilch, zero.

Oh, there were some mutterings

[TITLE]Reducing greenhouse gas emissions couldn't be more urgent:
[TEXT]
COP30 in Belém was billed as the implementation COP.

It was supposed to focus on getting countries to deliver on the commitments for climate action they signed up to in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the eight subsequent COP negotiations that followed, before this one.

With global warming already above the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius the need to reduce or "mitigate" greenhouse gas emissions, to limit the rise in global temperatures could not be more urgent.

But mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is a very hard slog. It requires system wide transformations in energy and transportation. It is disruptive, expensive, takes a long time, and is not easy to do. Yet it is the only way to contain the rise in global temperature.

So, when COP30 was labelled the "implementation COP" by President Lula of Brazil and the UN, it was natural for people in this part of the world to expect it would conclude with a strong commitment to crank up climate mitigation measures.

COP30 President André Aranha Corrêa do Lago (C) speaks during the plenary session

Two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, the entire world agreed to start to transition away from fossil fuel usage - an enormous achievement for negotiators at the time.

Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable and clean energy is the most important climate measure of all. There was no follow up or mention of that commitment last year at COP29 in Baku.

But at COP30, given the urgency of the climate crisis, and the well flagged focus on implementing previous commitments, the most important thing was to put flesh on the bones of the agreement to phaseout fossil fuels.

That is why Ireland, all EU countries except Italy and Poland, the UK, Columbia, Panama, and many more - 85 countries in all - went hell for leather to get a "roadmap for transitioning away from fossil fuels" into the final agreement.

Of course they have failed to achieve that, blocked by an equally large group led by the Arab oil producing nations and Russia. Their attitude throughout the COP30 negotiations was one of "hands off our oil".

The primary focus of many developing nations, particularly in Africa was very different to that of Europe.

They are on the frontline of climate change, often suffering the most devastating consequences of extreme weather events and climate disasters.

Tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean, fuelled by climate change, has put Socotra island's ecosystem at risk

They are not responsible for the greenhouse gases that have driven climate change, and they don't have access to the financial resources needed to protect themselves, adapt, or even recover after extreme weather events.

So, when they thought

Johannesburg: Poorer nations attending the Group of 20 summit in South Africa have used the meeting to push leaders on climate action and high levels of debt, issues directly affecting the developing world.They have also sought to position themselves as economic partners with much to offer in sectors including mining, technology and artificial intelligence, among others.Many lauded South Africa, which hands over the rotating G20 presidency to the US, for promoting an inclusive agenda prioritising the needs of poorer nations by focusing on global inequality. The United States boycotted the Johannesburg meeting meant to bring rich and developing nations together over President Donald Trump 's claims that South Africa is violently persecuting its Afrikaner white minority.In addition to the G20 countries, the African Union and the European Union, many developing nations were invited as guests, like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Jamaica and Malaysia."We are not here to speak of despair, we are here to speak of possibilities and shared responsibilities," Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told delegates.He said that debt relief must translate into investments that benefit people. "In Ethiopia, we have learnt that inclusivity is not charity, it is efficiency."Namibian President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah called for fair financing terms for developing nations. She said her country had recently paid back its USD 750 million bond on time."However, we are considered by decision makers as a risky country. We need fair international financial institutions," she said.Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Michael Holness reflected on climate-fueled natural disasters and their impact on developing nations, like that of Hurricane Melissa, which had devastated his country."One external shock can undo years of progress," he said.World Trade Organisation Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala on Sunday urged African leaders to think carefully about future trade with other countries when adopting policies."How we position ourselves depends on us and our policymakers. So if we continue to export, and see that 60 per cent of our exports are commodities and raw materials, then things will not change," she said. "We can go from raw materials all the way to finished product by creating subregional and regional value chains."Nabil Ahmed, director of economic and racial justice at think tank Oxfam, said it was the first time that a G20 agenda had inequality as one of its central pillars."The world recognises that we have a climate emergency. It's now time that we recognise that we have an inequality emergency as well," he said."One thing that South Africa managed to do as the first host of a G20 meeting on African soil was to prioritise the interests of African nations and the interests of the global south nations," he said.

[TITLE]Trump’s Vendetta Against Wind Is Gutting Jobs and Raising Prices:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump’s bizarre war on offshore wind is getting worse — and it’s screwing workers and anyone who uses electricity. In the past year, Trump’s policies have resulted in the loss of more than half of the planned power set to come from offshore wind, according to a new report by the Energy Industries Council released last week. People all across the country are facing relentlessly skyrocketing energy prices, with average electricity bills in July up 9.5 percent from just one year ago. Rising energy costs were a key issue influencing voters in elections this month and are expected to again play an outsized role in the crucial 2026 midterms.

Trump has never been shy

[TITLE]COP30 failed to land a deal on the fossil fuel transition. Countries are moving forward anyway:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

In 2022, the world watched in shock as cataclysmic floods driven by melting glaciers tore through Pakistan, displacing up to a third of the country's population and leaving essential power infrastructure in ruins.

To recover, people turned to clean energy — solar in particular . The province of Sindh rebuilt homes with solar panels on their roofs, and people ordered panels directly from China. Pakistanis were so enthusiastic abo ut this energy source that in 2024, th ey added 22 gigawatts' worth of solar power — more than Canada has ever installed.

It’s an example of how the shift to renewable energy is accelerating across the world, especially in developing countries taking advantage of falling prices for solar and wind power.

This rush comes at the same time that the U.S., the world’s largest oil producer, is do ubling down on fossil fuels and trying to get more of the world to buy its carbon-emitting energy.

At COP30, the UN climate summit in Belem, Brazil, last week, negotiating a roadmap for transitioning away from fossil fuels was unexpectedly added to the agenda after being missing from the conversation in the run-up to the summit.

Countries failed to reach a deal, but analysts say the fact it became such a big negotiating point shows there's global momentum to move away from fossil fuels.

[TITLE]Belém COP30 delivers climate finance boost and a pledge to plan fossil fuel transition:
[TEXT]
That was the message from UN climate chief Simon Stiell as COP30 wrapped up following marathon talks on Friday night which stretched into sunrise Saturday – signaling a turning point for climate ambition and global solidarity.

“A new economy is rising, while the old polluting one is running out of road.”

Climate disinformation: Commitment to promote information integrity and counter false narratives.

The final decision emphasises solidarity and investment, setting ambitious financial targets while leaving energy transition for later discussion. The burning of fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases that are by far the largest contributors to global warming, making this omission a point of concern for many nations, including negotiators from South America and the EU, as well as civil society groups.

Expectations were high that COP30's final decision would include explicit reference to phasing out fossil fuels. More than 80 countries backed Brazil’s proposal for a formal ‘roadmap.’

A draft text had included it – until the final hours of talks. The adopted outcome refers only to the ‘UAE Consensus’, the COP28 decision calling for “transitioning away from fossil fuels.”

Before the final plenary, Brazilian scientist Carlos Nobre issued a stark warning: fossil fuel use must fall to zero by 2040 – 2045 at the latest to avoid catastrophic temperature rises of up to 2.5°C by mid-century. That trajectory, he said, would spell the near-total loss of coral reefs, the collapse of the Amazon rainforest and an accelerated melt of the Greenland ice sheet.

A closer look

After two weeks of intense negotiations, the adopted text calls for mobilizing at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 for climate action, alongside tripling adaptation finance and operationalizing the loss and damage fund agreed at COP28.

It also launches two major initiatives – the Global Implementation Accelerator and the Belém Mission to 1.5°C – to help countries deliver on their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), or national climate action plans, and adaptation plans.

For the first time, the decision acknowledges the need to tackle climate disinformation, pledging to promote information integrity and counter narratives that undermine science-based action.

Last week, Brazil’s President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, opened the summit declaring it would be known as “the COP of truth,” and this landmark decision marks a significant step toward safeguarding public trust in climate policy – even as the absence of fossil fuel transition language underscores the complexity of energy negotiations.

Two new roadmaps

In the closing meeting, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago acknowledged what was left out of the deal:

“We know some of you had greater ambitions for some of the issues at hand,” he said, adding, “I know the youth civil society will demand us to do more to fight climate change. I want to reaffirm that I will try not to disappoint you during my presidency.”

Reflecting on President Lula’s call at the opening of COP30 for ambition, Mr. do Lago announced plans to create two roadmaps: one to halt and reverse deforestation; and another to transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner, mobilizing resources for these purposes in a “just and planned manner.”

The road to consensus

The road to consensus at the latest Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as the annual COPs are formally known, was anything but smooth.

Late last week, Indigenous groups staged blockades demanding stronger protections for the Amazon, and late Thursday afternoon, a fire at the conference venue disrupted talks during a critical phase.

Negotiators worked through the night on Friday – to bridge gaps on finance and ambition, with Brazil’s presidency steering discussions toward a politically workable outcome focused on support and implementation of agreements from past COPs.

‘Multilateralism is alive’

From the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, UN Secretary-General António Guterres sent a clear message to COP30: At the gateway of the Amazon, Parties reached an agreement that shows nations can still unite to confront challenges no country can solve alone.

The UN chief said that COP30 delivered progress, such as the launch of the Global Implementation Accelerator to close ambition gaps and reaffirmed the UAE Consensus, including a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.

“But COPs are consensus-based – and in a period of geopolitical divides, consensus is ever harder to reach. I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed.” Overshoot of 1.5°C is a stark warning: deep, rapid emission cuts and massive climate finance are essential. “COP30 is over, but the work is not,” he said.

Mr. Guterres vowed to keep pushing for higher ambition and solidarity, urging all who marched, negotiated and mobilized: “Do not give up. History – and the United Nations – are on your side.

Holding the line at 1.5 in ‘turbulent geopolitical waters’

UN climate chief Simon Stiell pointed to a series of major gains as COP30 closed in Belém: new strategies to accelerate Paris Agreement implementation, a push to triple adaptation finance, and commitments toward a just energy transition.

And despite what he called “turbulent geopolitical waters” – marked by polarization and climate denial – 194 nations stood together, “keeping humanity in the fight for a livable planet, determined to hold the line at 1.5°C.”

At the heart of this momentum is COP30’s flagship outcome: the Mutirão text, a sweeping deal that bundles four contentious negotiation tracks – from mitigation to finance and trade barriers – into a single, consensus-based agreement. Seventeen additional decisions were adopted alongside it.

The final document declares that the global shift toward low-emissions and climate-resilient development is “irreversible and the trend of the future.” It reaffirms that the Paris Agreement is working – and must “go further and faster” – strengthening the role of multilateral climate cooperation.

The text also recognizes the economic and social benefits of climate action, from growth and job creation to improved energy access, security and public health. Mr. Stiell pointed to a decisive trend: investments in renewable energy now outpace fossil fuels two to one – “a political and market signal that cannot be ignored,” he said.

A robust action agenda beyond negotiations

The Brazilian Presidency underscored that COP30’s success extends beyond negotiated agreements, highlighting a wave of voluntary commitments under the Action Agenda.

Among them:

Tropical Forests Forever Fund : Raised $5.5 billion and now includes 53 participating countries; at least 20 per cent of resources go directly to Indigenous Peoples and local communities.

[TITLE]Trump’s Vendetta Against Wind Is Gutting Jobs and Raising Prices:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump’s bizarre war on offshore wind is getting worse — and it’s screwing workers and anyone who uses electricity. In the past year, Trump’s policies have resulted in the loss of more than half of the planned power set to come from offshore wind, according to a new report by the Energy Industries Council released last week. People all across the country are facing relentlessly skyrocketing energy prices, with average electricity bills in July up 9.5 percent from just one year ago. Rising energy costs were a key issue influencing voters in elections this month and are expected to again play an outsized role in the crucial 2026 midterms.

Trump has never been shy

The rapid expansion of data centers in Texas is driving electricity demand higher during the winter, compounding the risk of supply shortfalls that could lead to blackouts during freezing temperatures. The Lone Star state is attracting a huge amount of data center requests, driven by its abundant renewable energy and natural gas resources as well as its business friendly environment. OpenAI, for example, is developing its flagship Stargate campus in Abilene,

[TITLE]Xcel Energy seeks $355.5M revenue hike, increasing residential bills nearly 10% on average:
[TEXT]
Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has asked state regulators for an increase of $355.5 million to its rate base, which would boost the average residential electric bill by nearly 10% per month.

Xcel filed the proposal Friday with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which will take testimony from the company and various intervening parties and hold a public hearing. If approved, the increase would take effect in September 2026.

Xcel Energy-Colorado President Robert Kenney said the utility’s last increase to the rate base was in 2022. The average residential bill rose by 3.2%, according to an Xcel statement after an agreement was reached with all the parties

The rate base is a utility’s investments to provide services and on which it’s allowed to earn a regulated rate of return.

“This rate case is to recover costs associated with investments that we’ve made over the last three years,” Kenney said.

The Utility Consumer Advocate, or UCA, which represents the public before state regulators, said the proposed increase is “too big of an increase.”

“It’s an especially large increase given the context of the economic times,” said Joseph Pereira, UCA deputy director.

The increase is largely related to Xcel’s expanded capital spending on distribution, transmission and generation, Pereira said.

“It’s unclear to parties in the UCA that the company is prioritizing investments that are the biggest bang for the buck, that increase reliability and that adopt an intelligent approach to how they’re using the grid,” Pereira said. “It still appears that the company is using a crude blanket approach to replacing and investing in new infrastructure.”

Kenney said Xcel has invested in safety, reliability, making the system more resilient, electrifying transportation and buildings, meeting increased demands from growth and taking steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Xcel has said it has reduced carbon emissions by 57%. The state’s target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030.

Xcel is upgrading its electric grid with a $1.7 billion transmission project. The Colorado Power Pathway includes transmission lines, power substations and other equipment stretching over 12 counties, mostly in eastern Colorado.

“We’ve added a tremendous amount of renewable energy over the last several years,” Kenney said. “And we’ve done all of this while keeping bills as low as possible.”

Xcel has faced criticism over the past few years for what the UCA has called “a pancaking of rate increases.”

The criticism of Xcel and other regulated utilities heated up in 2023 after a cold winter and high natural gas prices sent costs soaring statewide. A legislative committee held hearings and approved a bill intended to protect customers against future price shocks and level what some see as a playing field tilted in the utilities’ favor.

Kenney said Xcel Energy’s rates have been well below state and national averages for approximately the last 10 years. But, he added, the company recognizes that some customers face challenges to paying their bills. He said Xcel is expanding its programs to help people struggling to pay their bills and adding $10 million in assistance. People can also call 800-895-4999.

In the past, Xcel required people to show proof of income to apply for help, but now will accept their statements of need. And those receiving other aid, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will be automatically eligible.

Under Xcel’s proposed rate hike, the average monthly residential bill would rise 9.9%; small commercial bills would go up 9.3%-9.4% per month; and large commercial monthly bills would increase 7.3%-8.6%.
