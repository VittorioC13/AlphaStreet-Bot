MONROE, Mich., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in the retail and manufacture of residential furniture, today reported second quarter results for the period ended October 25, 2025. For the quarter, sales totaled $522 million, up slightly against the prior year comparable period, reflecting growth in Retail and Wholesale segments, offset by a decline in Joybird sales. Operating margin was 6.9% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and 7.1% on an adjusted(1) basis. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.70 on a GAAP basis and $0.71 on an adjusted(1) basis.

Second quarter total written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) grew 4% versus a year ago and written same-store sales (which exclude the impact of both newly opened stores and newly acquired stores) were down 2%. This represents a continued sequential improvement in written same-store sales trends over the last two quarters against a challenging consumer and macroeconomic environment.

Melinda D. Whittington, Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We were pleased to deliver modest sales growth, particularly in our Wholesale segment where we also again delivered margin expansion, continuing to create our own momentum in what remains a choppy landscape. We are investing in the business for the long term, as highlighted by the opening of 15 new company-owned stores in the last 12 months and the advancement of our distribution and home delivery transformation project. Furthermore, in the beginning of our third quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of a 15-store network in the southeast U.S. region. Our Century Vision strategy to grow our Retail store footprint and expand brand reach is working and positions us to disproportionately benefit when overall industry volumes rebound.”

Whittington added, “In addition to investing in our core, vertically integrated North American upholstery business, we are proactively taking steps to optimize our portfolio. We have announced plans to exit our non-core wholesale casegoods and upholstery businesses in the back half of the fiscal year, announced the proposed closure of our U.K. manufacturing facility, and strategically realigned our commercial leadership and corporate staffing to enhance operating efficiency. On top of this, leveraging our North American manufacturing base with ~90% of finished goods produced in the U.S., we are successfully navigating the current trade and tariff volatility. Our iconic brand, well positioned manufacturing base, strong balance sheet, and talented team provide the foundation for continued growth and margin expansion.”

Third Quarter Outlook :

Taylor Luebke, SVP and Chief Financial Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We expect fiscal third quarter sales to be in the range of $525-545 million (growth of 1-4% year-over-year) and adjusted operating margin(2) to be in the range of 5.0-6.5%, reflecting advancement of our Century Vision initiatives, friction costs related to portfolio and supply chain optimizations, and a measured view on the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.”

Indian investors are showing growing faith in Reliance Industries (RIL), the country’s most valuable company — even as foreign funds take a step back.In the September 2025 quarter, retail investors slightly increased their stake in Reliance to 7.08%, up from 6.92% in the June quarter, according to shareholding data. That means over 42 lakh small investors now collectively own around 94 crore shares of Reliance Industries.At the same time, mutual funds also boosted their exposure, raising their stake from 9.32% to 9.66%. The move indicates growing domestic conviction in Reliance’s prospects — even though the stock’s performance has been far from stellar lately.In sharp contrast, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) trimmed their holdings in the company, cutting their stake from 19.21% to 18.65%. The number of foreign investors fell as well — from 2,280 to 2,146 — suggesting that global funds may be taking a more cautious stance toward Indian equities or booking profits after a long rally.This shifting ownership pattern comes at an intriguing time.

[TITLE]Interview – Diageo’s faith in demand for pricier fare:
[TEXT]
Julie Bramham, MD of Diageo Luxury Group. Credit: Diageo

A year ago, Diageo launched a global division for its so-called “luxury” spirits brands. The Diageo Luxury Group principally (though not entirely) houses products priced at $100 and above. As well as Scotch brands like Brora and Port Ellen, the business unit manages 15 brand homes and visitor experiences, oversees Diageo’s cask ownership programme Casks of Distinction and runs UK-based fine-wine merchants Justerini & Brooks.

Just Drinks sat down with Julie Bramham, the division’s MD, to discuss the opportunities Diageo sees within that tier of spirits, an area she describes as “under-developed”.

Discover B2B Marketing That Performs Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. Find out more

Fiona Holland (FH): Where do the growth opportunities lie for what Diageo calls the “luxury” segment in spirits and how is the company planning to take advantage of those?

Julie Bramham (JB): What we’re seeing in the wider luxury market, outside of spirits, is a slowdown. However, what is in growth is experiences in luxury. People are really upgrading towards luxury experiences.

One of the areas that we’re starting to do a lot of exciting work in is what we call ‘experience-led luxury spirits’. That could be an out-and-out experience, fine dining, socialising, or it could be the experience that you get when you open the bottle of one of our spirits. Experience is a really big fat word but it allows us to span the areas that people can and want to access spirits – from a great mini-Martini all the way up to a bespoke blend created just for you. Experience-led and the growth of luxury experience outside of spirits is a huge area of opportunity for us.

More recently, he discussed The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) after Kimberly-Clark announced that it would acquire Kenvue for a whopping $48.7 billion price tag. Cramer commented that while The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was one of the biggest and dominant players in the industry, Kimberly’s CEO, Mike Hsu, might give the firm a tough time. In this appearance, he commented on the firm’s share price and mentioned it in the context of dividends:

“That was very significant. Yeah and UPS wasn’t. . as horrible. I think the government opening and people feeling better, we’re gonna get some good spend. I’m in favor of those, that’s the kind of stocks. I want retail because they’re very low multiple. And I’ve now decided that it’s time to buy these consumer product stocks if you want a yield and you’re older. You know if you can get a 4% good yield, that compounds, 50, 60, 70s, I like that, as an alternative, one of your five stocks. Might be one of those.

Procter & Gamble's (PG) at a "Real Low," Says Jim Cramer

“[After Carl Quintanilla mentioned Clorox, Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble] Yes, Yes, Yes. All three. . .I think that Proctor’s not generational low, but it’s real low. . .But if you want yield, we suddenly have it. And I’m not going to say if the Fed is going to be cutting rates, I’m gonna run away from yield.”

[TITLE]BranchOut Food Announces $2.5 Million Institutional Investment Pricing Following Record October Achieving a $20 Million Annualized Revenue Run Rate:
[TEXT]
BEND, Ore., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BranchOut Food Inc. (NASDAQ: BOF), a leading food technology company pioneering the next generation of natural fruit and vegetable snacks through its proprietary GentleDry™ process, today announced the pricing of a $2.5 million institutional investment consisting of 1,034,600 shares of common stock to be purchased by Bard Associates, Inc. The financing will strengthen BranchOut’s working capital reserves and marks an important milestone in the company’s growth. This investment is opportunistic for BranchOut, providing the company with the ability to bolster its balance sheet and fund key growth initiatives. Alexander Capital L.P. is acting as sole bookrunner for the offering.

“This financing is a powerful validation of our momentum and mission,” said Eric Healy, CEO of BranchOut Food. “October was the best month in our company’s history, with record revenue of $1.7 million, equivalent to a $20 million annualized run rate. With this capital, we will be well positioned to scale production and execution across our rapidly growing retail and ingredient channels.”

Healy added, “We see significant growth ahead and are expanding our production facility early next year with the installation of our fourth large-scale production line, which strengthens BranchOut’s position as the largest GentleDry™ operation in the world. In addition, we are transitioning from a made-to-order model to an inventory-based production strategy to reduce air shipping requirements, improve efficiency, and support larger retail programs. This capital will directly support those initiatives, funding both inventory build and critical capital expenditures.”

Inghams Ltd (ASX: ING) shares hit a 12-month low this week, a share price performance which chair Helen Nash admitted in her address to the company's annual general meeting on Thursday was "deeply disappointing".

But is it time to buy the dip, or will a suitor come in to take the company out?

Poor report card

Inghams, which published a trading update on Wednesday, said while market fundamentals had been strong, "at the same time, we have experienced higher than expected operational costs in Australia across farming and processing operations which arose toward the end of FY25''.

Ms Nash said in her address to the AGM on Thursday that the 33% or so decrease in the company's share price and the softer trading update had come about amid "challenging market conditions" that emerged in the fourth quarter of the last financial year, "and specific operational cost pressures across inventory management, farming and processing performance, and our turkey operations''.

She went on to say:

I acknowledge that these issues, and the performance of our share price, are deeply disappointing for all shareholders, and I want to assure you that your Board and management are responding with urgency and discipline through a range of measures which are expected to position the Company for stronger performance in the second half of FY26 and beyond.

But where there is share price weakness, there can be an opportunity.

The Australian Shareholders Association, in a report published ahead of the AGM, raised the notion that it could lead takeover suitors to take a closer look at the company.

As they said in their report:

So, what is going to happen? 2026 is not looking good with EBITDA predicted to be at best 2.8% lower and at worst, down by 10%. Is there a future upside? Hopefully! In the short term (first half 2026): reducing excess inventory built up in FY25 and rightsizing production, which is expected to weigh on first half 2026 earnings. Inghams has a substantial number of issues to overcome and hopefully it will, however its plunging share price and market positioning may make is susceptible to being bought out.

Shares looking cheap

Broker Jarden has also run the ruler over the company's recent trading update, and said while the update was "mixed", there was money to be made buying Inghams shares at current levels.

As they said in a note to clients:

We retain our neutral rating but with a positive bias, owing to new management taking action to cut cost, drive volumes and reduce volatility in earnings. Confidence around guidance, operational improvement and industry pricing will be key to becoming more positive.

Jarden has a price target of $2.80 on Inghams shares, and factoring in dividends, is projecting a total shareholder return of 19.3% based on the closing price on Wednesday of $2.43. Inghams shares were 3.1% higher on Thursday at $2.50.

[TITLE]GST cuts fail to deliver the consumption boost for footwear, apparel sectors:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI : The goods and services tax cuts were expected to bolster consumption across sectors, but failed to spark the expected revival for India’s apparel and footwear retailers. An early Diwali, weak discretionary spending and erratic weather culminated in a lacklustre festive season for the two categories.

The uncertainty around the rate rationalisation led to deferral in purchasing decisions, said Amit Aggarwal, CFO of Bata India Ltd, the country’s largest listed footwear retailer. “There was a delay in buying because of the planned rate rationalisation," he said, adding that the transition window from mid-August announcement to the 22 September rollout was “very, very long".

Many channel partners postponed purchases to avoid input tax credit (ITC) mismatches. “The moment the rates were announced, we saw a deferral in buying," Aggarwal said. Bata responded by reducing prices and launching incentive schemes early. “We were the first movers… passing on the GST-related benefits effective the first week of September," he added, despite the gross margin hit. Without the disruptions, Bata believes revenue would have been “at least flat" rather than the 4% decline reported.

The footwear maker’s revenue declined 4.2% year-on-year to ₹801.33 crore in the September quarter. Its net profit also slipped from ₹51.97 crore to ₹13.89 crore.

GST on footwear costing up to ₹2,500 fell from 12% to 5% as the GST Council rationalized slabs from four to two: 5% and 18%. The GST overhaul for apparel simplified rates into two slabs of 5% and 18% and raised the price threshold for the lower 5% rate from ₹1,000 to ₹2,500, making budget and mass-market clothing cheaper. However, garments priced above ₹2,500 now attract 18% GST, up from 12%, which affected mid-premium and festive-wear categories.

“GST helped only in certain price bands. The mid-premium segment benefited, which favoured brands like Metro and Pantaloons. But low-priced footwear didn’t gain because demand itself is weak, not the tax rate," said Satish Meena, founder of market research firm Datum Intelligence. “The divergence isn’t because of GST alone — it’s fundamentally brand-specific. Metro is doing well because it sells what consumers want today, while players like Bata are dealing with deeper relevance issues that go beyond tax changes."

Footwear maker Khadim India Ltd’s September sales fell to ₹101 crore in the September quarter from ₹109 crore a year earlier. Premium lines like British Walkers grew in double digits, and products priced below ₹500 rebounded, but the mid-segment continued to struggle. The company said it expects the GST cut to gradually revive this category. “The GST cut should bridge the gap between the unorganised and organised sectors."

Even V-Mart Retail said the benefits of the GST cut did not materialize immediately in its lower-ticket categories. Lalit Agarwal, managing director and CEO of the company, said, “We expected significant gains, but the consumer response was not as strong as anticipated."

Tata Group-owned retailer Trent Ltd also cited muted sentiment, unseasonable rains and the GST transition as factors keeping growth to low single digits.

A Mirae Asset note on Trent said GST rationalisation should support demand in small-ticket discretionary categories in the coming months, but warned that slower revenue growth — despite a strong base last year — points to a broader consumption slowdown.

Premium pull

By comparison, premium footwear and apparel retailers such as Metro Brands and Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail Ltd (ABFRL) reported steadier demand and limited disruption from the GST transition.

Consumers intentionally waited for the GST cut before shopping, and demand accelerated meaningfully once the new rates kicked in, said Metro Brands CEO Nissan Joseph.

“We had prolonged monsoons through the quarter, and customers waiting on doing a major shopping for the GST benefits to take effect," Joseph said. After the cut, the impact was immediate: “The GST changes have been very positive for our business. We’ve seen as much as 11% reduction on footwear priced between ₹1,000 and ₹2,500 and around 6% for footwear under ₹1,000."

GST cuts benefited nearly 90% of Walkway and a large share of Metro and Mochi’s portfolio, helping drive footfall and conversions. Joseph added that the broader consumption environment was normalising. “We have passed a lot of those things where you can see a certain normal trajectory of business come to light."

Metro also reported strong growth in e-commerce and remains optimistic

[TITLE]Signs of Distress As Middle-Class Shoppers Cut Back:

Home Depot just became the latest major retailer to warn that the slowdown in consumer spending is spreading.

The home improvement cut its full-year outlook on Tuesday, reporting weakening sales growth for Q3.

Comparable sales — a key measure that strips out new store openings — rose by just 0.2% with US comps up by 0.1% — falling short of Wall Street's expectations and underscoring a subtle yet important shift: more financially stable shoppers are starting to pull back.

"An expected increase in demand in the third quarter did not materialize. We believe that consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand," said Ted Decker, chair, president, and CEO of Home Depot.

Middle-class shoppers are pulling back

Evidence is mounting that it's not just lower-income shoppers who are becoming more cautious with their spending.

Home Depot's customer base tends to be relatively well off. And the chain benefits when people buy or renovate homes, but higher borrowing costs and a sluggish housing market have slowed that activity.

The company had expected better results as interest rates eased — but even that tailwind wasn't enough.

Brian W. Nagel, senior equity research analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., told CNBC on Tuesday that the company is facing "a convergence of negative factors" as both housing activity and discretionary spending weaken.

"They're not getting any help from the housing market," which is stagnant right now, he said, adding that the consumer backdrop "is going from soft to softer — and that's happening quickly."

Milder weather and a lack of storms also affected sales, Home Depot said, curbing demand for seasonal products such as roofing materials and generators, which typically boost late-summer revenue.

In a note to clients on Tuesday, retail analyst Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail said the calmer weather hurt demand across the sector, while uneasy consumers chose to spend on travel and leisure instead of home upgrades.

He estimated that home-improvement projects declined 0.8% from last year, with the steepest drop in big-ticket remodels that require financing.

A broader retail warning

It's part of a growing pattern across retail.

Earlier this month, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said that higher-income diners were trading down to cheaper meals, noting that "value matters to everybody, whether you're upper income, middle income, or lower income."

Meanwhile, pricier restaurant chains Cava, Chipotle, and Sweetgreen said in recent earnings calls that young customers were cutting back and eating at home to save cash.

Chad Lusk, managing director in consumer and retail at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal, told Business Insider that some higher-income shoppers are increasingly making trips to lower-priced retailers and trading down on food to spend on apparel and electronics.

They're changing their entire ingrained routines, he said, adding: "There are signs of real distress on the way."

The bigger picture

The economic backdrop is adding to the unease.

The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index declined 6% in November to 50.3, its lowest level since 2022, with broad-based decreases in confidence across income groups as the prolonged government shutdown weighed on the outlook.

Year-ahead inflation expectations ticked up to 4.7%, according to preliminary data released on November 15.

At the same time, job cuts are rising sharply: US employers announced 153,074 layoffs in October — the highest for that month in over two decades — pushing total cuts this year past one million, up 65% from 2024, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The firm cited cost-cutting, AI integration, and weaker consumer demand as key factors behind the surge.

That trend could have a disproportionate effect on white-collar professionals — and, by extension, the retailers that rely on them.

Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said on CNBC's Squawk Box on Tuesday that the rise of AI-driven job losses could alter the traditional dynamic of recessions.

"We might be — in the midterm — looking at an inverse of what anyone underwriting credit has seen for decades," he said.

"What we are seeing now due to AI may be the inverse, where it might be the high-income households due to the white-collar jobs being affected," he added.

For a company long considered a bellwether for the health of the American homeowner, Home Depot's miss is a worrying sign.

If even its solid, middle-class customers are cutting back, the broader consumer economy may be in for a chillier winter than expected.

[TITLE]Beyond Discounts: iGaming's New Deal:
[TEXT]
The frantic, coffee-fueled-refresh-hitting of Cyber Monday is starting to lose its magic. That “50% Off!” email, which once felt like a secret key to massive savings, now just feels… predictable. We’ve all felt the “deal fatigue.” We buy a discounted toaster or a pair of headphones, and the excitement is fleeting. But as the thrill of traditional e-commerce sales wanes, a new contender for the “best deal” crown has emerged: the iGaming industry. This sector isn’t just offering discounts; it’s fundamentally redefining what “value” means to a consumer.

The core difference lies in the value proposition. A Cyber Monday deal, at its heart, is a discount on an expense. You have to spend $200 to “save” $50. The iGaming industry completely flips this script. Its deals are built around multipliers. A typical offer isn’t “spend less”; it’s “get more.” An offer to “deposit $50 and play with $100” feels psychologically different. It’s not a rebate; it’s a value-add that doubles your entertainment potential from the very start.

This shift is evident across the digital entertainment landscape. Consumers who are savvy about value now compare a 20% discount on electronics to the kinds of welcome offers available on various platforms. For instance, in the iGaming space, promotions are a core part of the user experience, not just a seasonal event. Enthusiasts visiting a site like VulkanBet casino often find that the value lies in the added playtime and enhanced experience, which a simple e-commerce discount struggles to match. This model is built on engagement, not just transactions.

The Psychology: A Bonus vs. A Discount

The power of the iGaming model lies in its deep understanding of behavioral psychology. A discount is passive; a bonus is active. It taps into our desire for gamification and a sense of “beating the system.”

The Gamification of Loyalty

E-commerce loyalty programs are often slow and uninspired, offering tiny points that eventually lead to a minor discount. The iGaming industry, by contrast, has mastered gamification. Loyalty is rewarded instantly and in tiers. Players unlock new levels, “free spins,” or exclusive bonuses simply by participating. This creates a compelling loop that makes the user feel valued and rewarded for their time, not just their money. The “deal” is an ongoing, interactive experience rather than a single, boring transaction.

Personalization at Scale

Cyber Monday deals are a broadcast, a one-size-fits-all digital flyer. They might be based on your browsing history, but they often feel impersonal. iGaming platforms excel at personalization. The deals you are offered are often tied directly to your play style, your favorite games, or your loyalty status. A “VIP” player gets a different, more substantial bonus than a casual new user. This targeted approach makes the user feel recognized and understood, making the “deal” feel far more exclusive and valuable than a generic 20% off coupon code.

More Than Just a Transaction

When you break it down, the e-commerce model and the iGaming model are selling two completely different things. One is selling a product; the other is selling an experience.

The Entertainment Factor

When you buy a discounted laptop on Cyber Monday, the “fun” part (the deal) is over in a click. The real product (the laptop) is the goal. In iGaming, the “deal” is the product. A 100% deposit bonus or a set of free spins directly translates to more entertainment. The value isn’t a physical item; it’s extended playtime, more chances for a thrilling win, and a longer, more engaging experience. You are, in effect, buying “fun,” and the bonus is just “more fun” for your money.

Immediacy is King

Let’s not forget the most powerful psychological driver of all: instant gratification. You find a Cyber Monday deal, you click “buy,” and then… You wait. You track the shipping for three to five business days. The iGaming bonus is immediate. The moment you make your deposit, the bonus funds are credited to your account, ready for use. This instant, tangible reward provides a dopamine hit that the “your item has shipped” email simply cannot compete with.

What E-Commerce Can Learn

This doesn’t mean Cyber Monday is dead, but it does mean e-commerce platforms are no longer the undisputed kings of value. To compete, they need to think less like digital department stores and more like entertainment platforms.

They can start by shifting their focus from simple discounts to more engaging reward structures.

Focus on Gaining, Not Saving: Instead of just “50% off,” offer “Buy one, get one” or “Spend $50, get a $25 credit” on a future purchase. This reframes the value from losing less to gaining more.

Gamify the Shopping Experience: Implement meaningful loyalty tiers that offer tangible, instant rewards, not just points that expire. Create “missions” or “challenges” for shoppers to unlock exclusive deals.

Personalize Rewards: Use data to offer rewards that truly matter to the individual, making them feel like a valued VIP, not just another name on an email list.

A Shift in Value Perception

The battle for the consumer’s dollar is no longer just about the lowest price. It’s about the best experience and the greatest perceived value. While Cyber Monday will continue to be a day for stocking up on goods, the iGaming industry has proven that a well-designed, bonus-driven ecosystem can create far more excitement and loyalty. It has shifted the goalposts from “saving money” to “getting more,” and in a digital world, that’s a much more compelling game to play.

Which do you find more appealing: a 50% discount on a product, or a 100% bonus to enhance an experience? Share your thoughts below.
