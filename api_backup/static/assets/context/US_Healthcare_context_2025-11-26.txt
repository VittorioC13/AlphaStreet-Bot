GE HealthCare has announced an agreement to acquire medical imaging software provider Intelerad for a cash consideration of $2.3bn (C$3.24bn).

This move is intended to support GE HealthCare’s objective to significantly increase its range of cloud-enabled products by 2028.

Founded in 1999 in Canada, Intelerad offers products intended for cardiology and radiology. Its cloud-first solutions are used in both outpatient and inpatient healthcare environments.

Intelerad’s presence in outpatient care is seen as complementary to GE HealthCare’s established hospital-based imaging.

The combined product offerings are expected to increase customer access and provide integrated imaging solutions across various healthcare environments.

Intelerad’s business model is expected to expedite GE HealthCare’s transition towards a software-as-a-service (SaaS) approach and to raise recurring revenue.

[TITLE]Hartford HealthCare could acquire 2 Prospect hospitals by year end:
[TEXT]
After years of uncertainty regarding the future of the Connecticut hospitals owned by bankrupt operator Prospect Medical Holdings, two of the three facilities could have a new owner by the end of the year.

On Tuesday, Hartford HealthCare, one of Connecticut’s largest health systems, presented its case to the state’s Office of Health Strategy to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals. Under the new expedited approval timeline for hospitals in bankruptcy, state officials must issue a decision by Dec. 30.

During the public hearing, Hartford HealthCare CEO Jeffrey Flaks said the health system plans to bring all its expertise, resources and capabilities to Manchester, Rockville and the surrounding towns.

“The robust apparatus of Hartford HealthCare will be brought to these communities to make health care better. That’s why I’m so confident that we have this very unique opportunity to dramatically improve health care that will be here for generations going forward,” Flaks said.

Hartford HealthCare will spend $86.1 million to purchase the facilities and pledged to invest an additional $225.7 million towards capital improvements, like facility and IT upgrades, over the next three years.

Hartford HealthCare also plans to recruit new physicians to the Manchester and Rockville communities, as well as expand access to specialty care, like oncology, inpatient rehabilitation and vascular and orthopedic surgical services, according to the application submitted to the state.

If approved, the deal would serve as the first step towards concluding a lengthy search to find new buyers for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — a process that often seemed on the brink of failure.

In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell its three Connecticut hospitals — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury — to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation.

In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.”

In September, Yale agreed to pay $45 million to Prospect to end all disputes over the hospitals’ sale.

Hartford HealthCare stepped in and its acquisitions of the Manchester and Rockville facilities could be finalized by the end of the year. Connecticut’s flagship academic medical institution, UConn Health, seems poised to acquire Waterbury Hospital. A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved the UConn deal earlier this week, and now the transaction must obtain state approval.

It’s a speedy transition for the three hospitals, whose ownership had languished in uncertainty for years.

While the Yale deal was pending, Lamont and OHS received broad criticism for the lengthy approval process. That led state legislators to approve a measure earlier this year that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy.

Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete.

In an emailed statement, Lamont’s spokesperson Rob Blanchard said OHS “met all statutory timelines in the Yale-Prospect [certificate of need review]” and that the legal disputes between the two companies illustrate the transaction’s complexity.

“Yale’s decision to file suit against Prospect less than two months after the agreed settlement raised clear concerns

: Eli Lilly made history on Friday by briefly reaching a $1 trillion market capitalization, becoming the first health-care company to join the exclusive club of trillion-dollar companies, a group previously dominated by tech giants, as per a report.Shares of the Indianapolis-based drugmaker touched the milestone in morning trading before retreating, and then trading around $1,048, as per a CNBC report. LLY stock has climbed more than 36% this year, fueled by the runaway success of its diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight loss injection Zepbound, as per the report. Investors have applauded Eli Lilly for gaining ground over its chief rival Novo Nordisk in the highly competitive GLP-1 drug market, reported CNBC.ALSO READ: Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounds alarm: Cryptocurrency Bitcoin price at $60,000 could send BTC traders running The soaring demand for the treatments has translated into impressive revenue growth. In the third quarter, Mounjaro generated $6.52 billion, a 109% increase from the previous year, while Zepbound posted $3.59 billion in sales, marking a 184% year-over-year jump, as per the CNBC report.Analysts expect demand to grow further as insurance coverage expands and regulatory approvals increase. Eli Lilly is also planning to release an oral version of its popular drugs next year, offering a more convenient alternative to injections and easier production for the company, as per the report.ALSO READ: Jensen Huang at all-hands meet - Nvidia saved the world, a bad quarter could’ve broken everything Industry experts predict that Eli Lilly will remain a dominant player in the weight loss drug market, which could be worth over $150 billion by the early 2030s, reported CNBC.Despite Eli Lilly’s recent rise, competitors remain formidable. Novo Nordisk continues to challenge its position, and Pfizer recently made a major push by winning a $10 billion bidding war with Novo Nordisk for obesity drugmaker Metsera, as per the report.Eli Lilly’s journey began in 1876, when the pharmaceutical chemist and Union veteran founded the company. It has a long history of pioneering diabetes treatments, including introducing the world’s first commercial insulin in 1923, as per the CNBC report. Over the decades, the company has produced widely successful drugs such as Prozac and the earliest polio vaccine.The company’s breakthrough came in May 2022 with the approval of tirzepatide for diabetes, marketed as Mounjaro, as per CNBC. This treatment competes with Novo Nordisk’s diabetes injection Ozempic but uses a dual-hormone approach, imitating GLP-1 and GIP hormones that reduce appetite and improve sugar and fat metabolism, according to the report. Mounjaro quickly achieved blockbuster status, generating over $1 billion in its first full year, as per the CNBC report. Eli Lilly later secured approval to treat obesity with tirzepatide under the brand Zepbound, now competing directly with Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, as per the report. The twin success of Mounjaro and Zepbound has positioned Eli Lilly as a leader in both the diabetes and weight loss markets, cementing its rise to a historic market milestone, as per the report.Strong sales of its diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss injection Zepbound have driven a 36% increase in stock price.Novo Nordisk and Pfizer remain strong rivals in the diabetes and obesity drug space.

[TITLE]Healthcare ETFs to Buy as Big Pharma Rapidly Integrates AI:
[TEXT]
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer confined to the tech sector; it is being aggressively integrated across all industries, from defense to food processing, with healthcare being no exception. Over the past couple of years, AI integration in the U.S. healthcare industry has increased manifold. According to an IDC report commissioned by Microsoft and released in March 2024, 79% of healthcare organizations were already utilizing AI technology.

This rapid integration has been evident through strategic partnerships between major pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly LLY, Johnson & Johnson JNJ and AbbVie ABBV, and AI-centric tech giants like Palantir PLTR and Nvidia NVDA.

By accelerating drug discovery, streamlining clinical trials, and automating administrative tasks, these AI collaborations are expected to cut billions in costs, enhance operational efficiency and enable faster breakthroughs. This, in turn, is likely to bolster the underlying healthcare stocks and, by extension, strengthen the performance of healthcare exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide exposure to them.

Now, before suggesting healthcare ETFs that you may consider adding to your portfolio to benefit from AI-driven growth in the sector, let’s take a closer look at these partnerships to understand how AI is transforming the healthcare industry.

Notable Pharma-Tech Collaborations

Big Pharma's accelerated AI adoption is best illustrated by its strategic collaborations with AI-centric tech stocks:

• In October 2025, it was announced that Eli Lilly is partnering with NVIDIA to build an "AI Factory," leveraging the NVIDIA Blackwell DGX SuperPOD to power the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to drug discovery. This is aimed at compressing decades of research into instantly accessible intelligence, dramatically accelerating the time from target identification to clinical candidate.

• JNJ has been working with NVIDIA for more than a year to scale AI for use in surgery. This collaboration is aimed at delivering real-time analysis and AI-powered insights within the operating room, using advanced computing platforms to enhance surgical decision-making and training.

In October 2025, the company revealed that it is using an AI-driven simulation to train clinical teams on the MONARCH robotic platform for urology. To achieve this, JNJ is leveraging NVIDIA’s Isaac and Omniverse platforms to create high-fidelity digital twins of the system and patient anatomy, enabling teams to practice robot setup and simulate kidney stone procedures in a virtual operating room. The company is also using NVIDIA Cosmos for generating accurate, physics-based synthetic data, enhancing learning and procedure planning prior to surgery.

[TITLE]Salarius Pharmaceuticals Cites Errors on S&P CapIQ Platform Following Merger with Decoy Therapeutics, Affirms Its Shares Continue to Trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market Under the Symbol “SLRX”:
[TEXT]
HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SLRX) (Salarius or the Company) cites an error on the S&P CapIQ platform and reiterates that its common stock continues to trade uninterrupted on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the stock ticker “SLRX.”

S&P CapIQ inaccurately characterized the Salarius Pharmaceuticals and Decoy Therapeutics merger and inaccurately stated that the Company had been delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company is working to have this inaccurate information corrected. Similar inaccuracies that appeared on Yahoo Finance were corrected earlier this week.

On November 13, 2025, Salarius completed an underwritten public offering raising gross proceeds of $8 million and consummated the previously announced merger with Decoy Therapeutics (Decoy). As of the date of this release, the combined company had pro forma cash of approximately $14 million and approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock outstanding. The company is focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

[TITLE]The Wistar Institute Receives $600,000 Grant to Support Biomedical Technician Training Pre-apprenticeship For Philadelphia Adults Seeking Career Pivot & Regional Community College Students:
[TEXT]
Philadelphia, PA, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Wistar Institute Hubert J.P. Schoemaker Education and Training Center can continue offering its signature Biomedical Technician Training (BTT) Pre-apprenticeship Program to bolster job opportunities in the life science sector thanks to a recent $600,000 grant from the William Penn Foundation.

The newly awarded grant allows Wistar to continue providing access to the increasingly in-demand pre-apprenticeship for community college students and adults throughout the greater Philadelphia region. While the William Penn Foundation first supported the Wistar Institute almost 60 years ago, this is the first William Penn Foundation grant awarded to The Wistar Institute’s Hubert J.P. Schoemaker Education and Training Center.

“Our established BTT Program, in its 25th year, has a proven record of providing the necessary foundational knowledge and hands-on lab training required for technicians and research assistants in the life sciences,” explained Dean of Biomedical Studies Kristy Shuda McGuire, M.S., Ph.D. “The BTT Pre-apprenticeship Program gives both community college students and adults an entry to pursue life-sustaining careers in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries in Philadelphia and beyond.”

Created in 2000, The Wistar Institute BTT Pre-apprenticeship Program was initially designed as a two-summer, hands-on, mentored, technician training opportunity that prepared community college students for positions in biomedical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical laboratories.

In 2021 Wistar accelerated the Program to one summer and has expanded it to now include six regional community colleges. Wistar also offers additional cohorts to extend the Program’s reach to adults with a high school diploma who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in the life sciences. Another grant from the National Science Foundation, received in 2024, will bring the Program to additional community colleges in New Jersey and Delaware through Summer 2027, for a total of eight community colleges covering at least 10 counties in three states.

Students complete initial training and then apply and learn more specialized techniques in laboratory experiences at The Wistar Institute and other area academic and industry partner sites.

“The BTT Program offers an accelerated pathway to careers that are of critical importance to life science organizations throughout the region,” explained Dr. Shuda McGuire. “This funding from the William Penn Foundation enables us to continue offering the Program and building a skilled workforce to strengthen the life science industry in our region.”

“The Wistar Institute’s BTT Program opens doors to help people to access workforce training in the high-growth biomedical sciences sector,” said Elliot Weinbaum, Chief Philanthropy Officer at the William Penn Foundation. “Through investments in programs like BTT, we are focused on strengthening the most promising programs that help Philadelphians to gain the skills they need for better-paying, family-sustaining jobs.”

[TITLE]Four Lessons From $4 Billion in Impact-focused Giving:
[TEXT]
Photo by Frames For Your Heart via Unsplash

In 2011, when we began what would eventually become Coefficient Giving, we set out to explore a big question: If someone had billions of dollars to give, what should they fund to make the greatest positive difference?

Previously called Open Philanthropy, we started as a partnership between Good Ventures, the foundation of Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz, and GiveWell, a nonprofit dedicated to finding and supporting evidence-backed charities that save or improve lives the most per dollar. Our goal was to expand GiveWell’s focus on cost-effectiveness beyond the areas that already had a lot of evidence, with a greater openness to cause areas beyond global health and to high-risk, high-reward opportunities.

From the beginning, our vision wasn’t just to maximize the impact of Cari and Dustin's giving, but to make the journey easier for other philanthropists who might want to follow a similar approach. We recently changed our name from Open Philanthropy to Coefficient Giving to signal our growing work with other donors. And after distributing more than $4 billion across a wide range of issues, now is an appropriate moment to reflect on some lessons we've learned

[TITLE]Why Medical Tourism Is Becoming a Family Lifeline:
[TEXT]
Medical Tourism Is the New Middle-Class Healthcare Hack

I did not come to Thailand expecting a lesson in how broken the American healthcare system truly is. I came because my son needed braces, and back home, the quote nearly made me stop breathing. Almost four thousand dollars for a mouthful of metal. Four thousand for something his dentist described as “routine.” Four thousand for a child who still loses his shoes at school and asks for snacks every thirty minutes.

Still, taking care of your kids is not optional. So I did what most American parents do. I tightened my budget. I shifted bills. I convinced myself I would figure it out. That is what families do. We stretch.

The Moment I Started Considering Care Abroad

Eventually, after months of stretching, something in me snapped. I started researching alternatives. I looked at Mexico first, then Colombia. Then someone in a Facebook parenting group mentioned Bangkok. She said her daughter got braces there for less than what she paid for a semester of piano lessons. She said the clinic was spotless and the staff were kind. She said it changed everything for her budget.

Honestly, at first, it sounded unbelievable. But the more I read, the more it made sense. Studies that compare health costs across countries, like this OECD dataset, show how drastically prices differ: https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm. Thailand has become a global medical hub, known for dental work, cosmetic surgery, fertility treatments, and full-body checkups. Families from Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Asia fly there for modern, safe, and predictable care. And slowly, American families have started to join them.

The Price Difference Between U.S. and Thailand Care

I booked the trip.

Walking into that Bangkok clinic felt like stepping into a different version of what healthcare could be. The lobby was bright and airy. The staff greeted us like we were guests, not case files. The receptionist spoke softly, smiled easily, and handed my son a sticker before she handed me a clipboard. No frantic phones were ringing. No frustrated patients arguing

India is quietly becoming a surprising favourite for global patients, and even Americans may soon join that list in bigger numbers. With long hospital queues and soaring medical bills in the West, a growing number of people are looking for faster, safer and more affordable alternatives. Apollo neurologist Dr Sudhir Kumar believes India already offers that edge — and he laid out exactly why in a detailed post on X.Dr Sudhir Kumar listed three major advantages that set India apart. He said patients can access doctors, including superspecialists, far more quickly, often getting appointments within a day. Diagnostic tests like MRIs, CT scans and lab investigations also come through much faster, with minimal waiting time. And the biggest draw for many: India’s medical costs remain significantly lower, from routine blood work to complicated surgeries.He pointed out that this efficiency exists despite India having fewer doctors, fewer hospital beds and fewer MRI machines per capita than the US. According to him, a large, competitive healthcare ecosystem and high patient throughput help keep costs controlled and wait times short.Dr Sudhir Kumar also noted that NRIs and international patients have been travelling to India for years for affordable, high-quality treatment. With rising healthcare expenses and long delays in several Western countries, he believes more Americans may soon look to India for timely and cost-effective care, a trend already reflected in medical tourism data.To highlight the price gap, he shared a chart from the Economic Times using data sourced from KPMG and Policybazaar.com. It compared the cost of major procedures in both countries. A coronary artery bypass grafting, which can cost between $70,000 and $150,000 in the US, is priced at $5,000 to $8,000 in India. Knee replacements, which run up to $50,000 in America, cost $4,000 to $6,000 here.The gap widens further for organ transplants. A liver transplant that could cost more than $300,000 in the US is available in India for $40,000 to $60,000. Similarly, kidney transplants priced between $200,000 and $300,000 in America cost between $7,000 and $12,000 in India. Even IVF, one of the most sought-after procedures, is far more affordable, costing $2,000 to $5,000 per cycle compared to $12,000 to $15,000 in the US. All figures were calculated with a US dollar–rupee exchange rate of 88.45 as of 20 November 2025. The data also noted that actual prices can vary depending on the city, hospital, patient’s health and duration of stay.

: Eli Lilly made history on Friday by briefly reaching a $1 trillion market capitalization, becoming the first health-care company to join the exclusive club of trillion-dollar companies, a group previously dominated by tech giants, as per a report.Shares of the Indianapolis-based drugmaker touched the milestone in morning trading before retreating, and then trading around $1,048, as per a CNBC report. LLY stock has climbed more than 36% this year, fueled by the runaway success of its diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight loss injection Zepbound, as per the report. Investors have applauded Eli Lilly for gaining ground over its chief rival Novo Nordisk in the highly competitive GLP-1 drug market, reported CNBC.ALSO READ: Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounds alarm: Cryptocurrency Bitcoin price at $60,000 could send BTC traders running The soaring demand for the treatments has translated into impressive revenue growth. In the third quarter, Mounjaro generated $6.52 billion, a 109% increase from the previous year, while Zepbound posted $3.59 billion in sales, marking a 184% year-over-year jump, as per the CNBC report.Analysts expect demand to grow further as insurance coverage expands and regulatory approvals increase. Eli Lilly is also planning to release an oral version of its popular drugs next year, offering a more convenient alternative to injections and easier production for the company, as per the report.ALSO READ: Jensen Huang at all-hands meet - Nvidia saved the world, a bad quarter could’ve broken everything Industry experts predict that Eli Lilly will remain a dominant player in the weight loss drug market, which could be worth over $150 billion by the early 2030s, reported CNBC.Despite Eli Lilly’s recent rise, competitors remain formidable. Novo Nordisk continues to challenge its position, and Pfizer recently made a major push by winning a $10 billion bidding war with Novo Nordisk for obesity drugmaker Metsera, as per the report.Eli Lilly’s journey began in 1876, when the pharmaceutical chemist and Union veteran founded the company. It has a long history of pioneering diabetes treatments, including introducing the world’s first commercial insulin in 1923, as per the CNBC report. Over the decades, the company has produced widely successful drugs such as Prozac and the earliest polio vaccine.The company’s breakthrough came in May 2022 with the approval of tirzepatide for diabetes, marketed as Mounjaro, as per CNBC. This treatment competes with Novo Nordisk’s diabetes injection Ozempic but uses a dual-hormone approach, imitating GLP-1 and GIP hormones that reduce appetite and improve sugar and fat metabolism, according to the report. Mounjaro quickly achieved blockbuster status, generating over $1 billion in its first full year, as per the CNBC report. Eli Lilly later secured approval to treat obesity with tirzepatide under the brand Zepbound, now competing directly with Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, as per the report. The twin success of Mounjaro and Zepbound has positioned Eli Lilly as a leader in both the diabetes and weight loss markets, cementing its rise to a historic market milestone, as per the report.Strong sales of its diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss injection Zepbound have driven a 36% increase in stock price.Novo Nordisk and Pfizer remain strong rivals in the diabetes and obesity drug space.
