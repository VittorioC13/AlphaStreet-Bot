[TITLE]Amazon invests over $1 billion to raise employee pay, lower healthcare costs:
[TEXT]
Amazon.com said on Wednesday it is investing more than $1 billion to raise pay and lower healthcare costs for U.S. fulfillment and transportation employees, pushing up the average total compensation to over $30 an hour including benefits.

The technology giant said the average pay would increase to more than $23 per hour, adding that full-time employees will see their pay increase by $1,600 per year, on average.

The company is lowering the cost of its entry-level health care plan to $5 per week and $5 for co-pays, starting in 2026, representing a 34 per cent drop in weekly contributions from employees.

Amazon had more than 1.5 million full-time and part-time employees at the end of last year. The company also hires temporary workers and independent contractors seasonally, particularly around the crucial holiday season.

Last year, Amazon workers at seven U.S. facilities had walked off the job during the holiday shopping rush, after union officials said the retailer had failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. Employees were protesting what they said was Amazon's unfair treatment of its workers.

In December, Amazon also agreed to implement safety measures at all of its U.S. facilities to settle a federal agency's claims that it failed to prevent workers from developing back problems and other ergonomic injuries.

[TITLE]U.S. Healthcare System Seriously Threatened by Private Equity Takeover:
[TEXT]
The health of many Americans is seriously under threat because private equity firms are taking over hospitals. These private equity firms have taken over some 450 hospitals across the United States.

Private equity firm Steward had acquired over 37 hospitals in the United States alone.

Besides hospitals, reports state that the takeover has extended into the acquisitions of 750 nursing homes, 200 emergency set-ups, 5,779 doctor’s practices and two-thirds of the country’s air ambulances.

In this growing takeover trend, over the last 10 years, these private equity investors have paid out around $1 trillion in the last 10 years.

Succinctly put by Massachusetts State Senator Cindy Friedman:

“Private equity is the complete opposite of the delivery of healthcare…” She goes on to say “… make money, leave, make it however you want, make it for people who are interested in making money, and then you have got healthcare, which is all

[TITLE]Amazon invests over $1 billion to raise employee pay, lower healthcare costs:
[TEXT]
Amazon.com said on Wednesday it is investing more than $1 billion to raise pay and lower healthcare costs for U.S. fulfillment and transportation employees, pushing up the average total compensation to over $30 an hour including benefits.

The technology giant said the average pay would increase to more than $23 per hour, adding that full-time employees will see their pay increase by $1,600 per year, on average.

The company is lowering the cost of its entry-level health care plan to $5 per week and $5 for co-pays, starting in 2026, representing a 34 per cent drop in weekly contributions from employees.

Amazon had more than 1.5 million full-time and part-time employees at the end of last year. The company also hires temporary workers and independent contractors seasonally, particularly around the crucial holiday season.

Last year, Amazon workers at seven U.S. facilities had walked off the job during the holiday shopping rush, after union officials said the retailer had failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. Employees were protesting what they said was Amazon's unfair treatment of its workers.

In December, Amazon also agreed to implement safety measures at all of its U.S. facilities to settle a federal agency's claims that it failed to prevent workers from developing back problems and other ergonomic injuries.
