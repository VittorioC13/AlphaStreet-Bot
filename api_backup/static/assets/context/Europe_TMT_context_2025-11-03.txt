[TITLE]Trump Family Delves Deeper Into Crypto With Truth Social Prediction Market Feature:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) says it will soon roll out a prediction market feature for Truth Social in partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com.

The company majority-owned by President Donald Trump and his family said on Tuesday that the feature, Truth Predict, would enable Truth Social users to bet on the outcome of everything from elections to sporting events within the application.

“For too long, global elites have closely controlled these markets – with Truth Predict, we’re democratizing information and empowering everyday Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, turning free speech into actionable foresight,” Trump Media Chair Devin Nunes said.

Truth Predict event contracts would be offered through Crypto.com Derivatives North America, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-registered arm of the exchange, Trump Media said. The company also said that Crypto.com’s native token CRO would be required to trade Truth Predict event contracts, adding that it would enable the conversion of its in-app reward tokens, called Truth gems, into CRO.

CRO spiked 6% on the news from $0.15 to nearly $0.17, but has since given up these gains, trading most recently just below $0.15.

Trump Media said beta testing of Truth Predict would begin “in the near future,” followed by a full U.S. launch. The feature would also be made available to its global audience after all global requirements have been met, the company added.

Truth Predict would follow an existing partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com, which has seen CRO used as a utility token on Truth Social and its video streaming platform, Truth+. Trump Media has also partnered with Crypto.com to launch a CRO treasury company.

Trending: Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the $36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property

Prediction markets entered the mainstream during last year’s presidential election, attracting billions in bets and mentions alongside traditional polls. The momentum has continued this year with the two leading platforms, Polymarket and Kalshi, reaching a combined record monthly volume of $1.44 billion last month.

Donald Trump Jr. serves as an adviser to Polymarket and Kalshi. Polymarket received investments from the Trump Jr.-backed 1789 Capital last year and earlier this year. Truth Predict, however, puts the Trump family in competition with Polymarket and Kalshi.

[TITLE]Chat control proposal fails again after massive public opposition:
[TEXT]
The European Union Council has once again retreated from its controversial Chat Control proposal, a plan that would have required widespread scanning of encrypted messages. The withdrawal by the current Danish presidency represents yet another chapter in a long-running battle between privacy advocates and lawmakers who believe they can compromise encryption in the name of public safety. While this latest defeat is a victory for digital rights, the fight is far from over, and the fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology continues to plague policy discussions across Europe.

User A User B End-to-End Encrypted Message 🔒 Secure Communication 👁️ Scanning Blocked

A zombie proposal that refuses to die

Since its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a zombie proposal, repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and more than 80 civil society organizations have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.

The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the Danish presidency follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.

What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a “backdoor” into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they’re encrypted or after they’re decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a dangerous misunderstanding of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.

The technical impossibility of “safe” scanning

The core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.

Client-side scanning, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users’ devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.

Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is no way to create a scanning system that only works for “good guys.” Apple learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.

Client-Side Scanning: The Security Risk Secure Encrypted Device 🔒 ✓ Messages encrypted ✓ Privacy protected ✓ No backdoors ✓ User control Secure Communication Device with Scanning ⚠️ ✗ Scanning enabled ✗ Privacy compromised ✗ Backdoor exists ✗ Vulnerable to abuse Security Risk Chat Control

Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. Countries around the world are watching the EU’s actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they’re simply following Europe’s lead in implementing “reasonable” content moderation.

Public pressure and the power of resistance

The withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the critical importance of sustained public engagement in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned

[TITLE]Reflections on My Tech Career – Part 1:
[TEXT]
I’ve been lucky enough to have had a successful career as a software developer. Spanning six companies and thirty-seven years I’ve had the opportunity to work on Elastic Reality, Xbox, Windows, Steam, Internet Explorer, dozens of games, and Chrome, and create a blog whose investigative reporting and ETW tutorial articles have been read over five million times.

I was recently explaining to a friend how I got my start in this industry and I decided that I should write it down, if only to clarify in my mind how it all happened. I don’t necessarily recommend my career path, but there may be other people out there for whom it is the right way to go. Or, more likely, perhaps there will be a few ideas in here that could inspire somebody’s career path or help them avoid mistakes.

Here goes.

Learning to Program – 1983 to present

The most important initial detail is that I am a university dropout. During second-year university I stopped going to school. I lacked a support network of friends and was probably depressed and lonely and the more classes I skipped the harder it got to resume attending. I was also busying myself with disassembling the Apple ][ ROMs and other experimental programming projects. At the end of the year UBC politely told me that I was not permitted to continue attending. Oops. My parents were horrified.

Luckily through some convenient nepotism (thanks Lance!) I got an unskilled union desk job in a time when living in Vancouver was affordable. I made friends at work and got out of my lonely and depressed stage. The job paid well enough that I didn’t need to work a full 40 hours so I had lots of spare time.

I bought an Amiga computer and spent all my free time reading the Amiga, 68000, and 68881 reference manuals, C language tutorials, and whatever other sources of information there were in the pre-internet mid-80s. My dream was to become a video-game programmer. I spent hours on my Amiga and also continued programming on my 6502-based Apple ][ and at some point around 1986 I interviewed for a job at a local game-programming company called Distinctive Software.

They turned me down. I didn’t have enough experience or education.

At this time I discovered the Mandelbrot set. This is an infinitely detailed mathematical object that can be fascinating and beautiful to explore, but doing so was very compute intensive, especially on circa-1986 hardware. It was particularly slow if you used software floating-point to do the calculations, which all of the explorer programs were doing. I immediately knew that by discarding the flexibility of a floating-point exponent and using fixed-point numbers (exactly three bits to the left of the binary point) and by coding in assembly language I could make things run at least an order of magnitude faster. Note that this project and my subsequent one were both done in collaboration with a friend but I’ve omitted any other mention of him to simplify the story – sorry Steve!

Estimating

At this point I leveraged a skill that would serve me well throughout my career. I wrote up what the basic assembly-language calculation would look like, precisely estimated how many clock cycles it would take for that loop to execute (easy in those in-order processing days), estimated how many loops would need to execute to render an initial image, and on the back of an envelope calculated that the first image should take

[TITLE]Saudi Arabia, UAE Pour Over $130 B Into AI To Offset Oil Price Risks:
[TEXT]
Previously, we reported that Saudi Arabia is digging in for a "long and shallow" oil price war as it looks to regain market share from rivals like U.S. shale producers and OPEC+ members who have been exceeding their production quotas. This comes after Saudi Arabia made significant production sacrifices to support prices for over three years, which allowed competitors to increase their output. Saudi Arabia has also been hedging its oil price bets by rapidly diversifying its economy away from fossil fuels in recent years, expanding into areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), sports and tourism. Indeed, Saudi Arabia's Minister for Investment Khalid Al Falih has revealed that non-oil activities now drive more than half the country’s GDP, with that percentage growing.

And, the battle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for Middle East AI supremacy is quickly heating up. The two countries are not only spending heavily to beef up their AI infrastructure, including building some of the world’s largest data center clusters, but are also forming strategic alliances with U.S. tech giants. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 strategy has singled out AI as vital to the country’s economic transformation, with 70% of its goals involving data and AI.

Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence company Humain has launched a $10 billion venture capital fund called Humain Ventures dedicated to investing in AI startups across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Humain Ventures is a key part of Saudi Arabia's larger strategy to become a global hub for AI, and a key part of its Vision 2030 plan for economic diversification. Launched earlier in the current year, Humain has already begun deploying capital into AI infrastructure projects. In pursuit of its AI ambitions, Humain also entered into significant partnerships with major U.S. technology companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud service AWS, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and giant data center REIT Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX).

Back in May, Oracle announced a $14 billion investment in Saudi Arabia's digital cloud and AI infrastructure over 10 years, as part of its commitment to the Kingdom's Vision 2030. This investment will expand the company's cloud and AI presence by building a comprehensive network of data centers, including existing regions in Riyadh and Jeddah and planned expansions in NEOM and Dammam. AWS and Humain have announced a joint $5 billion investment to build an AI zone in the Kingdom. Meanwhile, Equinix has announced plans to build a $1 billion data center in Saudi Arabia to meet surging demand for AI, cloud and enterprise workloads.

The UAE has also launched a slew of AI investments. Last year, the Abu Dhabi government launched MGX, a technology investment company specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced technologies. The fund was founded as a partnership between Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, and the AI and cloud computing company G42. MGX focuses on AI infrastructure (data centers and connectivity), Semiconductors (chip design and manufacturing)

Core AI technologies and applications (software, data, and robotics). At its launch, MGX had a target of managing over $100 billion in assets, making it one of the largest funds in the world dedicated to AI.

Since its March 2024 launch, MGX has made several high-profile moves, showcasing its ambition to become a major player in the global AI industry. In September 2024, MGX formed a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) dubbed the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to invest up to $100 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure. Nvidia is a key partner of GAIIP, offering its expertise in AI factories and data centers. Meanwhile, Stargate UAE is a massive AI data center cluster in Abu Dhabi, developed in partnership between the Emirati AI firm G42 and US tech giants like OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Stargate UAE is the first international deployment of OpenAI's ambitious global AI infrastructure initiative, also named "Stargate". Positioned as a "national infrastructure," Stargate UAE will provide the country with its own powerful and secure AI capabilities as part of the UAE's broader strategy to diversify its economy and reduce reliance on external technology infrastructure. The project's central feature is a 1-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster, with an initial 200-megawatt phase planned to be operational by 2026. This facility will be equipped with advanced Nvidia hardware to meet the massive computational demands of training and running large AI models.

Further, Abu Dhabi has unveiled plans to invest AED 13 billion (equivalent to $3.54 billion) in its Digital Strategy 2025–2027, with the goal of becoming the world's first fully "AI-native" government by 2027. The strategy aims to automate 100% of all government processes and integrate AI into all digital services.

[TITLE]What Trump and Xi Did—and Didn’t—Agree To:
[TEXT]
Most of the details on the talks came from Trump, who spoke to reporters on Air Force One en route back to Washington and published a lengthy Truth Social post touting breakthroughs on soybeans, energy, rare earths, and fentanyl. Beijing’s readout was more circumspect, simply saying that the two leaders had an “in-depth exchange of views on important economic and trade issues, and reached consensus on solving various issues” and that the two sides “should work out and finalize the follow-up steps as soon as possible.” China’s Ministry of Commerce, however, confirmed some details that Trump laid out.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping used their first meeting since Trump returned to office to agree to a temporary truce on their trade tensions, stopping short of a full agreement but dialing back some of their harshest mutual countermeasures. It leaves the U.S.-China trade relationship only slightly worse than it was one year ago but less contentious than it could be.

[TITLE]5G in edge computing: Benefits, applications and challenges:
[TEXT]
Most telecom experts agree that the future of 5G technology lies in edge computing, in which 5G wireless networks with distributed computing resources are placed near the "edge" of the network or close to where data is generated.

The goal of 5G edge computing is to reduce latencies or delays so that organizations can process more data faster or store data locally for reliability or regulatory reasons. 5G, with its higher bandwidth, provides the connectivity backbone that makes edge deployments much more viable. It brings computing closer to the source, so the two together can support demanding new applications.

What is 5G edge computing? 5G edge computing is a paradigm in which computing, storage and network functions are placed closer to users or data sources, such as sensors, rather than being concentrated in remote data centers. "5G is the wireless protocol that we use to transmit over our devices to a tower and ultimately base station," said Jack Fritz, principal in Deloitte Consulting's technology, media and telecommunications practice. He added that combining 5G with edge technology brings more computing power to users' wireless applications. A key architectural model under 5G edge computing is multi-access edge computing (MEC), sometimes called mobile edge computing. MEC is defined by telecom standards-setting bodies European Telecommunications Standards Institute and Third Generation Partnership Project to provide an IT service environment, including computing, storage and network at the edge, enabling applications and services to run there with less latency, improved bandwidth efficiency and more control over where data is stored. MEC also supports multiple access technologies, including cellular, Wi-Fi and other technologies, so it is not limited to just one kind of network link. The 5G standard contains specifications for how to support edge computing in the 5G core -- that is, a 5G network's central control and management software -- as well as the radio access network. The architecture generally involves the following: Edge application servers deployed at edge nodes to host applications and services.

, which reside on user devices and communicate with edge enabler servers so that the device can discover and connect with edge services. User-plane function, which plays a key role in data transfer and packet processing, enabling traffic to be broken out or anchored locally so that data doesn't always have to travel back to core network servers. Key components Edge computing typically involves several components, including the following: Edge devices. These are the actual endpoints generating or consuming data. Examples include IoT smart sensors, cameras, vehicles, smartphones and robots that connect to edge nodes for processing.

Cloud integration layer. This layer of interfaces links the edge with central cloud data centers for coordination, backup and large-scale analytics.

Benefits of 5G in edge computing When 5G networks are paired with edge computing, applications can operate with faster responsiveness, higher reliability and greater efficiency than with traditional cloud models. The 5G-edge combination also supports real-time decision-making, enables more immersive experiences and provides the infrastructure for industries such as healthcare, transportation and manufacturing to innovate at scale. Among the benefits of 5G edge computing are the following: Lower latency. Because processing happens near the device rather than in faraway cloud servers, response times are drastically shortened. This makes applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), remote surgery and autonomous vehicles feasible, since even milliseconds of delay can make the difference between success and failure.

Data privacy and security. Processing sensitive information at or near its source helps organizations comply with data sovereignty laws and reduces the risk of exposure during long-distance transfers. "From the context of the cyber side, I can now have a resilient network using 5G and AI," said Dave Krauthamer, field CTO of QuSecure, which makes a post-quantum cryptography platform. "One of the elements we have is the ability to enhance the cryptographic fabric in real time based on threat patterns."

Applications of 5G in edge computing Among the applications that take advantage of the responsiveness, reliability and efficiency of 5G in edge computing are the following: Autonomous vehicles and intelligent transport.

[TITLE]Tech-first ministry seeks to redefine German efficiency – DW – 11/01/2025:
[TEXT]
Germany is renowned for its bureaucracy, paperwork and continued use of fax machines well into the 21st century. For the first time, the country also has a minister for digitalization and modernization. Will that help?

Anyone in Germany who wants a new identification card or to register a car or apply for family benefits needs an awful lot of patience. They'll have to fill out various forms that request all sorts of information. They may need to go in person to several different government agencies or offices. Everything is complex; everything takes time.

In 2017, though, the German federal government committed to digitizing these time-consuming tasks, and it is now possible to complete many of them online.

Still, when it comes to digital services, Germany lags far behind many other EU member states. The country ranks 21st out of the bloc's 27 countries on an index compiled by the national digital association Bitkom, which measures digital progress across the European Union.

Government modernization minister

Now, a figure from the private sector, Karsten Wildberger, has been given the job of speeding things up. The 56-year-old is the country's first ever federal minister for digitalization and government modernization.

Wildberger has been on the job for six months; before that, he was the high-paid chief executive of the major consumer electronics chain MediaMarktSaturn.

His first job as a minister was to establish the ministry. A building in western Berlin currently serves as a temporary headquarters. The ground floor used to house a car dealership. His staff were drawn from five other ministries and the chancellor's office. Now everything from ensuring federal cybersecurity to organizing how Germans can apply for a driver's license online happens under one roof. If another federal ministry launches a digital project, then Wildberger's ministry has a say in that, too.

At a recent conference in Berlin, Wildberger complained that he often heard people talking about how things should be done and what they wanted done. He'd prefer to hear about how they were going to get it done, he said, and he'd like them to move more quickly.

Wildberger knows that it's not going to be possible fix Germany's allergy to digital progress overnight. "There's no switch you can simply flip and then everything's digital and everything's fine," he warned in his first speech to the German parliament, the Bundestag, in May. "Digitalization is a process that requires time, courage, expertise, patience and partners."

A long list

At the top of Wildberger's list of priorities is expanding the availability of faster internet throughout Germany. There's a significant backlog, and the telecommunications companies are responsible. They only invest where it's profitable for them, and that is primarily in densely populated areas. Despite federal financial aid and regulatory pressure, little has changed in that respect.

Wildberger wants to tackle data policy, artificial intelligence and digital business models in Germany, too. He is also concerned that the country's obsession with data protection and privacy has been a brake on innovation.

But perhaps the most difficult part of his job will be bringing regional authorities into the digital fold. A lot of offices literally have shelves and shelves of paper files and folders, and all of this information needs to be digitized.

That's not even the biggest challenge. Over the past 15 to 20 years, the federal government, Germany's 16 state administrations and about 11,000 municipalities have developed their own IT systems. Many are unable to communicate with one another. There's no digital standard. Wildberger's ministry estimates that there are more than 8,000 different systems and portals in use.

"We have built an unbelievable variety of systems," Wildberger said.

Previously, the Interior Ministry was working on this. A new system called the "Deutschland Stack" or "D-stack" will offer a standardized IT infrastructure with clearly defined interfaces and cloud services. These are to become the backbone of future government services.

Following Estonia's lead

Wildberger is focusing on a few smaller projects with the aim of completing them by the next scheduled federal election, in 2029.

Online vehicle registration could become a reality. At the moment, the about 10 million registrations, deregistrations and reregistrations annually are handled by 400 specialized offices across Germany. These offices are already short of funding, so there is likely to be little resistance should the federal government take the service over.

Most German state services still use paper files Image: Monika Skolimowska/dpa/picture alliance

Wildberger said he was often confronted with the question of why Germany can't function as well as Estonia in the digital sphere. Estonia is regarded as something of a beacon of digital progress in Europe — all public services are available online.

Residents provide their data only once to government agencies, everyone has a digital ID, and ppeople are able to see who has accessed it. Government institutions share data through a standardized and decentralized system.

Germany is practically "at the other end of that spectrum," Wildberger said.

To get there, the country doesn't just need to digitize all of the paperwork it is storing — it also needs an official agreement among the federal government, the state governments and municipal authorities that allow them to share all their data. That in itself is likely to take a fair bit of time, Wildberger said.

[TITLE]DeepSeek, Qwen AI Besting ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini In AI Crypto Trading Challenge:

Chinese artificial intelligence models DeepSeek and Qwen AI are beating their U.S. counterparts in a real-money cryptocurrency trading challenge, according to financial markets-focused AI research lab Nof1.

Nof1 on Oct. 17 kicked off a contest to test the investment capabilities of popular AI models called Alpha Arena. The models were given $10,000 in starting capital, identical prompts and input data and charged with maximizing returns trading cryptocurrencies on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid.

Don't Miss:

As of Tuesday, DeepSeek V3.1 Chat has established a commanding lead over other models, growing its capital to $21,600 from its initial $10,000, a 116% gain. At a slightly distant second is the Alibaba-developed Qwen 3 Max, which has grown its capital by about 70% to nearly $17,000.

Anthropic‘s Claude 4.5 Sonnet and xAI‘s Grok 4 were most recently jostling for third and fourth with 11% and 4% returns, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, the worst performers have been Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI‘s ChatGPT 5, with losses exceeding 60%.

Nof1 said GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro have frequently opted for smaller position sizes, proving to be less aggressive than their rivals from previous test runs and the results so far.

Monad blockchain gaming ecosystem lead "Charles" suggested that being potentially trained on more cryptocurrency-native conversations on Asia-facing forums offers Chinese models an advantage. DeepSeek is also reportedly the side project of a quantitative trading firm.

Meanwhile, others have said that the Alpha Arena challenge results follow a random walk, a mathematical model describing a path composed of successive random steps. According to that theorem, the average trading position will converge to the starting point.

The Alpha Arena challenge ends on Nov. 3, suggesting that there could be time for the rankings to change significantly.

Alpha Arena is one of many experiments and studies testing the trading capabilities of AI models. In June, Stanford University researchers were able to “beat 93% of managers over a 30-year period by an average of 600%” with a model trained on only public information.
