NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market is steadying on Friday, as banks recover some of their sharp losses from the day before, and Wall Street is cruising toward the finish of a winning week.

The S&P 500 rose 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 298 points, or 0.6%, as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% higher.

This week is shaping up to be the best for the S&P 500 since the first of August, but it’s been a roller-coaster ride. Indexes careened through several jarring swings as worries built

While tensions flare with the U.S., China is charting its course for the next five years.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and the country's top leaders, known as the Central Committee, will meet next week from Monday to Thursday for a planning meeting called the "Fourth Plenum."

The gathering reminds the U.S. government, on the verge of possibly its longest shutdown in history, that China is a big believer in planning. Beijing has held the strategy-setting meeting twice every decade since the 1950s to rally the country around specific social and economic goals.

This year, China has promoted its achievements under the "14th five-year plan" despite U.S. pressure on tech and trade.

The upcoming "15th five-year plan" is particularly critical as China has laid out even longer-term ambitions for 2035, said Zong Liang, former chief researcher at the Bank of China. By then, China aims to boost per capita gross domestic product to the mid-range of developed countries, while achieving "major breakthroughs" in core technologies.

But that's getting ahead of the immediate challenges that policymakers will discuss next week: navigating increased U.S. tech restrictions, the possibility of a 100% tariff hike and lackluster domestic demand.

Rather than announce sweeping changes, Beijing is likely to double down on "reforms" to boost domestic demand — from reducing regional business barriers within China to expanding visa access, Zong said.

Following a recent ramp-up of support for high-tech industries, Beijing will likely pledge more support for homegrown semiconductors, artificial intelligence and humanoid robots. Full details aren't expected until the annual parliamentary meeting in March 2026, although a readout of next week's meeting should offer an early look at the exact priorities.

"The technology part of the [plan] should focus on two things: AI, where the adoption rate in key areas is required to reach 90% by 2030; and basic scientific research, which remains some way off the official target," Tianchen Xu, senior economist for Asia for the Economist Intelligence Unit, said in a note.

At a time when the U.S. is scaling back on its climate commitments, China has the next five years to make good on its pledge to start reducing carbon emissions after 2030.

So far, China is falling behind in its aim to reduce its emissions rate, Xu said. "We think that achieving this goal is still possible, but would require more concerted efforts on power market reform, and the weeding out of emission-intensive industries."

India’s benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty traded higher on Tuesday, led by gains in IT shares after HCLTech posted upbeat quarterly results, while easing retail inflation strengthened expectations of a potential rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India in December.The S&P BSE Sensex climbed 210.50 points, or 0.26%, to open at 82,537.55, while the NSE Nifty 50 advanced 57.30 points, or 0.23%, to start at 25,284.65.On the 30-share Sensex, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, Tata Steel, Infosys, and Reliance Industries led the gains, rising between 0.8% and 2%.Across sectors, IT stocks outperformed, with the Nifty IT index up 0.9%. Shares of HCLTech advanced 1.6% after the nation’s third-largest software exporter reaffirmed its full-year revenue growth guidance of 3%–5% and topped second-quarter revenue estimates.Broader markets also edged higher, with the smallcap and midcap indexes gaining 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.Meanwhile, India’s retail inflation fell to an eight-year low of 1.54% in September, government data showed Monday, as food prices cooled. The sharp moderation has bolstered expectations of a potential rate cut when the Reserve Bank of India meets in December.Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the market trends over the past year highlight a clear shift in investor preference. “A significant takeaway from the last one year market performance is the outperformance of large caps (Nifty up by 1.05%) and the underperformance of smallcaps (Nifty Smallcap index down by 4.77%),” he said, adding that public sector banks also stood out. “Equally significant is the outperformance of PSU banks (Nifty PSU Bank index up by 16.77%) and the huge underperformance of IT (Nifty IT down by 16.5%).”He noted that valuations have been a key driver behind these divergences. According to Vijayakumar, “IT stocks, particularly the large caps, are viewed as overvalued by the market since they are facing many headwinds and some strong structural issues. On the other hand, PSU stocks have been trading at very low valuations despite decent growth and robust balance sheets. This anomaly in valuations has been corrected by the market.”Vijayakumar expects this trend to persist but added that “in growth stocks like digital companies and renewable energy, their long-term growth potential will continue to attract investment despite high valuations.”“With Muhurat trading approaching,” he said, “there is room for a mild rally.”Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday as optimism over U.S.-China trade talks later this month was tempered by doubts about a durable deal.Early gains in MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index outside Japan and S&P 500 futures faded after initial rebounds following U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments that President Donald Trump remains on track to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.Trade tensions escalated as both nations began imposing port fees on ocean shipping firms, raising costs on global cargo routes.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.4%, while China’s CSI 300 dipped 0.1%. Taiwan led gains with a 0.8% jump as TSMC hit a record after OpenAI partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house AI chips. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.6% after Samsung projected a 32% jump in third-quarter operating profit, beating estimates. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1.2% as markets reopened after a holiday, with the dollar steady at 152.31 yen.Gold climbed 1.1% to $4,155.90 an ounce, extending record gains, while Bitcoin fell 1.9% to $113,629.29 and Ether slipped 3% to $4,161.79.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned net sellers on October 13 after four consecutive days of buying, offloading equities worth just over Rs 240 crore. Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), in contrast, remained net buyers, investing Rs 2,333.42 crore.MORE TO COME...

[TITLE]Stocks skid as fresh trade barbs knock wind out of rally:
[TEXT]
By Gregor Stuart Hunter

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Asian stocks tumbled on Tuesday, dogged by growing doubts over whether China and the U.S. could strike a tariff deal when the world's two largest economies meet later this month amid revived tensions over trade.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed early gains to fall 1.2% as S&P 500 futures slid 0.6%. The Nikkei stock index fell as much as 3%.

"Both Washington and Beijing are posturing before the November summit - escalate to de-escalate," said Marc Velan, head of investments at Lucerne Asset Management in Singapore. "Neither can afford a trade war heading into U.S. mid-terms."

Markets had earlier joined the rebound from Monday's cash session after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump remains on track to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in late October. But he added fuel to the fire in an interview in the Financial Times where he accused Beijing of trying to damage the global economy.

As negotiations between the U.S. and China intensify, the two nations will from today begin charging port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil.

Wall Street's main indexes had ended as much as 2.2% higher on Monday, led by chipmakers, after Trump struck a more conciliatory tone on trade tensions with China, reversing some of the panic from Friday when Trump announced 100% tariffs on China.

Citi analysts said they do not expect an escalation of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.

"The reason is not so much the reassuring President Trump tweet over the weekend, but the fact that China may be the only country with bargaining power, where the U.S. may have to be more flexible in its negotiation stance," Citi wrote.

But a spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said on Tuesday the U.S. cannot seek talks while also making threats, keeping markets on edge over the chances for a broader trade deal.

Beijing announced sanctions on Tuesday against five U.S.-linked subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean.

After early gains in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 2%, while in the mainland, the CSI 300 gauge of blue-chip Chinese stocks slipped 1.3%.

Asian chipmakers veered sharply between gains and losses. TSMC clung to gains after OpenAI said it has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors.

South Korea's Kospi index erased early gains, dragged by the broader selloff. The market had rallied at the start of the session, helped by Samsung Electronics', which projected a better-than-expected 32% rise in third-quarter profit, although the tech giant lost 1.7% as the day progressed.

Indian stocks rebounded into positive territory on Friday after a weak start, as losses in IT stocks, led by Infosys and Wipro on margin concerns, weighed on early trade. The Sensex and Nifty extended their rally into a third consecutive session, supported by optimism over a recovery in corporate earnings and steady foreign fund inflows.The S&P BSE Sensex rose 102.37 points, or 0.12%, to 83,617.74 in early trade, while the NSE Nifty 50 gained 42.66 points, or 0.16%, to 25,628.85.On the 30-share Sensex, Eternal HCL Technologies , Infosys, Power Grid , and Tech Mahindra were among the top laggards, slipping between 1% and 4%.Broader markets were mixed, with the midcap index down 0.3%, while small-cap shares edged up 0.1%.Among sectors, IT stocks led the decline, with the Nifty IT index falling 1.2% as Wipro and Infosys weighed on sentiment.Wipro fell 4.4% after its second-quarter results missed Street expectations. Infosys dropped nearly 2% even as the company reported a 13% year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 7,364 crore for the September quarter.Eternal shares sank 4% after the food delivery platform reported a 63% decline in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September.Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the market remains “resilient and technically strong,” with price action in leading stocks indicating short covering, noting that “even now there are big shorts in the system and the strength in the market might keep the bears on the back foot, facilitating further short covering.”Vijayakumar said that strong quarterly results from major banks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank could lend “fundamental support” to the market. “If RIL , which has been a laggard for some time now, also joins the rally, the market can sustain the momentum for some more time,” he said, adding that Muhurat trading and festive sentiment could further “add to the bullish spirits.”However, Vijayakumar cautioned that certain global risks persist. “China has been imposing restrictions on exports of rare earth metals and magnets in recent days,” he said. “China’s weaponisation of rare earths, in which it has around 90% global market share, is in response to Trump’s weaponisation of tariffs. Unfortunately, if this lingers, it will hurt all nations, including India.”Asian stocks fell on Friday, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street as signs of credit stress among U.S. regional banks rattled investor sentiment. Bonds extended their rally, while gold surged to a fresh record high as investors sought safety.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 0.9%, turning lower for the week. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1%, weighed down by a sharp decline in banking stocks.Taiwan’s benchmark slipped 0.9% despite a record quarterly profit and upbeat spending outlook from chipmaker TSMC on artificial intelligence.Chinese blue chips and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index both fell 1.4%, adding to the region’s risk-off tone.Gold touched an all-time high of $4,378 per ounce before easing on profit-taking, though it remains on track for a 7.6% weekly gain—its strongest since early 2020. Silver also climbed to a new record.On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their buying spree on October 16, purchasing equities worth a little over Rs 997 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 4,076 crore.Oil prices slipped in early trade on Friday, on track for a weekly decline amid uncertainty over global supply dynamics after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to meet in Hungary to discuss a possible resolution to the war in Ukraine.Brent crude futures dipped 8 cents, or 0.13%, to $60.98 a barrel at 0030 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures eased 9 cents, or 0.16%, to $57.37.The Indian rupee strengthened 21 paise to 87.75 against the U.S. dollar in early trade on Friday, buoyed by what traders described as heavy intervention from the central bank. The dollar index slipped to 98.22, tracking a decline in U.S. Treasury yields.
