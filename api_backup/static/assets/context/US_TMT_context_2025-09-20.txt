By joining Riviera, Olof expands the firm’s capabilities in several key ways. BaT’s longstanding presence in public company boardrooms enhances Riviera’s ability to serve clients at the very top of global enterprises. His expertise expands Riviera’s leadership in technical executive search while his European heritage and multilingual, multicultural experience will accelerate Riviera’s growth across Continental Europe and EMEA.

[TITLE]China says US TikTok deal a 'win-win', will review app's technology and IP transfers:
[TEXT]
China on Wednesday called the framework deal reached in Madrid to switch short-video app TikTok to US-controlled ownership a "win-win" and said it would review TikTok's technology exports and intellectual property licensing, in a state media editorial.Investors on both sides of the Pacific are now waiting for a call scheduled for Friday between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in which the agreement should be confirmed.Progress over the popular social media app - which counts 170 million US users - is seen as key to facilitating further talks in the coming months as the world's two largest economies chart a path beyond their current tariff truce.Reuters has reported that the deal, transferring TikTok's US assets to US owners from China's Bytedance , is similar to an agreement worked out earlier this year, but which was shelved after Trump announced steep tariffs on Chinese goods."China reached the relevant consensus with the United States on the TikTok issue because it is based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation," the official People's Daily said in a commentary.The article was signed "Zhong Sheng" or "Voice of China", a term the paper of the governing Communist Party uses to express views on foreign policy."China will review matters related to TikTok's technology exports and intellectual property licensing in accordance with the law," the commentary added.After meeting with Chinese negotiators in Madrid earlier this week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a September 17 deadline that could have disrupted the app in the US could be extended by 90 days to allow the deal to be finalised, without giving any further details.

[TITLE]Nvidia to invest US$5 billion in Intel in major boost to chipmaker’s turnaround:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK: Shares in Intel soared on Thursday (Sep 18) after Nvidia said it would invest US$5 billion in the struggling chipmaker, marking a major commitment to its turnaround efforts.

The move brings together two of the biggest names in semiconductors and follows support from both Japanese investment giant SoftBank and the US government, which last month took a rare 10 per cent equity stake in Intel.

President Donald Trump’s administration has described Intel as strategically vital given its role in powering the PC and internet revolutions, and Trump has signalled he is prepared to make similar interventions where he deems necessary.

“This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and centre into the AI game,” said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. “Along with the recent US government investment for 10 per cent, this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.”

AI COMPETITION HEATS UP

Intel has lagged rivals after missing key shifts in technology. It largely missed the smartphone boom and struggled to develop competitive hardware for artificial intelligence, while Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung cemented their dominance.

Most notably, Intel was overtaken by Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) – initially designed for gaming – became the essential building blocks of AI systems now sought by tech giants worldwide.

The partnership will focus on developing custom data centre and PC products tailored for AI applications. Nvidia will buy Intel stock at US$23.28 per share, pending regulatory approval.

Intel shares jumped more than 25 per cent on Wall Street, closing at US$31.25.

“This marks a fusion of two world-class platforms,” said Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang. “Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”

[TITLE]US Government’s Intel Stake Worth $14 Billion After Nvidia Deal:

(Bloomberg) -- The US government’s bet on Intel Corp. is paying off in a big way after a surprise investment from Nvidia Corp. sparked the biggest rally in the chipmaker’s shares in nearly four decades.

Intel shares soared as much as 28% on Thursday after the firm announced that Nvidia had agreed to invest $5 billion in the company and co-develop chips for PCs and data centers. The move comes less than a month after President Donald Trump sealed a deal for a roughly 10% US government stake in Intel.

[TITLE]Nvidia to invest $5bn in rival Intel:
[TEXT]
Chipmaker Nvidia to invest $5bn in rival Intel

Intel's stock surged more than 25% on news of the deal, which could boost the once-dominant chipmaker. Shares in Nvidia rose roughly 3%.

It will make Nvidia one of of Intel's biggest shareholders, with a roughly 4% stake in the troubled semiconductor company.

The deal, announced on Thursday, will involve a partnership between the two American companies to make personal computer and data centre chips, as demand for AI continues to surge and companies seek to power massive data centres.

Nvidia, the leading manufacturer of artificial intelligence chips, said it will buy a $5bn (£4bn) stake in Intel - a lifeline for its struggling rival on the heels of a separate investment from the US government.

Intel has struggled in recent years to build out more chip capacity. It has fallen far behind rival Nvidia, which has dominated the AI boom by offering chips that are crucial for developing the technology.

Nvidia's market cap has soared past $4 trillion while Intel's has languished at around $100bn.

The new collaboration represents "a fusion of two world-class platforms", Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, said in a statement.

"Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing," Mr Huang added.

Nvidia is motivated to invest in Intel in order to diversify some production away from other competitors - notably, Taiwan's TSMC, said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. The chip giant is "now in the mode of investing in other companies in the AI ecosystem in order to keep the momentum for the emerging technology," Mr Luria said.

Nvidia is also seeking to "support the US administration as it tried to prop up the only American company able to produce chips in the US," he added.

In late August, the Trump administration announced that the federal government would take a 10% stake in Intel.

At the time, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called the White House investment a "historic" agreement that "strengthens US leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge".

The Trump administration's announcement came after Intel became a target of US President Donald Trump. The president had accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of having problematic ties with China and called on him to resign, though Mr Tan called the accusations "misinformation".

In response to the latest investment from Nvidia, Mr Tan said: "We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the Nvidia team have placed in us."

Intel's semiconductors were once a crucial part of the popularity of personal computers. But the company has failed to maintain its dominance in Silicon Valley over the past two decades. It has most recently taken a hit from its struggles to profit from the AI surge, in contrast to Nvidia's success.

The American chipmakers' partnership comes against a backdrop of challenges in the Chinese market. Nvidia is struggling with its sales to China, as the country seeks to ramp up its domestic chip production.

Nvidia has also found itself in the crosshairs of the US-China trade war - geopolitical tensions that are weighing on its sales. Mr Huang this week said he was "disappointed" that China has reportedly ordered its top technology companies to halt purchases of the firm's AI chips.

Ray Wang, a semiconductor analyst at Futurum Group, noted that Nvidia's new stake in Intel does not appear to include an investment in Intel's contract manufacturing business - a part of the company that makes chips for other firms. Intel might not get a much-needed boost to that segment of its business.

Mr Wang added that other competitors in the chip sector - notably, AMD and TSMC - stand to suffer from the deal.

[TITLE]“Earthquake” in Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia invests $5 billion in Intel, shaking up the balance:
[TEXT]
Newsroom September 18 03:34

Nvidia and Intel have entered into a “mega-deal,” with Nvidia announcing a $5 billion investment in Intel. Both companies will collaborate on developing microchips for computers and data centers, in a surprising move since it strengthens a key competitor.

Nvidia will purchase Intel shares at $23.28 each. Intel will integrate Nvidia’s graphics technology into upcoming PC chips and will supply its processors for data center products based on Nvidia hardware.

The two companies have not provided a timeline for the release of the first products and clarified that this announcement does not affect their future plans.

Intel’s stock “soared” as much as 26% in pre-market trading.

This new funding for Intel follows an approximately 10% investment by the U.S. government in August, with Donald Trump taking on a role as “backer.” In addition, Japan’s SoftBank made an emergency $2 billion investment last month, while Intel has also been raising capital through asset sales. Intel’s current operations are struggling from market share losses and cannot bear the costs of producing advanced chips.

This collaboration highlights the shifting power dynamics in the computer and artificial intelligence industries. Intel gains financial backing and access to top-tier technology from a company it once considered “second-rate.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the partnership links Nvidia’s AI ecosystem with Intel’s x86 architecture, creating “a foundation for the next era of computing.”

Intel will provide PC microchips that combine general processing with Nvidia’s powerful graphics in order to compete with AMD, Nvidia’s main graphics rival. In data centers, Intel will supply processors for products incorporating Nvidia’s AI units.

Nvidia continues to design its own processors using Arm Holdings technology, with no changes to its corporate roadmap. With a market cap exceeding $4 trillion, Nvidia’s investment in Intel represents less than 5% of its value.

Nvidia is largely defining the industry’s future through its dominance in AI computing. The demand for new chips to power services such as ChatGPT was anticipated and executed by Nvidia before its competitors. In 2025, Nvidia is projected to generate about $200 billion in revenue, gradually surpassing Intel’s annual performance.

Intel, which once dominated the industry through its advanced manufacturing technology, has failed to develop competitive AI accelerators and now relies on TSMC for producing its top products. Under the leadership of Lip Boo Tan, Intel is moving toward a more open strategy, seeking partnerships and offering third parties access to its manufacturing facilities.
