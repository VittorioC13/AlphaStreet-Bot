[TITLE]The Net Zero Consensus Is Breaking Down in Britain:
[TEXT]
Once upon a time the promise of Net Zero enjoyed such universal support that a Tory government signed the UK’s Net Zero pledge into law. Today, the Tories say they’d scrap it – while alarm bells are ringing as the costs of the policy become clearer.

In June 2019, Prime Minister Theresa May passed a law – with near unanimous parliamentary backing and pretty much no debate – committing the UK to achieve Net Zero by 2050.

She hailed the move as a “historic step” that would make the UK the first major economy in the world to set such a legally binding target.

“Now is the time to go further and faster,” she said – “for our children” – and it was framed as a moral issue, a moment to be on the right side of history.

And while everyone was patting themselves on the back, and as the lofty ambition was turned into legal text, the UK accelerated down a path that is only now being fully understood.

If Theresa May hadn’t signed the 2050 into law someone else would have, such was the consensus and such was the sense of inevitability whipped up in those heady pre-Covid, pre-War days.

And where has it taken us?

The UK has the highest cost of energy in the developed world – for households and businesses – and we’ve been putting wind farms faster than our energy infrastructure can handle them – leading to a situation where we – taxpayers, bill payers – will pay £1bn this year to wind farm operators to turn off those wind farms when it’s too windy.

We’ve put the cart before the horse

Vast sums are then spent on replacement gas power to keep the lights on. And that’s almost certainly imported gas, by the way, as we’ve rather gone off producing our own.

It’s a problem known as ‘curtailment’ – too much wind produces too much power and it would overwhelm the congested network and so they’re simply switched off.

The National Energy System Operator, which runs the grid, says the cost of this – the constraint cost – could surge to £8bn a year by 2030.

We’ve put the cart before the horse. Windfarms were the great visible manifestation of our Net Zero drive – but we haven’t built the pylons and cables to make them worthwhile – something that will take years and cost billions.

Related: New Quantum Breakthrough Could Lead to Super-Efficient Electronics

There’s no problem with ultimately attaining a state of Net Zero emissions; the problems lie in the law, the target date and the consequences of an ill-thought through rush.

High energy costs are forcing chemical, cement and manufacturing plants to close. Energy investment and associated manufacturing are heading for the US. The North Sea is viewed as an awkward relic rather than a natural asset and the combination of green levies, subsidies and taxes are making a mess of the entire system.

Conservatives repent

Today the Conservatives, the moral and political architects of the 2050 target, say they’d scrap their law. They’ve seen the light. The Institute of Economic Affairs says the Tories’ announcement is “the first step back to sanity” – pointing out that the Climate Change Act was “the biggest central planning mistake since the Soviet Union’s Five Year Economic Plans.”

Kemi Badenoch says “Climate change is real. But Labour’s laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions. Previous Conservative governments tried to make Labour’s climate laws work – they don’t.”

She said that the Conservatives would make the North Sea the “cornerstone” of UK energy policy by ending a ban on new oil and gas exploration, and that as Prime Minister her priorities would be “growth, cheaper energy” and a renewed commitment to protecting the environment.

Even Labour, whose climate change secretary Ed Miliband is a full blown High Priest of Net Zero zealotry, is considering rowing back from some of its bolder commitments. That would certainly please the unions, who have been shouting at the deindustrialisation unleashed by the Net Zero sprint.

Miliband policies “a disaster”

Sharon Graham, boss of the Unite union, has called for Miliband to be sacked, labelling his Net Zero plan “a disaster” and accusing him of being “completely irresponsible” with the UK’s energy security and jobs in the oil and gas sector. And she’s right. Oil refineries are closing. Chemicals plants are closing. And the promised green jobs boom is felt more in consultancy and the civil service than in any factory.

Ahead of the Budget, the British Chambers of Commerce have called on the government to remove the windfall taxes imposed on oil and gas producers in the North Sea, saying the policy puts the UK at a “competitive disadvantage.”

Meanwhile, our energy demands are going to skyrocket – not least given all the hungry new data centres unveiled in recent weeks.

It seems when it comes to energy the best approach is to do everything, everywhere, but not all at once.

We need nuclear, and we’re getting more of it. We need the North Sea, but we’re ashamed of it. We need renewables – but only when the network can actually take the power and we shouldn’t be spending vast sums to subsidise biomass energy that burns wood from South America shipped to the UK and is somehow, supposedly, green. And we do need to look again at the law of the land – the feel-good commitment to be Net Zero by 2050.

The Tories and Reform have woken up to this. It seems many in Labour have, too, though it’s likely Ed Miliband will barricade himself in his office with hostages before recognising the political and economic reality that’s coming into focus.

Policies change. They evolve. They adapt to meet circumstances. They encounter problems and breakthroughs at unexpected moments. They do not always conform with political aspirations and timelines and badly-written law, and it seems that the penny is beginning to drop.

[TITLE]Notion Capital raises $130 million for European growth fund:
[TEXT]
Notion Capital, a London-based venture capital firm, has announced the close of a new $130 million growth fund. The fund will focus on supporting growth-stage startups across Europe in sectors like AI, defense, and supply chain logistics. Stephen Chandler, managing partner at Notion Capital, emphasized the importance of the new fund in addressing the shortage of growth-stage capital in Europe.

“This opens up a chance for firms like ourselves to become real European champions,” Chandler said. The fund, called Growth Opps III, will target areas of rising demand such as sovereignty, resilience, and artificial intelligence. Chandler described AI as a “super cycle” that is reshaping the industry.

Notion Capital will concentrate on applications of AI to multiply its market reach. Notion Capital has already begun deploying funds into ventures like Upvest, a stock trading API, Kraken, a builder of unmanned surface vessels, and Nelly, a developer of financial products for the medical sector. A dedicated team of fund partners will handle these growth deals and source new opportunities outside the existing portfolio.

Notion Capital secures new funding

The firm has also introduced new leadership with Growth Opps III. Partner Stephanie Opdam will drive the growth strategy alongside Jessica “Jess” Bartos, who joined from Salesforce Ventures as Notion’s first external partner hire.

Europe has historically struggled with a shortage of institutional capital, particularly from pension schemes. However, reforms like France’s Tibi initiative and the UK’s Mansion House Accord are starting to create incentives for long-term capital mobilisation. Reflecting its pan-European ambitions, the fund is denominated in euros and domiciled in Luxembourg, making it less dependent on UK regulation.

Around 85% of its capital came from institutional investors across Europe, the UK, MENA, and the United States. Since its founding, Notion Capital has invested in over 150 companies, including notable names like Currencycloud, GoCardless, Mews, Paddle, and Quantum Systems. Their established relationships with founders serve as a competitive advantage, particularly at the growth stage.

With Growth Opps III, Notion Capital is positioning itself as a key player in Europe’s evolving venture landscape. The firm plans to make about a dozen investments from the new fund, continuing to support ambitious European founders as they scale to global prominence.

[TITLE]Evantic Capital debuts with $400 million to fund B2B AI startups across Europe and beyond:
[TEXT]
Evantic Capital, a new London-based venture capital firm, has launched with over €341 million in capital to support B2B AI innovators across Europe, the United States, and Israel.

Why it matters: The substantial funding underscores the importance of investing in AI technologies that hold the promise of revolutionizing how businesses operate and deliver value, contributing to the competitiveness and dynamism of the European tech landscape.

The details:

Evantic Capital aims to identify and nurture groundbreaking AI startups that demonstrate strong potential in transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics.

The investment fund will provide financial support, strategic guidance, and industry connections to help these startups scale and achieve their transformative goals.

The firm’s launch is seen as a significant boost for the European AI startup ecosystem, which continues to garner global attention for its innovation and growth.

The firm is backed by an exclusive network of 140 seasoned founders, operators, and investors collectively known as “The Legends,” designed to create direct alignment between startup success and stakeholder involvement by allocating up to 50% of investment carry to those Legends who actively support the portfolio companies.

What they’re saying:

“Our Legends are senior leaders—experienced founders, operators, and executives—who bring a deeper level of involvement to our portfolio companies,” explains Matt Miller, Founder and Managing Partner of Evantic Capital.

“This creates a true partnership model: our Legends are not only motivated by goodwill or networking, but by a real alignment of interests. It ensures that when a founder engages with a Legend, they’re interacting with someone who is deeply invested in helping them succeed, both emotionally and economically.”

The other side: The rise of AI technologies presents a myriad of opportunities and challenges.

What’s next: Evantic Capital has already invested in five AI-focused startups and has two more commitments underway, with its current portfolio including Fireworks, Listen Labs, and Nexos.

[TITLE]Pre-budget figures show significant surplus in prospect for 2026:
[TEXT]
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will be able to announce his €9.4 billion budget package on Tuesday and still aim for a significant surplus of revenue over spending in 2026.

Strong growth in corporate and income taxes are again expected to underpin the public finances, according to pre-budget figures published on Saturday.

They show that before any budget measures are announced, tax revenues are expected to grow by around 3.25 per cent in 2026, with faster growth in corporate and income taxes. The corporate tax take is forecast to rise by another €2 billion next year to €34.1 billion.

While Mr Donohoe has said he expected the tax to top out at some stage, it is predicted to rise next year partly because under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tax deal the rate on big companies is increasing to 15 per cent from 12.5 per cent.

While the future of the OECD deal is now uncertain, this increase is nonetheless expected to remain bar a decision at European Union level to the contrary. Meanwhile, another part of the OECD agreement which would hit Irish corporate tax receipts looks increasingly unlikely to ever be implemented.

Income tax receipts are also expected to rise from €36.5 billion this year to just over €39 billion next year. While budget day measures normally reduce the figure forecast in the White Paper, the absence of a significant personal tax package this year means the figure may not change markedly on budget day.

It will be the first budget of recent years without significant changes to income tax bands and credits. Instead, the €1.5 billion tax package is likely to focus on VAT reductions aimed at the hospitality sector and possibly at construction.

The White Paper is compiled on what is called a “pre-budget” basis – in other words it excludes measures announced on budget day. However, it counts in measures already announced such as the increase in state investment signalled in the revised National Development Plan and cash to maintain service levels last year.

It forecasts an €8.8 billion surplus for 2026. This is likely to fall a bit on budget day, but it is expected that a healthy budget surplus target to still be set for 2026.

This will provide the exchequer with some leeway if tax revenues disappoint or if spending rises faster than target as has happened in every recent year.

Exchequer returns for September published on Friday showed a 4.5 per cent rise in underlying tax revenues – excluding the Apple tax money – but income tax after nine months, while ahead of last year, is slightly below expectations.

[TITLE]Europe teams with Japan on asteroid mission, beefs up space cooperation with South Korea:
[TEXT]
An illustration showing the Ramses spacecraft near the asteroid Apophis.

SYDNEY — Europe is deepening cooperation with South Korea and Japan as it looks to expand its international cooperation activities on Earth and in space.

The European Space Agency (ESA) and the Korea AeroSpace Administration ( KASA ) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for enhanced cooperation here at the 76th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) here in Sydney on Wednesday (Oct. 1).

The agreement will allow the agencies to use each others' ground stations for telemetry, tracking and command functions. The MoU also covers future areas of cooperation including space science, exploration, human spaceflight, in-space infrastructure and beyond. There is also an intention to work together on space weather .

"This is an important moment for Europe and Korea, opening up great opportunities for our space interests, and strengthening existing systems through cooperation," ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said in a statement . "In ESA, we are excited to learn from our colleagues in KASA, and to share our experience to reach complementary goals."

"KASA's objectives include enhancing global space cooperation;" said Youngbin Yoon, KASA's administrator. "Today, we have taken an important step, and we look forward to our shared journey in cooperation in space activities for peaceful purposes."

Support from ESA's Estrack global ground station network could help facilitate South Korea's lunar ambitions, with ESA having played a similar role during the development of China's Chang'e lunar program .

South Korea's moon program already includes the Danuri spacecraft, which is in lunar orbit, capturing stunning images of the moon. But the country is now building toward a robotic lunar lander to be launched by a homegrown rocket, with a grander vision of establishing a moon base by 2045 as part of a long-term exploration road map released by KASA in August. Earlier this year, the agency began converting an abandoned mine to a testing ground for lunar exploration.

The developments come as ESA earlier this year began considering diversifying and deepening global partnerships in the wake of uncertainty over the NASA budget and the future of cooperative programs. ESA also held discussions with India on deepening their cooperation at IAC in Sydney.

India is a strategic partner with enormous capacity and is precisely the type of nation that @esa and its Member States want as a partner. Today, with @isro, we discussed ways of deepening collaboration in three main areas: Exploration, Earth Observation, and Operations. pic.twitter.com/A5cVzsm88ROctober 1, 2025

Asteroid rideshare with Japan

A day earlier, ESA's Aschbacher celebrated recent milestones in cooperation with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) with agency head Hiroshi Yamakawa. Both men addressed IAC at a Heads of Agencies event on Sept. 29.

Aschbacher celebrated a recent rideshare agreement that will see ESA's Ramses spacecraft and Japan's Destiny+ mission launch together on a Japanese H3 rocket to study the former doomsday asteroid Apophis ahead of its 2029 close encounter with Earth .

"Ramses is not only a scientifically exciting mission and a symbol of two partnerships between Japan and ESA, but it also is a good example of quick project development and implementation," Aschbacher said.

The main objective for Destiny+ is to study the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower . Launch delays have, however, provided the opportunity for the spacecraft to first visit Apophis, and for a serendipitous rideshare for Ramses.

[TITLE]The race to find a way to recycle old turbine blades from windfarms:
[TEXT]
Thirty years ago they towered 55 metres above the South Lanarkshire countryside, powering Scotland’s first commercial windfarm at Hagshaw Hill. But earlier this year these blades pioneered a green energy breakthrough of another kind: blade recycling.

In the Scottish port town of Irvine in Ayrshire, almost 80 of Britain’s oldest wind turbine blades lay disused in an old warehouse for over eighteen months.

[TITLE]Telecom Italia targets B2B growth from sovereign services:
[TEXT]
TIM Enterprise, the domestic business-to-business (B2B) division of Telecom Italia, has outlined a three-year €1bn investment plan for 2025-27 that will help it “consolidate its role as the technological engine and point of reference for the TIM Group, serving over 30,000 business and public administration customers” and help it fulfil the €4bn in contracts it has already secured with enterprise and government customers.

And at the heart of its efforts is, like many of its digital service provider peers, a focus on the development and delivery of sovereign services for Italy’s public and private sectors.

In 2024, TIM Enterprise, which has 6,600 staff, generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of €700m from revenues of €3.3bn (24% of group revenues), with half coming from public/government bodies and half from its private business customers, which include more than 8,000 large enterprises.

Of that total, €1.1bn was from connectivity services (40% market share), another €1.1bn from cloud (15% market share), €200m from cybersecurity and €100m from internet of things (IoT), and the remaining €600m from other tech services. (All of these numbers exclude the Sparkle international unit that is being divested.)

According to TIM, the total B2B tech and communications services sector in Italy was worth €26.8bn in 2024 and that is set to grow to be worth
