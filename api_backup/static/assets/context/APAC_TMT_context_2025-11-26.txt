Nvidia surprised markets by posting fiscal third-quarter revenue of $57.01 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by almost $2 billion.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin rebounded above $91,000 after briefly dipping below $89,000, as analysts attributed much of the crypto market’s decline to growing concerns

[TITLE]Hiring outlook improves for Hong Kong's financial sector, recruiters say:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong's financial services sector could boost hiring by as much as 15 per cent next year, fuelled by buoyant capital markets and growth in assets under management, according to a global recruitment agency.

The surging equity markets in Hong Kong and mainland China had boosted revenues and budgets for hiring investment professionals and traders, said John Mullally, managing director for Hong Kong at Robert Walters.

The jobs market would be "more functional", with hiring across the financial services sector likely to rise by 10 to 15 per cent in 2026, though it would remain below the levels seen a few years ago, he said. "It'll be slower but steadier."

[TEXT]
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Nov. 21, 2025 in New York City.

Last week on Wall Street, two forces dragged stocks lower: a set of high-stakes numbers from Nvidia and the U.S. jobs report that landed with more heat than expected. But the leaves that remained after hot tea scalded investors seemed to augur good tidings.

Even though Nvidia's third-quarter results easily breezed past Wall Street's estimates, they couldn't quell worries

[TITLE]Wall Street edges higher amid tech gains and renewed hopes of Fed rate cut:
[TEXT]
The U.S. stock market rose on Monday, spurred by a jump in tech stocks and renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve may slash its benchmark interest rate at its December meeting.

The S&P 500 climbed 108 points, or 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.6%, as of 2:10 p.m. EDT. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.7%.

Companies with investments in artificial intelligence saw gains on Monday. Alphabet, which has been getting praise for its newest Gemini AI model, rallied 5.5% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. The jump in tech stocks comes as investors continue to assess the potential of AI-focused businesses, even as questions remain

[TITLE]Another rally for Alphabet leads the US stock market higher:
[TEXT]
By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market rallied on Monday, at the start of a week with shortened trading because of the Thanksgiving holiday.

The S&P 500 climbed 1.5% for one of its best days since the summer and added to its jump from Friday, finding some strength following a shaky few weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 202 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 2.7%.

Stocks got a lift from rising hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate again at its next meeting in December, a move that could boost the economy and investment prices.

The market also benefited from strength for stocks caught up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy. Alphabet, which has been getting praise for its newest Gemini AI model, rallied 6.3% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Nvidia rose 2.1%.

Monday’s gains followed sharp swings in recent weeks, not just day to day but also hour to hour, caused by uncertainty

[TITLE]Stocks rally as bumber Nvidia report offsets Fed rate concern:

Asian markets rallied Thursday after blowout earnings from chip powerhouse Nvidia cooled worries over an AI bubble and overshadowed a Federal Reserve report that dealt a blow to hopes for a December interest rate cut.

Global equities have struggled of late owing to warnings that valuations — particularly in the tech sector — have been overdone and are due a pullback, and possibly a sharp correction, following a record-breaking rally this year.

Some market-watchers have warned that the hundreds of billions of dollars pumped into artificial intelligence will not likely realise any profits for some time, while others point out that infrastructure to meet demand is not yet in place.

Wednesday’s report from Nvidia — one of the torchbearers of the AI revolution — was therefore seen as a bellwether on the industry.

And it topped expectations on fierce demand for its sophisticated chips, with chief executive Jensen Huang brushing off the recent concerns.
