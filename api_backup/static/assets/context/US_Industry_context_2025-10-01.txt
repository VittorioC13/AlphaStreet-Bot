Geely-owned Volvo Cars is to continue its investment in the Ridgeville car manufacturing facility near Charleston, South Carolina, in the US, to maximise the plant’s output in the upcoming years.

Global automakers with manufacturing facilities in the US are generally looking to invest heavily and max out on plant capacity utilisation in order to avoid import tariffs on shipments from overseas.

Looking ahead, China’s Geely-backed carmaker has plans to introduce a new hybrid model tailored for the US market to the Ridgeville production line before 2030.

Over the past decade, the company, which is listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, has channelled $1.3bn into the plant, equipping it for future demand.

These investments are part of Volvo Cars’ strategy to enhance production volumes, financial performance, and to fully utilise the plant’s capabilities.

Currently, the Ridgeville plant has an installed capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles annually, manufacturing the all-electric EX90 sport utility vehicle (SUV) and the Polestar 3.

[TITLE]CenterPoint unveils $65 billion capital spending plan over next 10 years:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) -CenterPoint Energy on Monday announced it was planning $65 billion in capital spending from 2026 through 2035, as U.S. utilities rush to capitalize on surging power demand.

Data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, as well as the electrification of industries such as transportation, are driving up U.S. power consumption.

CenterPoint also raised its annual adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $1.75 and $1.77 per share, from $1.74 to $1.76 per share earlier. The new range is 9% higher at the midpoint than last year.

Analysts estimate $1.76 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The U.S. electric and gas utility also expects 2026 adjusted EPS targeting at least the midpoint of the range of $1.89 to $1.91 per share.

Power demand from U.S. data centers is expected to nearly triple in the next three years and consume as much as 12% of the total electricity produced, according to a study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

CenterPoint reiterated that electric peak load demand will increase about 50% to nearly 31 gigawatts (GWs) by 2031 and forecast peak power demand to double by the middle of the next decade.

"Continued economic development is anticipated to drive significant growth in electric demand over the next decade, especially in Texas," the company said in a statement.

CenterPoint in May said it intends to spend $4 billion in new projects to support its growth in Texas.

Texas is one of the quickest-growing data center markets, with the business-friendly state also attracting other forms of energy-intensive industries such as computer chip manufacturing.

CenterPoint delivers electricity and natural gas to more than 7 million customers across Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas.

[TITLE]States scramble to plug transportation funding holes:
[TEXT]
By Erika Bolstad, Stateline.org

States are scrambling for the money to fill potholes, plow roads, maintain bridges and pay bus drivers as they confront inflation- and tariff-driven cost increases and declining gas tax revenues.

States also face uncertain federal funding as the Trump administration reduces the size of government and zeroes out some Biden-era transportation programs. As the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act expires next year and Congress considers its next transportation funding bill, cities are clamoring for the federal government to bypass states and give cities a larger share of federal infrastructure money distributed by formula.

Drivers will have to pay higher vehicle registration fees and gas taxes to make up for the shortfalls. Long-planned construction projects and safety improvements will be delayed. And bus riders may see fewer routes and longer wait times.

The chaos in a pair of state legislatures on either side of the country illustrates the dire state of highways and transit systems – and might foretell a bumpy road ahead.

In Oregon, nearly 500 transportation employees,

[TITLE]Firehawk Aerospace secures $60 million investment from Presto Tech Horizons:
[TEXT]
Firehawk Aerospace has secured an oversubscribed $60 million investment round led by 1789 Capital. The venture capital firm’s partnership group includes Donald Trump Jr. Presto Tech Horizons (PTH), a defense and resilience tech fund created through a partnership between European venture capital firm Presto Ventures and Czechoslovak Group, also contributed to the round.

Firehawk is using 3D printing technology to produce propellant and solid rocket motors. The company aims to make the manufacture of advanced energetics faster, safer, and more flexible. Their approach can also be used for artillery charges, allowing ammunition production to be rapid, reliable, and scalable.

Firehawk’s method uses commercial-off-the-shelf equipment and new additive manufacturing processes to greatly reduce production times. This transforms the energetics supply chain. With this latest funding, Firehawk plans to improve Europe’s ability to locally source critical munitions supply chain elements.

Firehawk’s defense mission gains traction

This will boost resilience and ensure sustained defense readiness for NATO and allied forces. Will Edwards, CEO of Firehawk, said, “The conflict in Ukraine proves that while drones give warfighters a decisive edge, munitions like missiles and rockets are the core of combat power.

A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and propellant and energetics production are currently the biggest constraints on missile, rocket, and artillery manufacturing. Enabling the European defense industry to produce these weapons quickly and at scale is the core of Firehawk’s mission. We’re proud to partner with Presto Tech Horizons and CSG to bolster the European energetics supply chain.”

Michal Strnad, Chairman of the Board and owner of Czechoslovak Group, stressed the importance of investing in innovative defense technologies given the current geopolitical climate.

“Firehawk can play a crucial role in the future of not only rocket propulsion but also ammunition production. This innovative project can strengthen cooperation between leaders of the American and European defense industries.”

The involved parties are already looking at opportunities for industrial application of Firehawk’s technologies. Matej Luhovy, newly appointed Partner at Presto Tech Horizons, said, “Since the early 2010s, scientists and engineers have explored 3D printing to unlock faster, safer, and more flexible solid propellant production.

Firehawk is the first to truly deliver on that promise. Their technology doesn’t just speed up propellant manufacture—it fundamentally reshapes the supply chain for missiles and rockets.”

This investment marks a major milestone for Firehawk Aerospace and its mission to revolutionize the energetics supply chain for defense industries.
