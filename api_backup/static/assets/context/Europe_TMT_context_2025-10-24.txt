[TITLE]AI is boosting the legacy business for top Indian IT firms, for now:
[TEXT]
Four of the country’s five largest offshore services providers have reported an increase in software modernization deals as Fortune companies prepare to automate much of their backend tech work.

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, and Wipro Ltd reported a significant uptick in such deals, according to their earnings calls with analysts for the second quarter ended September. Two of the four said artificial intelligence (AI) is expediting software upgrades to automate clients’ tech functions.

According to at least one analyst, TCS and Infosys are getting a higher share of such legacy or core modernization deals. These involve replacing or transforming a company’s old information technology (IT) software with new ones that can handle large amounts of data and perform AI tasks quickly.

“...firms are investing in their digital core, preparing them for AI. This requires them to modernize much of their legacy so they can more easily get at the data," said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of Everest Research. “...Firms have long wanted to modernize their legacy, but the (high) cost has caused them to defer this expense. AI and the AI-related tools are significantly reducing the cost."

For homegrown IT services companies, such contracts offer an opportunity at a time when the $283-billion sector faces an uncertain FY26 due to tariff fluctuations and visa flip-flops in the US.

TCS, Infosys lead

“...As you would appreciate, many of our customers globally have a lot of technology debt that they have carried over the years," K Krithivasan, chief executive officer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said during the company’s post-earnings analyst call on 9 October. “GenAI and Agentic AI are powerful tools to really address the tech debt. You can use these AI, GenAI to understand the legacy code, and forward-engineer and deliver the new code. Modernization with AI is a huge opportunity, and we are seeing a significant uptick across customers."

According to Krithivasan, these are short-term deals that can be completed within a quarter. TCS's management also noted that the company is actively looking at delivering business outcomes with AI in a matter of weeks as part of its AI strategy for customers.

The Mumbai-based firm is also eyeing heightened deal activity in application support services and software development.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh called the overhaul of legacy software a huge opportunity because of AI.

“...in the past, without the AI tools, you could do modernization, but clients needed a longer time horizon. With some of the AI tools, the time horizon becomes less and as a consequence, the ROI (return on investment) for the client on that program is much better," Parekh said in response to Mint’s question during the company’s post-earnings press conference on 16 October. “What we anticipate now is, as the AI tools mature, we will see more and more of them (AI) being deployed on the modernization program."

According to Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, TCS and Infosys have the “highest exposure by volume", especially in banking, insurance, and healthcare, where legacy systems create both the biggest risk and biggest opportunity. “Wipro and HCLTech have been more aggressive repositioning as transformation partners rather than maintenance shops."

While TCS and Infosys said AI is hastening legacy modernization, India’s third-largest software services provider HCLTech said the spending on non-essential IT services is also gaining momentum because of tech transformation deals.

“I think the biggest demand elasticity is in modernization. While discretionary spend is whatever it is, we are seeing a number of programs which are coming up based on legacy modernization," said CEO C Vijayakumar during the company’s post-earnings call with analysts on 13 October. He said the clients who were skeptical

[TITLE]HUTCHMED Highlights HMPL-A251 Data Presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics:
[TEXT]
— First investigational drug candidate using the HUTCHMED ATTC technology platform to create potent targeted therapy payloads while mitigating related toxicities —

— Unique, highly potent PI3K/PIKK inhibitor payload optimized to exploit antibody-conjugate advantages, with directed delivery and low plasma exposure of free payload —

— Preclinical data shows robust antitumor activity with synergistic and bystander killing effects —

HONG KONG and SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“HUTCHMED”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces preclinical data for HMPL-A251 at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, held October 22–26, 2025, in Boston, USA. HMPL-A251 is a first-in-class PI3K/AKT/mTOR (“PAM”)-HER2 Antibody-Targeted Therapy Conjugate (“ATTC”) comprising of a highly selective and potent PI3K/PIKK inhibitor payload linked to a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 antibody, via a cleavable linker.

HER2 is a well-established therapeutic target. HER2 overexpression is found in a variety of cancer types and often associated with poor prognosis. As a key downstream signaling pathway of HER2, the PAM pathway contributes significantly to the resistance against HER2-targeting treatments when altered. HMPL-A251 is innovatively designed to leverage the synergy between HER2 targeting and PAM pathway inhibition to address limitations of traditional toxin-based antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”) and standalone PAM inhibitors.

In vitro, the PI3K/PIKK inhibitor payload exhibited high potency, selectivity, and broad anti-tumor activity across a panel of 130 tumor cell lines. By conjugating this potent payload with an anti-HER2 antibody via a hydrophilic linker, the ATTC compound HMPL-A251, upon binding to the HER2-positive target cells, undergoes rapid internalization, lysosomal trafficking, payload release, and inhibition of PAM and PIKK signaling, inducing tumor cell apoptosis. HMPL-A251 demonstrated HER2-dependent antitumor activity in vitro, potently inhibiting HER2-positive tumor cell growth regardless of PAM pathway alterations, with moderately reduced activity in HER2-low, PAM-altered cell lines. HMPL-A251 also demonstrated a bystander effect on HER2-null cells when co-cultured with HER2-positive cells.

Unlike toxin-based ADCs, which often face challenges with toxicity related to their cytotoxic payloads, ATTCs are designed to prioritize tumor-specific delivery of a pathway-modulating payload, enhancing safety for long-term use and enabling potential frontline combinations with chemotherapy. In vivo, HMPL-A251 demonstrated superior anti-tumor efficacy and tolerability as compared to the naked antibody and payload administered together. A single intravenous dose of HMPL-A251 induced tumor regression across multiple models including HER2-positive and HER2-low models with or without PAM alteration. Efficacy correlated strongly with payload concentration and target inhibition in tumor tissue. Notably, when benchmarked against T-DXd (trastuzumab deruxtecan, a HER2-directed ADC), HMPL-A251 achieved superior or comparable efficacy at equivalent doses in most tested models. Moreover, payload-based toxicities are expected to be low, as the plasma exposure of free payload was much lower than for HMPL-251, with a mass ratio of less than 1:500,000.

“We are excited to share the progress of HMPL-A251, the first candidate from our ATTC platform. It represents a potentially significant leap forward in addressing the limitations of toxin-based ADCs and narrow therapeutic window of systemic PAM inhibitors. By combining selective PI3K/PIKK inhibition with precise HER2 targeting, HMPL-A251 achieves potent antitumor effects while maintaining a favorable safety profile,” said Dr Michael Shi, Head of R&D and Chief Medical Officer of HUTCHMED. “The compelling preclinical data presented underscore its potential to redefine treatment for a wide spectrum of cancers, and we are excited to advance HMPL-A251 as well as more ATTC drug candidates toward clinical trials.”

HUTCHMED plans to initiate global clinical trials for HMPL-A251 around the end of 2025, followed by multiple global Investigational New Drug (IND) filings for more ATTC candidates in 2026.

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq jump as Trump confirms Xi meet, earnings flood in:
[TEXT]
US stocks climbed on Thursday as the US confirmed a highly anticipated meeting with China next week and investors parsed through a fresh batch of quarterly results after Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) earnings fell short.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) drifted 0.3% higher.

President Trump said a long-anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi is scheduled for next Thursday, offering reassurance to markets unsettled by rising tensions.

Meanwhile, oil futures spiked more than 5% after the US placed sanctions on Russia's giant producers, piling pressure on President Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Brent crude (BZ=F) rose to settle above $65 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled above $61.

Elsewhere, Tesla shares pared earlier losses to gain 2% after the EV maker posted mixed third quarter results on Wednesday, kicking off the “Magnificent Seven” earnings cycle. IBM stock dropped around 1%, as stronger-than-expected profits were offset by in-line software revenue that nevertheless disappointed investors.

After reporting quarterly results before the open, American Airlines (AAL) stock jumped as the carrier's fourth quarter earnings guidance topped expectations. Shares in T-Mobile (TMUS) dipped as the telecom company's customer base grew more than expected.

Results from struggling chipmaker Intel (INTC) take center stage after the bell.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been receiving pitches for the US to take stakes in several quantum computing companies, the Wall Street Journal reported — the latest move in its push to become a shareholder in critical sectors. Shares of IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti Computing (RGTI), and other targeted companies surged on the news.

On Friday, the delayed release of the September Consumer Price Index report will provide investors with a rare look at the inflation picture. Government data has come to a virtual standstill amid the ongoing government shutdown.

[TITLE]Tata trustees inch towards resolution of core issues:
[TEXT]
Following his reappointment to the board of the Tata Trusts, Venu Srinivasan emailed his fellow trustees on October 21. The mail read: “My dear fellow trustees, thank you very much for the confidence reposed in me, and for the kind words that have been expressed. I sincerely hope we will now work harmoniously.”

Fellow trustee Mehli Mistry immediately responded: “Dear Venu, it has always been our intention to work harmoniously together! The only problem earlier was the lack of required information requested by us, which you all nominated directors have agreed to provide. We must bury the past, respect each other and move forward as a team unanimously! That’s what Ratan would have expected to do.”

Not an ego battle

Even as it indicates the trustees’ search for harmonious functioning, the correspondence sums up the drama at Tata Trusts that began on September 11 when the reappointment of Vijay Singh to the Tata Sons Pvt Ltd (TSPL) board was opposed by four trustees — Mehli Mistry, Darius Khambatta, Jehangir HC Jehangir and Pramit Jhaveri.

After a series of meetings that businessline had with protagonists from both camps in Mumbai recently, it is clear this is not a battle of egos or personalities though one or the other trustee may not like the persona of another.

Core issue

The core issue appears to be flow of information from the trustees nominated to the Tata Sons board back to the other trustees. The underlying trust seems to have given way as the camp comprising the four trustees named above alleged that information had not been shared by the trustees nominated to the TSPL board, namely Noel Tata, Venu Srinivasan and Vijay Singh (he was a nominee until September 11).

They narrated instances of resolutions passed in the TSPL board that were not brought back to the Trust board as provided in Article 121 A of TSPL’s Articles of Association. The said Article was introduced in 2014 and stipulates a range of actions of the TSPL board that require affirmative vote by a majority of the Trust nominees (Article 121). The examples quoted ranged from the €3.8 billion acquisition of Italian commercial vehicle manufacturer Iveco by Tata Motors, where the trustees were not informed until well into the deal, to the more contentious one where the TSPL board approved funding of ₹1,000 crore to Tata International Ltd, a company of which Tata is the Chairman, in April.

Conflict of interest

The group ranged against Tata hints at a conflict of interest here as he wears three hats — Chairman of the Trusts, its nominee on the board of TSPL and Chairman of four group companies, Tata International, Trent, Tata Investment Corporation and Voltas. He’s also Vice-Chairman of Tata Steel and Titan. “How can you as the owner (representative of Tata Trusts) sitting on the board (TSPL) vote as director along with the board on a ₹1,000 crore funding resolution related to a company (Tata International) where you’re Chairman and also approve it as a trust nominee,” asked a person speaking for a trustee.

Sources close to Tata, however, dismiss this. “They want every proposal over ₹100 crore to be taken to them for approval, which is not necessary,” they said. According to them, if at all there is a conflict of interest, it is in Mistry’s business dealings with Tata Power (he manages their logistics), while also being listed as a promoter of the company by virtue of his position as a trustee on Tata Trusts. This is violative of related party provisions in law, they allege.

Ironically, Mistry had proposed and pushed for the appointment of Tata as Chairman of the Trusts to replace Ratan Tata upon the latter’s demise, according to a source. This was against opposition from a fellow trustee who wanted the position kept vacant. The story goes that this trustee hosted a dinner for three other trustees the day before the crucial trust board meeting where he persuaded them not to appoint Tata. This move failed after Mistry, who was part of the dinner, proposed Tata’s name for chairmanship at the board meeting the next day.

Ask Mistry’s camp why he did that and the answer is: “The Tata Trusts have to remain with a Tata!” There was also the worry that an empty chair could attract unwanted characters from outside.

Sources close to Mistry underline that the trustees are even now not against Tata, but they’re sore

[TITLE]Trump’s Australia Critical Minerals Deal Is a Move to Break China’s Monopoly:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump signed a critical minerals deal with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday, a team-up explicitly intended to break China’s near-monopoly on mining and refining the valuable resources.

The agreement committed the U.S. and Australia to invest over a billion dollars each over the next six months into mining projects and refineries. The deal also set a minimum price for critical minerals.

The White House said the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM Bank) would make up to $5 billion in financing available for mineral projects. Albanese said projects valued at roughly $8.5 billion would soon be up and running, giving the U.S.-Australian partnership access to mineral deposits worth up to $53 billion.

Albanese noted the agreement is more of an “action plan” than a binding agreement with “enforceable obligations,” but he and Trump predicted the allure of critical minerals was so great that American and Australian industries would require no government urging to exploit the opportunities created by the deal.

[TITLE]Stocks Pressured as Texas Instruments Drags Chipmakers Lower:
[TEXT]
The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is down -0.02%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.14%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down -0.18%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) are down -0.01%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) are down -0.16%.

Stock indexes are posting modest losses today, led by losses in chipmakers after Texas Instruments forecasted Q4 revenue that was below expectations. Other corporate earnings results today are mixed for stocks. Intuitive Surgical is up more than +16% after boosting its worldwide Da Vinci procedure growth forecast for the whole year. Also, Capital One Financial is up more than +3% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS. Conversely, Netflix is down more than -7% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 EPS.

US MBA mortgage applications fell -0.3% in the week ended October 17, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -5.2% and the refinancing sub-index up +4.0%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.37% from 6.42% in the prior week.

The markets are focusing on progress in US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods "if there isn't a deal" by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

The shutdown of the US government continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last three weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the Sep payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don't align with President Trump's priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts' expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets are lower today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.19%. China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.07%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.02%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are down -2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is up +0.8 bp to 3.963%. Supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $13 billion of 20-year T-bonds later today. Losses in T-notes are contained due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields are mixed today. The 10-year German bund yield is up +0.9 bp to 2.561%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 6.5-month low of 4.369% and is down -7.7 bp to 4.401%.

UK Sep CPI rose +3.8% y/y, unchanged from Aug and weaker than expectations of +4.0% y/y. Sep core CPI unexpectedly eased to +3.5% y/y from +3.6% y/y in Aug, weaker than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

US Stock Movers

Netflix (NFLX) is down more than -7% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after reporting Q3 EPS of $5.87, well below the consensus of $6.94.

[TITLE]Eos Energy Executes Next Phase of Growth Strategy with U.S. Manufacturing Expansion and New Software Hub Under Project AMAZE:
[TEXT]
$24 million state-led economic development package underscores the shared commitment between Eos and Pennsylvania to advance U.S. manufacturing and job creation

Expansion reinforces the Company’s progress and transformation as Pennsylvania becomes a national hub for energy, technology, and manufacturing innovation

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) ("Eos" or the “Company”), an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced the next phase of its growth strategy with the expansion of its U.S. manufacturing footprint and the establishment of a new software hub strengthening American energy storage capacity, energy independence, and industrial job growth.

In partnership with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Allegheny County, the Company was awarded a joint $24 million economic development package to support U.S. manufacturing and the continued growth of 1,000 high quality American jobs. The incentive package will help the Company scale operations to meet growing market demand driven, in part, by AI infrastructure, while advancing energy innovation in Pennsylvania.

“Energy storage is the backbone of a modern energy system, and this significant milestone marks our progress to bring America’s battery to scale,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “Through Project AMAZE, we’re proving that you can make things in America again by building world-class capacity, pairing advanced manufacturing with innovative software, and doing it here in Pennsylvania to ensure a more energy-efficient and secure future. We thank Governor Shapiro, Allegheny County, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, and the Pittsburgh Technology Council for their unwavering support and shared vision for advancing Americas quest to lead in energy.”

Eos will expand its manufacturing capacity with a new state-of-the-art 432,000 sq. ft. facility in Marshall Township, PA, that will house additional production lines that complement the Company’s existing Turtle Creek manufacturing facility with plans to reach 8 GWh of annualized energy storage capacity. The new facility enables Eos to transition from single piece flow operations to high-efficiency, large-scale production, marking the culmination of years of process development designed to bring U.S. made energy storage to market at scale.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology. I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Eos will also establish a new software hub at Nova Place, Pittsburgh’s premiere technology and innovation center, that supports the Company’s growing workforce and proprietary battery management system, software, controls and analytics platform, DawnOSTM. Eos joins a thriving community of other advanced manufacturing, data/telecommunications, AI, electric utilities, and robotics leaders in Pittsburgh’s innovation headquarters.

As part of its expanding software and engineering focus, the Company plans to deepen its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, a leading institution in robotics, AI, computer science, and engineering to further develop a state-of-the-art workforce to work in Eos’ software hub.

“Carnegie Mellon University is thrilled to celebrate this milestone with Eos, and we are looking forward to the many opportunities it unlocks – for Pittsburghers, our students, and America’s bright future in manufacturing,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. “On behalf of the CMU community, I extend my sincere congratulations to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo and their teams for leading the way in strengthening Western Pennsylvania’s roles as an innovation engine for the nation and as a driver of the talent that will power it.”

“Pennsylvania has an extensive history of being at the forefront of innovation. We’re proving that in Pittsburgh you can not only build products in America but also offer world class education and intellectual capabilities to grow emerging industries,” said Pranesh Rao, Eos Senior Vice President of Storage System Engineering. “Building our software hub in Pittsburgh—surrounded by talented workers and a fast-growing innovation ecosystem—is both a strategic move and a catalyst to propel Eos to the next level.”

[TITLE]AI is boosting the legacy business for top Indian IT firms, for now:
[TEXT]
Four of the country’s five largest offshore services providers have reported an increase in software modernization deals as Fortune companies prepare to automate much of their backend tech work.

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, and Wipro Ltd reported a significant uptick in such deals, according to their earnings calls with analysts for the second quarter ended September. Two of the four said artificial intelligence (AI) is expediting software upgrades to automate clients’ tech functions.

According to at least one analyst, TCS and Infosys are getting a higher share of such legacy or core modernization deals. These involve replacing or transforming a company’s old information technology (IT) software with new ones that can handle large amounts of data and perform AI tasks quickly.

“...firms are investing in their digital core, preparing them for AI. This requires them to modernize much of their legacy so they can more easily get at the data," said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of Everest Research. “...Firms have long wanted to modernize their legacy, but the (high) cost has caused them to defer this expense. AI and the AI-related tools are significantly reducing the cost."

For homegrown IT services companies, such contracts offer an opportunity at a time when the $283-billion sector faces an uncertain FY26 due to tariff fluctuations and visa flip-flops in the US.

TCS, Infosys lead

“...As you would appreciate, many of our customers globally have a lot of technology debt that they have carried over the years," K Krithivasan, chief executive officer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said during the company’s post-earnings analyst call on 9 October. “GenAI and Agentic AI are powerful tools to really address the tech debt. You can use these AI, GenAI to understand the legacy code, and forward-engineer and deliver the new code. Modernization with AI is a huge opportunity, and we are seeing a significant uptick across customers."

According to Krithivasan, these are short-term deals that can be completed within a quarter. TCS's management also noted that the company is actively looking at delivering business outcomes with AI in a matter of weeks as part of its AI strategy for customers.

The Mumbai-based firm is also eyeing heightened deal activity in application support services and software development.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh called the overhaul of legacy software a huge opportunity because of AI.

“...in the past, without the AI tools, you could do modernization, but clients needed a longer time horizon. With some of the AI tools, the time horizon becomes less and as a consequence, the ROI (return on investment) for the client on that program is much better," Parekh said in response to Mint’s question during the company’s post-earnings press conference on 16 October. “What we anticipate now is, as the AI tools mature, we will see more and more of them (AI) being deployed on the modernization program."

According to Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, TCS and Infosys have the “highest exposure by volume", especially in banking, insurance, and healthcare, where legacy systems create both the biggest risk and biggest opportunity. “Wipro and HCLTech have been more aggressive repositioning as transformation partners rather than maintenance shops."

While TCS and Infosys said AI is hastening legacy modernization, India’s third-largest software services provider HCLTech said the spending on non-essential IT services is also gaining momentum because of tech transformation deals.

“I think the biggest demand elasticity is in modernization. While discretionary spend is whatever it is, we are seeing a number of programs which are coming up based on legacy modernization," said CEO C Vijayakumar during the company’s post-earnings call with analysts on 13 October. He said the clients who were skeptical
