[TITLE]GlobalFoundries Plans Billion-Euro Investment to Expand Chip Manufacturing in Germany:
[TEXT]
GlobalFoundries (GF) today announced plans to invest €1.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities at its Dresden, Germany site. The investment will enable a production capacity increase to more than one million wafers per year by the end of 2028, making it the largest site of its kind in Europe.The expansion, known as project SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act, with EU approval for the full program expected later this year. This investment underscores Saxony's role as a critical hub for semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and reinforces Europe's strategic goal of supply chain resilience.As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements.Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as part of his visit to GF Dresden on 28 October, welcomed the planned investments in Germany: "The SPRINT project is a commitment to Germany as an industrial and innovation location - and above all to the sovereignty of our country and Europe. The investment in chip manufacturing in Dresden sends a signal that Germany wants to play an active role in shaping the development of the global semiconductor market. Germany already plays a leading role in microelectronics in Europe. With its national microelectronics strategy, the federal government is setting the course for further expanding this strength."Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer adds: "The further expansion of semiconductor manufacturing here at GlobalFoundries is a clear commitment to a unique location. The billion-euro investment is more good news for Silicon Saxony, Europe's most important microelectronics location, and demonstrates the attractiveness and dynamism of the cluster that has grown here. This will not only strengthen the Saxon economy—Germany and Europe will also benefit. After all, more chips manufactured here also means more German and European sovereignty and technological independence in this key industry. Germany's economic vulnerability due to excessive dependencies is currently being demonstrated by the example of chip manufacturer Nexperia."The new manufacturing capacity will focus on GF's highly differentiated technologies - with critical performance features including low power, embedded secure memory, and wireless connectivity - all essential for meeting Europe's chip demand for automotive, internet of things (IoT), defense and critical infrastructure applications. These sectors are being rapidly transformed by the rise of physical AI technologies for which GF's semiconductors are essential. The investment will also support continued innovation in next-generation compute architectures and quantum technologies as they scale into the next decade."Recent disruptions in the automotive sector underscore just how vulnerable global chip supply chains truly are. Our planned expansion in Dresden is yet another step in GF's strategy to address these challenges head-on and deliver on our commitment to support Europe's need for secure supply chains and differentiated technologies," said Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "By scaling our manufacturing footprint in Europe, in the U.S. and around the world, GF is reinforcing its role as a resilient and trusted partner to customers in critical industries and building a foundation for the next wave of innovation as physical AI becomes reality."Dr. Manfred Horstmann, senior vice president and general manager European fabs at GlobalFoundries, adds: "With this planned investment, we are deepening our commitment to Germany and Europe. Expanding cleanroom capacity is not just

[TITLE]Gran Tierra Energy Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results and Announces Further Exploration Success in Ecuador:
[TEXT]
Gran Tierra Secures $200 Million Prepayment Facility Highlighting Strength of Portfolio

Increase and Extension of Canadian Credit Facility

Three Major Ecuador Discoveries Add to the Existing Success in Country

Colombia’s Southern Putumayo Cohembi Field Achieves Highest Production in a Decade

CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:GTE) (TSX:GTE) (LSE: GTE) announced the Company’s financial and operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 (the “Quarter”) and provided an operational update. All dollar amounts are in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and all production volumes are on an average working interest before royalties (“WI”) basis unless otherwise indicated. Production is expressed in barrels (“bbl”) of oil equivalent (“boe”) per day (“boepd” or “boe/d”) and are based on WI sales before royalties. For per boe amounts based on net after royalty (“NAR”) production, see Gran Tierra’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed October 30, 2025.

Message to Shareholders

“The Third Quarter showcased continued operational success across our portfolio. In Ecuador, we achieved further exploration success with the Conejo A-1 and A-2 wells and confirmed a new discovery at Chanangue-1, all of which highlight the significant potential of our acreage position. We also recently cased and cemented the Conejo A-2 well, targeting multiple prospective reservoirs including the Basal Tena and Hollin. The well discovered 41 feet of net reservoir with an average porosity of 13.8% in the Hollin formation suggesting well-connected reservoir quality over the full Conejo structural trap.

In Colombia, new wells at Costayaco continued to perform well, and the Cohembi field delivered a strong waterflood response, with production reaching levels not seen in over a decade. In Canada, we successfully drilled and brought two additional Lower Montney wells onstream, both meeting or exceeding expectations.

Production during the Quarter was temporarily impacted primarily by externally driven events, including a landslide in Ecuador that required the shut in of all Ecuador production for several weeks and trunk line repairs at the Moqueta field which resulted in the field being shut in for the Quarter. These volumes represent deferred bbls rather than lost production, and we are already seeing a strong recovery, with current production(2) averaging approximately 45,200 boepd. Based on the deferrals, we are forecasting the lower end of our production guidance range. The underlying assets continue to perform well, and our teams remain focused on ongoing optimization and maximizing production efficiency and cash flow with an expected exit rate of 47,000 to 50,000 boepd. We completed a number of initiatives to enhance liquidity and will be releasing our 2026 budget in mid December which will focus on free cash flow generation. The 2025 capital program was focused on fulfilling exploration commitments, which resulted in numerous material discoveries, and facility construction primarily in the Suroriente Block. With substantially all commitments behind us, the focus turns to free cash flow generation from our substantial, diversified resource base and deleveraging,” commented Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra Energy.

Operational Update:

Ecuador Another successful exploration well, Conejo A-1 was drilled during the Quarter on budget. The well was subsequently completed and tested the Hollin and Basal Tena sands. The Basal Tena and Hollin oil zones perforated over 19 feet (“ ft ”) and 40 ft of reservoir, respectively. Under natural flow conditions, the well has produced at stabilized rates over 308 hours at 1,328 bbls of oil per day (“ bopd ”), 26.9-degree API gravity oil, a 23.7% water cut, and a gas-oil ratio of 289 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel. During the fourth quarter, the Company plans to re-enter the well to install the final completion and conduct selective testing of each zone to optimize total well production. The Conejo A-2 well was spud on October 4, 2025, targeting multiple prospective reservoirs including the Basal Tena and Hollin. The well included coring of key intervals to further evaluate reservoir characteristics and potential. The Conejo A-2 well discovered 41 ft of net reservoir with an average porosity of 13.8% in the Hollin formation. Of particular interest is the outstanding reservoir quality suggesting high deliverability over the full Conejo structural trap. With the delivery of the Conejo A-2 well, Gran Tierra has completed all of the Exploration commitments in Ecuador and we are now well-positioned to continue to increase production into the development phase and establish our long-term growth position in Ecuador. A new oil discovery was made in the legacy Chanangue-1 well drilled in 1990 and suspended in 1992 on the Chanangue Block. The well was re-entered to test the previously bypassed Basal Tena formation, which was subsequently perforated and brought online. The well is currently producing approximately 600 bopd on jet pump. This discovery highlights significant reserve potential and is expected to generate additional future drilling opportunities on the eastern side of the Chanangue Block.

Colombia During the Quarter, Gran Tierra’s development program in the northern area of the Costayaco field continued to perform well, with all three new wells contributing to production growth. The Costayaco-63, -64, and -65 wells were drilled and brought onstream between late June to mid-August, achieving average initial 30-day oil rates ranging from approximately 600 to 1,100 bopd with water cuts between 25% and 70%. Combined production from these wells during the Quarter averaged approximately 1,700 bopd with an average water cut of around 60%, helping sustain stable field output. We are currently changing the artificial lift system from jet pump to electronic submersible pumps which is expected to add an incremental 1,000 - 1,500 bopd. Cohembi continues to deliver a strong waterflood response, with the five development wells drilled during the first half of 2025. Output from the northern area has increased by approximately 135%, rising from 2,800 to 6,700 gross bopd, with additional gains anticipated. Total field production has now exceeded 9,000 gross bopd – levels not achieved since 2014. Drilling has commenced a 6-well program which includes the Raju-1 exploration well, the 2nd well in the program, which is expected to spud in early November. The Raju-1 exploration well will be targeting a large prospective area north of the current development. We expect to have initial results from this well prior to year end 2025.

Canada Two additional Lower Montney wells were drilled, completed, and brought on stream in September, bringing total 2025 activity in Simonette to 4.0 gross (2.0 net) wells. Initial production performance has been very encouraging, with one well exceeding high-case expectations and another tracking closely to the base case and still cleaning up.

Capital Structure Optimization:

Executed Oriente Crude Oil Agreements providing for an initial advance of up to $150 million and an additional $50 million, to be repaid through scheduled deliveries of Ecuadorian Oriente crude oil; proceeds are expected to be used to repay debt and fund select capital initiatives.

Amended Colombian credit facility to align with the new prepayment structure, enhancing financial flexibility, reducing standby costs, and optimizing Gran Tierra’s overall capital structure.

Subsequent to the Quarter, the Company amended and restated the existing credit agreement of Gran Tierra Canada Ltd. (“ GT Canada ”) pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement dated October 30, 2025 to, among other things, increase the total available borrowing capacity available under its credit facilities (the “Canadian Credit Facilities”) from C$50.0 million to C$75.0 million. Other key amendments to the Canadian Credit Facilities as a result of such amendment and restatement are summarized as follows: The tenor of the Canadian Credit Facilities was extended by one year and converted from a “one year revolving facility with a one year term-out period” into a “two year revolving facility” with a maturity date of October 31, 2027; GT Canada’s lender completed its semi-annual borrowing base review, which resulted in the borrowing base remaining at C$100.0 million; and The existing uncommitted accordion feature (which contemplates a further increase of the Canadian Credit Facilities) was reduced from C$50.0 million to C$25.0 million.

Mr. Lowe continued, “Through our recent refinancing and equity raise, we have strengthened our balance sheet giving us greater capacity to invest in growth, both organically and through disciplined M&A, where we continue to see a robust pipeline of attractive opportunities. Additionally, we continue to progress on several key organic initiatives, including the expansion plans for our Engineered Air Movement businesses and launch of the Olympus Max product.”

Mr. Lowe further commented, “Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2025, we remain confident in the strength of customer demand and our operational momentum.

Third Quarter 2025

The revenue increase was primarily driven by:

an organic increase due predominantly to higher volumes of both heating and cooling products driven by continued strength in demand and higher throughput primarily resulting from increased production capacity; and

an inorganic increase from the acquisition of Sigma & Omega.

The segment income and segment income margin increases were due primarily to the revenue growth mentioned above and associated operating leverage.

Third Quarter 2025

The revenue increase was primarily driven by:

an organic increase primarily due to higher project volumes within our communication technologies business; and

an inorganic increase from the acquisition of KTS.

The segment income and segment income margin increases were due primarily to the revenue growth mentioned above and associated leverage on our fixed costs, particularly within SG&A expenses. This increase was partially offset by the impact of a less favorable project mix primarily within our communication technologies and transportation systems businesses.

[TITLE]Hub Group Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
Highlights:

GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.47 for the third quarter

Third quarter revenue of $934 m illion

Non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $0.49, which excludes adjusted items in the quarter

Operating income of $39 million or 4.2 % of revenue, adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) of $41 million or 4.4% of revenue

Closed on the acquisitions of Marten Transport Intermodal assets and SITH, LLC

Strong balance sheet with net debt/EBITDA LTM (non-GAAP) of 0.4x as of September 30, 2025

OAK BROOK, Ill., Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hub Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: HUBG) announced third quarter 2025 net income of $29 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.47. Adjusting for certain expenses of $1.2 million (pre-tax), third quarter 2025 adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $30 million decreased 6% from the prior year adjusted net income of $32 million. Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) of $0.49 per diluted share decreased $0.03 from $0.52 of adjusted EPS reported in the third quarter of 2024.

“During the third quarter, Hub Group continued to navigate softer demand across freight markets. Intermodal profitability and revenue per load increased sequentially and from prior year. The Logistics operating margin also improved, and Hub Group started onboarding recent Final Mile awards. Our continuous improvement approach to expense management helped offset the impact of lower revenue. The recent addition of Marten Intermodal accelerates the momentum of our refrigerated intermodal business, and our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation provide significant capital flexibility. We remain focused on serving customers and realizing the intermodal growth potential for Hub Group in collaboration with our rail partners Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. Hub Group is well positioned to deliver accelerating growth and further improvement in margin performance,” said Phil Yeager, Hub Group’s President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman.

Third Quarter 2025 Results

Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2025 was $934 million, a 5% decrease from $987 million reported in the third quarter of 2024. Stable intermodal volume and higher intermodal revenue per unit were partially offset by lower Dedicated and Logistics revenue reflecting sub-seasonal demand and lower fuel revenue.

Purchased transportation and warehousing costs of $684 million were 8% lower than prior year. Salaries and benefits of $143 million were stable compared to prior year as lower headcount offset the impact from the EASO transaction. Depreciation and amortization of $31 million decreased 3% from prior year. Insurance and claims of $10 million increased just 1% from prior year due to safety performance and lower claims costs in the quarter. General and administrative expenses decreased 9% from prior year due to benefits from cost saving initiatives.

GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $39 million or 4.2% of revenue and adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) was $41 million or 4.4% of revenue. Prior year adjusted operating income was $42 million or 4.3% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) for the third quarter was $88 million. Net debt/EBITDA LTM (non-GAAP) was 0.4x for the third quarter, below the leverage target range of 0.75x to 1.25x.

Intermodal and Transportation Solutions (“ITS”) Segment revenue was $561 million in the third quarter compared to $560 million in the prior year as growth in intermodal revenue was largely offset by lower dedicated revenue. GAAP ITS operating income was $16 million, or 2.8% of revenue. Adjusted ITS operating income (non-GAAP) was $16 million, or 2.9% of revenue, up from $15 million in the prior year.

Third quarter Logistics Segment revenue was $402 million, down from $461 million in the prior year due to lower volume and revenue per load in our brokerage business, a decrease in customer activity for consolidation and fulfillment, and soft demand in managed transportation and final mile businesses. GAAP Logistics operating income was $24 million, or 5.9% of revenue. Adjusted Logistics operating income (non-GAAP) was $25 million, or 6.1% of revenue, down from $28 million in the prior year, due to lower brokerage and consolidation and fulfillment results.

Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2025 totaled $9 million and decreased sequentially due to lower tractor fleet spending. As of September 30, 2025, Hub Group had cash and restricted cash of $147 million. Year-to-date the company returned $36 million to shareholders through dividend payments of $23 million and stock repurchases of $14 million.

2025 Outlook

We expect 2025 diluted earnings per share will range from $1.80 to $1.90. We estimate revenue of approximately $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion for the full year. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% and capital expenditures of less than $50 million for the full year.

OpenAI, Oracle and Related Digital will build a data-center campus of more than 1 gigawatt in Saline Township, Michigan, as part of their Stargate push to expand U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure capacity.

The announcement made on Thursday underscores the AI industry's surging appetite for computing power, driven by the pursuit of technology capable of matching or surpassing human intelligence.

The companies said it was a multi-billion dollar investment, without disclosing the exact figure. Industry executives have said 1 GW of computing power, enough to power roughly 750,000 U.S. homes, can cost around $50 billion.

The construction is slated to begin in early 2026.

The project is part of Oracle and OpenAI's 4.5-GW Stargate expansion and, together with six other U.S. sites, raises the infrastructure group's planned capacity to more than 8 GW and total investment to over $450 billion in the next three years.

OpenAI said the move kept Stargate ahead of schedule to meet its $500 billion, 10-GW commitment. The startup has shared few details on how it plans to fund the spending.

Earlier this week, it completed a restructuring that frees the ChatGPT maker to move away from its nonprofit roots. Reuters has reported it was laying the groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion.

But surging valuations of AI companies and their massive AI spending commitments, which total more than $1 trillion for OpenAI, have raised fears that the AI boom is inflating into a bubble.

OpenAI said on Thursday Related Digital would develop the Michigan project, which is expected to create more than 2,500 union construction jobs.

"This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation," said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI's vice president of industrial compute.

[TITLE]British Businesses to Save over £400m a Year as Government Slashes Electricity Costs:
[TEXT]
Government slashes electricity costs to save British businesses over £400m a year from April 2026 through landmark support under the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy.

UK industry including steel, chemicals, cement, glass and paper employing around 400,000 people to benefit from 90% discount on their electricity network charges.

Unprecedented support brings UK industrial energy costs in line with European competitors to protect jobs and attract new investment, helping drive growth and deliver Plan for Change.

Around 500 of the UK’s most energy-intensive businesses are set to save up to £420 million per year on their electricity bills from next April, as the Government takes decisive action to slash industrial energy costs.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle has today (31 October) announced that government will power ahead with plans to increase the discount on electricity network charges for businesses in sectors like steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, which employ around 400,000 people in total across the UK, from 60 percent to 90 percent.

Some of these businesses currently pay the highest industrial electricity prices in the G7, making it harder to stay competitive on the international stage, which is why the Government has taken decisive action to deliver this relief and level the playing field for industry.

The landmark support, which is being delivered at no extra cost to taxpayers, fulfils a crucial promise in the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy launched in June, and follows a four-week consultation on the plans for the increased discount which ran between July and August this year.

The increased discount will also slash costs for a range of businesses across Scotland and Wales to help them support local jobs and deliver growth, including Tata Steel at Port Talbot and INEOS in Grangemouth, ensuring the benefits are felt right across the country.

It comes on top of the Government’s landmark British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme announced in the modern Industrial Strategy, which will slash energy costs by 25 percent for over 7,000 businesses from 2027 in sectors like aerospace, automotive and chemicals, supporting hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs in these industries.

The Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will be funded through reforms to the energy system. The Government is reducing costs within the system to free up funding without raising household bills or taxes.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

British industry deserves a level playing field – and this government is delivering it. We’ve heard businesses loud and clear, and this landmark support will help them stay competitive on the global stage so they can invest and grow here in the UK. This is our Modern Industrial Strategy in action: practical, targeted support that secures jobs, attracts investment and drives our economy forward, as part of our Plan for Change.

Encirc Glass Managing Director Sean Murphy said:

This will be a major boost for our industry and will help British glass manufacturers compete with cheaper imports from regions that do not bear the same level of cost and regulation. By cutting the costs of energy in this way, the government is helping our industry to support thousands of jobs across the country whilst we make the transition to renewable sources of power. We welcomed the opportunity to engage with the Minister on the pressing challenges facing our sector. Continued government support for vital industries like glass manufacturing is essential to safeguarding jobs and unlocking investment across all regions of the UK.

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce said:

Our research shows energy costs remain a major concern, forcing many businesses who are struggling to pay their bills to raise prices. Energy is a business essential not a luxury. The promise of cheaper bills for hundreds of energy-intensive firms through increasing the discount on electricity network charges is welcome.

Community Union Assistant General Secretary Alasdair McDiarmid said:

We welcome the government’s determination to reduce the industrial energy costs which are such a huge burden on energy-intensive industries like steel. Whilst there is still more to do, the decision to increase the level of compensation for network charging costs from 60% to 90% is a huge step in the right direction. This will help avert carbon leakage, and will go some way towards boosting the competitiveness of our steel producers in line with European counterparts. After long years of neglect, our members in the steel sector know that they now have a government which is on their side.

The increased discount under the Network Charging Compensation (NCC) Scheme will bring down electricity bills for businesses by slashing the prices they pay to access the UK’s electricity network.

This will help bring industrial energy prices in line with other major European economies to keep the UK competitive on the global stage, protect local jobs in the UK’s foundational industries, and attract new investment, delivering on the Government’s Plan for Change.

The Government is also driving forward plans to have a new Connections Accelerator Service in force by the end of 2025, which will streamline access to the UK’s electricity grid.

This will make it easier for major investment projects to speed up delivery, bringing new high-quality jobs and growth to local communities and boosting the UK’s investment attractiveness further.

New Delhi: China has resumed supplying heavy rare earth magnets to India after six months, providing relief to companies in the electric vehicle, renewable energy, and consumer electronics sectors.Beijing has, however, imposed conditions - these magnets can't be re-exported to the US nor can they be used for military purposes, said people aware of the development. China and the US are embroiled in a trade war though both sides have agreed to take steps to partly ease tensions following US President Donald Trump's meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday.Chinese exporters to four companies in India - Hitachi , Continental, Jay-Ushin and DE Diamonds - secured approvals from local authorities for supplying the rare earth magnets, the people said.ET was the first to report on October 9 that China has sought guarantees that these magnets will not be re-exported to the US.China had also sought assurance that magnets will be used only to meet local requirements.Indian companies had already submitted end-user certificates (EUC) stating that the components will not be used for manufacturing weapons. However, more than 50 of these applications were pending approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce.“There seems to be some easing in supplies. Four companies have got approvals for importing rare earth magnets,” a senior industry executive in the know told ET. The executive also noted that direct flights have also resumed between India and China, connecting the cities of Kolkata and Guangzhou, from earlier this week. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal Thursday also confirmed Indian companies getting licences from China for importing rare earth magnets. However, he added, “We have to look at how the US and China talks will play into our domain.”In India, EV makers are the largest consumers of these powerful magnets. These magnets are also key to other high-tech industries such as renewable energy, electronics manufacturing, and aerospace and defence.China controls 90% of the global production of these magnets. China on April 4 announced export controls on medium and heavy rare earth-related items with a view to “safeguarding national security”, in response to President Trump imposing tariffs on Beijing. The April notification mandated exporters that ship such items to seek a licence from China’s commerce department after getting an EUC from the buyer. The EUC requires buyers to guarantee these items will not be used for storing, manufacturing, producing, or processing weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. While China has over the past few months resumed supplies of rare earth magnets to companies in Europe and Southeast Asia, export licences were not issued to vendors supplying to India. India imported 870 tonnes of rare earth magnets valued at ₹306 crore in FY25.
