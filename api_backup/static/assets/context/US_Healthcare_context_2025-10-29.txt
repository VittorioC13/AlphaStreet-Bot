[TITLE]Molina Healthcare stock falls as medical costs spike, Obamacare worries mount:
[TEXT]
Molina Healthcare (MOH) stock cratered Thursday morning, falling more than 20% in the first hours of the trading session after the company disclosed a hefty miss on earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter due to rising medical expenses.

The company also slashed its guidance for the fourth quarter.

Molina's adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.84, the company announced Wednesday, missing analyst expectations of $3.89 per share by more than 50%. Molina is now projecting fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $0.35, far below analysts' expectations of $2.42 per share.

The crux of the problem is a critical measure for healthcare providers: the ratio of premium revenue to medical expenses, which Molina refers to as the medical care ratio (MCR).

Healthcare companies like Molina charge customers a premium on their healthcare plans and then use that money to cover the expenses incurred by medical treatment the customer requires. The delta between those figures is a key metric for determining profitability.

The commonly accepted range for a good MCR is roughly 80% to 85%, according to the Corporate Finance Institute. Molina's consolidated MCR, across all of its plan offerings, was 92.6% for the third quarter, compared to 89.2% in the same quarter last year, as the increased cost of medical expenses has eaten into the company's margins.

A ratio of 92.6% means the company had only 7.4 cents per dollar of premium revenue left over to cover costs and reinvest into the business after paying for customers' medical expenses. Part of the problem for Molina is that customers are using their plans.

"As medical cost trends increase beyond [early 2025] rates, our MCR increased each quarter," Molina CEO Joseph Zubretsky said on Molina's third quarter earnings call Thursday morning. "The rate updates we received later in the year and risk corridors did not provide an adequate buffer."

Plans under the Affordable Care Act, which take up an increasingly growing share of Molina's offerings, have been a significant thorn in the company's side.

Molina's MCR for ACA plans was 95.6% in the third quarter, far above both the 86% MCR analysts had predicted for the quarter and Molina's own 73% ACA ratio for the same quarter last year.

Centene (CNC), another insurer like Molina with a large ACA customer base, saw its ACA-specific expense ratio jump to 90.6% in the second quarter from 73.4% the previous year. The company is scheduled to report third quarter earnings on Oct. 29.

[TITLE]Onward Therapeutics Exercises Exclusive Option and Signs Worldwide License Agreement with Institut du Cancer de Montpellier for Novel Onco-Metabolism Program:
[TEXT]
EPALINGES, Switzerland, Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Onward Therapeutics SA, a clinical stage oncology company, today announced that its French subsidiary, Onward Therapeutics France, has exercised its exclusive option and entered into a worldwide license agreement with Institut du Cancer de Montpellier (ICM), France, to further advance a breakthrough program in onco-metabolism.

This license agreement builds upon the exclusive collaboration and option agreement signed between Onward Therapeutics France and ICM, Inserm and Université de Montpellier in June 2021, under which the company provided research funding to support the discovery program at ICM. The successful progress achieved through this collaboration has led to the identification of promising compounds and the transition of the drug discovery program into Onward Therapeutics' development pipeline. The program is currently in lead optimization, with the goal of nominating IND-enabling candidates next year.

The program, designated OT-S00X by Onward Therapeutics, is an innovative onco-metabolism project aimed at expanding therapeutic possibilities in cancer treatment. Proof-of-principle studies have demonstrated strong preclinical efficacy, and promising candidates from two distinct chemical series have already been identified, and compounds with improved physico-chemical properties will be generated through artificial intelligence approaches.

"OT-S00X represents a breakthrough in targeting tumor onco-metabolism. Preclinical studies have shown that the efficacy of these compounds strongly correlates with a predictive biomarker of response across multiple tumor types, providing a clear rationale for this novel mechanism of action." said Dr. Armand de Gramont, Chief Scientific Officer of Onward Therapeutics."OT-S00X introduces a differentiated metabolic strategy that broadens our pipeline and primarily provides an innovative way to tackle cancer resistance," added Dr Alain Herrera, President of Onward Therapeutics France and Chief Medical Officer of Onward Therapeutics.

"We are delighted to strengthen our collaboration with Onward Therapeutics," said Prof. Marc Ychou, Directeur Général of ICM. "The innovative OT-S00X program, initially developed by our research teams together with Inserm and Université de Montpellier, demonstrates the potential of translational science to generate novel therapeutic strategies in oncology. It also highlights the international reach of ICM and the strength of the Montpellier MedVallée ecosystem in driving cancer innovation."

Key Factors Driving the Growth of the Gastroparesis Market

Rising Gastroparesis Prevalence

According to DelveInsight analysis, the United States accounted for approximately 715K cases of gastroparesis in 2024. These cases are anticipated to increase by 2034. This upward trend is driven by the rising prevalence of diabetes, the leading underlying cause, improved diagnostic tools enabling more accurate detection, and greater clinical awareness leading to higher diagnosis rates

GIMOTI’s Role in Optimizing Healthcare Efficiency

GIMOTI is the only approved drug demonstrated to reduce hospitalizations, emergency room visits, medical office visits, and associated healthcare costs compared to oral metoclopramide, providing a clear clinical and economic advantage.

Clinical Promise of Naronapride

Naronapride uniquely integrates 5-HT4 receptor agonist with D2 receptor antagonism within a single molecule. Given its promising clinical profile and the growing unmet need in gastrointestinal disorders, there is a compelling opportunity for Renexxion Ireland and Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH to expand its research into dual-targeted therapeutic approaches.

Novel Gastroparesis Competitive Landscape

Companies like Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Tradipitant), Neurogastrx (NG101), CinDome Pharma (Deudomperidone), Renexxion Ireland (Naronapride), Processa Pharmaceuticals and Intact Therapeutics (PCS12852), and others are investigating their key products for gastroparesis.

Emergence of Novel Drug Classes

The pipeline of novel therapeutic candidates targeting diverse mechanisms such as NK-1R antagonists (Tradipitant), 5-HT4 receptor agonists (PCS12852), D2 receptor antagonists (NG101), dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonists (CIN-102), and others demonstrates strong innovation and commitment to addressing unmet needs in gastroparesis treatment.

Gastroparesis Market Analysis

Managing gastroparesis remains challenging, focusing primarily on symptom relief and improving gastric motility rather than providing a definitive cure. Initial strategies often involve lifestyle modifications, including dietary adjustments, glycemic control, and adequate hydration, but these measures generally yield only modest benefits for most patients. Pharmacologic treatments form the cornerstone of therapy: prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin are used to promote gastric emptying, while antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, phenothiazines) and neuromodulators (tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, delta ligands) help manage nausea, vomiting, and related symptoms.

GIMOTI, a nasal form of metoclopramide, offers a non-oral option for those with persistent symptoms despite oral therapy. Nevertheless, many patients continue to experience inadequate symptom control. In severe, treatment-resistant cases, advanced interventions like gastric electrical stimulation or G-POEM may be considered, though both are invasive, expensive, and supported by limited evidence. Overall, existing treatments reveal significant unmet needs, emphasizing the necessity for safer, more effective, and accessible therapeutic options for gastroparesis.

The therapeutic landscape for gastroparesis is gradually evolving as new candidates progress through development. Companies including Vanda Pharmaceuticals (tradipitant), CinDome Pharma (deudomperidone), Processa Pharmaceuticals (PCS12852), Renexxion Ireland, Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH (Naronapride), Neurogastrx (NG101), and others are actively investigating treatments aimed at improving symptom management and overall disease control across the 7MM.
