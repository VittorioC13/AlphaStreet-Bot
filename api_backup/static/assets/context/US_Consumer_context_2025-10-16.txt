Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the UK’s largest retail investment platforms, has warned that bitcoin should not be treated as a core part of investment portfolios — even as it prepares to offer crypto products to clients for the first time.

In a statement published on its website, the Bristol-based firm said bitcoin, despite its long-term price gains, “is not an asset class” and lacks the intrinsic characteristics that would justify including it in a portfolio for growth or income.

[TITLE]Report: Americans Will Soon Be Paying 55% of Tariff Costs:
[TEXT]
US consumers will soon be footing more than half the bill for President Trump's tariffs, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs economists. Six months after tariffs took effect on everything from copper to cars, the investment bank's analysts estimate Americans will be paying

[TITLE]Why US consumers will pay for over half of Trump tariffs this year: Goldman Sachs estimate:
[TEXT]
US consumers will end up paying for more than half of President Trump’s tariffs by the end of the year, according to a note released Sunday by Goldman Sachs economists.

American consumers will shoulder 55% of tariff costs, while US companies will take on 22% and foreign exporters will absorb 18% by slashing prices on their goods, economists including Elsie Peng and David Mericle wrote in the note.

“US businesses are likely bearing a larger share of the costs” as they aim to raise prices gradually, the economists said.

“If recently implemented and future tariffs have the same eventual impact on prices as the tariffs implemented earlier this year, then US consumers would eventually absorb 55% of tariff costs.”

The wide-ranging levies will likely hike the inflation rate to 3% – well above the Fed’s 2% goal – by December, according to the note.

Trump’s tariffs have already pushed core personal consumption expenditure prices – which are used in the Fed’s key inflation reading – up by 0.44% so far this year, the economists wrote.

“The President and Administration’s position has always been clear: while Americans may face a transition period from tariffs upending a broken status quo that has put America Last, the cost of tariffs will ultimately be borne by foreign exporters,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told The Post in a statement.

“Companies are already shifting and diversifying their supply chains in response to tariffs, including by onshoring production to the United States.”

Trump has insisted that foreign nations will eat the bulk of the tariffs. But the import taxes are directly paid by US firms during the customs process.

Foreign companies absorb tariff costs when they slash their prices to remain competitive and hold onto market share.

However, Goldman’s analysis is hinged on a sizable “if,” since Trump’s tariffs are constantly evolving during trade talks with foreign nations.

Most recently, Trump threatened a “massive increase” of duties on China to 100% as he accused the nation of “becoming very hostile” in its rare earth restrictions. Goldman’s latest analysis does not include this new rate on China.

Goldman has already lowered its projected tariff impact from its analysis in August. At the time, it wrote that consumers had absorbed just 22% of tariff costs thus far, but predicted their share would jump to 67%.

Trump blasted Goldman and its CEO David Solomon over the report, which claimed US consumers would end up bearing the brunt of the tariffs once they finished working their way through the economy.

“They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else,” the president wrote in a Truth Social post after the August report’s release.

Economic data has been on hold amid the government shutdown, which entered its thirteenth day on Monday. But some furloughed employees are reportedly being called back to help release September’s inflation report on Oct. 24, nine days after it was initially due.

So far, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has missed its deadline for the release of a highly-anticipated monthly jobs report.

Economists and policymakers have been closely monitoring employment data, especially as some Fed officials cite a slowing labor market to justify further interest rate cuts.

According to the most recently available data, US consumer inflation heated up to 2.9% in August as tariffs started to drive up prices.

[TITLE]IMF upgrades U.S. economic outlook as tariffs cause less disruption, for now:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and global economies will grow a bit more this year than previously forecast as the Trump administration’s tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the agency also said the extensive duties still pose risks.

The United States’ economy will expand 2% in 2025, the IMF projected in its influential semi-annual forecast, the World Economic Outlook. That is slightly higher than the 1.9% forecast in the IMF’s last update in July and 1.8% in April. The U.S. should grow 2.1% next year, also just one-tenth of a percent faster than its previous projection, the IMF said.

The global economy, meanwhile, will grow 3.2% this year, up from a 3% estimate in July, the IMF forecast, and 3.1% in 2026, the same as its previous estimate.

The figures represent a bit of a round-trip for the IMF: In January, before President Donald Trump began imposing tariffs, it had forecast global growth of 3.3%, only slightly higher than its newest estimate. While the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it’s too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the IMF said, as Trump has continued to make tariff threats and it can take time for changes in international trade patterns to play out.

On Friday, for example, Trump threatened to slap 100% duties on all imports from China, which caused a sharp fall in the stock market.

IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a news conference that the import taxes and ongoing threats to impose more duties have created ongoing uncertainty for many businesses and it’s weighing on the world economy.

“The tariff shock is here, and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects,” he said.

Gourinchas also said that a burst of investment in artificial intelligence, in the form of huge data centers and extensive computing power, has helped offset the drag from trade and boosting the U.S. economy. Yet if a financial market bubble formed and then burst, it could sharply slow business investment and consumer spending, he said.

“There are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s,” he said. “It was the Internet then, it is AI now.”

Shares of two companies active in the AI sector, AMD and Oracle, which announced an expanding partnership Tuesday, have seen their shares rise 80% this year.

Gains in AI-related stock values have lifted Americans’ wealth and fueled consumer spending, Gourinchas said, just as companies are ramping up their investments in advanced computer chips and building data centers. Hotter spending and investment could push central banks to raise interest rates over time, he said.

Gourinchas also offered several reasons the U.S. and global economies have remained resilient after the widespread imposition of tariffs earlier this year.

“First and foremost, the tariff shock itself is smaller than initially feared, with many trade deals and exemptions,” he said. “Most countries also refrained from retaliation, keeping the trading system open. And the private sector also proved agile, front-loading imports and re-routing supply chains.”

By front-loading imports, many U.S. companies were able to stock up on goods before the duties took effect, enabling them to avoid or delay price increases.

Yet many of those factors only reflect “temporary relief, rather than underlying strength in economic fundamentals,” the IMF’s report said.

The IMF also said that import price data in the U.S. shows that so far importers and retailers are paying most of the tariffs, not overseas companies, as many Trump administration officials have predicted. Over time, those firms are likely to pass on more of the price hikes to consumers, the report said.

There are signs that some downsides of the higher tariffs are starting to emerge, the IMF outlook said. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, has ticked up to 2.9%, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, up from 2.7% a year ago. Hiring has ground to nearly a halt, which could partly reflect a more cautious approach by many firms in the wake of the uncertainty created by the higher tariffs.

The IMF’s forecasts are modestly more optimistic than many private-sector economists’ expectations. The National Association for Business Economics, a group of academic and business economists, on Monday forecast that the U.S. would grow just 1.8% this year and 1.7% in 2026.

Nearly two-thirds of the economists surveyed by the NABE said they think the administration’s duties are nevertheless slowing growth, by up to a half-percentage point.

China, meanwhile, has weathered the hit from U.S. tariffs by sending more of its goods to Europe and Asia, rather than the United States, the IMF said. Its currency has depreciated, which has made its exports cheaper. The IMF is forecasting that China’s economy will expand 4.8% this year and 4.2% in 2026, the same as in July.

Gourinchas said that China’s economy has grown increasingly dependent on exports, while its real estate sector continues to struggle under heavy debt loads.

“It is increasingly hard to see how this could be sustained,” he added.

In Europe, Germany is bolstering growth by increasing government spending to build up its military, Gourinchas said. The IMF now expects the 20 countries that use the euro to grow 1.2% this year, up from a 1% forecast in July, and 1.1% next year, the same as three months ago.

The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.

[TITLE]Two Brothers rides India's organic food wave with ₹110 crore funding:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: Organic foods products company Two Brothers Organic Farms, based in Pune, has raised ₹110 crore in a Series B funding round led by 360 ONE Asset, Rainmatter Investments, Narotam Sekhsaria Family Office and Rahul Garg of Ignite Growth LLP.

The funding comes at a time when large fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are investing in organic food brands, signalling growing consumer awareness around clean labels and nutrition among consumers. Tata Consumer products has picked up a stake in Organic India and ITC Ltd has done so with 24 Mantra.

Earlier this year health food brand Anveshan raised ₹48 crore in a Series A funding round led by Wipro Consumer Care Ventures. It will use the capital primarily to expand it manufacturing capabilities, expand its international reach, and scale its operational capacity.

In June 2024, Two Brothers Organic Farms raised ₹58.25 crore in a Series A round largely led by Rainmatter, an investment platform owned by Zerodha, along with investors such as Raju Chekuri, founder of NetEnrich.

Organic growth

Founded by fourth-generation farmers Ajinkya and Satyajit Hange, Two Brothers Organic Farms sells more than 100 products including A2 cultured ghee, khapli atta, peanut butter, honey, pickles and cold-pressed oils.

“What began on two gas stoves on our farm has now turned into manufacturing facilities spanning over 60,000 square feet," Satyajit Hange said in an interview with Mint. “We were completely bootstrapped for the first five to six years. We began by selling at farmers’ markets in Mumbai every Sunday before launching our online business six years ago," he said. The company now clocks average monthly revenue of ₹20 crore, with 95% of sales coming from online channels.

A portion of the new funds raised will go towards building a large integrated food park in Maharashtra. “We plan to invest up to ₹10 crore from this fundraise to start creating a food park ecosystem. It will be spread across 10-15 acres and include everything related to food manufacturing—labs, packaging, weighing scales, water treatment, farmer training facilities and more. The total investment will happen over three to five years."

Health food boom

India's organic-food market (domestic and exports) is currently estimated at ₹10,000 crore in size. According to a September note by Worldpanel by Numerator (formerly Kantar), health-oriented foods and beverages now representing ₹63,093 crore in value, having grown at 11.7% compounded annually over the past four years.

Stalwarts are lining up to tap the opportunity. In January 2024 Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL) acquired Organic India for an estimated ₹1,900 crore to create a ‘health and wellness platform’.

And in April 2025 ITC Limited acquired Sresta Natural Bioproducts Private Limited, which sells organic foods under the 24 Mantra Organic brand, for ₹472 crore. The company said at the time the category had high growth potential, given the low penetration levels and growing consumer preference for natural and organic foods.

Premium pricing

At ₹3,370 for a one-litre jar of A2 Gir Cow-Cultured Ghee, Two Brothers is at the top end of the premium market. A litre of Amul ghee costs ₹650.

“Yes our products are premium, but 45% of our consumers are from metro cities and 55% from smaller towns. With scale, we intend to pass on savings and lower prices. Some of our products like wood-pressed oils and jaggery powder are already very competitively priced because of our backward integration."

The company plans to go deeper into its core staples and expand its kitchen and dining table offerings. It aims to close FY26 with revenue exceeding ₹200 crore, up from ₹108 crore in FY25. “Awareness around organic and chemical-free food has grown drastically—especially post-covid," Hange added.

This ‘organic trend’ will become stronger as awareness around health and wellness grows, said Devangshu Dutta, founder and chief executive of consulting firm Third Eyesight. “For most brands, initially the consumption may be driven by upper-income customers, perhaps located in a few of the largest cities," he said.

He added, however, that companies may face challenges in execution owing to the rampant use of harmful fertilisers and pesticides in India. Because of this, brands will find it hard to maintain their organic nature unless they work with an ever-growing number of cultivators over large tracts of land over the years, he said. "To do this profitably, brands do need to scale significantly, and for this their price premium must drop," Dutta added.

[TITLE]Facing unprecedented demand, Weld Food Bank manages rising costs, funding cuts:
[TEXT]
On any given weekday, the line at the Weld Food Bank will stretch well out of the parking lot onto H Street. On the busiest days, the line may even back up to the FedEx shipping center, nearly a half mile north of the food bank.

A line of that magnitude was unfathomable to food bank staff and volunteers before the COVID-19 pandemic. Even a few years ago, it was quite the surprise when the line left the parking lot.

“The line to the street used to be a couple times a year, and when that happened, it was panic,” Director of Marketing and Communications Weston Edmunds said. “Now it’s every time I drive in.”

This year, through the Emergency Food Program and the Senior Feeding Program — the two programs that operate out of the warehouse at 1108 H St. in Greeley — the food bank is serving an average of 1,700 people daily, five times the daily pre-pandemic average of

[TITLE]OpenAI's new deal with Walmart shows how AI is going to shake up the shopping experience:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

AI shopping may be going mainstream.

On Tuesday, Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, announced a partnership with OpenAI to shake up the e-commerce experience. Shoppers can now make direct Walmart purchases through the ChatGPT app and plan their purchases around their individual meals and needs.

"For many years now, eCommerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses," Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart Inc., said in a statement. "That is about to change."

The move marks an expansion of Walmart's partnership with OpenAI, which has so far been focused on more internal use of the AI company's tools. Walmart launched a new AI skills training program for employees this summer, and last month rolled out access to the enterprise-grade ChatGPT for Sam's Club workers.

At the same time, Walmart has been developing its own in-house army of AI agents, such as the AI assistant Sparky, which perform some of the same tasks as OpenAI's products.

However, when asked whether he has a preference for shoppers using Walmart's tools or those made by another company, Walmart US CEO John Furner said last month that he's only concerned with making it easier for shoppers to buy from Walmart.

"We want to make sure we're building in the flexibility that you can shop however you want," he said. "Whether that comes off of our marketplace — it's pickup, delivery, it's our stores — I need to make sure that we're just there to prepare you the way that you want to be served."

Several retail analysts said this partnership is yet another way Walmart is pulling ahead of the competition when it comes to integrating AI throughout its operations.

"We view this as a major step forward in the adoption and broader acceleration of agentic commerce," Mizuho analyst David Bellinger said in a note. "Walmart is clearly ahead of the curve here, while others have been slow to adapt or even made efforts to block AI web crawlers."

Agentic shopping refers to a new model of e-commerce where an AI agent handles consumers' product searches, comparisons, and even purchases. A shopper could input queries such as what kind of cereal to purchase based on their flavor preference, and an agent may spit out a list of recommendations, and then make the purchase on the customer's behalf.

Tuesday's announcement also shows that AI-assisted shopping is shaping up to be more than just a fleeting phase.

In September, ChatGPT also pushed further into the retail market by partnering with Stripe to create the "Instant Checkout" button, where users could directly buy an item in the chat. Merchants usually have to pay a small fee for this feature, and it is unclear how the algorithm works when it comes to shopping recommendations for users. The rollout has already been adopted by Etsy sellers in the US for some single-item purchases.

Opening up retail to a brand new way of shopping also comes with less control over listings and traffic, which are risks that e-commerce giant Amazon has been reluctant to take. While Walmart and Target have doubled down on agent shopping with external partnerships like ChatGPT, Amazon has restricted open access to its product listings, and most of its products do not consistently appear on AI chatbots.

Meanwhile, Amazon is going all in on its internal AI tool named Rufus, which is embedded in Amazon's search bar and acts as a shopping assistant. It is currently unable to directly shop for consumers, but it protects Amazon's $56 billion advertising business, which relies on the traffic of shoppers visiting its site and not shopping through an external chatbot.

With 50 million shopping-related queries flowing through ChatGPT on a daily basis, this holiday season will be a test of whether agent shopping can truly drive sales for Walmart.

"We're still learning how these strategies are going to go," Furner said in last month's remarks. "I don't think we know yet where it's going to end, but we do know that the work that we're doing with our agent, Sparky, is a great place to start."

Now you can add ChatGPT to that list.

[TITLE]Walmart partners with OpenAI so shoppers can buy things directly in ChatGPT:
[TEXT]
Walmart is partnering with OpenAI to give shoppers a new feature that lets them complete purchases using ChatGPT, as the retailer invests in artificial intelligence to improve operations.

Using ChatGPT's new "Instant Checkout" feature, shoppers in conversation with the AI-powered bot will be able to browse Walmart's offerings and complete purchases from within the app.

ChatGPT first announced "Instant Checkout" last month. The shopping feature lets users query ChatGPT for things like "best mattress under $1,000" or "gift for an avid reader," and buy suggested products from within the chat, without having to navigate outside the app.

With the Walmart partnership, the AI-driven shopping experience "allows customers and Sam's Club members to plan meals, restock essentials, or discover new products simply by chatting — Walmart will take care of the rest," the retail giant said Tuesday.

Walmart touts the move as a push beyond traditional e-commerce search tools that retrieve products solely based on consumers requests. "AI will learn and predict customers' needs, turning shopping from a reactive experience into a proactive one — what Walmart calls agentic commerce," the company said Tuesday.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the consumer-facing enhancement is long overdue.

"For many years now, eCommerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses. That is
