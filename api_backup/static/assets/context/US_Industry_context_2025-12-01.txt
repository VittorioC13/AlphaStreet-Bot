[TITLE]Catamaran Ventures to follow patient capital route in bets on India's manufacturing push:
[TEXT]
Billionaire N R Narayan Murthy's family office Catamaran Ventures plans to make more growth stage equity bets in manufacturing, a top executive at the firm said on Wednesday.

“Our thesis is based on the view that over the next 5-10 years in India, from a wealth and job creation perspective, the country needs to develop its supply chain for precision manufacturing," Deepak Padaki, president at Catamaran Ventures told Mint.

Murthy, a co-founder of information technology services bellwether Infosys Ltd, is chairman emeritus of Catamaran.

Over the last year, several funds have been deepening their focus on manufacturing as a sector, with some launching new funds to narrow down on the industry's potential. Much of this is backed by private equity and venture capital's belief that manufacturing and supply chain companies are going to be what pushes India to become an export-led economy.

“Themes like import substitution (for EMS), rising domestic consumption (for packaging, building materials) and India’s emergence as an export hub (for chemicals, auto, engineered solutions, aerospace and defense) are providing structural long-term impetus to companies," said Koushik Bhattacharyya, managing director and head of industrials investment banking at Mumbai investment bank Avendus Capital. (EMS is short for electronic manufacturing services.)

So far, Catamaran has two precision manufacturing investments: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker. Both companies are headed for IPOs.

Catamaran has so far made two investments in the manufacturing space, both of which are headed for the public markets: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker looking to raise up to Rs1,000 crore through an offer for sale. Catamaran has also invested in point-of-care medical diagnostics company Achira Labs.

The family office's sees supply chain manufacturing companies as not a good fit with typical venture capital bets given the long gestation period for such businesses. Most generalist VC funds look for exits in a five to six year horizon.

Manufacturing, which is considered a sub-sector of deeptech given the changing nature of the activity and patents around it, take as long as 10-15 years to come of some scale. For private equity to back such startups, on the other hand, they need them to be more mature businesses.

“We're more mid-market private equity when it comes to manufacturing. We thought about how we as a family office can put money into companies that is patient capital," said Padaki.

Sectors of opportunity

Catamaran is focused on a few areas within manufacturing: aerospace, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the electric vehicle space, medical devices and semiconductor companies.

The family office sees defence as “interesting" while on the lookout for companies that have achieved some scale and can be taken global — of which it has seen very few. Even on the aerospace side, apart from Aequs, despite Catamaran's desire to do more in the coming year, the pipeline is looking thin.

There's more action in electric vehicle OEMs, however. “There's a lot of small component manufacturers in places like NCR (Delhi region) and Coimbatore that are promoter-owned who are switching to EVs because we already have a strong base in auto component manufacturing," said Padaki. “We're more interested in EV supply chain components like motors, electronic systems, that kind of thing."

Catamaran is also looking to back battery recycling companies that are looking to claw back the rare earth materials used to make EV batteries.

In the electronics and semiconductor space, there are two burgeoning ends like a dumbbell. On the one end, there are plenty of startups but they're still very early in their journey, and on the other, there's fabrication companies which require very large investments to build out factories. Catamaran is scouting for those in the middle. “We're looking for companies that are in the semiconductor or data center space that are looking for growth capital support," said the Catamaran president.

Cheques from Catamaran would range from ₹50 crore to ₹250 crore and in some exceptional cases, the family office is willing to go up to ₹400-500 crore, especially when companies from outside India are looking to build joint-ventures for strategic partnerships in the country.

Previously, Catamaran had a joint venture with e-commerce behemoth Amazon back in 2014 called Cloudtail. In 2021, Amazon acquired the family office's stake due to stricter rules for e-commerce marketplaces with foreign investments.

The firm has traditionally been selective in how it makes investments and that's not changing going into 2026. "Our run rate is typically two to three investments, for which we have to look at 10-12 companies" said Padaki. “These are long gestation in terms of companies because we have to understand the promoters for some time to build relationships. Even next year, we're looking to do maybe two or three."

Manufacturing maturity in 2026

India saw some large deals by risk capital players in manufacturing this year. VIP Industries raised $206 million in a round led by Multiples. Euler Motors secured $75 million from GIC and British International Investments, while Scimplify raised $40 million in a deal led by Accel and Omnivore Partners. Rangsons Aerospace also raised capital in a round led by ValueQuest.

Many of the manufacturing startups that cropped up between 2018-2020 are also now on the lookout for their growth rounds. “Valuations need to see a shift," said Padaki. “The reason many of these companies don't get high valuations is because people don't understand that these are ROCE businesses and not growth-at-all-costs businesses."

ROCE stands for return on capital employed and is a ratio used to assess a company's profitability and capital efficiency, essentially giving insight into how well it is doing based on the money it is spending.

Aequs and SEDEMAC are both heading for the public markets and Catamaran hopes their debut will set the precedent for IPOs by other manufacturers. “Today, you don't have that many precedents of small promoter-owned companies that have suddenly gone public," Padaki said.

Given how the various themes are playing out across manufacturing and precision manufacturing, both venture capital and private equity players have their ears perked for companies that are growing sustainably. “While some near-term factors like tariff might lead to temporary uncertainty, we see large amounts of private capital entering this sector in the next 3-5 years," said Avendus' Bhattacharyya.

[TITLE]NeoVolta Enters into Definitive Agreements Led by Infinite Grid Capital to Advance 2 GWh U.S. Battery Energy Storage System Manufacturing Initiative:
[TEXT]
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeoVolta Inc. (NASDAQ: NEOV) (“NeoVolta” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based energy technology company delivering scalable storage for resilient residential and commercial power infrastructure, today announced that it has entered into agreements for a $13 million private placement financing anchored by Infinite Grid Capital (“IGC”), in connection with a long-term relationship to support NeoVolta’s next phase of scalable growth and U.S.-based manufacturing expansion.

The investment is structured to provide both immediate and future capital support for NeoVolta’s planned domestic manufacturing initiative. In addition to the relationship with IGC, a substantial portion of the investment proceeds is intended to advance this initiative pursuant to a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with third parties to establish and operate a state-of-the-art battery energy storage manufacturing facility in Georgia. This initiative, if pursued to completion, would emphasize domestic production aligned with federal incentives supporting battery manufacturing and compliance with relevant standards.

The facility under consideration is designed for an initial annual capacity of approximately 2 GWh, with a focus on utility-level and commercial & industrial (C&I) battery energy storage systems (BESS) that are expected to significantly expand NeoVolta’s addressable market and revenue opportunity. Operations are expected to ramp up in 2026, subject to definitive agreements and successful execution. In addition, the capital raised through this financing substantially improves NeoVolta’s financial position, significantly enhancing liquidity and addressing working capital needs to support ongoing growth initiatives.

NeoVolta and IGC also plan to establish a shared framework to evaluate potential future commercial opportunities, including offtake arrangements that may align NeoVolta’s commercial channels with IGC’s grid-scale pipeline, subject to definitive agreements.

“We are thrilled to welcome Infinite Grid Capital as a long-term strategic investor with their $10 million investment,” said Ardes Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of NeoVolta. “IGC is well-capitalized and highly aligned with our vision as we advance our domestic manufacturing plans and scale our commercial and grid-aligned channels. The investment delivers the capital and support we need while preserving the flexibility essential to our next phase of growth. We are now well-positioned to pursue a manufacturing platform capable of capturing strong downstream demand in the rapidly expanding U.S. battery energy storage market.”

“IGC is proud to back NeoVolta’s U.S. manufacturing initiative,” said Frank Liu, General Partner and CEO of Infinite Grid Capital. “This partnership reflects our commitment to advancing domestic energy storage capabilities and enabling the next phase of scalable growth.”

As the relationship develops, NeoVolta and IGC will provide updates on key milestones and the continued evolution of NeoVolta’s manufacturing and market initiatives, including details on production schedules, operational dynamics, and potential strategic collaborations. The MOU is non-binding and subject to negotiation of definitive agreements. While there is no assurance that the parties will reach agreement on final terms or that the proposed manufacturing initiative will be consummated, NeoVolta and IGC remain committed to advancing strategic manufacturing opportunities.

[TITLE]Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway:

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.

[TITLE]Asset Management Strategist Says It's Time To Rethink How We Measure Poverty:
[TEXT]
Simplify Asset Management chief strategist Mike Green hit the nail on the head on his Substack post on why so many Americans feel like they're drowning these days. Green also delved into how we measure the federal poverty level, and why it's completely inadequate in today's society.

Here's a portion of his post, titled Part 1: My Life Is a Lie, How a Broken Benchmark Quietly Broke America, and after all of the facts and figures in the beginning, here's some of the meat of it:

This week, while trying to understand why the American middle class feels poorer each year despite healthy GDP growth and low unemployment, I came across a sentence buried in a research paper: “The U.S. poverty line is calculated as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation.” I read it again. Three times the minimum food budget. I felt sick.

After discussing that the number was based on the fact that most families at the time spent roughly a third of their income on food, and during that time housing was relatively cheap. So was healthcare. Most women stayed at home and both parents did not need to work, and then things changed:

Housing costs exploded. Healthcare became the largest household expense for many families. Employer coverage shrank while deductibles grew. Childcare became a market, and that market became ruinously expensive. College went from affordable to crippling. Transportation costs rose as cities sprawled and public transit withered under government neglect. The labor model shifted. A second income became mandatory to maintain the standard of living that one income formerly provided. But a second income meant childcare became mandatory, which meant two cars became mandatory. Or maybe you’d simply be “asking for a lot generationally speaking” because living near your parents helps to defray those childcare costs. The composition of household spending transformed completely. In 2024, food-at-home is no longer 33% of household spending. For most families, it’s 5 to 7 percent. Housing now consumes 35 to 45 percent. Healthcare takes 15 to 25 percent. Childcare, for families with young children, can eat 20 to 40 percent. If you keep Orshansky’s logic—if you maintain her principle that poverty could be defined by the inverse of food’s budget share—but update the food share to reflect today’s reality, the multiplier is no longer three. It becomes sixteen.

Which, as Green discussed, takes the poverty threshold from just over thirty thousand to somewhere between$130,000 and $150,000.

Green was making the rounds on some of the cable news shows this week, and surprisingly his interview with Fox Business Network's Charles Payne (see above) was better than the one he did on CNN.

Payne asked Green what made him go down this rabbit hole to begin with, and Green proceeded to explain what made him look into how poverty is measured and dug into some of the numbers in the piece:

[TITLE]Massachusetts senator: State puts students in crosshairs of MBTA zoning fight:
[TEXT]
School districts in communities resistant to the controversial MBTA zoning law are losing out on state funding for a financial literacy program for students, according to a state senator urging the Healey administration to restore that money.

Republican Peter Durant says a regional school district in his central Massachusetts district has been blocked from accessing a $3,200 grant from the state Department of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation for the Credit for Life Fairs program.

The state senator added that Dracut and Hanover join Wachusett Regional — a school district that covers Holden, Paxton, Princeton, Rutland and Sterling — in losing out on the funding because they have yet to comply with the MBTA Communities Act.

Wachusett Regional High School serves more than 1,750 students in Worcester County, and Durant is arguing that towns in the five-community district are being unfairly punished because of Holden’s “policy dispute with the administration.”

“Using a regional high school as leverage in a disagreement with one of the towns in the district is the wrong approach and an overreach of state authority,” Durant said in a statement. “Punishing them … sets a troubling precedent of tying educational funding to unrelated grant funds, rather than basing it on the needs of students.”

Under the act, which then-Gov. Charlie Baker signed into law in 2021, 177 municipalities across Greater Boston must have at least one zoning district where multifamily housing is permitted as of right.

Holden has resisted complying with the law, with residents in the town of nearly 20,000 shooting down a multi-family zoning bylaw at a town meeting last spring. Durant indicated that the community is set to vote on a new proposal in February.

Four schools in total — Wachusett Regional High School and two in Hanover and another in Dracut — have been denied grant funding from the nearly $285,000 available for the Credit for Life financial literacy programs, with the initiative receiving 93 applications, Durant said.

“Wachusett is a separate body, and it shouldn’t be impacted by what we do,” Holden Town Manager Peter Lukes said in a statement.

Wachusett Regional High School received a notice from the state Department of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation about the funding loss last week, continuing the Healey administration’s practice of withholding grants to communities resistant to the MBTA zoning law.

Gov. Healey told state lawmakers last March that she could not “commit” that her administration would “refrain from withholding funding” from cities and towns not in compliance with the law.

As of Nov. 20, 118 cities and towns are in compliance, while 11 communities were deemed “non-compliant” as they missed previous deadlines to submit district compliance applications.

The state Supreme Judicial Court ruled last January that the law is constitutional and enforceable, a determination stemming from the attorney general’s fight with Milton, the first town that voted against compliance.

AG Andrea Campbell scored a victory in June when a Superior Court judge found that the MBTA Communities Act does not impose an “unfunded mandate” on cities and towns, striking down lawsuits filed by nine resistant communities and a determination from state Auditor Diana DiZoglio.

“The Superior Court confirmed what has long been clear: a state law requiring multi-family housing districts in communities served by public transportation,” Campbell said in a statement at the time, “but leaving the details and location of those districts to the municipalities themselves, permissibly addresses our housing shortage while still preserving substantial local discretion.”

The South Shore town of Marshfield lost access to a $261,600 grant covering the dredging of a local river, leading to “better marina access for public boat ramps, boatyards, and local bait shops.”

In Middleboro, Healey and the state housing office rescinded a $73,000 grant for student mental health needs and are refusing to sign a $2.8 million MassWorks contract for commercial development infrastructure, according to town officials.

“The MBTA Communities Act is a complex mandate that requires thoughtful local decision-making, community input, and collaboration,” Durant said. “Communities across the state are working through these requirements in good faith.”

“But withholding any type of funding from a regional school does not advance dialogue or encourage productive solutions,” the state senator added. “It simply harms students who have no say in the matter.”

[TITLE]BMC adds 30 new mini compactors for garbage collection first time in 15 years:
[TEXT]
The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday inducted 30 new mini garbage collection vans, also known as mini compactors, into its fleet of vehicles that are mainly used for picking and transporting garbage in Mumbai. This is the first time in 15 years that BMC has inducted new vehicles in his fleet of garbage compactors. Civic officials said overall, 800 new small, medium and large trucks and compactors will be added to the fleet in the next two years.

Mumbai generates 7,500-8,500 metric tonnes (MT) of solid waste daily and each of the new vehicles will have a capacity to carry 5MT of waste every day—twice the capacity of the mini compactors which will be replaced by the new vehicles. Civic officials said the new vehicles have been painted a unique blue and white colour and eventually all the new vehicles will be painted with the same colour. Currently, these vehicles have been deployed in all the 25 municipal wards and will be responsible for collection and transportation of waste from densely populated areas. Officials also said due to its compact size, the vehicles will be able to penetrate into the dingy lanes of slum areas, easing the process of garbage collection from such places.

America’s Sneaker Market Is Crashing And New Jersey Sellers Are Feeling It— Here’s Why

Shore News Network ^ | 11 28 2025 | Staff

Posted on by yesthatjallen

After years of explosive growth fueled by hype, exclusivity, and social media buzz, the U.S. sneaker market is facing a sharp downturn. Analysts and resellers alike are calling it a “crash,” as resale prices plummet and demand cools amid changing economic conditions and shifting consumer priorities.

This crash is hitting New Jersey retailers and resellers hard as high priced shoes are now competing with high energy bills, high medical insurance rates and increases in costs of living in New Jersey.

It’s only expected that the least necessary luxury items are taking a hit.

What’s Behind the Collapse

Oversaturation:

Major brands like Nike, Adidas, and New Balance ramped up production of once-limited models, flooding the market with sneakers that used to sell out instantly. Popular releases such as Nike Dunk Lows — once prized for their scarcity — are now available at retail or even discounted prices.

A crash in high end sneakers? That could work a real hardship on Chinese and Southeast Asian sweatshops. It could even lead to starvation among gulag workers. And the effects would inevitably filter upstream and impact the uber-woke, invariably left wing U.S. companies that profit off third world slave labor.

To: yesthatjallen

This is just another sign that Americans are tapped out. People are spending more on the essentials, like housing, heating, food, transportation, and there’s nothing left for extras like $200 sneakers. The truth is we’re living in an economy distorted by government overspending, money printing, and constant intervention from the Federal Reserve, which keeps markets inflated while eroding the value of savings. The recent scramble when government programs temporarily paused also showed just how massive and overextended the welfare system has become, and how many people depend on it. Meanwhile, anyone who’s not in the stock-market casino is falling behind in this K-shaped economy( rich get richer and poor get poorer and there is no middle class). In times like this, hype-driven luxury items naturally fall to the bottom of people’s priority lists. survival comes first.

I didn’t see anything in the article for a timeframe of the downturn in sneaker sales. If it’s recent (i.e. month of November) it might be related to the “poor” having delays in their SNAP, giving them less money to blow on high end items.

See plenty of one shoe auctions on Ebay. Brand new. Pinched? Nah.

My broker says, in the long run, that kind of investment could be a very good idea! What’s your broker say? Well, my broker is MR Duck. And MR Ducks says, “son how long can you wear sneakers, because you have about a thousand year supply!”

“I buy Walmart sneakers” I bought a $17 dollar pair of white Walmart sneakers a few years ago and found them comfortable enough for just about anything. Still keep a nicer pair of Skechers. But I never feel too bad if I accidentally scuff the Walmart pair.

>> After years of explosive growth fueled by hype, exclusivity, and social media buzz, the U.S. sneaker market is facing a sharp downturn. Analysts and resellers alike are calling it a “crash,” as resale prices plummet and demand cools amid changing economic conditions and shifting consumer priorities. “Beanie Babies”

“Beanie Babies” That was my first thought - Sneakers “beanie babies” for the financial illiterate.

Not to worry, if the Pistons keep on playing like they have been, at least the Detroit NBA stuff should be a slam-dunk for sellers. They have new Home uniforms but I don’t care much for them. If they do win it all, maybe I’ll have had a change of heart by then and actually want to be seen wearing a pair of those shoes.

Aerospace companies set to get more capital market support as reusable rockets make headway

Global Times

By Chu Daye Published: Nov 28, 2025 10:46 PM

Six Chinese commercial aerospace companies had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus from June 18 to November 27, the Securities Daily reported on Friday, amid faster growth in China's commercial aerospace sector and launches being scheduled for several reusable carrier rockets in the coming months.

Chinese industry insiders and financial experts said more commercial aerospace companies are set to receive further support from the capital market as China's commercial aerospace industry moves from the technological exploration phase to commercialization.

The Securities Daily reported on Friday that six commercial space companies, including Chinese private space firms LandSpace, Galactic Energy, CAS Space, Space Pioneer, Yee Space and Mino Space, have had their IPO counseling and filing accepted by local securities regulatory bureaus.

The IPO progress has come amid China's increasing policy support for the sector. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced in June a new sci-tech growth tier on the country's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR Market.

The regulator also called for more support for companies in cutting-edge sectors such as artificial intelligence and commercial aerospace, such as more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market, in light of industrial development and market demand.

Beijing-based LandSpace said in a statement sent to the Global Times that it is set to launch its ZQ-3 reusable rocket at the end of November. Industry analysts said this will be a key step in the mastering of heavy duty, low cost and reusable rockets by Chinese private space firms.

Space Pioneer, another Beijing-based aerospace company, is also preparing for a launch for its Tianlong-3 reusable rocket, according to the South China Morning Post. The rocket is expected to be used to build China's massive internet satellite constellations, the report said.

A Beijing-based venture capital investor surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Friday that there has been a marked rise in market attention toward the commercial aerospace sector, given the policy support and recent progress made in the industry. "The new policies are also a boon for earlier-stage investors looking for an exit strategy," Liu said.

Tian Lihui, professor of finance at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Friday that listing can not only address the financing challenges faced by enterprises and secure funding for continuous research and development input, but also guide capital toward companies with genuine technical strengths and commercial potential. It will also promote the healthy development of the industry, Tian noted.

The CSRC's call for more accommodative listing standards on the STAR market precisely addresses the chokepoint for commercial aerospace - high R&D investment and long profitability cycles - by opening up more capital market channels for the industry, Tian said.

Further policy support came on Tuesday, when China's space agency released an action plan to back commercial space firms and encourage them to pursue international cooperation over the next two years.

The document released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said the country's commercial space enterprises should "go global" and help developing countries to build satellite-application industries.

Among the supportive measures, the CNSA will establish a national commercial space development fund and local governments will be urged to establish technology-innovation centers focused on reusable rockets and smart satellites, and to build open platforms for advanced manufacturing, final assembly and testing.

The plan aims to achieve high-quality commercial space development by 2027. The recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30) list the aerospace sector among China's strategic emerging industries.
