[TITLE]JP Morgan Chase Buys Miami Beach Retail Branch:
[TEXT]
J.P. Morgan Chase bought back its retail banking branch in Miami Beach, paying a threefold premium since its sale 11 years ago.

The finance giant paid $23.5 million for the 25,030-square-foot building at 1801 Alton Road in the Sunset Harbour neighborhood, property records show. The two-story property sits on a 1-acre site, facing Dade Boulevard.

J.P. Morgan Chase purchased the property for $4 million in 2010. Four years later, the current sellers, a Coral Gables-based entity managed by Dominic Cavagnuolo, acquired the building for $8 million.

A representative for the sellers could not be reached, while a spokesperson for J.P. Morgan Chase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, J.P. Morgan Chase’s competitor, Wells Fargo, sold its 6,654-square-foot retail branch next door at 1901 Alton Road for $15 million to the family office of developer Russell Galbut. The developer obtained a $54 million construction loan for a Whole Foods-anchored development, where Wells Fargo will operate a 4,000-square-foot retail location.

J.P. Morgan Chase’s acquisition is also another example of retailers buying the properties they lease. Last year, nearby on Lincoln Road, Alo Yoga paid $17 million for a retail condo, where it plans to open a store and private gym. The activewear brand also bought its boutique in the Miami Design District for $22 million the year prior.

Since 2024, grocer Publix has spent about $345 million buying seven retail centers it anchors in South Florida.

[TITLE]Irish households not getting full benefit of retail investment, research reveals:

The Irish financial services industry is not reaching enough potential investors in the Republic and more should be done to encourage household investment, according to two new reports.

On Tuesday, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) released new research, showing that just 44 per cent of Irish adults hold any investments at all.

Over three-quarters of the 1,000-plus respondents to the lobby group’s survey said they do have separate savings or deposit accounts, particularly people over the age of 65.

The report echoes a piece of research published by the Central Bank of Ireland on Monday, which indicated relatively low levels of engagement with capital markets among Irish households compared with the EU average.

The rupee’s slide past the crucial Rs 90 mark for the first time against the dollar may become the trigger for companies across consumer electronics, beauty, and cars to raise prices. Such a step could reverse robust sales gains achieved in these segments following the recent tax cuts.Companies who rely heavily on imported parts or fully imported products are a worried lot. Many had held off price hike plans despite rising raw material costs, fearing government scrutiny after the goods and services tax (GST) cuts with effect from September 22.Makers of smartphones, laptops, TVs, and large appliances said they will now raise prices by 3-7% from December–January.This will help offset higher prices of memory chips, copper and other components due to the weaker rupee. Imported inputs make up 30–70% of production costs in these categories.“The whole (benefit) of GST rate cut will be wiped away by the rupee depreciation and increase in component prices,” said Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive at Super Plastronics , which manufactures Kodak, Thomson and Blaupunkt TVs.“Prices of memory chips have gone up more than six times in the last four months. We fear demand may again take a hit after the swift recovery aided by the GST cut,” said Marwah.Industry executives emphasised they had benchmarked costs assuming the rupee would stay at 85-86 a dollar, but the sharp breach to Rs 90 is forcing them to revise estimates. Many companies had delayed routine price revisions since October despite rising commodity prices, concerned

[TITLE]‘When I’m young and going out a lot, I don’t want to worry about putting on weight’:
[TEXT]
Everyone knows that alcohol can cause weight gain, particularly beer, sugary cocktails and creamy liqueurs. But while the most likely action for anyone trying to lose a few pounds would be to cut down on the amount of alcoholic drinks they consume, some people are doing the opposite and are cutting down their food intake in order to increase their “alcohol allowance”. This practice appears to be particularly prevalent among students and young adults.

Two students, Sarah and Aisling, are no strangers to food restricted alcohol consumption (FRAC), and say most of their friends do it as a means of staying slim and “not having to worry

[TITLE]Bar Garden Employee Had To Deal With A Rude Customer, So They Made Her Wait Hours To Get Her Food Because The Place Was Packed:
[TEXT]
A word to the wise…

Don’t mess with the people who make your drinks and food!

Because it won’t end well.

Read on and see what happened when this bar employee got tired of dealing with a rude and unrealistic customer.

So 35 people walk into a pub, sadly this isn’t a set up for a joke. “This happened a couple of years back in a pub I was working at. I worked the bar at this pub which was pretty popular especially on sunny days as we had a lot of outdoor seating and a pretty huge beer garden. Now the story takes place one exceptionally hot summer Sunday. For those of you who have the joy of not being all that familiar with our tea and crumpets society I’ll enlighten you as to why this is a pain for working in a pub.

This is pretty exciting for the folks over there!

Firstly the moment the sun blesses our sodden gray land with its presence we British come out of our thatched caves to bask in its glow like the lizard people our royal family is. This subsequently also means every one had the exact same though of “Let’s go have a pint at the pub and sit in the sun”. Yay for bartending. The other noteworthy point here is that on Sunday, a roast is had. Beef, lamb, chicken or pork with roasted potatoes veggies, gravy and Yorkshire puddings. All of which is wonderful unless you have to spend 2 hours cooking it. With that out of the way this particular Sunday we were full and I mean full. Bar 4 or 5 people deep, the 100+ tables all double booked for turn over and I found myself without a moments respite between pouring drinks and telling people we were fully booked. During this manic rush I spot a bit of a commotion outside and see a group of roughly 30-35 people including screaming kids walking through the courtyard ignoring everyone and into the beer garden. Once my colleague and I had thinned down the numbers at the bar substantially I told him I was going to walk past to see what the huge group was doing. Anyone that’s worked with real life people of course know that people suck, hence why I just wanted to walk past and avoid interaction.

This was going to be annoying…they could feel it…

Also it’s a pet peeve of mine when people just sit themselves down ignoring all the staff and expecting us to accommodate them without even the courtesy of mentioning to someone that they’re here. So I take a step past the threshold of the bar (always dangerous and that day a choice I regretted) and walk through the beer garden collecting empty glasses as I go. As I near the area the group has settled in, as far away from the building as possible I might add, I avoid eye contact at all costs. You’re not going to come say hi, then I can’t see you. Walking past the group I am spotted by a very angry woman, the Alpha Karen if you will.

Uh oh…

Snapping her fingers at me to try and get my attention, as I tried to get away. She stormed up to me and stared me in the face. “Excuse me we’ve been waiting here for the last 15 minutes and no one has come to give us menus. What the hell are you all doing?”. I’ll admit I was momentarily in shock, as the group had to walk through the courtyard and must have seen the crowds of people and stressed waiters everywhere. “I’m sorry madam but I had no idea you were here, did you speak with anyone to let us know?”. Then what I saw was a rage build just below her plasticized skin. “Yes, I… I spoke with the red head!” (No one that worked there was a red head) “Well anyway I want some menus we’re STARVING!”. I looked past her and asked how many they were.

Doh!

“Were 36 people, that’s not a problem is it?” She said without so much as a hint of understanding why this was ridiculous. “Well yes actually, that’s quite a lot for a walk in and as you probably saw on your way in we’re extremely busy. I’m afraid we have no tables available and we don’t serve food in the beer garden. You’ll have to try your luck at getting a table in the courtyard but I can’t imagine you’ll be able to find enough seating for the 36 of you and I simply can’t hold tables for you turning other guests away”. The realty is that I could but simply didn’t want to. She stated at me for a moment then said “you don’t serve food in the beer garden or YOU won’t serve me food in the beer garden?.” “No madam the establishment does not serve food in the beer garden”. “Ugh! Fine, look can we just have chips then? For the kids? They’re starving.” I thought about it for a moment deciding if I was really willing to put up with this or if I should just say no and send them on they’re way.

Sure…

Against my better judgement I said ok but they would have to sit in the courtyard once the tables were available and asked roughly how many portions of chips they would be wanting. She replied 6 and I said that’s probably fine but she’ll have to go inside to order. This did not sit well with her and she started to get very cross. On my way back in I swung by the kitchen to let them know what’s up and to expect 6 chip orders but not to rush them because the woman was an enormous pain. I get back to the bar and it’s busy again, 3-4 people deep so I immediately jump in and start pouring pints.

Here we go again…

A few minutes later I hear “Oh for god’s sake this is ridiculous!” and immediately know who it is, this tiny angry woman pushes her way through the crowd and snaps her fingers at me to get my attention. “You, I want to order my chips. And hurry it up the kids are hungry”. “Ok, I’ll put them on now, 6 portions correct?”. “No, 17”. Sufficient to say I was bewildered. “Madam that’s not what we discussed, I’ll have to see if the kitchen can even do that, were very busy”. “We’ll go on then, run along to the kitchen” she barked. As I was about to I hear “Actually can you make it 35.” “Madam I’ll be honest with you there’s no way you’ll get them all at once it’s simply too many for the fryer. It’ll have to be in batches and it’s going to take a while as there are more pressing orders ahead of you. You will also need to pay up front”. “I don’t care, bring them one by one if you have to, as soon as one is ready bring it out”.

You got it!

Bingo. I went and spoke to the chef explaining what was going on, rude woman, many chips, one by one. He laughed and we decided to do exactly as she asked. Bring on the malicious compliance. So despite being very very busy as soon as one portion of chips was ready I took it out, one portion, only one. She was not pleased, “What the hell is this?? I said 35 portions ,not one.” “As I explained to you inside madam 35 portions is simply far too many for our fryers to handle and there is a substantial number of other orders ahead of you” I had to try very hard to hide my **** eating grin at this point. “But… But…what the hell do you expect me to do with this???”. “Perhaps you could have one chip each per portion?” And I swiftly turned and walked away. Following this every 10-15 minutes I would take out one more and only one more portion of chips the the group. By about portion 12 they had been there several hours and were fed up. They tried to complain to the manager but she was so rude and disrespectful to myself, my manager and other staff members that he dismissed her stating that I had explained clearly to her that we were very busy and she herself and told me to bring them out one portion at a time if need be. They left very angry and we had 23 portions of chips paid for that staff got to enjoy later on.”

[TITLE]Nike reshapes C-suite to speed digital shift:
[TEXT]
Nike Inc. is restructuring its senior leadership team as the company works to simplify decision-making, strengthen digital capabilities and regain momentum in key markets.

In a note to employees, CEO Elliott Hill said the company designed the changes to “remove layers” and improve execution under Nike’s “Win Now” strategy.

At the center of the overhaul is an executive vice president and chief operating officer (COO) role that Nike has newly created. Venkatesh “Venky” Alagirisamy, currently chief supply chain officer, will step into the position Dec. 8. He will oversee technology along with supply chain, planning, operations, manufacturing and sustainability — consolidating end-to-end operations under one leader.

Nike is No. 13 in the Top 2000. The database is Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of the largest North American online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales. In the database, Nike is the highest-ranking Apparel & Accessories retailer.

Nike’s new chief operating officer role changes C-suite, leadership team structure

Hill said Nike intends for the move to better integrate digital tools across how the retailer designs, makes, distributes and sells products.

The reshuffling eliminates two positions from the Nike senior leadership team. Muge Dogan, chief technology officer, will leave the company as it removes the chief technology officer (CTO) role. Craig Williams, executive vice president and chief commercial officer, is also departing as Nike dissolves the chief commercial officer (CCO) title.

To sharpen regional responsiveness, Nike is elevating its geography leaders to report directly to Hill.

Those reporting to him are:

Angela Dong (Greater China)

Carl Grebert (EMEA)

Tom Peddie (North America)

Cathy Sparks (Asia Pacific/Latin America)

The reorganization also shifts global sales and Nike Direct — spanning digital commerce and retail stores — under EVP and chief financial officer (CFO) Matt Friend. Hill said aligning commercial operations with strategy and capital allocation ensures consumer insights more directly guide investment decisions.

“This move is about growth and offense — giving Sales and Nike Direct an even stronger voice in how we set strategy and invest,” Hill wrote.

The changes extend Nike’s broader cost-reduction and operational streamlining efforts following uneven performance and intensifying competition across both sport and lifestyle categories. Hill emphasized urgency as the company seeks to restore momentum.

“We need everyone pushing forward with focus, speed, collaboration and urgency,” he said.

[TITLE]Beyonce, Sydney Sweeney and a fight for relevance: How American Eagle, Gap and Levi sparked a new 'denim war':

Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass was out for a run in San Francisco last March when she first heard the song "Levii's Jeans" from Beyonce's latest album, "Cowboy Carter." "Literally, I got chills," Gass recounted to CNBC, adding the name-check represented a "once in a lifetime" marketing opportunity she couldn't afford to squander. "She is one of the most celebrated and influential artists of our time. ... We asked the question, 'Could there be something more?'" Six months later, Levi announced Beyonce would star in a new global marketing campaign. Then, a pattern that's repeated itself since Levi invented blue jeans more than 150 years ago happened again: competitors raced to catch up. Gap and American Eagle launched their own star-studded campaigns the following summer in a bid to sell more jeans. Gap partnered with girl group Katseye in its viral made-for-TikTok "Milkshake" ad, while American Eagle chose actress Sydney Sweeney for its controversial "good jeans" campaign. Just before Thanksgiving, American Eagle launched another celebrity campaign with a different type of star: Martha Stewart. Some smaller brands that can't pay for a name like Beyonce have gotten free marketing just from celebrities wearing their denim. In late August, Kylie Jenner posted a picture of herself in True Religion jeans, leading to a spike in sales, CEO Michael Buckley told CNBC. He called it the "ultimate compliment." Industrywide, brands aired nearly 70% more denim TV spots this year compared with last, as the global jeans market swelled to $101 billion, up 28% since 2020, according to data from TV outcomes company EDO and market research company Euromonitor International.

[TITLE]Global luxury apparel market to rebound slowly after 2024 setback – analysis:
[TEXT]
Louis Vuitton remained the largest luxury apparel brand in 2024, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Credit: Peter_Fleming/Shutterstock.

The global luxury apparel market will undergo a gradual recovery after a 2.4% contraction in 2024, analysis indicates.

According to GlobalData Global Luxury Apparel Market to 2029 report, growth will return in 2025, but it is expected to be largely fuelled by price increases rather than higher sales volumes.

Macro pressures including inflation across Europe and the US and a sharp slowdown in China dented consumer spending last year, producing the market’s first material setback in several years. GlobalData’s report forecasts that the sector will grow by 2.0% in 2025 as brands raise prices to protect margins, even as volumes continue to decline.

Free Sample Download sample pages of selected reports Explore a selection of report samples we have handpicked for you. Get a preview of the insights inside. Download your free copy today.

Over the 2024–29 period, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 2.8% and to begin outperforming the broader apparel market from 2028 as the finances of aspirational shoppers improve.

Clothing is projected to be the strongest category through 2029, with a 3.1% CAGR driven by ultra-wealthy consumers who remain willing to spend on trend-led pieces; womenswear is expected to outperform menswear. Accessories – led by luxury handbags as enduring status symbols – should record a 2.9% CAGR. Footwear looks set to be the weakest area, with a modest 1.0% CAGR, as strong demand for trainers from premium and mass-market specialists limits growth for high-end shoe categories.

Asia-Pacific will be the growth engine, posting the strongest regional CAGR of 4.0% between 2024 and 2029, supported by the recovery of China and robust growth in emerging Asian markets. In contrast, Europe and the Americas are forecast to experience softer growth – 1.8% and 1.5% CAGRs respectively – hampered by sluggish economies and the lingering effects of US tariffs. The Middle East and Africa will increase its share of the global market, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates benefiting from tourism and strong domestic spending.

Luxury heavyweights retained power in 2024. Louis Vuitton remained the largest apparel brand, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Hermès was the standout performer, expanding share by 0.7 percentage points to 6.0% as its exclusivity and craftsmanship held strong appeal among the ultra-wealthy. Chanel also gained share, largely through strategic price increases. By contrast, brands such as Gucci and Burberry lost ground amid unclear positioning and weaker product offerings.

Luxury apparel rebound drivers

Several structural factors underpin the recovery outlook. Ultra-wealthy customers continue to provide a stabilising base for top-tier luxury houses, maintaining demand and preserving brand equity. Meanwhile, improvements in broader macroeconomic conditions and rising consumer confidence should gradually bring back aspirational shoppers – the expanding middle and upper-middle segments whose purchasing power was most affected during the downturn.

Social media and influencer marketing are playing an increasingly important role in engaging younger buyers. Luxury brands are courting content creators and leaning into platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to capture Gen Z’s appetite for luxury. Collaborations with celebrities, entertainment franchises and other brands continue to deliver cultural moments that drive excitement and sales.

At the same time, the booming resale market presents both opportunity and challenge. Resale apparel is expected to grow sharply – by nearly 48% between 2024 and 2028 – with luxury items particularly coveted as more affordable options. Some houses have partnered with resale platforms to reclaim share, but secondhand channels remain a threat to full-price sales, especially among budget-conscious aspirational shoppers.

China’s 2024 slowdown – driven in part by its real estate crisis – hit the market hard, and while stimulus should support a recovery in 2025, Chinese shoppers are likely to remain cautious, amplified by government messaging discouraging ostentatious displays of wealth. Online luxury retail also faces challenges: the collapse of major multi-brand platforms in 2024 has reinforced the importance of brick-and-mortar boutiques, where premium service and in-store experience are key to selling high-priced items.

[TITLE]India’s e-commerce growth continues to outpace global market: Elara Capital:
[TEXT]
India’s e-commerce continued to outperform global markets in the September quarter, according to analysis by Elara Capital. It noted that while US online sales grew by about 5-6 per cent year-on-year while Indian online sales continued to grow double-digit.

Karan Taurani, Executive Vice-President, Elara Capital noted in a sector update report, “India’s digital commerce flywheel continues to outperform global markets, with e-commerce and quick commerce growing faster than in the US. While US online sales rose ~5-6 per cent YoY, India continues in double digits with robust trajectory fuelled by quick commerce channel driving user expansion and regional penetration.

He added that advertising is also shifting in India to digital mediums as brands chase high-ROI performance channels, directly benefiting ad-tech players such as Affle, with direct customer relations.

“Despite solid momentum, India’s category penetration is far below US levels, offering one of the largest multi-year growth runways globally across apparel, electronics, GM and beauty,” he added.

Taurani added that India’s e-commerce maturity curve trails the US and China by 10–12 years. “ This offers a compelling long-term growth as these mature markets growth plateaus. In the near term, India’s e-commerce expansion will be driven by the rise of quick commerce and mass-commerce,” he added.

Global e-commerce was steady in the third quarter of CY25, with US online sales being 5 per cent year-on-year with penetration at about 16-17 per cent, the report noted.
