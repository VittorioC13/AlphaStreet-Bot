[TITLE]Style Capital Exits LuisaViaRoma, CEO Commits to Futureproof Business Model:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Style Capital has exited LuisaViaRoma after four years, leaving the troubled luxury e-tailer in the hands of current chief executive officer Tommaso Maria Andorlini, who has plans to stabilize the business by retooling strategy to pave the way for future growth.

WWD first reported on Style Capital’s sale on Wednesday.

Andorlini has taken over the 22 percent stake of Class A shares previously owned by Style Capital in Florence Srl, the investment vehicle that controls LuisaViaRoma. Florence Srl, which is backed also by other investors that are remaining onboard, holds a 40 percent stake in the e-tailer.

As a result Andorlini now controls 40 percent of LuisaViaRoma via his controlling stake in Florence Srl. This is in addition to the 8 percent stake in LuisaViaRoma he already owned through personal investment vehicle Holding 1. A third shareholder is Aima Srl, the investment vehicle of Andrea Panconesi, whose grandmother Luisa Jaquin opened a small boutique on Florence’s Via Roma in 1929, planting the first seeds of the family company’s success.

The acquisition comes at a complex time for the Florence-based multibrand retailer and the global retail landscape. LuisaViaRoma hasn’t been immune to the havoc being wrought by the current macroeconomic headwinds, dented consumer confidence and geopolitical instability.

“My investment was driven by having a clear vision of where LuisaViaRoma needs to go, as well as a strong understanding of where the market, as a whole, but especially the multibrand fashion market, is heading,” Andorlini told WWD.

“I was guided by the desire to implement a long-term industrial plan, free of the short-term cash-out pressures of financial vehicles. Instead, it’s

[TITLE]Shopify Launches A Product Network That Will Natively Integrate Items From Across Merchants:
[TEXT]
Shopify launched its latest advertising business line on Wednesday, called the Shopify Product Network.

The Product Network shows items from across participating merchants where? Shop App? even if it that item isn’t carried by the store any given person is browsing. For example, someone buying home supplies from a Shopify merchant’s site might search for “organic cleaning supplies” or some particular soap fragrance.

If that merchant doesn’t carry anything that fits the search, the customer could see some of the closest-to options from that seller, interspersed with products from other sellers in the network with items that do fit the bill.

And the Product Network placements aren’t necessarily triggered by a search; they can also natively appear in another merchant’s homepage, nearly indistinguishable from other items sold by that merchant. The purchase occurs in one cart, and the shopper might have no idea that “sold by” label means it’s from a different Shopify merchant.

The Shopify Product Network is emblematic of the company’s advance into advertising. Shopify has kept ad revenue and ad tech at arm’s length, even while tactically monetizing its data and trying to increase the subscription value of its ecommerce product suite, which has come to include data-driven marketing.

Shopify is different from other retail media platforms, though, because it does function on behalf of such a large part of overall open web shopping, Amanda Engelman, the product director for Shopify’s advertising business, told AdExchanger. She was formerly Target’s director of product for developer platforms working on the Roundel business.

With Shopify, she added, “it’s just a different approach to the world.”

The Shopify angle

The new Shopify Product Network is cosmetically similar to platform ad products like Google’s Performance Max, Meta Advantage+ Shopping and Amazon Performance+, in the sense that advertisers aren’t really in control of the campaign. A seller sets a target cost per acquisition, and the platform optimizes to hit that number.

Bing, bang, boom.

However, Shopify’s version has important differentiators.

For one thing, are these even ads?

“It’s a great question,” Engleman said. “But I probably wouldn’t say so.”

If the new network placements are ads, it might be a problem, because of the minimal disclosures. The placements are akin to actual native product displays. The new network could even lead to comical situations where shoppers find an item on one site and become loyal repeat buyers, even personal advocates for the product, having no idea that it comes from a different merchant, and isn’t even stocked by the seller they buy it from.

And unlike the other platform PMaxes, Shopify has a much more amorphous cost and payout system. Google PMax and Meta Advantage+ campaigns may be in a black box, but at least inside that black box are discrete ad units sold at some real-time rate, and which can be added up to then be divided by conversions. Shopify is making some judgement

[TITLE]The 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Before 2026:
[TEXT]
This post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them.

Investors love S&P 500 dividend stocks, especially those with dependable, high yields, because they provide a substantial passive income stream and offer significant total return potential. Total return includes interest, capital gains, dividends, and distributions realized over time. In other words, the total return on an investment or a portfolio consists of income and stock appreciation. At 24/7 Wall St., we consistently emphasize the potential of total return to our readers. It is one of the most effective ways to enhance the prospects of overall investing success. Once again, total return refers to the collective increase in a stock’s value, including dividends. With the potential for a sizable sell-off, we think it makes sense to move to some of the best S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat stocks now.

Investors seeking defensive companies that pay substantial dividends are drawn to the Dividend Aristocrats, and with good reason. The 66 companies that made the cut for the 2025 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats list have increased their dividends (not just maintained them) for 25 consecutive years. But the requirements go even further, with the following attributes also mandatory for membership on the aristocrats list:

Companies must be worth at least $3 billion for each quarterly rebalancing.

Average daily volume of at least $5 million transactions for every trailing three-month period at every quarterly rebalancing date.

They must be a member of the S&P 500.

We screened the list for safe, reliable stocks that make sense as we approach the start of the fourth year of the long-running stock market rally. The S&P 500 is up a stunning 41% from its lows in April, so it makes sense to shift to a safer investing posture in case a big sell-off comes. As usual, it’s not a question of if, but when.

Why do we cover the Dividend Aristocrats?

S&P 500 companies that have paid and raised their dividends for 25 years or longer are the types that growth and income investors want to buy and hold in their stock portfolios for the long term. These stocks are mostly conservative, and should we see a dramatic market correction, they will likely keep their ground much better than volatile technology names.

Consolidated Edison

Consolidated Edison Inc. (NYSE: ED) is one of the largest investor-owned energy companies in the United States. This old-school utility stock offers income investors the stability and track record many seek today, and it pays a strong 3.38% dividend. The company, through its subsidiaries, Consolidated Edison Company of New York (CECONY), Orange and Rockland Utilities (O&R), and Con Edison Transmission, provides a range of energy-related products and services to its customers.

CECONY is a regulated utility providing electric service in New York City and New York’s Westchester County, gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens, and parts of Westchester, and steam service in Manhattan.

O&R and its utility subsidiary, Rockland Electric, provide electric service to customers in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey, a 1,300-square-mile service area.

O&R delivers gas to customers in southeastern New York.

Con Edison Transmission primarily falls under the oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and, through joint ventures, manages both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects.

Mizuho has an Outperform rating with a $112 target price.

Exxon Mobil

Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) manages an industry-leading portfolio of resources and is one of the world’s largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies. The decline in oil prices presents investors with an excellent entry point, and they will likely seize the opportunity to secure a strong 3.41% dividend yield. Exxon is the world’s largest international integrated oil and gas company, exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada/South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia/Oceania.

The energy giant also manufactures and markets commodity petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics, as well as specialty products. Additionally, the company transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products.

Top Wall Street analysts expect the company to remain a key beneficiary in a stable oil price environment. Most remain very optimistic

[TITLE]Meet the branding agency behind the buzzy TBPN podcast:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

How can a new media company make a big splash in the tech world?

One answer: call Day Job, a Los Angeles-headquartered creative agency.

That's what the hosts of the "Technology Business Programming Network" — better known as TBPN — did when they wanted help nailing the podcast's branding and style.

Day Job cofounder Rion Harmon described the vision: a "cacophony of logos" slapped all over the screen (a nod to Formula 1 racecars), a "country club" forest green, and a VHS visual effect.

It'd be somewhere between a news station and a sports-casting channel — hence the rebranding from the "Technology Brothers Podcast" to TBPN.

"They're doing something new," Harmon told me. "It doesn't feel like a stuffy, sort of normal sort of journalism thing. It feels more alive. It feels vibrant. We were trying to capture their energy, right? It's funny to just be overly sponsored."

TBPN has had a big year. The podcast, which launched in 2024, has become a new center stage for a rotation of headline-making Big Tech guests like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Palantir's Alex Karp, and Anduril's Palmer Luckey. Both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal profiled the hosts, John Coogan and Jordi Hays, reporting that the media company expects $5 million in revenue this year.

That, in turn, has helped make Day Job a hot commodity in the tech world, as startups and VCs seek to stand out with their branding. The growing attention from Silicon Valley is paying off. Harmon said that this year, Day Job has doubled its revenue and head count.

"With Day Job, what separates them is they will make four or five different brand directions that are all viable and all justifiable in different ways," Hays said.

Founded in 2018 by Harmon and Spen Madsen, Day Job is a bootstrapped and has a team of

[TITLE]Our Heroes: Herald’s top NZers of 2025 in news, sport, business and entertainment:
[TEXT]
Everybody needs a hero – and luckily New Zealand is not short of them. The New Zealand Herald is today nominating Our Heroes for 2025 to highlight the achievements of Kiwis across news, sport, business, entertainment and lifestyle.

We’re honouring men and women (and sometimes boys and girls) from across the country who have made a positive impact on their community and the lives of others. The spectrum is broad – from police officers to teen inventors, campaigners, athletes, educators, businesspeople... they’re part of a group of people who made New Zealand a better place this year.

Our judges set out to recognise a wide range of human achievements, ranging from acts of one-off heroism to a lifetime’s achievement. Like every year, we’ve stuck to a few hard and fast rules when selecting our winners and finalists – including no politicians and no repeat winners.

Every single day across New Zealand there are people who lead with heart and courage. These are Our Heroes. These are their stories.

Kylie Schaare (left) and Nicola Reeves played a key part in bringing former police Deputy Commissioner Jevon McSkimming’s conduct to light.

WINNER: Kylie Schaare, Nicola Reeves and ‘Officer O’

New Zealanders were stunned when an Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) investigation into former Deputy Commissioner Jevon McSkimming revealed “interference at the highest levels of police”, according to Police Commissioner Richard Chambers.

Too many senior officers failed to do their duty and some actively hindered a full investigation into serious allegations against McSkimming by a woman known only as “Ms Z”.

However, three officers in particular stood their ground, bringing McSkimming’s conduct to light.

Among those officers who the report says displayed “commendable integrity and moral courage” are Detective Superintendent Kylie Schaare (Officer M), Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves (Officer D), and an unnamed detective (Officer O) at the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre (FTAC).

Had it not been for the actions of Officer M, now known to be Detective Superintendent Kylie Schaare, the report said it was “conceivable that Ms Z’s complaint may never have been heard”.

Schaare, the director of integrity and conduct, warned then Police Commissioner Andrew Coster of the huge organisational risk posed by the police’s off-the-books McSkimming investigation.

She suggested the complaint should be recorded in the database and later contacted the IPCA with her concerns. Soon after, the IPCA emailed Coster asking that police refer any complaints regarding McSkimming to them, which eventually forced senior police to start an official investigation through the correct channels.

“When she felt her concerns were not being heeded, she sought our support in elevating the matter,” the IPCA report said. “We commend her moral courage.”

Officer D, Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves, one of New Zealand’s most senior adult sexual assault investigators, was brought in when former Deputy Police Commissioner Tania Kura finally decided to explore the former unsworn staffer’s allegations.

The terms of reference for the investigation did not instruct Reeves to speak to Ms Z, but she insisted she should.

“I personally think it should be very simple in every police officer’s world,” Reeves told the IPCA.

“Doesn’t matter who the hell you are. We speak to the person, take a complaint and investigate it.”

Reeves told the IPCA the handling of the allegations before her involvement in the case was “appalling” and told the IPCA that McSkimming tried to “get rid of this” by “making [Ms Z] the villain”. She also told them that, “to an outsider looking in” and even to her, it looked “like a cover-up”.

Officer O, an unnamed detective at the FTAC, was tasked with looking through the emails allegedly sent by the woman. He was supposed to identify the risk she posed to McSkimming. Instead he drew senior officers’ attention to “allegations of both criminal offending and breaches of the police code of conduct”.

After combing through hundreds of emails sent to McSkimming, Officer O raised “multiple other accusations” that would “definitely not fit” the police code of conduct.

Chambers told the Herald the three officers are “an absolute credit” to NZ Police.

“I am very proud of those staff who stood up and did what was right,” he said, after hearing they were being named among the Herald’s Our Heroes for 2025.

“To me, it showed courage, integrity and leadership. I also know that they are such decent people, they will consider they were simply doing their jobs properly.”

FINALISTS:

Cameron Moore

Rotorua mountain biker Cameron Moore knows the sport he loves has many stories of riders left paralysed after going over the handlebars. Rather than let it scare him off his passion, he’s come up with a solution that could save lives .

The 16-year-old Rotorua Lakes High School student created an inflatable neck brace that senses a crash and rapidly inflates to support a rider’s neck to reduce the risk of serious spinal injury.

His prototype invention, called the Air Brace, earned him first place in the Year 11–13 category of the nationwide Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition this year.

While neck braces already existed in mountain biking, Cameron said many riders did not wear them because they were “uncomfortable”. His design aimed to fix that. The Air Brace uses small sensors that detect sudden, high-impact movement. When triggered, a mechanism inflates the neck support in the moment of a crash.

He is currently working on a second-stage prototype to make the design even more compact. He’s also working on a separate, but related, invention: a device that sits on the rider’s helmet to gather and measure crash data that he can use to refine the algorithm of the Air Brace.

The Rotorua teen is juggling his work on his inventions with school and a social life but says none of it has suffered. In fact, some of his best ideas for inventions come to him when he’s out on bike rides “so having fun with friends is part of it”.

Leonie Morris says stalking is a widespread problem. Photo / Kellie Blizard

Leonie Morris

Stalking is now a criminal offence in New Zealand, partly thanks to the tireless efforts of campaigner Leonie Morris, chairwoman of the Coalition for the Safety of Women and Children and Aotearoa Free From Stalking project lead.

The legislation passed its third reading in Parliament last month. It amends the Crimes Act to make stalking and harassment punishable by up to five years in prison, coming into force in May next year.

“We’re delighted that it has passed at last,” said Morris, who felt the Our Heroes recognition belonged to her whole team.

“We’re hoping that it will both increase New Zealanders’ understanding of how harmful stalking is and that it will provide protection for people, especially women, from stalking.”

The murder of Farzana Yaqubi by her stalker in 2022 put the issue in the spotlight, she said.

“It increased awareness considerably that, on the one hand, the police conduct authority found police failed to help Farzana, and of just how dangerous stalking can be.”

Overall, the passing of this legislation will contribute towards making New Zealand a safer place. “This is a widespread problem. The more attention is put on it, the more people understand that stalking is not

[TITLE]European shares flat ahead of Fed decision:
[TEXT]

European shares ended flat on Wednesday, as investors adopted a cautious stance in advance of the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, while also parsing a slate of corporate announcements.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed flat at 577.78, extending its pattern of trading in tight ranges during the past few sessions.

Major regional benchmarks were largely trading in the red, with ones in Germany and Spain down 0.5 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.

Market attention centred on the Federal Reserve’s rate decision later in the day, where the central bank is expected to trim interest rates by 25 basis points.

However, comments from chairman Jerome Powell will be scrutinised for clues on how the bank will approach monetary policy next year amid sparse economic data and the US administration’s push for lower rates.

Dublin

Dublin’s Isex index was lower on Wednesday in sparse trading. Shares in Uniphar, the healthcare services group, were down 1.9 per cent at €3.58 while food company Glanbia fell 0.7 per cent to reach €14.61.

Ryanair continued its climb, reaching €28.20. The airline said this week it planned to cut one million seats and 20 routes from its Brussels 2026/27 winter schedule over Belgium’s decision to raise tax on air passenger tickets.

Europe

An index of automakers led losses, down 1.5 per cent, dragged lower by a 4.8 per cent drop in luxury carmaker Ferrari.

Industrial stocks that buoyed the market in recent sessions fell 0.35 per cent, with defence firms weighing. The European aerospace and defence index lost 0.8 per cent after gaining more than 2 per cent in the previous two sessions.

Vinci lost 3.1 per cent after BNP Paribas downgraded the French infrastructure and concessions group to “neutral” from “outperform”, with the brokerage forecasting a muted 2026 for European transport and infrastructure firms.

Construction and materials index fell 0.8 per cent.

Aegon was the worst-performing stock for the day, losing over 10 per cent after the insurer said it would move its legal domicile and head office to the US from the Netherlands.

London

Britain’s blue-chip FTSE 100 edged up on Wednesday, supported by gains in banking stocks as investors awaited ‍the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.

The FTSE 100 closed up 0.1 per cent, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 index dipped 0.4 per cent to a two-week low.

Lenders HSBC and Standard Chartered ‌rose 3.2 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively, following bullish recommendations from BofA Global Research.

The FTSE 350 banks index rose ⁠1.8 per cent and led gains among the sectors.

Traders are also looking ahead to UK GDP data for ⁠October on Friday. Signs of easing inflation ⁠and a weakening labour market have pushed traders to price in a 25 bps rate cut from the Bank of England ‍next week, with further cuts seen next year.

Among other stocks, Pearson climbed 2 per cent after JP Morgan named the education company one of its top picks in the media sector. FirstGroup added 5 per cent after the transport operator was named the preferred bidder for London’s Overground suburban rail network in a contract worth

[TITLE]68 Cities, Counties, and States Will Increase Their Minimum Wage on January 1:
[TEXT]
Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today.

The Trump administration is one of the most anti-labor administrations in modern U.S. history — it has attempted to decertify the union representation of more than 1 million federal employees. Trump has also fired key members of the National Labor Relations Board, thus rendering it largely non-functional. Moreover his administration has come out against rules requiring disabled workers all be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, and it has blocked a Biden-era rule increasing the minimum wage for federal contractors.

Despite faux-populist credentials and a claim to be addressing the forgotten multitudes, Trump 2.0 is simply following modern Republican Party orthodoxy. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 per hour since 2009, with the GOP stymying repeated efforts in Congress to increase the wage to at least keep up with the cost of living. As a result of this intransigence, the federal minimum wage today has the lowest real value that it has had since at least 1956. In 2022, researchers with the Economic Policy Institute estimated that in the 13 years since the last minimum wage increase, prices had increased by more than 27 percent. Since 2022, the U.S. has experienced a surge of inflation that has further eroded the value of that minimum wage — and yet the GOP majority in Congress, now backed by Donald Trump and his hard-right cabinet, remains adamantly opposed to legislation that would increase the federal minimum wage.

Trump recently addressed a conference of McDonald’s corporate executives, managers, and franchise owners, telling them they would have to fight minimum wage hikes, and, using his customary slew of juvenile insults, lambasted California Gov. Gavin Newsom for raising the state’s minimum wage.

However, as the Trump administration continues to undermine labor and the minimum wage, city and state governments are stepping in themselves to enact wage increases for their residents.

More than two dozen more cities, counties, and states will raise their minimum wage later in 2026. In most of these, the minimum wage will rise to at least $15 per hour.

According to a recent report by the National Employment Law Project (NELP), 68 cities, counties, and states will see their minimum wages go up at the start of the new year. More than two dozen more will raise their minimum wage later in 2026. In some of these locales, the higher minimum wage will apply to all workers; in others, to only some sectors of the economy. In most of these, according to the NELP data, the minimum wage will rise to at least $15 per hour — the goal established by the Fight $15 campaign more than a decade ago, and in many to $17. In a number of these locales, large employers will have to pay a higher minimum wage than will small business owners.

New Jersey is creating a higher minimum wage of $18.92 per hour for long-term care workers. In Los Angeles, as the city prepares for both the World Cup and the 2028 summer Olympics, a coalition of unions, led by UNITE Here Local 11, have successfully pushed for a move toward a $30 per hour minimum wage by 2028 for many tourism industry jobs. When the hotel industry tried to put a referendum on the ballot to overturn this, the coalition successfully beat it back. In San Diego, an increasingly progressive city council has voted for wage increases, meaning that hospitality workers are on course for a $25 per hour minimum wage by 2030.

California as a whole now has a sector-wide collective bargaining system in place for the fast-food industry, and a minimum wage in that sector of at least $20 per hour. It also has begun the process of applying the federal minimum wage to incarcerated firefighters, who often find themselves on the front lines of massive wildfires, but historically have been paid pennies on the dollar.

The widespread popularity of minimum wage increases can be seen in the political diversity of the locales raising the wage for low-end workers this coming year. Missouri voters supported Trump by an 18-point margin in 2024, but in that same election they passed a $15 per hour minimum wage, and the state supreme court upheld the constitutionality of that initiative — though the GOP-led legislature then blunted its impact somewhat by passing a law to no longer index state minimum wage increases to inflation and rolling back paid sick leave. Alaska, which already had an $11.91 minimum wage, increased the minimum to $13 starting in mid-2025. Nebraska’s electorate also voted in 2022 to increase the state minimum to $15 starting in January 2026. And in 2020, Florida voters approved a graduated series of minimum wage increases, meaning the state will reach $15 per hour in September of next year.

In fact, look at a map of the United States, and one sees two Americas: in the first, the public has backed a higher minimum wage and legislators have enacted changes that in many cases more than double the federal minimum; in the second — concentrated largely in the deep south, the rural Midwest, and the mountain west — workers at the bottom of the economy still earn $7.25 per hour, and efforts to better their lot have consistently fallen flat in the face of unrelenting political hostility from the governing party.

In 26 (mainly Republican-controlled) states, legislators have gone so far as to pass legislation blocking their more liberal cities from enacting their own higher minimum wage ordinances.

In 26 (mainly Republican-controlled) states, legislators have gone so far as to pass legislation blocking their more liberal cities from enacting their own higher minimum wage ordinances. In consequence, despite cities such as Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas attempting to make life better for workers at the bottom of the economy over the past decades, they remain largely bound by the opposition to minimum wage increases in hard-right legislatures such as that of Texas, with exceptions only for local public employees, who do earn higher minimum wages.

As the 2026 midterms approach, “affordability” has become something of a political buzzword — one with the potential to upend traditional political calculations, as the recent election of Zohran Mamdani to the mayorship of New York City demonstrated. Polling from 2023 found that two-thirds of voters favored a federal $15 per hour minimum wage. More recent polling, reflecting the years of high inflation unleashed first by the COVID crisis and then by Trump’s tariffs, shows majority support to move toward a $25 per hour “living wage,” with voters in high-cost-of-living cities now favoring $30 per hour as a baseline.

This is a profound change in the voting public’s economic priorities and suggests that those candidates who successfully craft policies to address the affordability crisis will reap dividends at the ballot box. Paradoxically, the worse Trump’s posture on affordability and on the minimum wage gets, the more advocates of a higher minimum wage at the local level see the wind in their sails.

Trump may deride the affordability crisis as just a “con job,” but voters know that without a commitment to increasing the purchasing power of those at the bottom of the economy, millions will be left holding the bag for economic policies that continue to massively increase inequality and insecurity in the United States.

Our most important fundraising appeal of the year December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation. This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board. We can only resist Trump’s agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you. We’ve set an ambitious target for our year-end campaign — a goal of $250,000 to keep up our fight against authoritarianism in 2026. Please take a meaningful action in this fight: make a one-time or monthly donation to Truthout before December 31. If you have the means, please dig deep.

American Rebel Light Beer Product & Brand Background:

American Rebel Light Beer is a premium all-natural light lager brewed with just four ingredients – water, barley, hops, and yeast – with no added corn, rice, or sweeteners. At ~100 calories, 3.2g carbs, and 4.3% ABV per 12 oz., it offers a cleaner, “better-for-you” profile compared to many mass-produced light beers

American Rebel Light Beer “America’s Patriotic Beer,” embraces a bold brand identity rooted in faith, freedom, and American patriotism. The Company’s marketing, led by CEO (and country-rock entertainer) Andy Ross, emphasizes a Patriotic values-driven image – “God-Fearing, Constitution-Loving, National Anthem-Singing, Stand Your Ground” – that resonates with conservative and heartland audiences. Since launching in 2024, American Rebel Light Beer has leveraged an event-driven playbook (sponsoring motorsports, music festivals, and veterans’ celebrations) to convert enthusiasts into customers. This approach, combined with the Company’s relentless focus on signing quality distributors, has made American Rebel Light Beer one of the fastest-growing premium light lager beers in the U.S.

Since its 2024 launch, American Rebel Light Beer (www.americanrebelbeer.com) has rapidly expanded its multi-state distribution footprint through a growing network of independent wholesalers and national and regional retail placements, including Kroger, Total Wine & More, Minuteman Food Mart, and (beginning spring 2026) Southeastern Grocers. “Rebel Light” has secured distribution in 17 states and counting by insisting on partnerships with the nation’s top-tier wholesalers.

NEW YORK, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NasdaqGS: GIII) (“G-III” or the “Company”) today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, ended October 31, 2025 and announces approval of a quarterly dividend.

Morris Goldfarb, G-III’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a strong third quarter with gross margins and earnings far exceeding our expectations. This was driven by the strength of our go-forward portfolio, particularly our owned brands, as well as a healthy mix of full-price sales and our mitigation efforts against tariffs. I am pleased with how our brands are resonating with consumers and encouraged by the solid demand we have seen throughout the holiday season to date.”

Mr. Goldfarb concluded, “Looking ahead, we are raising our fiscal 2026 earnings guidance to reflect our third quarter outperformance tempered by the uncertainties around the consumer environment and tariff-related margin pressures. I am extremely proud of our teams for executing on our strategic priorities and delivering strong profitability. With our powerful brand portfolio and best-in-class operating model, we are well-positioned to achieve our fiscal 2026 outlook. Our strong financial profile gives us the ability to return capital directly to stockholders including through our newly initiated dividend program, while also continuing to pursue strategic opportunities to drive profitable growth.”

Results of Operations

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026

Net sales for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 decreased 9% to $988.6 million compared to $1.09 billion in the prior year’s third quarter.

Net income for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 was $80.6 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to $114.8 million, or $2.55 per diluted share, in the prior year’s third quarter.

Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.90 for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025 compared to $2.59 in the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share excludes (i) in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, $2.4 million of professional fees related to a potential strategic opportunity that did not come to fruition, (ii) in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, asset impairments of $1.6 million, (iii) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, $0.5 million in one-time severance expenses related to a closed warehouse and (iv) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a $1.6 million write-off of deferred financing costs related to the redemption of our senior secured notes (the “Notes”). The aggregate effect of these exclusions was equal to $0.06 per diluted share in the third quarter of this year and $0.04 per diluted share in last year’s third quarter.

Balance Sheet as of Third Quarter Fiscal 2026

Inventories increased 3% to $547.1 million this year compared to $532.5 million last year.

Total debt decreased 95% to $10.6 million this year compared to $224.2 million last year with the Company ending the quarter in a net cash position of $173.5 million compared to a net debt position of $119.5 million in the same period last year.

Capital Allocation

Share repurchases of 209,851 for $5.4 million were made in the third quarter and 2,158,276 for $49.8 million in the year-to-date period.

G-III announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a new quarterly dividend program to evolve its strategic use of capital. The Board of Directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 29, 2025, to all stockholders of record as of December 15, 2025. The Company intends to pay dividends quarterly in the future, subject to market conditions and approval by the Board of Directors.

Outlook

The Company has updated guidance for fiscal 2026, which reflects the strength of our third-quarter earnings outperformance, along with a disciplined view of the current consumer landscape and the expected effects of tariffs on our top and bottom lines. Based on current tariff rates, the Company anticipates the gross impact of tariffs will now be approximately $135 million. This has been partially offset through vendor participation, strategic sourcing shifts, and targeted price increases. The remaining unmitigated impact, reflected in fiscal 2026 guidance, is now estimated at $65 million.

Fiscal 2026

Net sales are expected to be approximately $2.98 billion (previous guidance $3.02 billion). This compares to net sales of $3.18 billion for fiscal 2025.

Net income is expected to be between $121.0 million and $126.0 million (previous guidance $112.0 million and $122.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $2.72 and $2.82 (previous guidance $2.53 and $2.73). This compares to net income of $193.6 million, or $4.20 per diluted share for fiscal 2025.

Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2026 is expected to be between $125.0 million and $130.0 million (previous guidance $113.0 million and $123.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90 (previous guidance $2.55 and $2.75). This compares to non-GAAP net income of $203.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $4.42 for fiscal 2025.

Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2026 is expected to be between $208.0 million and $213.0 million (previous guidance $198.0 million and $208.0 million) compared to adjusted EBITDA of $325.9 million in fiscal 2025.

Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $1.5 million.

Tax rate for fiscal 2026 is estimated to be 29.5%.

[TITLE]Suzy Amis Cameron’s Inside Out Grows With Research-led Design and Strategic Acquisitions:
[TEXT]
PARIS — If you’ve followed Suzy Amis Cameron’s work as an early pioneer in sustainable fashion, you know her journey began with Red Carpet Green Dress, the campaign that put eco-conscious design on the map, proving that elegance and ethics could coexist.

But RCGD had limits — it gained attention, but it couldn’t scale the systemic change Amis Cameron wanted.

“Certainly, Red Carpet Green Dress started a big conversation, but it wasn’t making huge impact. I was at this place in my life where I was like, something has to be done, and if there’s a way for me to do that, I will,” she told WWD.

That’s why she closed that chapter in March 2024 and founded the international holding company Inside Out.

“The idea was to build a holding company that reimagines how business interacts with both people and the planet,” Amis Cameron said of the privately backed venture. Inside Out approaches fashion from a biological and psychological perspective, to create what she calls “healthy clothes.”

“Not only are we solution-oriented, we actually have solutions,” she said. “And they are lucrative.”

[TITLE]Style Capital Exits LuisaViaRoma, CEO Commits to Futureproof Business Model:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Style Capital has exited LuisaViaRoma after four years, leaving the troubled luxury e-tailer in the hands of current chief executive officer Tommaso Maria Andorlini, who has plans to stabilize the business by retooling strategy to pave the way for future growth.

WWD first reported on Style Capital’s sale on Wednesday.

Andorlini has taken over the 22 percent stake of Class A shares previously owned by Style Capital in Florence Srl, the investment vehicle that controls LuisaViaRoma. Florence Srl, which is backed also by other investors that are remaining onboard, holds a 40 percent stake in the e-tailer.

As a result Andorlini now controls 40 percent of LuisaViaRoma via his controlling stake in Florence Srl. This is in addition to the 8 percent stake in LuisaViaRoma he already owned through personal investment vehicle Holding 1. A third shareholder is Aima Srl, the investment vehicle of Andrea Panconesi, whose grandmother Luisa Jaquin opened a small boutique on Florence’s Via Roma in 1929, planting the first seeds of the family company’s success.

The acquisition comes at a complex time for the Florence-based multibrand retailer and the global retail landscape. LuisaViaRoma hasn’t been immune to the havoc being wrought by the current macroeconomic headwinds, dented consumer confidence and geopolitical instability.

“My investment was driven by having a clear vision of where LuisaViaRoma needs to go, as well as a strong understanding of where the market, as a whole, but especially the multibrand fashion market, is heading,” Andorlini told WWD.

“I was guided by the desire to implement a long-term industrial plan, free of the short-term cash-out pressures of financial vehicles. Instead, it’s

FMCG major Nestle India will sharpen its focus on technology and consumer-centricity as it targets volume-led expansion across categories, Chairman and Managing Director Manish Tiwary told PTI in an interview.Tiwary, who took charge recently, said the company expects “healthy volume growth” in regions where it is setting up new factories and outlined three core priorities: a consumer-first approach, volume-driven growth, and accelerated investment in marquee brands such as Maggi, KitKat and Nescafe “It is not just about value growth, but about how many more meals our consumers enjoy with Maggi, how many more cups of coffee they drink, how many more KitKats they taste,” he said.India, one of Nestle’s fastest-growing markets, offers “enormous headroom,” he added. Coffee consumption is rising fast, while Maggi noodles have only around 20% monthly penetration. To tap this potential, Nestle plans to fuel brand growth through advertising, pricing and innovation.Tiwary said Nestle India is open to acquisitions “if there is something promising in the market,” but added that the bulk of growth will come from core categories.“In this business, fewer, bigger, bolder is very important… I would rather focus on fewer initiatives and execute them well,” he said.Nestle India posted sales of Rs 20,077 crore in FY25 and has invested nearly Rs 3,900 crore in capex over the last two financial years.A computer engineer and former Amazon India executive, Tiwary said he is bringing key learnings from his e-commerce background to Nestle.“The one area I am particularly focused on accelerating is the role of technology,” he said, adding that tech adoption will “enhance both efficiency and effectiveness” and fundamentally reshape processes across the company.Asked whether higher automation would lead to job cuts, he said the intent was not to reduce headcount. “Growth does not need to follow a linear correlation with headcount… we need our existing teams to deliver a far greater impact by leveraging technology,” he said.Tiwary said India could become one of Nestle SA’s top five markets in the coming years and that he would be “disappointed” if this does not materialise.India is already the company’s largest global market for Maggi and the second-largest for KitKat.“Two out of three Indian households use our products. I want that number to grow,” he added, highlighting expansion in both human and pet food segments.Nestle is banking on faster rural growth, expecting the segment to expand at least 1.5 times its overall growth rate, aided by low penetration and rising consumption. Premium offerings will also expand as 20–30 million Indian households consume at levels comparable to Europe, Tiwary said.He noted that FMCG markets have picked up, supported by GST reforms and tax relief measures. Both urban and rural markets are now growing in double digits.Commodity prices for coffee and cocoa have stabilised and may soften over the next year, he said. While ruling out any blanket assurance on pricing, Tiwary expects the first half of 2026 to be driven “more by volume growth than by pricing actions.”E-commerce and quick commerce contributed 12.5% of domestic sales in the last quarter, with Nestle outperforming industry averages.Tiwary said Nestle’s pet food business Purina, its one-year-old Nestle Health Science joint venture with Dr Reddy’s, and offerings like Nespresso are showing strong traction.“These ventures make me very optimistic about Nestle’s future in India,” he said.
