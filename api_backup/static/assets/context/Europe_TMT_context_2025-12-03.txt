[TITLE]VCI Global Announces Strategic Transformation to Become Regional Leader in AI Infrastructure, Stablecoin Payments, and Digital Asset Advisory:
[TEXT]
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VCI Global Limited (NASDAQ: VCIG) (“VCI Global” or the “Company”) today announced a comprehensive strategic transformation to reposition the Company as a leading provider of AI infrastructure, stablecoin payment solutions, and digital asset advisory services across the high-growth ASEAN and MENA regions. This transformation marks a decisive shift toward sectors with substantial long-term demand, global scalability, and strong institutional adoption.

Focused Strategy Around Three High-Growth Pillars

VCI Global is streamlining its operations around three high-growth pillars, leveraging the unique expertise of its subsidiaries to drive long-term shareholder value:

1. AI Infrastructure & Consulting

Through V Gallant Limited (“V Gallant”), VCI Global delivers enterprise-grade AI solutions, including secure AI and data privacy, AI compute and consulting, data analytics as a service, ISO audit and advisory services, and cybersecurity consulting. These capabilities meet the rising demand for digital transformation in emerging markets.

2. Stablecoin Infrastructure & Settlement Rails

Through Smart Bridge Technologies Limited (“Smart Bridge”), VCI Global is advancing stablecoin initiatives. Planned initiatives include USDT-powered payment rail integration, real-time settlement infrastructure, AI-driven compliance and analytics for enterprises and institutions, supporting institutional adoption of stablecoin payments. The Company intends for these rails to enable merchants to receive real-time fiat settlement from digital asset payments.

3. Digital Asset & RWA Consultancy

Smart Bridge provides advisory services for tokenization, digital asset structuring, and real-world assets. Services include corporate fundraising advisory, regulated exchange listings, and multi-jurisdictional structuring for institutional clients.

Spin-Off, Carve-Out Strategies and Dividend Update

As part of its long-term strategy, VCI Global is pursuing a dual approach to unlock shareholder value and sharpen its focus on core growth areas. The Company will spin off non-core businesses through separate IPOs, retaining a 30% stake in each entity to preserve long-term value while enabling independent market valuation. The businesses currently in the spin-off pipeline include the Company’s capital markets consultancy arm, real estate division, energy unit, and fintech operations.

Concurrently, VCI Global is advancing a carve-out IPO of V Gallant, its wholly owned AI infrastructure subsidiary, which remains central to the Company’s growth strategy. In connection with this carve-out, the previously announced special dividend of 10% of V Gallant’s share capital will be distributed to VCIG shareholders, with the record date to be confirmed in due course, pending regulatory approvals. This underscores the Company’s commitment to delivering value to shareholders alongside its strategic initiatives.

Strengthening VCIG’s Role in the Global Stablecoin Ecosystem

VCI Global is reinforcing its position in the global stablecoin ecosystem through strategic alignment with Oobit and Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer. The Company plans to integrate stablecoin payment solutions, build settlement rails, and deploy AI-driven compliance and analytics tools for institutions and enterprises. Priority deployment will focus on ASEAN and MENA, two high-growth regions for digital commerce, alternative payments, and AI-driven transformation. To support this expansion, VCI Global has established the Oobit Treasury to grow the Oobit ecosystem and its OOB token, with initiatives targeting merchant acceptance, settlement rails, and stablecoin conversions.

“VCI Global is aligning itself with the fastest-growing engines of global digital transformation, AI infrastructure, stablecoin payment systems, and digital asset advisory. This strategic shift provides a powerful and scalable foundation for long-term growth while unlocking value for our shareholders through sector-focused expansion and planned initiatives,” said Dato’ Victor Hoo, Group Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VCI Global.

[TITLE]Tutor Raises $34 Million to Teach Warehouse Robots:
[TEXT]
Tutor Intelligence, which makes AI-powered robots for warehouse work, has raised $34 million in new funding.

The company will use the new capital to speed commercialization of its robots, scale its consumer packaged goods (CPG) fleet and advance its central robot intelligence platform and research infrastructure, according to a Monday (Dec. 1) news release.

“Tutor stands out for its extraordinary speed of execution and its ability to balance cutting-edge product and model development with a clear commercial focus that quickly gets this functionality into customers’ hands,” Rebecca Kaden, managing partner at Union Square Ventures, which led the funding round, said in the release. “They’re not building for an abstract future; they’re transforming how CPG companies operate today.”

Founded out of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Tutor Intelligence’s robots work alongside human operators to process goods for a “vast Fortune 50 supply chain network,” the company said in the release. It also works with multiple Fortune 500 packaged food companies, and “global leaders” in the personal care, toys, home goods, beauty and consumer technology spaces.

“When we started Tutor Intelligence nearly five years ago as grad students at MIT, we saw that the robotics intelligence bottleneck was the key barrier to robotic worker viability,” said Josh Gruenstein, the company’s co-founder and CEO.

“We built a system that leverages on-the-job data to teach robots to navigate and understand the physical world with human-like intuition. This new capital enables us to expand our fleet, scale our robot training infrastructure, and empower our robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks, reshaping industrial work as we know it.”

The funding comes at a time when, as covered here last month, physical artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as the next stage of robotics. Earlier robots followed fixed commands and worked only in predictable environments, having trouble with the unpredictability found in everyday operations such as shifting layouts, mixed lighting, and human movement.

“That is beginning to change as research groups show how simulation, digital twins and multimodal learning pipelines enable robots to learn adaptive behaviors and carry those behaviors into real facilities with minimal retraining,” PYMNTS wrote.

Amazon’s launch of its Vulcan robot is one of the clearest examples of physical AI moving from research to frontline operations. This robot uses both vision and touch to pick and stow items in the company’s fulfillment centers, letting it handle flexible fabric storage pods and unpredictable product shapes.

3 Total 2024 revenues include intercompany transactions.

Management Comments

“While global demand for digital remittance continues to grow, competition across major corridors has intensified,” said Alex Kong, Founder and Executive Chairman of Currenc. “In this environment, we prioritized pricing discipline, maintaining Tranglo’s take rate at 0.36% while delivering US$2.8 billion in TPV in the first half of 2025. Strategically, we continue to deemphasize lower-value airtime services, redirecting capital and resources toward our AI initiatives to deepen engagement with financial-institution clients, broaden our addressable market, and extend our remittance reach across additional high-volume corridors. Looking ahead, we remain committed to strengthening our remittance franchise while broadening our AI portfolio to create a more balanced, higher-quality revenue mix and deliver sustainable long-term value to our shareholders.”

Wan Lung Eng, Chief Financial Officer of Currenc Group, commented, “Our first-half performance reflects solid execution in our remittance business, which largely offset the expected decline in airtime revenues. Tranglo and WalletKu together generated positive EBITDA of US$1.7 million in the first half, while disciplined pricing and cost management kept our gross margin stable at 34.3% and maintained Tranglo’s payout rate at a healthy 0.13%. Operating expenses increased to US$15.1 million, mainly due to US$4.3 million in incentive share expenses associated with the de-SPAC merger and US$1.5 million in investments to develop our new AI offerings. Looking ahead, we will continue to streamline our cost structure, capitalize on our remittance strengths, and scale AI-driven growth to boost our profitability and shareholder value.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, it uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as described below, to understand and evaluate its core operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, is presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Currenc believes that EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the impact of items that Currenc does not consider indicative of the performance of its business. While Currenc believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating its business, this information should be considered supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

[TITLE]Government Cloud Computing Forecast Report 2025: An $80+ Billion Market by 2030, Driven by Cost Efficiency, Scalable Infrastructure Demand, and Improved Citizen Service Delivery:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Government Cloud Computing Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Government Cloud Computing Market, valued at USD 32.01 Billion in 2024, is projected to experience a CAGR of 16.71% to reach USD 80.90 Billion by 2030.

Government cloud computing refers to a specialized model of cloud services tailored to meet the distinct security, compliance, and operational requirements of public sector entities, enabling data storage and processing over the internet rather than exclusively on physical local servers. Key drivers supporting market growth include the imperative for cost efficiency, allowing agencies to optimize IT expenditures, and the demand for scalable infrastructure that can dynamically adjust to fluctuating service loads. Furthermore, enhanced capabilities for efficient service delivery to citizens promote adoption.

Key Market Drivers

Enhanced cost efficiency and budget optimization represent a primary driver for government cloud adoption. Public sector entities are under constant pressure to deliver greater value to citizens while operating within strict financial parameters. Cloud computing directly addresses this by converting substantial capital expenditures for IT infrastructure into more manageable operational expenditures, thereby eliminating the need for significant upfront investments in hardware procurement and ongoing maintenance. This pay-as-you-go model allows agencies to precisely match resource consumption with demand, preventing the costly inefficiencies associated with over-provisioning traditional on-premise systems. Furthermore, the ability to scale resources dynamically ensures optimal utilization and cost control.

Key Market Challenges

The persistent concern regarding data security and the complexities of navigating regulatory compliance frameworks represent a significant impediment to the growth of the Global Government Cloud Computing Market. Government agencies are entrusted with highly sensitive citizen information, necessitating exceptionally robust safeguards against evolving cyber threats and strict adherence to numerous data protection laws.

This creates considerable integration and management complexities for cloud service adoption. The inherent risks associated with data breaches, coupled with the stringent requirements of compliance mandates such as FedRAMP, GDPR, or similar regional regulations, compel public sector entities to exercise extreme caution. This heightened risk aversion and the substantial overhead required to ensure continuous compliance directly slow the pace of cloud migration and limit the scope of cloud-based initiatives.

Key Market Trends

The increasing demand for sovereign cloud offerings and data residency solutions represents a significant market trend, driven by governmental imperatives for enhanced control over sensitive national data and strict adherence to local regulatory frameworks. Governments prioritize infrastructure that guarantees data storage and processing within their geographical boundaries, mitigating geopolitical risks and ensuring compliance with national security mandates.

This trend is fostering specialized cloud deployments and partnerships aimed at meeting these stringent requirements. According to the U. S. Government Accountability Office, federal cloud spending reached USD 7.1 billion in fiscal year 2023, with 70% allocated to solutions meeting strict sovereignty requirements. This emphasis on localized data governance promotes the development of dedicated sovereign cloud environments.

[TITLE]Telco Market Tracker Report, 2Q25: Performance for 140 Telcos from 1Q11 Through 2Q25 - Revenue, Labor, Capex, Opex, and Profitability Data:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Telco Market Tracker, 2Q25: Capex pullback persists even as revenues surge 4.6%" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

This report delivers a detailed analysis of the global telecommunications network operator (telco) industry, drilling down into performance for 140 telcos from 1Q11 through 2Q25. It captures revenue, labor, capex, opex, and profitability data with a focus on the most recent quarter (2Q25).

Key findings:

Global telco revenues climbed 4.6% year-over-year (YoY) in 2Q25 to reach $456.8 billion (B), supported by broad-based recovery across major markets. On an annualized 2Q25 basis, revenues grew 1.7% YoY to $1.8 trillion (T). Airtel (20.0%), Etisalat (18.7%), SoftBank (7.3%), Deutsche Telekom (4.6%), and China Unicom (3.7%) led growth in the annualized 2Q25 period, while Vodafone (-11.6%) and Orange (-7.1%) declined sharply.

Capex declined 2.1% YoY in 2Q25 to $67.5B, while the annualized total fell 2.6% to $292.9B. That's the lowest 12-month total since 2011, and the lowest capital intensity since 2013. China Mobile remained the largest investor with $24.4B in annualized capex (+7.8% YoY) in 2Q25, while America Movil (-24.5%), China Telecom (-22.9%), and China Unicom (-17.7%) made significant cutbacks. Telco tech spending continues to shift modestly towards software and services, which may be recorded as opex rather than capex, but telcos remain vigilant cost cutters across the board.

Labor costs fell 1.3% YoY to $258.1B in the annualized 2Q25 period, with telco headcount shrinking to 4.36 million. Labor represented 21.7% of opex (excluding D&A) for the annualized 2Q25 period, down a bit from 22.2% in 2Q24.

Profitability margin inched higher in the latest annualized period from a year ago, with EBITDA at 33.8%, suggesting stable operational efficiency despite cost pressures. EBIT margin also edged up a bit, from 14.9% in 2Q24 to 15.5% for the 12 months ended June 2025.

Regionally, Asia maintained its lead with 36.8% of global telco revenues in 2Q25, slightly ahead of the Americas (36.3%). On the capex spending front, the Americas outspent all other regions, boosted by network spending from AT&T and Verizon.

[TITLE]Nvidia’s Q3 earnings call says the AI boom is the future. Here’s how it could reshape your money, job and life:
[TEXT]
Nvidia’s Q3 fiscal 2026 earnings didn’t just mark another monster quarter, they marked a turning point. The company used its earnings call to make something very clear: the AI surge isn’t slowing, and it isn’t a hype-fueled bubble. It’s the start of a multi-year infrastructure build-out that could reshape the global economy.

Revenue hit $57 billion, up 62% year over year, and a record sequential revenue growth of $10 billion. Nvidia’s newest AI platforms is so strong that CFO Colette Kress said, “Demand for AI infrastructure continues to exceed our expectations” (1). Behind the numbers, the company outlined a future where AI hardware is becoming as essential as roads, utilities and cloud computing.

Must Read

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP

CEO Jensen Huang went even further, saying the shift from generative AI to “agentic” and physical AI will be “revolutionary,” powering new industries, new business models and entirely new kinds of applications. Nvidia now sees more than $500 billion in visibility for its next-generation GPUs through 2026, not just from Big Tech, but from governments, enterprises and AI factories around the world.

For Americans trying to understand what all this means, Nvidia’s message lands with real implications. If the company is right, AI will quietly run the systems that touch your job, your money and your daily routines — not years from now, but starting now.

AI boom, not a bubble

To Nvidia, the AI boom isn’t inflating toward a burst, it’s the foundation of an AI infrastructure cycle that’s only just beginning.

CEO Jensen Huang said, “The transition to generative AI is transformational and necessary, supercharging existing applications and business models. The transition to agentic and physical AI will be revolutionary, giving rise to new applications, companies, products, and services.”

The scale is staggering. Nvidia says it now has roughly $500 billion of visibility for its Blackwell and Rubin GPU platforms through 2026, showing strong demand not just from cloud giants but also from broader enterprise projects (2). Basically, the company is laying the foundation for AI infrastructure as essential as roads or power grids.

It’s not just about tech companies getting richer. AI is quietly running behind the scenes in medicine, banking, transportation, and retail, automating workflows and making decisions (3). Nvidia sees a future where intelligent systems are woven into entire industries.

[TITLE]Rare earth magnet sops to lift India’s EV, chip plans: Industry:
[TEXT]
The Union Cabinet’s approval of a Rs 7,280 crore scheme to promote manufacturing of sintered rare earth permanent magnets ( REPM ) will help address a crucial missing link in India’s electric vehicle (EV) and chip supply chains, electronics and semiconductor industry executives said.The programme aims to create 6,000 metric tonnes per annum of integrated REPM capacity through five globally bid projects, backed by sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy over a seven-year period.Under the scheme, India will, for the first time, support end-to-end REPM manufacturing, from rare earth oxides to metals, alloys and finished magnets, in order to cut import dependence and serve fast-growing demand from EVs, renewables, industrial electronics and defence.The government has earmarked Rs 6,450 crore for sales-linked incentives over five years and Rs 750 crore as capital support to set up the targeted 6,000 metric tonnes per annum capacity, with each of the five selected players expected to get up to 1,200 metric tonnes per annum.Officials expect India’s REPM consumption to roughly double between 2025 and 2030, driven primarily by EVs and clean energy, making domestic capacity critical to supply chain security and the country’s Net Zero 2070 roadmap.The scheme’s seven-year timeline includes a two-year gestation period for plants to come up, followed by five years of incentive disbursal linked to magnet sales.The REPM scheme complements ongoing semiconductor and electronics initiatives by addressing a core upstream vulnerability in India’s EV and chip ecosystem, said industry executives.Mayank Shrivastava, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and cofounder of AGNIT Semiconductors that specialises in gallium nitride semiconductor technology, said the programme is “as critical as building fabs”. This is because advanced electronics depends on magnetic materials as much as on silicon, and the initiative shores up a key weak link in the country’s electronics supply chain.Rajoo Goel, secretary-general of the Electronic Industries Association of India , called the government scheme a first of its kind initiative focused on the core of the supply chain for electronics. Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet available, making them critical for emerging technology applications like electric motors for vehicles, defence and aerospace, renewable energy, computer hard drives and smaller electronics such as smartphones, he said.These magnets are efficient, long-lasting, and have higher resistance to corrosion and high temperatures, he explained. With rapidly growing demand for electronic products and technology, magnets and inputs made of rare earth materials have become critical, he added.The electronics industry is becoming increasingly dependent on the same and the countries which control their supply chain and technology have a geopolitical advantage and can dictate terms to the rest of the world, Goel said. Vivek Tyagi , executive council member at the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, said the scheme could quickly reduce import dependence for two- and three-wheeler manufacturers while also benefiting four-wheeler players over time.Several executives view the move as a logical follow-on to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's India Semiconductor Mission, aligning magnet manufacturing incentives with policies to attract chip fabs and advanced packaging units.The policy push comes as Andhra Pradesh emerges as a hub for downstream electronics and semiconductor manufacturing linked to EVs and industrial applications.Advanced System in Package (ASIP) Technologies is setting up an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility in the state in partnership with South Korea’s APACT, with an initial investment of Rs 468 crore.Chennai-based Syrma SGS, through its unit Syrma Strategic Electronics, is also building a Rs 765 crore multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) plant in Andhra Pradesh under the Centre’s electronic component manufacturing scheme, strengthening local PCB availability for automotive and industrial original equipment manufacturers.ASIP Technologies chief executive Venkata Simhadri said the rapid transition to EV two-wheelers and four-wheelers makes it “very important for India to create the local ecosystem and supply chain”, pointing to both semiconductors and REPMs as key components in the new mobility stack.He highlighted that the REPM scheme, along with ISM incentives for fabs and advanced packaging, addresses crucial elements of the EV supply chain, from permanent magnet motors on the mechanical side to compound semiconductor-based motor control and battery charging systems on the electronics side.While many electronics manufacturing services (EMS) players do not directly process rare earth materials, they expect second-order benefits from improved magnet availability.Syrma SGS managing director Jasbir Singh Gujral said REPMs are critical inputs for EV and semiconductor industries, and a domestic magnet ecosystem will indirectly help EMS companies by making the supply of magnet-based components more predictable and reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions.Syrma’s own operations rely on components made using REPMs, rather than raw magnets themselves, so greater upstream resilience should translate into smoother sourcing for finished parts, he said."It's a very well curated scheme that is coming at the apt time. It's going to take some time for these capacities to get created but the reactions I'm getting from my peers are quite positive," an EMS company executive said on the condition of anonymity."There is a belief that the investments are going to come in. And this is again de-risking from the borderland country which is absolutely prudent," he said.For fabless firms such as BigEndian Semiconductors, which designs custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions from its Bengaluru base while partnering with a foundry in Taiwan, the scheme stresses India’s intent to build deeper hardware value chains.Cofounder and chief executive Sunil Kumar cautioned that gestation-heavy incentive schemes tend to favour already established large organisations. However, innovation often comes from smaller challengers, making it important for policy to be calibrated to company size, he argued.Academia and skill-development experts expect the REPM scheme to catalyse new electronics manufacturing clusters, particularly for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and startups in advanced materials and magnet-based components.T Senthil Siva Subramanian, who heads the Institute Industry Interface programme at Hindustan College of Science and Technology in Mathura, said the scheme can help create MSME-focused electronics clusters that bridge lab-to-market gaps, generate new job roles through skilling, and encourage startups in REPM and related applications.He added that such clusters can feed into broader initiatives like “Vocal for Local” and “One District One Product” by nurturing “swadeshi” proof-of-concepts, while also advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals related to industry, innovation, infrastructure and climate action.Experts argue that domestic REPM capacity carries strategic weight beyond EVs, given its applications in defence, medical devices, nuclear research reactors and precision agriculture equipment.Subramanian pointed out that magnets such as samarium-cobalt and neodymium-iron-boron are critical across defence security systems, electronic traction motors, therapeutic medical equipment, nuclear research reactors and electronic farm machinery, and that local design and production capabilities can enhance India’s strategic autonomy and global ranking in high-tech manufacturing.He also expects the scheme to spur intangible investments in design tools, miniaturised products, software and intellectual property around rare earth magnets, boosting India’s standing in global innovation indices and helping domestic products progress across technology, customer, manufacturing and investment readiness levels.For policymakers and industry, the REPM push is increasingly seen as a foundational layer that strengthens everything from chip packaging and compound semiconductors to EVs, robotics and flexible electronics.(With inputs from Dia Rekhi in Chennai)

1 Change in TPV is calculated based on the local currency. TPV would increase by 1.8% year-over-year, if it is calculated by converting the local currency to US dollars. USD translation convention used for displaying TPV levels are based on month end exchange rate.

2 Currenc divested TNG Asia and GEA in August 2024 and July 2024, respectively. As such, from the fourth quarter of 2024 onward, only Tranglo’s (digital remittance and global airtime transfer businesses) and WalletKu’s (Indonesian airtime business) results will be consolidated and reported in the Company’s financial statements.

3 Total 2024 revenues include intercompany transactions.

Management Comments

“While global demand for digital remittance continues to grow, competition across major corridors has intensified,” said Alex Kong, Founder and Executive Chairman of Currenc. “In this environment, we prioritized pricing discipline, maintaining Tranglo’s take rate at 0.36% while delivering US$2.8 billion in TPV in the first half of 2025. Strategically, we continue to deemphasize lower-value airtime services, redirecting capital and resources toward our AI initiatives to deepen engagement with financial-institution clients, broaden our addressable market, and extend our remittance reach across additional high-volume corridors. Looking ahead, we remain committed to strengthening our remittance franchise while broadening our AI portfolio to create a more balanced, higher-quality revenue mix and deliver sustainable long-term value to our shareholders.”

Wan Lung Eng, Chief Financial Officer of Currenc Group, commented, “Our first-half performance reflects solid execution in our remittance business, which largely offset the expected decline in airtime revenues. Tranglo and WalletKu together generated positive EBITDA of US$1.7 million in the first half, while disciplined pricing and cost management kept our gross margin stable at 34.3% and maintained Tranglo’s payout rate at a healthy 0.13%. Operating expenses increased to US$15.1 million, mainly due to US$4.3 million in incentive share expenses associated with the de-SPAC merger and US$1.5 million in investments to develop our new AI offerings. Looking ahead, we will continue to streamline our cost structure, capitalize on our remittance strengths, and scale AI-driven growth to boost our profitability and shareholder value.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, it uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as described below, to understand and evaluate its core operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, is presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Currenc believes that EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the impact of items that Currenc does not consider indicative of the performance of its business. While Currenc believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating its business, this information should be considered supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

[TITLE]2025 CPA-Zicklin Index Finds Strong Corporate Support for Robust Political Disclosure and Accountability:
[TEXT]
The number of leading U.S. companies with the most robust policies for transparency and accountability around their political spending increased significantly from 103 in 2024 to 112 this year, according to the recently released 2025 CPA-Zicklin Index.

For the first time, representatives of five major U.S. public companies – all of them Trendsetters – participated in the announcement event. From the telecommunications, payments technology, and utilities sectors, the companies in attendance were Visa Inc. (Index score of 100.0 percent); Comcast Corp. (94.3 percent); Consolidated Edison Inc. (100.0 percent); Sempra (100.0 percent); and FirstEnergy Corp. (94.3 percent). Each were awarded certificates for earning Trendsetter status; all other Trendsetter companies are receiving the recognition digitally.

The 2025 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, the annual benchmarking of the political disclosure and accountability policies of the Russell 1000, was released at an event at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. It is a joint effort of the Center for Political Accountability, a Washington, DC based non-profit, and The Wharton School’s Zicklin Center for Governance and Business Ethics.

These public companies scoring 90 percent or above in the benchmarking study, designated Trendsetters, comprised more than 22 percent of all S&P 500 companies evaluated. This reflected a continuing trend “despite [companies] facing the greatest pressures of a lifetime,” in a period of turmoil and national division, the study said.

[TITLE]Telco Market Tracker Report, 2Q25: Performance for 140 Telcos from 1Q11 Through 2Q25 - Revenue, Labor, Capex, Opex, and Profitability Data:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Telco Market Tracker, 2Q25: Capex pullback persists even as revenues surge 4.6%" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

This report delivers a detailed analysis of the global telecommunications network operator (telco) industry, drilling down into performance for 140 telcos from 1Q11 through 2Q25. It captures revenue, labor, capex, opex, and profitability data with a focus on the most recent quarter (2Q25).

Key findings:

Global telco revenues climbed 4.6% year-over-year (YoY) in 2Q25 to reach $456.8 billion (B), supported by broad-based recovery across major markets. On an annualized 2Q25 basis, revenues grew 1.7% YoY to $1.8 trillion (T). Airtel (20.0%), Etisalat (18.7%), SoftBank (7.3%), Deutsche Telekom (4.6%), and China Unicom (3.7%) led growth in the annualized 2Q25 period, while Vodafone (-11.6%) and Orange (-7.1%) declined sharply.

Capex declined 2.1% YoY in 2Q25 to $67.5B, while the annualized total fell 2.6% to $292.9B. That's the lowest 12-month total since 2011, and the lowest capital intensity since 2013. China Mobile remained the largest investor with $24.4B in annualized capex (+7.8% YoY) in 2Q25, while America Movil (-24.5%), China Telecom (-22.9%), and China Unicom (-17.7%) made significant cutbacks. Telco tech spending continues to shift modestly towards software and services, which may be recorded as opex rather than capex, but telcos remain vigilant cost cutters across the board.

Labor costs fell 1.3% YoY to $258.1B in the annualized 2Q25 period, with telco headcount shrinking to 4.36 million. Labor represented 21.7% of opex (excluding D&A) for the annualized 2Q25 period, down a bit from 22.2% in 2Q24.

Profitability margin inched higher in the latest annualized period from a year ago, with EBITDA at 33.8%, suggesting stable operational efficiency despite cost pressures. EBIT margin also edged up a bit, from 14.9% in 2Q24 to 15.5% for the 12 months ended June 2025.

Regionally, Asia maintained its lead with 36.8% of global telco revenues in 2Q25, slightly ahead of the Americas (36.3%). On the capex spending front, the Americas outspent all other regions, boosted by network spending from AT&T and Verizon.

[TITLE]Naoris Ventures Outlines Cross-Sectoral Mission to Drive Real-World Deployment of Post-Quantum Technology:
[TEXT]
Porto, Portugal / Wilmington, DE , Nov. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Naoris Ventures , the acceleration venture of Naoris Protocol , the first in production quantum-resistant blockchain and cybersecurity mesh architecture, has unveiled its roadmap to accelerate real-world deployment of post-quantum technology in high-impact sectors including robotics, smart cities, energy, finance, defense, and AI.

The European Commission and EU Member States recently released a coordinated roadmap to transition the bloc’s digital infrastructure to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), recognizing the threat quantum computers pose to existing encryption. The plan sets a unified timeline: all Member States must begin national PQC strategies and initial migration steps by 2026; critical infrastructure and other high-risk sectors must adopt quantum-resistant encryption by 2030; and, by 2035, the PQC transition should be completed for all systems that can feasibly be upgraded.

Against this backdrop, Naoris Ventures is actively investing in, building with, and integrating alongside companies creating secure, resilient, and post-quantum-ready solutions across these critical industries.

Across industries, the practice of Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) has quietly become one of the most pervasive cybersecurity threats of the decade. Malicious actors are systematically collecting and storing encrypted data today, from sensitive financial transactions to patient health records, personal identifiers, and corporate communications, with the intent of decrypting it once quantum computing becomes commercially viable. This threat is particularly acute in data-rich sectors such as telecommunications, finance, and healthcare, where vast volumes of encrypted information are routinely transmitted and archived. Even if this data is currently protected by conventional cryptography, once quantum computers achieve sufficient processing power, the encryption algorithms underpinning today’s digital world could be rendered obsolete, exposing decades of stored data to retroactive exploitation.

Naoris Ventures recognizes that this looming vulnerability demands proactive innovation rather than reactive defense. By leveraging decentralized, quantum-resistant encryption architectures, Naoris can neutralize the Harvest Now, Decrypt Later threat by ensuring that even data harvested today remains secure in a post-quantum world. This not only safeguards sensitive assets like financial data, patient records, and personal communications but also establishes a resilient digital foundation for enterprises navigating the quantum era.

Last month Naoris Protocol was cited in a research submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the reference model for quantum-resistant blockchain infrastructure in its Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework (PQFIF). Within this framework, Naoris Protocol is recognized as a proven, evidence-based implementation model for industry-wide adoption.

Buoyed by Naoris Protocol’s landmark SEC citing, Naoris Ventures will accelerate initiatives that strengthen resilience, trust, and efficiency in an increasingly automated and interconnected world, with a view to partnering with visionary founders building solutions that secure the foundations of the next technological era.

Founders joining the Naoris Ventures ecosystem will benefit from access to the protocol’s deep research and engineering capabilities, advanced cybersecurity knowledge, and post-quantum infrastructure. Combined, these elements form a secure foundation for innovation to grow without sacrificing integrity. In the weeks ahead, Naoris Ventures will be unveiling new partnerships, co-developed proof-of-concepts, and initiatives aimed at strengthening resilience across high-impact industries.

“Naoris Ventures has a clear mandate to be the capital and coordination layer of a new global standard for digital trust,” said Regan Melin, Managing Partner of Naoris Ventures. “Today we are setting out our ambitious roadmap to scale secure and intelligent systems across critical industries such as robotics, smart cities, energy, finance, defense, and AI systems. We are just getting started”

Since launching its testnet in January, Naoris Protocol has recorded significant growth, with over 104 million post-quantum transactions processed, over 3.3 million wallets onboarded, over 1M security nodes and over 600 million cyber threats mitigated as well as 31 active projects under development across sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, defense, and IoT.

[TITLE]VCI Global Announces Strategic Transformation to Become Regional Leader in AI Infrastructure, Stablecoin Payments, and Digital Asset Advisory:
[TEXT]
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VCI Global Limited (NASDAQ: VCIG) (“VCI Global” or the “Company”) today announced a comprehensive strategic transformation to reposition the Company as a leading provider of AI infrastructure, stablecoin payment solutions, and digital asset advisory services across the high-growth ASEAN and MENA regions. This transformation marks a decisive shift toward sectors with substantial long-term demand, global scalability, and strong institutional adoption.

Focused Strategy Around Three High-Growth Pillars

VCI Global is streamlining its operations around three high-growth pillars, leveraging the unique expertise of its subsidiaries to drive long-term shareholder value:

1. AI Infrastructure & Consulting

Through V Gallant Limited (“V Gallant”), VCI Global delivers enterprise-grade AI solutions, including secure AI and data privacy, AI compute and consulting, data analytics as a service, ISO audit and advisory services, and cybersecurity consulting. These capabilities meet the rising demand for digital transformation in emerging markets.

2. Stablecoin Infrastructure & Settlement Rails

Through Smart Bridge Technologies Limited (“Smart Bridge”), VCI Global is advancing stablecoin initiatives. Planned initiatives include USDT-powered payment rail integration, real-time settlement infrastructure, AI-driven compliance and analytics for enterprises and institutions, supporting institutional adoption of stablecoin payments. The Company intends for these rails to enable merchants to receive real-time fiat settlement from digital asset payments.

3. Digital Asset & RWA Consultancy

Smart Bridge provides advisory services for tokenization, digital asset structuring, and real-world assets. Services include corporate fundraising advisory, regulated exchange listings, and multi-jurisdictional structuring for institutional clients.

Spin-Off, Carve-Out Strategies and Dividend Update

As part of its long-term strategy, VCI Global is pursuing a dual approach to unlock shareholder value and sharpen its focus on core growth areas. The Company will spin off non-core businesses through separate IPOs, retaining a 30% stake in each entity to preserve long-term value while enabling independent market valuation. The businesses currently in the spin-off pipeline include the Company’s capital markets consultancy arm, real estate division, energy unit, and fintech operations.

Concurrently, VCI Global is advancing a carve-out IPO of V Gallant, its wholly owned AI infrastructure subsidiary, which remains central to the Company’s growth strategy. In connection with this carve-out, the previously announced special dividend of 10% of V Gallant’s share capital will be distributed to VCIG shareholders, with the record date to be confirmed in due course, pending regulatory approvals. This underscores the Company’s commitment to delivering value to shareholders alongside its strategic initiatives.

Strengthening VCIG’s Role in the Global Stablecoin Ecosystem

VCI Global is reinforcing its position in the global stablecoin ecosystem through strategic alignment with Oobit and Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer. The Company plans to integrate stablecoin payment solutions, build settlement rails, and deploy AI-driven compliance and analytics tools for institutions and enterprises. Priority deployment will focus on ASEAN and MENA, two high-growth regions for digital commerce, alternative payments, and AI-driven transformation. To support this expansion, VCI Global has established the Oobit Treasury to grow the Oobit ecosystem and its OOB token, with initiatives targeting merchant acceptance, settlement rails, and stablecoin conversions.

“VCI Global is aligning itself with the fastest-growing engines of global digital transformation, AI infrastructure, stablecoin payment systems, and digital asset advisory. This strategic shift provides a powerful and scalable foundation for long-term growth while unlocking value for our shareholders through sector-focused expansion and planned initiatives,” said Dato’ Victor Hoo, Group Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VCI Global.

1 Change in TPV is calculated based on the local currency. TPV would increase by 1.8% year-over-year, if it is calculated by converting the local currency to US dollars. USD translation convention used for displaying TPV levels are based on month end exchange rate.

2 Currenc divested TNG Asia and GEA in August 2024 and July 2024, respectively. As such, from the fourth quarter of 2024 onward, only Tranglo’s (digital remittance and global airtime transfer businesses) and WalletKu’s (Indonesian airtime business) results will be consolidated and reported in the Company’s financial statements.

3 Total 2024 revenues include intercompany transactions.

Management Comments

“While global demand for digital remittance continues to grow, competition across major corridors has intensified,” said Alex Kong, Founder and Executive Chairman of Currenc. “In this environment, we prioritized pricing discipline, maintaining Tranglo’s take rate at 0.36% while delivering US$2.8 billion in TPV in the first half of 2025. Strategically, we continue to deemphasize lower-value airtime services, redirecting capital and resources toward our AI initiatives to deepen engagement with financial-institution clients, broaden our addressable market, and extend our remittance reach across additional high-volume corridors. Looking ahead, we remain committed to strengthening our remittance franchise while broadening our AI portfolio to create a more balanced, higher-quality revenue mix and deliver sustainable long-term value to our shareholders.”

Wan Lung Eng, Chief Financial Officer of Currenc Group, commented, “Our first-half performance reflects solid execution in our remittance business, which largely offset the expected decline in airtime revenues. Tranglo and WalletKu together generated positive EBITDA of US$1.7 million in the first half, while disciplined pricing and cost management kept our gross margin stable at 34.3% and maintained Tranglo’s payout rate at a healthy 0.13%. Operating expenses increased to US$15.1 million, mainly due to US$4.3 million in incentive share expenses associated with the de-SPAC merger and US$1.5 million in investments to develop our new AI offerings. Looking ahead, we will continue to streamline our cost structure, capitalize on our remittance strengths, and scale AI-driven growth to boost our profitability and shareholder value.”

To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, it uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as described below, to understand and evaluate its core operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, is presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Currenc believes that EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the impact of items that Currenc does not consider indicative of the performance of its business. While Currenc believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating its business, this information should be considered supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The company will use the new capital to speed commercialization of its robots, scale its consumer packaged goods (CPG) fleet and advance its central robot intelligence platform and research infrastructure, according to a Monday (Dec. 1) news release.

“Tutor stands out for its extraordinary speed of execution and its ability to balance cutting-edge product and model development with a clear commercial focus that quickly gets this functionality into customers’ hands,” Rebecca Kaden, managing partner at Union Square Ventures, which led the funding round, said in the release. “They’re not building for an abstract future; they’re transforming how CPG companies operate today.”

Founded out of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Tutor Intelligence’s robots work alongside human operators to process goods for a “vast Fortune 50 supply chain network,” the company said in the release. It also works with multiple Fortune 500 packaged food companies, and “global leaders” in the personal care, toys, home goods, beauty and consumer technology spaces.

“When we started Tutor Intelligence nearly five years ago as grad students at MIT, we saw that the robotics intelligence bottleneck was the key barrier to robotic worker viability,” said Josh Gruenstein, the company’s co-founder and CEO.

“We built a system that leverages on-the-job data to teach robots to navigate and understand the physical world with human-like intuition. This new capital enables us to expand our fleet, scale our robot training infrastructure, and empower our robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks, reshaping industrial work as we know it.”

The funding comes at a time when, as covered here last month, physical artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as the next stage of robotics. Earlier robots followed fixed commands and worked only in predictable environments, having trouble with the unpredictability found in everyday operations such as shifting layouts, mixed lighting, and human movement.

“That is beginning to change as research groups show how simulation, digital twins and multimodal learning pipelines enable robots to learn adaptive behaviors and carry those behaviors into real facilities with minimal retraining,” PYMNTS wrote.

Amazon’s launch of its Vulcan robot is one of the clearest examples of physical AI moving from research to frontline operations. This robot uses both vision and touch to pick and stow items in the company’s fulfillment centers, letting it handle flexible fabric storage pods and unpredictable product shapes.

[TITLE]U.S. vs China AI Rivalry : Chips, Homegrown AI, Power & What the Next Decade Brings:
[TEXT]
What if the United States’ dominance in artificial intelligence isn’t as unshakable as we’ve been led to believe? For years, America has been the undisputed leader in AI innovation, fueled by Silicon Valley giants and innovative chip manufacturing. But now, China’s meteoric rise in AI development is forcing a global recalibration. With its centralized approach, vast talent pool, and aggressive investments in semiconductor technology, China is no longer content to play catch-up, it’s aiming to lead. This shift is more than a technological rivalry; it’s a seismic challenge to the U.S.’s economic and geopolitical influence. Could it be that the American AI bubble is
