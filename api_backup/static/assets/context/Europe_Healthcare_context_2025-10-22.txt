[TITLE]Transgene and BioInvent’s Armed Oncolytic Virus BT-001 Shows Positive Local, Abscopal, and Sustained Antitumoral Activity in Advanced Refractory Tumors:
[TEXT]
BT-001 in combination with pembrolizumab is well tolerated and shows sustained antitumoral activity in both injected and non-injected lesions

Data support further development of BT-001 in solid tumors to improve response to cancer immunotherapy

Strasbourg, France, and Lund, Sweden, October 20, 2025, 08:30 a.m. CEST – Transgene (Euronext Paris: TNG), a biotech company that designs and develops virus-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, and BioInvent International AB (“BioInvent”) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BINV), a biotech company focused on the discovery and development of novel and first-in-class antibodies for cancer immunotherapy, jointly presented a poster at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Annual Meeting on updated clinical results and positive antitumoral activity of BT-001 in patients with advanced refractory tumors.

The data show that intra-tumoral (IT) BT-001 injection in combination with MSD’s (Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA) intravenous (IV) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab[*]), was well tolerated and showed positive local, abscopal and sustained antitumoral activity in injected and non-injected lesions.

Translational analyses reveal increased T cell chemoattractants in the blood and infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells and macrophages in tumors after treatment with BT-001 in combination with pembrolizumab. Significant tumor shrinkage (≥30% decrease in longest diameter) was observed in five of 16 injected lesions (in three patients with melanoma and one patient with sarcoma). Four patients had tumor shrinkage of non-injected lesions.

Long-lasting partial responses (PRs) were observed in a patient with melanoma resistant to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy and in a heavily pre-treated, PD-L1 negative leiomyosarcoma patient.

These immune-mediated tumor shrinkages are consistent with the mechanistic hypothesis that BT-001, in combination with pembrolizumab, turns “cold” tumors into immunologically active ones. The overall data support further development of BT-001 across a range of solid tumors to improve responses to cancer immunotherapies.

Prof. Celeste Lebbé, Dermatologist and Venereologist, Head of Dermatology Department at Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, commented: “Many cancer patients fail to respond to existing treatments, emphasizing the urgent need for new approaches. BT-001 represents a promising new class of immunotherapy, capable of inducing a potent local immune response through the expression of GM-CSF and an anti-CTLA-4 antibody. These clinical data provide compelling proof of concept, highlighting the relevance of this oncolytic virus in transforming cold tumors into immunologically active ones. Whether administered alone or in combination with pembrolizumab, BT-001 offers the potential to expand treatment options with a favorable safety profile across multiple tumor types.”

Dr. Alessandro Riva, Chairman and CEO of Transgene, said: “We are pleased to jointly present these clinical data on BT-001 at ESMO 2025, demonstrating encouraging antitumor activity in patients with solid, refractory solid tumors. These updated results confirm BT-001’s mechanism of action as a single agent administered via intra-tumoral injection and show early signs of clinical benefit, including lesion shrinkage and stable disease. With a favorable safety profile - both alone and in combination with pembrolizumab - BT-001 could represent an effective option to enhance responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with limited treatment alternatives. Together with our partner BioInvent, we will continue to explore its safety and efficacy and share further data as it becomes available.”

Andres McAllister, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer at BioInvent, added: “By combining BT-001 with pembrolizumab, we are building upon the promising data generated by BT-001 as a single agent. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in addition to BT-001’s mechanism of action is expected to further stimulate and restore the patient’s immune system, which should result in improved antitumoral activity and patient outcome. We are pleased to pursue clinical development opportunities with clinicians and further demonstrate the potential of this novel oncolytic virus.”

Transgene and BioInvent are co-developing BT-001, an oncolytic virus developed using Transgene’s Invir.IO® platform armed to express GM-CSF and BioInvent’s full-length anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, to elicit a strong and effective anti-tumoral response in solid tumors.

The poster titled: “Updated clinical results of BT-001, an oncolytic virus expressing an anti-CTLA4 mAb, administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.”, can be accessed at the websites for the ESMO conference, Transgene and BioInvent.

[TITLE]Natural Killer Cell Therapies Lead $254B Immunotherapy Market Transformation:
[TEXT]
Equity Insider News Commentary

Issued on behalf of GT Biopharma, Inc.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity InsiderNews Commentary – MIT and Harvard scientists recently created engineered CAR-NK cells that hide from the immune system and more effectively destroy cancer, opening doors to off-the-shelf treatments doctors can administer immediately after diagnosis instead of waiting weeks for personalized cell production[1]. Eight new oncology approvals between July and September 2025 demonstrate how cellular immunotherapy platforms are solving manufacturing challenges while expanding from blood cancers into solid tumors, with researchers discovering ways to reprogram immune cells to fight cancer for days without fatiguing[2]. This convergence of natural killer cell activation, T-cell engagers, personalized vaccines, and precision delivery systems positions GT Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GTBP), Evaxion A/S (NASDAQ: EVAX), RenovoRX, Inc. (NASDAQ:RNXT), EDAP TMS S.A. (NASDAQ: EDAP), and Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR).

The global cancer immunotherapy market stood at $105.7 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $254.6 billion by 2033, driven by increasing cancer incidence and rapid developments creating better tailored therapies[3]. Biomarker-driven drug development accelerates across oncology as companies advance novel mechanisms targeting previously difficult populations, with recent clinical data demonstrating high response rates in molecularly defined patient subgroups creating favorable conditions for immune-activating therapies offering reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy.

GT Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GTBP) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company headquartered in San Francisco that's focused on harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer. The firm is currently advancing innovative immunotherapy treatments designed to combat some of the most challenging cancer types, with recent progress showing promise in its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of GTB-3650. The company has successfully enrolled both patients in the trial's third dosing group (Cohort 3), with neither patient experiencing concerning side effects or dose-limiting toxicities thus far. GT Biopharma expects to commence treatment for Cohort 4 patients before the end of 2025, with further data releases planned for early 2026.

The Phase 1 study is testing GTB-3650 in patients battling relapsed or refractory blood cancers that express the CD33 protein, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These represent some of the most difficult cancer cases to treat, involving patients whose disease either came back after initial therapy or never responded to conventional treatment options.

GTB-3650 works by stimulating the patient's natural killer cells, a type of immune cell that naturally hunts down and destroys abnormal cells, to specifically target cancer cells. Patients receive the therapy through continuous infusions following a structured schedule: two weeks of treatment followed by two weeks of rest, repeating this cycle for up to four months based on how they respond.

After thorough safety assessments, the company successfully advanced into Cohort 3 following formal reviews of the initial two patient cohorts that found no safety or tolerability issues. The early results are particularly encouraging based on biomarker data, objective biological measurements that indicate whether the drug is working as designed. Blood analysis from the first four patients revealed measurable increases in both natural killer cell activity and proliferation.

The initial patient in Cohort 3 has shown encouraging signs of immune activation at levels comparable to those seen in patients from the earlier, lower-dose cohorts. This biological response suggests GTB-3650 is functioning precisely as intended: activating the immune system and directing it to attack cancer cells.

The Phase 1 design calls for testing GTB-3650 in approximately 14 patients across seven cohorts, with two patients per cohort receiving progressively higher doses from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 up to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7. The trial will continue escalating doses into higher ranges expected to translate immune activation into meaningful clinical benefits.

"We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule," said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO of GT Biopharma. "Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650. We look forward to sharing more data later this year to reinforce the ability of our TriKE constructs to activate endogenous NK cells, and the potential for broader utility with other targets to treat solid tumors (GTB-5550) and autoimmune indications (GTB-7550)."

Beyond blood cancers, the company is developing GTB-5550, which targets B7H3, a protein commonly found across various solid tumor types including breast, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancers. GT Biopharma plans to file its regulatory application to begin human trials of GTB-5550 in the fourth quarter of 2025. GTB-5550 is being designed as a subcutaneous injection that patients might eventually self-administer at home.

Both candidates utilize GT Biopharma's proprietary TriKE platform technology, which employs specialized antibody fragments originally found in camels and llamas. These molecules offer advantages over conventional antibodies due to their smaller size and greater stability. The company holds an exclusive worldwide license from the University of Minnesota for this technology.

As of June 30, 2025, GT Biopharmareported approximately $5.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, with management projecting this capital would support operations through the first quarter of 2026.
