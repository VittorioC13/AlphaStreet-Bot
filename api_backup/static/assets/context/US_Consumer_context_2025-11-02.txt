[TITLE]AIG to acquire the majority of renewal rights to Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio in $2 billion deal:
[TEXT]
Insurance giant AIG is set to acquire the renewal rights for the majority of Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio worth $2 billion in premiums, sources with intimate knowledge of the deal told Fortune.

The agreement with Everest, one of the world’s largest reinsurance and insurance solutions firms, is part of AIG CEO Peter Zaffino’s transformation effort at the century-old insurance company. It will also ease Everest’s loss reserve management issues after it underestimated claim costs in its U.S. casualty insurance business, leaving the firm in need of capital.

Insiders say that AIG expects to begin writing policies for existing North America Everest clients by the start of 2026. As for clients in the European Union, AIG is positioned to begin working on that portfolio during Q1 of 2026, depending on regulatory approvals.

AIG, a $44 billion insurance company, already serves more than 88 million commercial and personal customers worldwide​, operating in more than 200 countries and jurisdictions​. Everest also serves millions of policy holders, but is substantially smaller, valued at approximately $14.5 billion.

Meanwhile, Everest has hired multiple senior executives from AIG in recent years including the company’s former legal chief Anthony Vidovich, who was named executive vice president and general counsel of Everest on Oct. 16.

The Everest deal, insiders say, did not require AIG to seek out external capital or take on debt. And while AIG will obtain the portfolio and client relationships within the deal, all existing liabilities and prior exposures will remain with Everest. This specification will allow AIG to gain access to customers and future business without inheriting responsibility for claims and obligations from policies written before the transaction closed.

The move will significantly advance AIG’s portfolio growth in general insurance, a facet which, under Zaffino’s leadership, has demonstrated consistent growth. In 2024, the company wrote $23.9 billion in insurance premiums, up 6% year over year on a comparable basis. New business in 2024 reached $4.5 billion, a 9% increase. The company’s Q1 and Q2 earnings show potential further promise. New premiums written in Q1 were up 8% on a comparable basis, bringing in $4.5 billion, with Q2 premiums generating $6.9 billion.

Growth potential and avoidance of additional financial risk are particularly important to Zaffino’s vision and turnaround of AIG. The company has faced an uphill battle following its involvement in the 2008 global financial crisis. Leading up to 2008, AIG entered into enormous volumes of largely unhedged credit default swaps, insuring more than $440 billion in assets, including $57.8 billion backed by risky subprime mortgages.

When the subprime mortgage market collapsed, AIG faced huge losses and had to pay out on the credit default contracts. As investors and counterparties demanded collateral, the company’s liquidity evaporated, requiring a $182 billion government bailout, in exchange for an equity stake.

In the decade that followed, the insurer lost more than $30 billion in underwriting—a sign of excess capital, poor risk controls, and a lack of accountability for underwriting outcomes—and endured several CEO changes.

When Zaffino became CEO in 2021, AIG had undergone massive downsizing, asset sales, and management churn, but lingering operational inefficiencies and poor profitability, especially in underwriting, remained.

Since taking over, Zaffino has led an aggressive transformation strategy focused on disciplined underwriting, operational streamlining, and technological modernization. AIG has divested non-core units, reduced its risk exposure by over $1 trillion, and invested in AI capabilities. Those include partnerships with Anthropic and Palantir to build AI-driven risk assessment and operational tools aimed at improving underwriting precision and claims efficiency.

AIG’s financial performance has markedly improved, with analysts describing it as a “different company” compared to past years. In Q2 2025, the firm reported a $1.1 billion profit, reversing a $4 billion loss a year earlier which mainly reflected the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial, a life insurance and retirement solutions provider, and other portfolio changes. Adjusted after-tax income rose 56% year over year, and AIG’s earnings per share of $1.81 beat the forecast of $1.60, while revenue of $6.88 billion surpassed the expected $6.78 billion.

[TITLE]Alison Loehnis Joins JP Morgan’s Consumer and Retail Investment Banking Team:
[TEXT]
LONDON — Alison Loehnis has joined JP Morgan as a senior adviser in the consumer and retail investment banking team and will focus on luxury and lifestyle brands sector.

She was tapped by Jeannette Smits van Oyen, global head of consumer and retail investment banking at JP Morgan, and began work earlier this month. She is based in London.

Smits van Oyen said Loehnis’ “extensive leadership experience, global network and industry relationships will provide invaluable insight as we continue to strengthen our investment banking franchise across brand sub-verticals.”

She added that the bank has been advising “across a range of industry-defining transactions across sub-verticals over the past 24 months, including the take-private of Skechers; sale of Valentino to Kering, and sale of Rhode to E.l.f. While each transaction and each sub-vertical carries its own specific dynamic, the interconnectivity between them has become increasingly apparent.”

Smits van Oyen continued: “We look forward to working with Alison to enhance our sector expertise, deepen our network and relationships across the industry and accelerate idea generation for future opportunities.”

As reported, Loehnis left her role as president and ad interim chief executive officer of Yoox Net-a-porter group earlier this year. She spent 18 years at YNAP, which has since become part of Mytheresa’s publicly quoted parent company, LuxExperience.

LuxExperience picked up Yoox Net-a-porter for 555 million euros and a 100 million-euro credit facility from Compagnie Financière Richemont. In return, it handed Richemont a 33 percent stake in the wider luxury ecommerce company.

Loehnis’ tenure at YNAP was long — and eventful — with launches, mergers and corporate deals that went through — and fell through.

Loehnis, who cut her creative and commercial teeth at companies as diverse as Thomas Pink and The Walt Disney Co., joined Net-a-porter in 2007 as vice president of sales and marketing. She rose to the role of president in 2011.

During her long tenure she spearheaded some of the digital retail group’s biggest projects, heading the development of Mr Porter in 2011 and playing a key role in the launch of The Outnet, the group’s discount site.

She also introduced new categories, such as fine jewelry, expanded the group’s markets, and was celebrated as a leader in the digital luxury world.

As ad interim CEO she helmed YNAP as it prepared to be sold to Farfetch and Mohamed Alabbar. That deal was supposed to be completed by the end of 2023, but Richemont killed it after Farfetch was placed into administration, and later rescued by Coupang.

After the deal fell through, Loehnis stayed on until another buyer for YNAP could be found.

[TITLE]Cramer's week ahead: Earnings from Palantir, McDonald's, Robinhood, Warner Bros Discovery:
[TEXT]
CNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday told investors what to pay attention to next week on Wall Street, highlighting earnings from Palantir , McDonald's , Robinhood and Warner Bros Discovery .

Cramer offered an optimistic outlook for November, even as Wall Street worries about weakrning consumer-oriented companies as the government shutdown persists. He said November and December usually tend to be better months for the market than September and October.

"I think you got to have the long term view here," he said. "We're in the middle of earnings season, just finished the biggest week, and we've come out relatively unscathed. More important, we made it out of October without some sort of collapse — historically, we dodged a real bullet."

Berkshire Hathaway is set to report earnings on Saturday. Cramer said he likes the company, but he warned that investors should expect more profit-taking as CEO Warren Buffet leaves his longtime post.

Monday brings reports from Palantir and Clorox . Cramer suggested that the popular data software company is set to go higher, even though there might be some profit-taking after the quarter. Cramer praised Palantir's management and added that he's not "backing away from this one long-term." He called Clorox a conundrum, as the stock is down more than 30% year-to-date even though consumer packaged goods names usually do well during times of economic uncertainty.

Pfizer , Shopify , Uber , AMD and Axon will post earnings Tuesday. Cramer wondered whether Pfizer will break out after the quarter, saying the drug company has had a "dull run" as of late. He suggested Shopify and Uber are reliable winners, saying he's optimistic about results from both companies. Cramer was positive on AMD and Axon, saying the former is a strong Nvidia competitor and the latter's products are innovative. He also noted that Caterpillar will hold an investor day on Tuesday, and he praised business, remarking that the company's equipment is used to create and maintain data centers.

On Wednesday, McDonald's and Robinhood will report, and Cramer said the burger chain is a good judge of the state of the consumer. Online brokerage Robinhood has been able to win over many investors, he continued, and predicted earnings will be strong. Bank of America has an investor day on Wednesday, and Cramer said he thinks the financial giant will "tell a relatively sanguine story about the state of the economy."

Thursday brings earnings from Warner Bros Discovery, and Cramer said he's looking to find out whether the company is preparing to be taken over. Affirm , Sandisk and MP Materials will also report on Thursday, and he was positive on all three, saying they have had "tremendous stories to tell for a while now."

Wendy's and Constellation Energy are set to report on Friday, and Cramer suggested buying the power company and avoiding the fast food franchise.

[TITLE]Tariffs are expected to start showing up more in consumer prices as holiday shopping season starts:
[TEXT]
Shoppers carry Macy's and Nordstrom bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20.

While the impact so far this year has been muted, tariffs are expected to catch up with prices consumers pay just in time for the holiday shopping season.

President Donald Trump's tariffs on a plethora of items and individual countries, which started in April, have coincided with common inflation measures trudging along between 2.5% and 3% this year.

While economists don't see a major spike coming in common measures such as the consumer price and the personal consumption price indexes, they expect the tariffs will keep those gauges elevated at a time when they otherwise would be moving lower.

"There have been some questions in recent months as to whether tariffs have led to higher inflation for consumers," Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. "We think there's no debate — tariffs have pushed consumer prices higher."

Tariff impacts have been muted so far as companies built up inventories ahead of the duties and absorbed some of the impact through compressed profit margins.

Bank of America, though, expects that tariffs will be adding

Porsche’s billion-dollar loss last week isn’t just a setback for one of the world’s most profitable automakers—it’s a warning shot for the entire luxury economy. After years of record profits fueled by cheap credit and post-pandemic “revenge spending,” the German carmaker’s sudden slowdown shows that even the world’s most coveted brands are losing altitude as global demand cools.

[TITLE]GST reforms power small car sales for Maruti Suzuki, outpace SUV demand:
[TEXT]
Riding on the GST cuts, carmaker Maruti Suzuki saw sales of small cars zoom in October. Chairman RC Bhargava said that the perception that “aspirations of all Indians have changed, and that nobody wants to buy small cars” had been proved “incorrect”.

The belief that “the market has moved up to bigger and more luxurious cars has been proved to be an incorrect perception,” he said.

Bhargava told news agency Reuters he expects a larger growth in the company’s small car sales compared to SUVs following the Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms, that kicked in effective September 22.

Story continues below this ad

With the GST rate rationalisation, the taxes on small cars fell to 18 per cent from 28 per cent. These are vehicles with engine capacities not exceeding 1200 cc (for petrol) and 1500 cc (for diesel) and with length of not more than 4 metres.

On the other hand, the taxes on larger vehicles increased to 40 per cent, with additional compensation cess of 17-22 per cent, taking the total tax to 50 per cent in some cases.

Citing sales performance of October, the first full month after the new GST rates came into effect, Bhargava said: “Our retail sales growth in the ’18 per cent GST’ category grew by 30 per cent. Big cars have also grown by around 4-5 per cent. Overall, we have seen a growth of 20 per cent in retails.” This just shows that there were a lot of people wanting to buy small cars, he asserted.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd is among the manufacturers that maintained that due to changing aspirations, consumers have moved away from small cars and hatchbacks to smaller SUVs such as Exter and Tata Punch, which have also benefited from the 18 per cent GST rate.

Story continues below this ad

On the very first day the new GST regime kicked in on Monday (September 22), Maruti Suzuki reported a record 80,000 enquiries and 25,000 car deliveres. In comparison, rival automaker Tata Motors saw around 25,000 enquiries and 10,000 deliveries.

Following the development, Partho Banerjee, head of marketing and sales for Maruti Suzuki, had noted: “Demand for small cars has been especially strong, with bookings growing by nearly 50 per cent. Enquiries remain very high, and we may even run out of stock for certain variants. Dealers are staying open late into the night to deliver cars to customers. Compared to last year, the overall response has been exceptionally strong.”

The new GST regime, which came into effect on September 22, replaced the four-slab system (5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent, 28 per cent) with a two-slab system (5 per cent, 18 per cent), reducing the burden on customers and boosting transactions and economic activity in a wide range of sectors related to essentials, consumer goods, and services.

[TITLE]Judge questions the Trump administration’s plan to suspend SNAP benefits for millions:
[TEXT]
Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.

BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge in Boston on Thursday seemed skeptical of the Trump’s administration’s argument that SNAP benefits could be suspended for the first time in the food aid program’s history because of the government shutdown.

During a hearing over a request by 25 Democratic-led states to keep the funding flowing, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani told lawyers that if the government can’t afford to cover the cost, there’s a process to follow rather than simply suspending all benefits. “The steps involve finding an equitable way of reducing benefits,” said Talwani, who was nominated to the court by then-President Barack Obama.

Talwani said she expects to issue a ruling later Thursday and seemed to be leaning toward requiring the government to put billions of dollars in emergency funds toward SNAP. That, she said, is her interpretation of what Congress intended when an agency’s funding runs out.

“If you don’t have money, you tighten your belt,” she said in court. “You are not going to make everyone drop dead because it’s a political game someplace.”

Talwani acknowledged that even ordering emergency funds to pay for SNAP might still be painful for some SNAP recipients because it could mean they get less money and that the money they do get could be delayed. “We are dealing with a reality that absent a 100% win for you, the benefits aren’t going to be there on Nov. 1,” she told the plaintiffs.

The hearing came two days before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it can’t continue funding it due to the shutdown.

On Saturday, some 42 million people in the U.S. who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could lose the ability to afford food because of the ongoing government shutdown.

The Trump administration has warned that the debit-like EBT cards that hold an individual's SNAP funds won't be refilled when the money runs out on Nov. 1 — despite millions in emergency contingency money being available.

On Friday, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits. But it was unclear how much assistance may be provided or when it might come.

This comes as more than 700,000 federal workers are furloughed without pay or continue to work without their regular paychecks also because of the government shutdown.

These crises have placed immense pressure on food banks and food pantries across the country to fill in and provide much needed supplies for hungry families.

[TITLE]The Rise of the Artisan Economy:
[TEXT]
Developer Shaheen Sadeghi’s vision of an artisanal, small-business-driven economy seems oddly incompatible with his environment. After all, Orange County, Calif., where the 71-year-old Sadeghi has worked for four decades, bristles with mass-produced fabrication. Home to several of the nation’s most successful malls and endless shopping centers, the region has incubated such firms as McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, Cheesecake Factory, Marie Callender’s, Taco Bell, and the epicenter of faux American conformism, Disneyland.

Yet walking around his expanding development, called the Camp, it’s clear Sadeghi has made his vision real. Located on four acres in Costa Mesa — just one mile from the South Coast Plaza — one of the most successful mega-malls in the country — is a collection filled with dozens of independent, small businesses including oddball boutiques, diverse independent restaurants, and even a bar — Cowboy and Poodles — that celebrates southern California’s cowboy heritage, with Western images and artifacts matched with kitschy images of well-groomed dogs.

“Most of retail may be dying,” Sadeghi notes, “the next generation of customers won’t go to the big stores but are seeking out a direct human experience.” Moreover: “The traditional middleman role is obsolete. People may go online to buy necessities but when they go out to shop, they want something real, something that offers the possibility of serendipity.”

Sadeghi, who grew up in Michigan, is the child of Muslim Iranian immigrants. He graduated from Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute and worked in the surf-wear industry — eventually running Huntington Beach–based Quiksilver — for a decade until he came up with his concept of “the anti-mall” in 1993. His LAB company, which stands for “Little American Business,” has some 40 projects spread across the county. For many young residents, including my daughters, the Camp and Anaheim’s Packing House (both LAB developments) replaced the conventional mall as their preferred place to hang.

Sadeghi says he believes that his developments tap an unmet demand for personal, unique experiences and, most of all, human interaction. “The rise of artificial intelligence and virtual reality, a world of robots, suggests we don’t need to interface with people,” he says over lunch at Aba, a crowded and popular Israeli restaurant at the Camp. “But people need more than that. They want that personal experience, the unexpected. Providing that is what excites me.”

The notion of an artisan economy may seem odd in an age dominated by online sales and artificial intelligence. Yet, as Sadeghi points out, this is the opportunity. As we buy routine, depersonalized products online or at a mega retailers such as Target or Costco, there remains a desire for something more human. We seek to connect more closely to the farmer, the maker of products, and to products sourced close to the community.

This counterfactual development can be seen in such things as the rapid growth of flea markets, farmers’ markets, and that ultimate symbol of grassroots free markets, garage sales. The 2000s and 2010s saw the growth of the “buy local” movement and the rapid expansion of farmers’ markets in the U.S. — from fewer than 1,800 in the mid-1990s to more than 8,770 by 2019. Flea markets have also proliferated around the world, growing at 4.5 percent a year. By 2033, U.S. flea market sales are expected to grow from $12.5 billion to almost $17.5 billion. Similar growth is projected in Latin America, Europe, and Asia.
