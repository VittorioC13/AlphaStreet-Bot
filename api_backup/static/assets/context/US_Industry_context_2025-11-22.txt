[TITLE]Smartkem and Jericho Energy Ventures Extend Letter Of Intent for Proposed All-Stock Merger to Form U.S.-Owned, AI-Focused Infrastructure Company:
[TEXT]
Proposed all-stock transaction aims to align JEV's scalable energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor innovations to power next generation AI data centers

MANCHESTER, England, Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Smartkem, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMTK), ("Smartkem"), a company developing a new class of organic semiconductor technology, today announced that it has agreed to a 60-day extension of its non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") for a proposed all-stock business combination (the "Proposed Transaction") with Jericho Energy Ventures Inc. (TSX-V: JEV, OTC: JROOF) ("Jericho" or "JEV"), an energy innovation company. The amendment to the LOI also extends the deadline by which Smartkem is required to invest in Jericho to prevent Jericho from having the right to terminate the LOI to December 31, 2025. The other terms of the LOI remain unchanged.

As previously disclosed, if completed, the Proposed Transaction would establish a Nasdaq-listed, U.S.-owned and controlled AI infrastructure company that integrates low-cost domestic energy with advanced semiconductor packaging and materials to support the rapidly growing demand for AI compute capacity.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Ian Jenks, Chairman & CEO of Smartkem

"We are pleased to extend the LOI as both teams are committed to working towards a transaction that could unlock meaningful value across the rapidly converging energy and AI sectors. We believe the opportunity to integrate Smartkem's world-class semiconductor materials with JEV's scalable energy platform represents a compelling strategic path forward."

Brian Williamson, CEO of Jericho Energy Ventures

"Extending the LOI reflects the continued enthusiasm between JEV and Smartkem to progress with the proposed merger to create a U.S.-owned AI infrastructure company that brings together JEV's energy innovation and Smartkem's semiconductor capabilities. We look forward to discussions toward a definitive agreement."

Anthony Amato, Strategic Advisor to Smartkem

"This extension indicates the significant potential that both parties see in combining the complementary capabilities of JEV's energy platform with Smartkem's semiconductor technology to meet the power and performance needs of next-generation AI infrastructure."

The LOI is non-binding, and there can be no assurance that Smartkem and Jericho will ultimately enter into a definitive agreement for the Proposed Transaction, that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated, or as to the timing or ultimate terms of any Proposed Transaction that may occur. Both Smartkem and Jericho will need significant additional capital to complete the negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, obtain any required stockholder approvals and ultimately complete the Proposed Transaction. The closing of the Proposed Transaction would be subject to significant closing conditions, including the negotiation of the definitive agreement, the satisfactory completion of due diligence, required board and stockholder approvals, and approval of continued listing by Nasdaq.

[TITLE]Aramco Redefines Oil Power in $120 Billion U.S. Tech and LNG Alliance:
[TEXT]
The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code.

Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion.

Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just

[TITLE]Tai Software and HaulPay Bring One-Click Carrier Payments to Tai TMS:
[TEXT]
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tai Software, a leading provider of automation-driven TMS technology for freight brokers and 3PLs, today announced the launch of the HaulPay Freight Payment Wallet, powered by HaulPay, the digital freight finance and payments platform.

The new feature is now embedded directly in Tai TMS, allowing brokers to reduce risk by verifying payees, automate carrier payments, and access optional working capital without leaving their core workflow.

With the HaulPay wallet, Tai users can move from “shipment delivered” to “fully paid” in one single step, while maintaining controls that help mitigate fraud and reduce back-office workload.

“Brokers want fewer tabs and more certainty,” said Daniel Ely, Chief Product Officer at Tai Software. “Integrating HaulPay’s payment wallet gives our customers a faster, safer way to pay carriers and reconcile transactions within Tai. The result is less manual work and more confidence in every payment.”

“This partnership is about speed and protection,” said Steve Kochan, President at HaulPay. “By bringing our verification and financing guardrails into Tai, brokers can automate payouts, avoid misdirected funds, and unlock cash flow so they can grow without stressing their own balance sheet.”

Key Features of HaulPay Wallet for Tai TMS

One-click carrier payments from ACH and other supported methods.

[TITLE]With $1.6 Billion in Jeopardy, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold Plug Power Stock Here?:
[TEXT]
Plug Power (PLUG) has been no stranger to volatility, but the stakes just got a lot higher. After years of ambitious expansion plans, the hydrogen fuel-cell company has decided to suspend work on six U.S. green hydrogen plants—projects that formed the backbone of its long-term growth strategy and were tied directly to a massive $1.6 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. That loan, awarded in the final days of the Biden administration, was expected to support the construction of green hydrogen facilities across multiple states and help Plug transition from aspiration to scale.

But now, as the company abruptly pauses development and shifts its focus toward data centers, investors are left wondering whether this pivot represents smart strategic realignment. Losing access to low-cost federal financing could be a major blow, especially for a company already burning substantial amounts of cash and facing pressure to prove that its business model can eventually turn profitable.

Against this backdrop, the question becomes unavoidable: with so much uncertainty hanging over Plug Power, should investors buy, hold, or sell PLUG stock here?

[TITLE]FMCSA’s tighter bond enforcement looms over freight brokers in 2026:
[TEXT]
Many freight brokers look forward to turning the page on 2025, another difficult year for the trucking industry, but they’re now facing what could be the most consequential regulatory shift in several years.

On January 16, 2026, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s long-awaited updates to broker and freight forwarder financial responsibility rules fully kick in, transforming the $75,000 surety bond from a largely paper requirement into a rigidly enforced floor. Freight brokers’ gross margins, especially on a margin dollars per load basis, have been under pressure for years. These changes will present further challenges to highly leveraged brokers who already don’t have much room to maneuver.

The rules, finalized in late 2023 and delayed by a year due to registration system issues, close loopholes that have allowed some brokers to operate with depleted or questionable financial security. Chief among the changes is the requirement for immediate suspension of operating authority if a broker’s available bond or trust fund dips below $75,000 and isn’t replenished within seven business days of notice. Surety providers and trustees must now electronically notify FMCSA of drawdowns or signs of insolvency, practically in real time.

Perhaps most disruptively, BMC-85 trust funds—the alternative to traditional surety bonds used by thousands of brokers—must now consist solely of cash or cash-equivalent assets that can be liquidated in seven days or less, and only federally regulated financial institutions can serve as trustees. A significant portion of existing trusts will no longer qualify, forcing brokers to scramble for new providers or revert to costlier bonds.

These stricter standards arrive at a dangerous time. The trucking market has spent much of 2024 and 2025 in a protracted trough, with contract rates from shippers remaining stubbornly low while spot rates paid to carriers have begun climbing again. Mid-market brokers in particular have amplified their risks by leveraging earnings multiple times over through credit facilities, often with covenants tied to gross margin percentages. When those margins shrink, because brokers must absorb rising carrier costs without fully passing them on to shippers, lenders demand repayment, creating a death spiral that can end in insolvency.

Broker math has been brutal. Many brokers entered the post-pandemic downturn with contract books locked in at rates that no longer cover escalating spot payouts. Spot rates, which bottomed out in the freight recession, have shown signs of life in late 2025, with dry van linehaul indices posting year-over-year gains even as overall volumes stagnate. Yet shippers, enjoying the leverage of excess capacity, have been slow to accept meaningful contract increases during bid seasons. The result is widespread margin compression, with some publicly traded brokerages reporting gross margins hovering in the low-to-mid teens, down from healthier levels seen in prior cycles.

[TITLE]TCS joins AI, data centre rush with TPG alliance, draws gigawatt-scale plans:
[TEXT]
India’s largest software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ), is joining forces with private equity group TPG in a multi-billion dollar joint venture to create gigawatt-scale, AI-ready data centres. The Tata company is looking to accelerate its efforts toward becoming the world’s largest AI-led technology services firm.This also marks a strategic pivot for the IT firm, which has historically pursued a capex-light, organic growth business model.It will be the third equity partnership between TPG and Tata group after the Tata Motors lectric vehicles arm and Tata Technologies . Both partners have agreed to cumulatively invest up to Rs 18,000 crore ($2.1 billion) as equity in HyperVault AI Data Centre Ltd — incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the technology company late in October — over the next few years, TCS said in an official statement on Thursday.TCS will own a controlling 51% of HyperVault. TPG will deploy Rs 8,820 crore ($1.1 billion) for a stake of up to 49%.ET was the first to break the story online on Thursday afternoon, hours before the formal announcement.The new data centre arm will be led by a separate management and will operate as a colocation data centre provider offering services to hyperscalers, Indian enterprises and government entities, along with Tata companies, said the company’s management.TPG can appoint up to two board members. The project will complete buildout in five to seven years and revenue could start kicking in over the next 18-24 months.“HyperVault will give options to our customers to establish active or passive facilities (data centres), create private cloud, or give them ability to do model-as-a-service as well as work with hyperscalers and AI companies,” TCS chief executive K Krithivasan told ET in an exclusive interaction, moments after the deal announcement. “We are creating a passive data centre. Then someone has to put the GPUs, CPUs and all the hardware, software required. That additional money will come from the users of the data centre, as and when contracts get signed.” Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran said, “With this capability, TCS is uniquely positioned to deliver complete AI solutions for its customers and partners.”TPG’s investment will be through TPG Rise Climate and its Global South Initiative, a private equity strategy launched in partnership with Altérra, along with its Asia real estate business, TPG Asia Realty, which will also be making its India debut.TPG executive chairman Jim Coulter pointed out India’s advantages. “India is currently short on data centre capacity, though it is expected to ramp up to 10 GW relatively fast. The national grid provides low-cost electricity that is 40% cheaper than (in) the US,” he said. “Construction costs are also among the lowest, which will have a bearing on lease pricing. Additionally, one of the things that is hugely underestimated in this market is the quality of human capital. If you add it all up, this is an interesting market not only for servicing India, but for servicing the world.”This is the first time that cash-rich TCS will be taking equity from a PE firm as well as external debt to fund a project.Last month, TCS announced its plan to enter the data centre space with an aim of building up to 1.2 GW of capacity, entailing $6.5-7 billion in investments to be funded via debt and equity.To put the scale of the project in context, 1.2 GW is the entire combined capacity of India’s existing data centres. However, this is expected to grow manifold, reaching 9 GW in the next five to seven years, attracting capex investments of $50-95 billion as competition heats up in the space, market forecasts suggest.Some investors and analysts had expressed concern over the diversification plan, which they saw as having limited overlap with core IT services and putting pressure on returns.TCS’ return on equity stood at 51% and return on invested capital at over 80% in FY25, but the shift to a capex-heavy model may weigh on these metrics. The TCS stock had reacted negatively, dropping 1.5% following the October announcement.The company had Rs 47,000 crore in free cash flows as of FY25.Traditional IT services companies such as TCS are facing a tough transition, shifting from a human-led model to stay relevant amid AI disruption. The Tata firm laid off 1%, or 6,000 people, of its 600,000-strong workforce in the last quarter as part of plans to reduce headcount by 2% in this financial year. This, combined with voluntary and involuntary attrition, saw the workforce down by 19,755 on a net basis in July-September, its largest quarterly decline ever.However, the management said the data centre project will help TCS become an “end-to-end solutions provider,” offering both infrastructure and IT services.“We believe this is the best way to ensure that our investors’ money is well spent,” said Krithivasan. “Together, we invest $2 billion. And then we go to the market for the rest of the money. We are currently looking at three or four major segments. As cloud usage increases, this market is expected to grow significantly. The second is AI training and inferencing. And finally, secure and sovereign cloud or private data centres.”TCS uniquely provides comprehensive solutions to clients, Coulter said. “Together, we see it as a missed opportunity if those solutions didn’t include data centres,” he said. “So, developing the ability for TCS to serve its clients more holistically, through pairing physical and virtual solutions together, is just a natural extension.”Tata group is the latest among deep-pocketed Indian business houses to make a big entry into the space and will be pitted against leading colocation providers such as Reliance Industries, AdaniConnex, Bharti Airtel’s Nxtra Data, NTT Global, Sify Technologies and CtrlS Datacenters.According to industry estimates, India’s data centre market has attracted nearly $94 billion in investments since 2019. That’s dwarfed by what the tech titans — Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — are spending globally, with their combined annual capex projected to exceed $400 billion in 2026 alone.AZB & Partners, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and Latham & Watkins LLP were the legal advisers involved in the TCS-TPG partnership, while Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India and Price Waterhouse & Co were tax advisers.

[TITLE]New Edmonton city council to discuss proposed 6.4% property tax increase:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

Edmonton city councillors will get the chance to make adjustments to a proposed 2026 budget and 6.4 per cent property tax hike in the coming weeks.

It comes as administration says the city is facing a fiscal gap, with a flurry of cost pressures pushing up against population growth and the desire to maintain service levels.

The proposed tax increase is the same amount that was approved in the spring by the previous council.

Stacey Padbury, the city’s chief financial officer, said it works out to an average of $49 more per $100,000 of a home’s assessed value.

She said keeping the increase to 6.4 per cent was a challenge.

“I would say that any reductions would actually have to correspond with a reduction in a service level.”

This budget is the final year as part of the last four-year budget cycle. The new council will craft its next four-year budget in 2026.

Administration says the cost of delivering services in a rapidly growing city is a challenge as Edmonton has limited sources of revenue.

The 2026 budget earmarks extra spending for basic services that are costing more, including the spring street sweep, animal control and vandalism repairs.

But it also rolls back the level of services in bus cleaning and Dedicated Accessible Transit Service.

And the spending plan has scant funding for any flashy capital projects, instead focusing on the basics of servicing new neighbourhoods with firehalls and school sites.

Padbury said it is mostly aiming to continue planned projects and respond to emerging needs such as the province’s plan for new school construction.

It does, however, include $6.5 million for replacing the Rossdale Power Plant roof.

There’s a number of planned projects that did not get funding listed in the budget, including 25 new buses and several road-widening projects.

Padbury said administration decides how to fund capital projects based on what’s available.

“At this point there's not a lot of available funding left for the 2023 to 2026 budget,” she said.

The adjustments will be presented to council next week and will be debated the first week of December.

Mind the gap

In a report last fall , city administration set out to further understand Edmonton’s ongoing fiscal gap.

It describes less money coming in from provincial grants, a declining share of non-residential taxes, debt limits, inflationary pressures and a population growth pinch.

Despite those limitations, polling completed before the fall election suggested Edmontonians want taxes to stay low , without compromising services.

It’s a challenge the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce hopes the new council will tackle.

“This budget process, under Mayor [Andrew] Knack's leadership, is the moment to focus on spending that grows the economy, improves core services and strengthens our ability to attract investment,” Heather Thomson, the organization’s vice-president of economy and engagement, told CBC News in an emailed statement.

“Businesses are looking for predictability, value and a city budget that supports growth, not burdens it."

[TITLE]ESCO Reports Fourth Quarter And Fiscal 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
St. Louis, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ESCO Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ESE) (ESCO, or the Company) today reported its operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 (Q4 2025 and FY 2025, respectively). During Q4 2025, the Company completed the sale of VACCO Industries. The VACCO operating results are presented as Discontinued Operations in the attached tables and are excluded from the following discussion of the Company’s results from Continuing Operations for the comparable periods.

Operating Highlights

Q4 2025 Sales increased $79 million (28.9 percent) to $353 million compared to $274 million in Q4 2024. Q4 organic sales increased $21 million (7.7 percent) and the Maritime acquisition contributed $58 million (21.2 percent) of revenue growth in the quarter.

FY 2025 Sales increased $176 million (19.2 percent) to $1.1 billion compared to $919 million in FY 2024. Organic sales increased $81 million (8.8 percent) and the Maritime acquisition added $95 million (10.4 percent) of revenue growth for the full year.

Q4 2025 GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations increased 13.8 percent to $1.73 per share compared to $1.52 per share in Q4 2024. Q4 2025 Adjusted EPS from Continuing Operations increased 29.6 percent to $2.32 per share compared to $1.79 per share in Q4 2024.

FY 2025 GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations increased 13.1 percent to $4.49 per share compared to $3.97 per share in FY 2024. FY 2025 Adjusted EPS from Continuing Operations increased 26.4 percent to $6.03 per share compared to $4.77 per share in FY 2024.

Q4 2025 Entered Orders increased $73 million (29.7 percent) to $321 million (book-to-bill of 0.91x).

FY 2025 Entered Orders increased $565 million (56.5 percent) to $1.6 billion (book-to-bill of 1.43x), resulting in record year-end backlog of $1.1 billion. Excluding $364 million of acquired backlog at Maritime, FY 2025 orders increased $201 million (20.1 percent) over the prior year.

Net Cash provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations was $112 million in Q4 2025 and $200 million for FY 2025 (an increase of $79 million compared to FY 2024).

Bryan Sayler, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, “We finished the year strong with another great quarter highlighted by 29 percent sales growth, 100 basis points of Adjusted EBIT margin improvement, and a 30 percent increase in Adjusted EPS from Continuing Operations.

“For the year, strong end-market demand, disciplined execution, and the acquisition of Maritime drove record sales, orders, backlog and Adjusted EPS. These results underscore the strength of our strategic positioning and our ability to create sustainable value in attractive markets.

“It was a truly historic year for ESCO as we continued to build on our solid foundation, delivering value across the enterprise while enhancing our portfolio by completing two consequential transactions. These accomplishments were the result of a lot of hard work and I would like to extend my appreciation to our entire team for their energy, focus, and dedication. Our collective efforts helped drive significant improvement in operating performance while taking a meaningful step forward in the evolution of the company.”

Segment Performance

Aerospace & Defense (A&D)

Q4 2025 sales increased $71 million (71.6 percent) to $170 million from $99 million in Q4 2024. Organic sales increased $13 million (13.1 percent) and Maritime added $58 million (58.5 percent) of revenue growth in the quarter. FY 2025 sales increased $137 million (40.4 percent) to $478 million from $341 million in FY 2024. Organic sales increased $42 million (12.5 percent) and Maritime added $95 million (27.9 percent) of revenue growth for the year. Sales growth in both the quarter and the year was driven by strength in Navy and commercial aerospace.

Q4 2025 EBIT increased $17.0 million to $46.9 million from $29.9 million in Q4 2024. Adjusted EBIT increased $18.8 million in Q4 2025 to $48.7 million (28.6 percent margin) from $29.9 million (30.1 percent margin) in Q4 2024. The 63 percent increase in Adjusted EBIT was driven by the Maritime acquisition as well as leverage on higher volume, price increases, and mix. FY 2025 EBIT increased $39.3 million to $125.1 million from $85.8 million in FY 2024. FY 2025 Adjusted EBIT increased $43.7 million to $129.7 million (27.1 percent margin) from $86.0 million (25.2 percent margin) in FY 2024. Leverage on higher volume, price increases, mix, and the impact of Maritime more than offset inflationary pressures for the year.

Q4 2025 entered orders increased $53 million (60.1 percent) to $141.9 million (book-to-bill of 0.83). Q4 orders growth was driven by strong commercial and defense aerospace orders at PTI and $43 million of Maritime orders. FY 2025 entered orders increased $465 million (108 percent) to $896 million (book-to-bill of 1.87) resulting in record year-end backlog of $803 million. FY 2025 included $364 million of acquired backlog at Maritime. Without this impact, A&D orders increased $101 million (23 percent) primarily driven by higher Navy orders at Globe and the addition of Maritime.

Utility Solutions Group (USG)

Q4 2025 sales increased $2 million (1.6 percent) to $110 million from $108 million in Q4 2024. Doble sales increased by $6 million (6.8 percent) and NRG sales decreased by $4 million (19.7 percent). FY 2025 sales increased $11 million (3.0 percent) to $380 million from $369 million in FY 2024. Doble sales increased $18 million (6.0 percent) and NRG sales decreased $7 million (9.6 percent) for the year. Sales growth in both the quarter and the year was driven by higher offline test equipment, protection testing, and services, partially offset by lower condition monitoring sales at Doble and lower renewables revenue at NRG.

Q4 2025 EBIT increased $3.3 million to $31.9 million from $28.6 million in Q4 2024. Adjusted EBIT increased $3.4 million in Q4 2025 to $32.0 million (29.1 percent margin) from $28.6 million (26.4 percent margin) in Q4 2024. FY 2025 EBIT increased $8.8 million to $94.7 million from $85.9 million in FY 2024. FY 2025 Adjusted EBIT increased $9.1 million to $95.2 million (25.0 percent margin) from $86.1 million (23.3 percent margin) in FY 2024. Adjusted EBIT increases for the quarter and year were largely driven by price increases and mix, partially offset by inflationary pressures.

Q4 2025 entered orders increased $17 million (16.8 percent) to $116 million (book-to-bill of 1.05). Record quarterly orders at Doble increased $21 million (25.7 percent) to $101 million and NRG orders decreased $4 million (21.2 percent) to $15 million compared to Q4 2024. FY 2025 entered orders increased $48 million (13.5 percent) to $404 million (book-to-bill of 1.06) resulting in year-end backlog of $143 million. For the year, Doble orders increased $47 million (16.2 percent) related to increased electric utility spending to maintain and expand the grid. NRG orders increased $1 million (1.4 percent) as renewables project developers focused on completing current projects as tax credits sunset under new U.S. tax legislation approved during the year.

RF Test & Measurement (Test)

Q4 2025 sales increased $6 million (9.6 percent) to $72 million from $66 million in Q4 2024. FY 2025 sales increased $27 million (13.2 percent) to $237 million from $210 million in FY 2024. Sales growth in both the quarter and the year was largely driven by higher Test & Measurement (EMC) and industrial shielding sales, partially offset by lower wireless sales.

Q4 2025 EBIT and Adjusted EBIT both increased $0.6 million to $12.6 million (17.5 percent margin) from $12.0 million (18.3 percent margin) in Q4 2024. The Adjusted EBIT margin was lower than the record margin of 18.3 percent in Q4 2024 as leverage on higher volume and price increases were offset by inflationary pressures. FY 2025 EBIT increased $5.5 million to $34.1 million from $28.6 million in FY 2024. FY 2025 Adjusted EBIT also increased $5.5 million to $34.6 million (14.6 percent margin) from $29.1 million (13.9 percent margin) in FY 2024. Leverage on higher volume and price increases in FY 2025 were partially offset by inflationary pressures and unfavorable mix.

Q4 2025 entered orders increased $3.4 million (5.8 percent) to $63 million. Higher Test orders were highlighted by a $5.5 million defense project booked in the quarter. FY 2025 entered orders increased $53 million (24.6 percent) to a record $266 million (book-to-bill of 1.12) resulting in year-end backlog of $187 million. With the exception of the wireless market, Test experienced a broad rebound in orders across other served markets in FY 2025.

Discontinued Operations - VACCO Industries Divestiture

As previously announced, the Company closed the divestiture of VACCO Industries on July 18, 2025. During the fourth quarter, the Company recognized an after-tax gain of $173 million related to the sale and $1.1 million in earnings related to discontinued operations. An accrued tax expense of $59 million was recorded in the quarter, with the anticipation of making the tax payment related to the gain on the sale in the first half of FY 2026.

Business Outlook – FY 2026

Management expects double-digit sales, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS growth in FY 2026.

Expectations for growth in FY 2026 compared to FY 2025:

Net sales are expected to grow 16 to 20 percent to a range of $1.27 to $1.31 billion on a consolidated basis, with A&D growing 33 to 38 percent (6 to 8 percent organic growth plus Maritime revenue of $230 to $245 million), USG growing 4 to 6 percent, and Test growing 3 to 5 percent.
