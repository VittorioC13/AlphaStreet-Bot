Segmental Insights

By drug type analysis

Which Drug Type Led the U.S. CAR T-Cell Therapies Market in 2024?

The axicabtagene ciloleucel segment accounted for a dominant share of the market in 2024. Its widespread adoption is driven by its greater efficacy in treating particular, often previously intractable, types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), specifically in patients whose cancer has relapsed or is refractory to other treatments. In October 2024, the FDA authorised RMAT designation for axicabtagene ciloleucel as an efficient first-line treatment for adults with newly diagnosed, high-risk large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL).

Moreover, the tisagenlecleucel segment is anticipated to witness rapid expansion. It is mainly approved for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and certain B-cell lymphomas. Currently, the US scientists are continuing analysis of real-world data for both its approved indications (pediatric/young adult B-ALL and adult DLBCL/HGBCL), and persistent research into new CAR-T technologies, including site-specific integration and probably wider applications.

By indication analysis

Why did the Lymphoma Segment Dominate the Market in 2024?

By capturing the biggest share, the lymphoma segment led the U.S. CAR T-cell therapies market in 2024. A prominent driver is a rise in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Recent studies are leveraging improvements in delivery methods, such as direct intrathecal administration is being promoted for lymphomas affecting the central nervous system. In May 2025, a study demonstrated that an "armored" CAR T-cell therapy (huCART19-IL18) that secretes the cytokine IL-18 gained a 52% complete remission rate in heavily pre-treated lymphoma patients. By 2030, there will be a rise in nearly 108,000 new NHL cases in the U.S. is predicted.

Whereas the acute lymphocytic leukemia segment will expand rapidly. In 2024, the American Cancer Society anticipated that

[TITLE]Eisai Submits New Drug Application for Subcutaneous Formulation of “LEQEMBI®” for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease in Japan:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that Eisai has filed a new drug application for “LEQEMBI®” (brand name, generic name: lecanemab) seeking approval for a subcutaneous formulation (subcutaneous autoinjector: SC-AI) as a new route of administration to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA).

The application is based on data from multiple subcutaneous (SC) administration sub-studies of lecanemab conducted as part of the Phase 3 Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE), following the 18-month core study in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) or mild stage of AD dementia (collectively referred to as early AD). It was confirmed that the once-weekly administration of SC-AI 500mg resulted in equivalent exposure to once every two weeks intravenous (IV) administration and similar clinical and biomarker benefits. Subcutaneous administration demonstrated a safety profile similar to IV administration, with less than 2% incidence of systemic injection/infusion-related reactions.

If approved, the SC-AI of 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) could be used to administer a once-weekly dose at home from the initiation of treatment, as an alternative to the current IV administration every two weeks dose in the hospital setting. The potential approval of SC-AI would expand the option for patients and care partners to receive LEQEMBI treatment at home. The injection time for each autoinjector (250mg injection) is approximately 15 seconds. The SC formulation also has the potential to reduce healthcare resources associated with IV dosing, such as preparation for infusion and nurse monitoring, while streamlining the overall AD treatment care pathway.

AD is a progressive, relentless disease with amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau as hallmarks that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* that begins before amyloid plaque accumulation and continues after plaque removal.1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both protofibrils and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

LEQEMBI is currently approved in 51 countries and regions and is under regulatory review in 9 countries.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

*Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.2
