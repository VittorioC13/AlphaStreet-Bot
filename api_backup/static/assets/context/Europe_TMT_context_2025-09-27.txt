[TITLE]Linktour's European Entry: A Strategic Bet on Premium Micro-Mobility:
[TEXT]
MUNICH, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the IAA Mobility 2025, Chinese EV newcomer Linktour Automotive made its European ambitions official. However, unlike many competitors focusing on volume segments, Linktour is executing a targeted strategy: entering the premium niche of the microcar market. For German financial observers, this raises a critical question—is there a viable business model for high-end, tech-infused city cars?

In an exclusive interview with OnVista, Zheng Lei, the vice general manager, clarified the rationale. "We see a significant gap that hasn't been fully addressed yet," he stated. "While existing options serve a basic need, many lack the elements that define modern urban life: style, personal expression, and smart technology." Linktour's approach is not to compete on price but to create "a new class of urban mobility," positioning its L6e and L7e models as emotionally engaging lifestyle products rather than mere utilities. This focus on margin over volume is a calculated risk in a segment traditionally driven by cost-consciousness.

The brand's potential differentiator lies in its industrial backbone. As part of the Shandong Weiqiao Pioneering Group, a Fortune Global 500 leader in aluminum production, Linktour possesses an inherent cost and engineering advantage. The use of an all-aluminum frame—a first for vehicles in this class—directly translates to weight reduction and efficiency gains, a tangible benefit of vertical integration. This material science edge is central to its value proposition.

Furthermore, Linktour is deploying advanced technology typically reserved for larger vehicles. The application of Cell-to-Body (CTB) technology in microcars is a strategic move explained by three pillars: "performance and safety," "efficiency," and "innovation." By integrating the battery into the vehicle's structure, Linktour enhances rigidity and safety while saving weight and space—a crucial advantage in a small vehicle. This technological ambition signals an intent to redefine segment standards and justify a premium positioning.

Regarding European operations, Linktour's strategy appears phased and pragmatic. When questioned

[TITLE]Tony Blair is a tech evangelist with a lot of power. Insiders are worried:
[TEXT]
Critics of Tony Blair’s TBI say that the think tank is part of a major influence operation that could culminate in US tech firms taking control of Britain’s most valuable data.

Tony Blair has rarely looked smaller. Seated alone on a vast Dubai stage in February with ranks of premiers and ministers filling the auditorium at the World Governments Summit, he sounded hoarse as he introduced his patron. Looming over him on a giant screen was Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, whose share price this month briefly made him the richest man in the world.

IBM shares went up more than 4% in New York after it announced its first experiment using quantum computers for bond trading with HSBC . The experiment helped improve predictions for bond orders in the European corporate bond market by up to 34%.The trial combined normal computers and IBM quantum computers to make quote requests better in over-the-counter markets, where buyers and sellers trade directly with each other. Philip Intallura from HSBC said, "We now have a tangible example of how quantum computers can solve a real-world problem and deliver a competitive advantage", as per the report by Market Screener.IBM explained that the project shows how business knowledge, algorithm research, and advanced quantum processors can work together. HSBC announced this is the world’s first proof that quantum computers can give real benefits in financial markets, according to the report by Benzinga.Corporate bond trading uses models to quickly price customer requests during competitive bidding. The quantum approach was better than normal computing at predicting quote prices. The trial used real trading data from European corporate bonds and ran on IBM’s quantum systems, including the Heron processor.By using quantum computing in models, the teams found hidden pricing signals that were buried in messy market data. HSBC said this shows quantum technology can make quote requests in over-the-counter bond markets faster and more accurately, giving trading advantages.HSBC stock has gone up more than 41% this year, much higher than the S&P 100’s 15% gain, and the bank beat revenue and earnings expectations for three quarters in a row. This experiment happened soon after the Technology Prosperity Deal between the US and UK, which focuses on AI, semiconductors, telecom, and quantum computing. Leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman were involved, as per the report by Benzinga.UK Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said technologies like AI and quantum computing will change people’s lives. At the last check, HSBC shares were down 0.99% to $69.20 in premarket trading on Thursday.IBM stock rose over 4% after its trial with HSBC showed quantum computers can improve bond trading predictions by up to 34%.HSBC and IBM used quantum computers to make bond trading more accurate and faster by predicting prices better in over-the-counter markets.

[TITLE]Interview with Milano Finanza:
[TEXT]
Interview with Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, conducted by Francesco Ninfole on 24 September 2025

The ECB launched an innovation platform with 70 partners to collaborate on the digital euro. What results has it produced and what will the next steps be?

Our innovation platform brought together universities, fintechs, start-ups, banks and retailers. The results have been very encouraging. Collaboration has shown that the digital euro can improve people’s daily lives and offer them new services. For example, we could make on-delivery payments online, or issue digital receipts that can make consumers’ lives easier when returning a product or activating the guarantee on a purchase. We will present the fruits of this research at Bocconi University tomorrow. We're just getting started. There are still myriad ideas to explore, and numerous companies, banks and research institutes have asked us to explore the innovation potential of the digital euro. We want to continue this dialogue with the market to promote the development of novel solutions. To that end, over the coming months we will organise a second round of collaboration with the private sector.

Many people are still unclear

[TITLE]What’s up with… Nscale, Nokia, TIP:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: UK-based AI infrastructure company Nscale has raised $1.1bn from the likes of Nvidia, Nokia and DT to fund its datacentre rollout; as a result, Nokia has become Nscale’s preferred network tech supplier; Vodafone’s Paco Pignatelli takes over from Caroline Chan as TIP’s president; and much more!

UK-based AI infrastructure firm Nscale has raised $1.1bn in what it describes as “the largest Series B in UK and European history”. The new funding will be used to advance Nscale’s deployment of AI infrastructure across Europe, North America and the Middle East, including the ‘AI factory datacentres for projects such as Stargate UK and Stargate Norway. The round was led by Norwegian investment giant Aker ASA and included participation from Sandton Capital, Blue Owl Managed Funds, Dell, Fidelity Management & Research Company, G Squared, Nokia, Nvidia, Point72 and T.Capital, which is Deutsche Telekom’s investment vehicle. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang highlighted his company’s intention to invest in Nscale earlier this month as part of the flurry of AI infrastructure investment activity that marked the ‘Tech Prosperity Deal’ between the US and UK, where Nscale is set to deploy up to 58,640 Nvidia GPUs across various projects with the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI.

One of the AI infrastructure specialist’s investors, Nokia, has become an “Nscale preferred partner for networking technologies from across its Network Infrastructure portfolio, for the build-out of AI clusters at scale… The partnership agreement will also see Nokia and Nscale jointly drive innovation in the networking stack used in AI clusters and partner globally on joint deployment initiatives,” noted Nokia in this announcement. Nokia CEO Justin Hotard stated: “Demand for the build-out of secure, scalable AI infrastructure in Europe and across the world continues to accelerate. Our partnership with Nscale combines Nokia’s expertise in IP and optical networking with Nscale’s leading infrastructure platform and enables the innovation needed for the future of AI infrastructure.” Nokia is banking on growing demand for its switching, IP and optical product lines from datacentre operators to fuel future sales growth. The vendor recently announced the formation of a new corporate unit, dubbed the Technology and AI Organization (TAO), and appointed former Intel AI and datacentre executive Pallavi Mahajan to lead it – see Nokia taps former Intel exec for new tech, AI role.

The Telecom Infra Project (TIP) has appointed Francisco ‘Paco’ Pignatelli, Vodafone Group’s head of Open RAN and a TIP board member, as its new president. Pignatelli takes on the role vacated earlier this month by Caroline Chan, who stepped down from her position as a TIP board member and as president following her departure from Intel. “Francisco has been a valued TIP board member, bringing deep expertise and passion for open and disaggregated networks,” noted TIP in this announcement on LinkedIn. “His leadership will help guide our community as we continue to accelerate innovation, scale deployments and shape the future of connectivity,” it added. With Chan, who was until last month general manager of telco AI and new technologies at Intel, stepping down, Cristina Rodriguez, general manager of Intel’s NEX (Network and Edge Group), which is being spun out as a separate business, has been appointed by Intel to join the TIP board. “Cristina’s experience and leadership in advancing communications technologies will be invaluable as TIP continues its mission to transform the future of global connectivity,” the industry body noted in a recent email newsletter.

Migrating the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) sectors from outdated analogue networks to digital infrastructure could result in a £3bn “net economic benefit” across five key sectors by 2040, according to a study by Assembly Research released by UK national operator BT Group. The telco noted that the research evaluated the costs, risks and potential gains from digital migration across energy, water, health (NHS), emergency services and local government, accounting for “the direct cost of upgrading, as well as the rising expense of maintaining legacy systems like the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the 2G mobile network – both decades old and increasingly challenging to support”. The migration to digital systems would also create greater efficiencies in critical sectors, according to the Assembly Research team – for example, preventing 100 unnecessary ambulance trips each day and saving over 600,000 NHS staff hours (comparable to the annual workload of 350 full-time employees). Matthew Howett, founder and CEO of Assembly Research, stated: “For the first time, we've lifted the lid on legacy network migration and worked to understand the scope and scale of how key UK industries are still relying on aging fixed and mobile networks. Our research found that while the energy and water sectors are already well into their migrations, it’s vital that others follow to avoid growing costs and missed efficiencies.” Jon James, CEO of BT Business, added: “This research sends a clear message: Delaying the shift to digital carries a real cost to public services, the environment and the wider economy. Legacy systems are becoming increasingly unreliable and the case for action is urgent. BT is committed to guiding the UK’s critical national infrastructure sectors through this upgrade with the resilience and support they need.”

San Francisco-based Distyl AI, which has developed a platform called Distillery that turns company processes into AI workflows, has raised $175m in its Series B funding round at a $1.8bn valuation. The investors in this round, which follows a $20m Series A round announced in November 2024, include Lightspeed Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, DST Global, Coatue and Dell Technologies Capital. “Distyl works with Fortune 500 leaders in healthcare, telecommunications, insurance, manufacturing and financial services to deliver measurable outcomes today while preparing them to re-architect their business models for the AI era,” according to the company.

China’s space infrastructure is “expanding rapidly, supported by commercial and private enterprises, as well as technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, quantum computing and 6G research,” according to ABI Research. The developments “are tightly integrated with China’s ambitious plans to deliver next-generation connectivity solutions,” added the research firm, which expects China’s serviceable addressable market (SAM) for satellite direct to cellular (D2C) subscription services “could reach 30 million users by 2030, driven by the launch of new major LEO networks”. According to ABI Research analyst Rachel Kong, there are “opportunities in China’s space sector across a wide range of areas, including domestic commercial expansion in private and state-backed constellations, business opportunities in downstream applications, multi-application communication networks, and partnerships in adjacent technology areas. These opportunities are strongly supported by government policies, which are a key driver in ramping up investments and funding for national initiatives. Examples include the Space Silk Road Initiative, the New Infrastructure Policy, and the Space-Ground Integrated Information Network Plan. Currently, two mega constellations, Spacesail and Guowang, are launching satellites with the aim of building networks that could potentially include tens of thousands of satellites,” she added. ABI Research expects the number of active satellites put into orbit by Chinese companies to increase from more than 17,000 in 2025 to over 48,000 by 2032.

Cisco Systems has unveiled a Sovereign Critical Infrastructure portfolio for European companies that are looking for “more control and autonomy over their digital infrastructure and data,” the vendor announced. The new portfolio, which comprises Cisco’s “core product lines, from routing, switching and wireless, to collaboration, and select endpoint devices, enhanced by Cisco and Splunk security and observability solutions”, can be operated by customers “in their own air-gapped, ‘on-prem’ physical environments,” noted the vendor.

[TITLE]What’s up with… SIM farms, Optus, AI in Europe:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: A cloud is hanging over Australian telco Optus following a service outage that led to multiple deaths and the unveiling of dodgy sales tactics; the US Secret Service has uncovered a massive SIM farm that had the potential to disrupt the UN general assembly; eight major European telcos join forces to lobby the region’s lawmakers for lighter regulation; and much more!

Headlines have been dominated by US President Donald Trump’s antics at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly this week as the world body celebrated its 80th anniversary. Amid the reporting on his speech lambasting the UN and European leaders, the US Secret Service announced it had uncovered a network of devices with the potential to cripple cell towers and even eavesdrop on world leaders as they gathered in Manhattan, a revelation that resulted in multiple US media reports. According to the Secret Service, it dismantled a “network of electronic devices located throughout the New York tristate area that were used to conduct multiple telecommunications-related threats directed towards senior US government officials, which represented an imminent threat to the agency’s protective operations”. More than 300 co-located SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards were discovered across multiple sites. Notably, the devices were concentrated within a 35-mile radius of the UN General Assembly. In the release, US Secret Service director Sean Curran indicated that the network of devices had strong potential to disrupt telecom networks. “The US Secret Service’s protective mission is all

[TITLE]TV networks are more vulnerable to political pressure than ever before:
[TEXT]
“Is there any way we can screw him?” asked President Richard M. Nixon.

“We’ve been trying to,” an aide replied, alluding to the White House’s efforts to remove from the airwaves an ABC talk show host whose critiques of the administration had placed that “son of a b—h” on the chief executive’s enemies list.

Over 50 years ago, Nixon and his team sought to use the full weight of the federal government – with calls to network executives, Federal Communications Commission complaints, IRS audits and FBI investigations – to silence “The Dick Cavett Show.”

Cavett, who seemed to personify the liberalism that Nixon despised, had drawn the president’s ire by platforming anti-war activists like John Kerry and Jane Fonda, along with left-wing radicals such as Stokely Carmichael.

Nixon ultimately failed in his attempt to silence Cavett. ABC executives were committed to independent media, while the broadcasting industry as a whole had garnered the attention and trust of an enormous audience, which insulated them from political pressure.

It’s a sharp contrast to President Donald Trump’s second term, during which he has loudly announced his desire to rid the nation’s televisions of his critics, and is making headway in doing so. In July 2025, CBS announced the cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s late night show. While the network maintained this was “purely a financial decision” based on ratings, it came in the wake of Colbert mocking both the president and the network.

“I hear Kimmel is next,” Trump crowed in the days after. Lo and behold, ABC briefly suspended Jimmy Kimmel on Sept. 17 over comments the comedian made

[TITLE]Why the EU has no choice but to respond to Donald Trump’s bullying on tech regulation with a coercion investigation:
[TEXT]
Back in November 2023 – a time when it wasn’t even clear that Donald Trump would be allowed to run in the upcoming presidential primaries – the European Union approved a tough new “anti-coercion instrument”.

This stated: “Economic coercion exists where a non-EU country applies or threatens to apply a measure affecting trade or investment in order to prevent or obtain the cessation, modification or adoption of a particular act by the EU or a Member State, thereby interfering in the legitimate sovereign choices of the EU or a Member State”.

At the time, the threats were all coming from Russia, which stood accused of interfering in election campaigns, and undermining trust in liberal democracy.

Yet that regulation now seems a perfect fit for the US under a president who is threatening “substantial additional tariffs” against countries he deems to be imposing unfair laws against tech companies. Europe, where those digital regulations were literally invented, is now the clear target of Trump’s ire. Although I would argue that the EU’s approach to regulating in this area has some serious problems, it should not risk bowing to US pressure. The union would lose credibility if it showed that it does not believe in its own rules.

In just eight years, European institutions have approved ten laws in the digital space. The legislation spans 591 articles and covers 1,091 pages. This would have been a monumental effort, with each regulation stemming from the work of potentially hundreds of lawyers, experts and policymakers. That’s even before the EU’s three different institutions (commission, parliament, and council) all had their say.

The problem, though, is that the more articles you have regulating interconnected activities, the more likely you are to find contradictions among them. Paradoxically, the firms that may be more damaged by the necessity to comply tend to be European start-ups, which are generally too small to afford the fees needed to pay lawyers who can help them make sense of such complex legislation.

Added to this is the fact that the phenomena we are trying to govern is extremely radical and unprecedented (especially large language model artificial intelligence). We therefore don’t yet know what the impact of digital change will be and whether the regulations in place are the right ones. Indeed, it’s almost inevitable that such detailed regulation contains what will eventually turn out to be mistakes as circumstances change.

But while EU digital regulation is far from perfect, the bloc cannot allow a third party to bully its way to changing the rules. EU regulation is suboptimal but it is not targeting “incredible American tech companies”, as Trump suggests.

True, elements of the Digital Service Act only apply to “very large platforms” (with over 45 million users in the EU), but while the majority of the 19 giants meeting this threshold are American, the list also includes three Chinese, one Canadian and three European companies.

In fact, some of the comments made by the US president arguably meet the description of actions that the Anti-Coercion Instrument is designed to sanction.

Fighting fire with fire

Trump has put in the bluntest terms that “digital taxes, legislation, rules or regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American technology”. He has said: “unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs”. This is “threatening a measure affecting trade or in order to obtain the cessation of a particular act by the Union”. Not to open a case to investigate the US on these points would send a dangerous message that competitors (or former allies) can meddle in European sovereign affairs.

Alamy/Pictorial Press

The activation of countermeasures would require a qualified majority at the European Council which would not be impossible to reach: 55% of the member states (15 out of 27 would be enough) representing 65% of the population (the sum of Germany and France is one third of the total). In any case, even if a qualified majority is not reached, the exercise is still worthwhile. It would be helpful to know which member states are still serious about being part of a (sovereign) union and which of them would rather go for a union “à la carte”. This latter option is not, logically, good enough for times that require the EU to react quickly to crises.

Trump has taken a similar approach to the EU’s renewable energy policy, calling for member states to dismantle their wind turbines.

The times in which we are living will soon force Europe into a make or break decision. This is what Mario Draghi, former Italian prime minister and author of the report currently guiding the EU’s competitiveness, hinted saying recently when he said: “we have been reminded, painfully, that inaction threatens not only our competitiveness but our sovereignty”. Europe cannot afford to give the impression that it has lost faith in its ability to be free.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Berlin's digital elite packed into the Welt AI Summit on Thursday for a glimpse of Sam Altman. They got something else, too: a full-throated gospel from Federal Minister Karsten Wildberger, calling for fewer shackles on Germany's tech scene.

"We have to start to open up the gates and allow our companies to innovate much, much faster," Wildberger said minutes after Altman's exit. He made the comments in a packed room at the headquarters of Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company.

Wildberger isn't a career politician, but a former tech executive. In May, he was sworn in as Germany's first-ever federal minister for digital transformation and government modernization, heading a new group that seeks to cut red tape.

It was not too long ago that Elon Musk staked a similar post in the Trump administration. Wildberger is Germany's slightly more tactful version. As Axel Springer journalist Tatjana Ohm noted in her intro, he once said, "I'm not the one with the chainsaw but with a toolbox."

Wildberger cast himself as a regulatory pragmatist, railing against what he sees as Europe's habit of legislating AI to death before it has even taken root.

In 2021, the European Union unveiled the AI Act, a risk-based rulebook meant to safeguard its citizens' rights and safety — banning practices like social-scoring, strictly policing "high-risk" uses in health, policing, or hiring, and demanding transparency from everything else.

The intent was to make Europe the first bloc with comprehensive guardrails for AI. In Wildberger's view, the effect has been the opposite: startups saddled with costs and paperwork while the real innovation migrates abroad.

"You should regulate when you have a market, when you have products," Wildberger told the room, warning that otherwise "companies develop elsewhere, and the products come to us."

At Welt's AI Summit, Wildberger tried to jolt the country out of its self-pity and into a future of looser rules and faster growth. He pointed to the country's density of universities, research institutes, and industrial giants that breed technical talent.

He brushed aside the familiar refrain that Germany has already missed the boat, insisting the country still has the resources and time to matter in artificial intelligence.

"We know we have challenges on investment, on financing, on how to scale things," Wildberger said, "but we need to enter the race."

Wilberger admitted that competing on the foundation models is a long shot. He tried to redirect the ambition toward what you do with them. Germany, he suggested, should focus on building products and services on top of base models and then get those systems into wide use.

The minister's address ended with a pep talk. He called for optimism in Germany.

"My final hope," he said, "is that this country that has so much more potential finds a way to talk differently about itself." From where he sits, Germans don't give themselves enough credit.

"If you always start from the negative when you get out of bed in the morning," he said, "it's going to be a tough day. I just hope that as part of the process, we rediscover the faith, the belief in the strength of what this country is capable of."

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang highlighted his company’s intention to invest in Nscale earlier this month as part of the flurry of AI infrastructure investment activity that marked the ‘Tech Prosperity Deal’ between the US and UK, where Nscale is set to deploy up to 58,640 Nvidia GPUs across various projects with the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI.

One of the AI infrastructure specialist’s investors, Nokia, has become an “Nscale preferred partner for networking technologies from across its Network Infrastructure portfolio, for the build-out of AI clusters at scale… The partnership agreement will also see Nokia and Nscale jointly drive innovation in the networking stack used in AI clusters and partner globally on joint deployment initiatives,” noted Nokia in this announcement. Nokia CEO Justin Hotard stated: “Demand for the build-out of secure, scalable AI infrastructure in Europe and across the world continues to accelerate. Our partnership with Nscale combines Nokia’s expertise in IP and optical networking with Nscale’s leading infrastructure platform and enables the innovation needed for the future of AI infrastructure.” Nokia is banking on growing demand for its switching, IP and optical product lines from datacentre operators to fuel future sales growth. The vendor recently announced the formation of a new corporate unit, dubbed the Technology and AI Organization (TAO), and appointed former Intel AI and datacentre executive Pallavi Mahajan to lead it – see Nokia taps former Intel exec for new tech, AI role.

The Telecom Infra Project (TIP) has appointed Francisco ‘Paco’ Pignatelli, Vodafone Group’s head of Open RAN and a TIP board member, as its new president. Pignatelli takes on the role vacated earlier this month by Caroline Chan, who stepped down from her position as a TIP board member and as president following her departure from Intel. “Francisco has been a valued TIP board member, bringing deep expertise and passion for open and disaggregated networks,” noted TIP in this announcement on LinkedIn. “His leadership will help guide our community as we continue to accelerate innovation, scale deployments and shape the future of connectivity,” it added. With Chan, who was until last month general manager of telco AI and new technologies at Intel, stepping down, Cristina Rodriguez, general manager of Intel’s NEX (Network and Edge Group), which is being spun out as a separate business, has been appointed by Intel to join the TIP board. “Cristina’s experience and leadership in advancing communications technologies will be invaluable as TIP continues its mission to transform the future of global connectivity,” the industry body noted in a recent email newsletter.

Migrating the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) sectors from outdated analogue networks to digital infrastructure could result in a £3bn “net economic benefit” across five key sectors by 2040, according to a study by Assembly Research released by UK national operator BT Group. The telco noted that the research evaluated the costs, risks and potential gains from digital migration across energy, water, health (NHS), emergency services and local government, accounting for “the direct cost of upgrading, as well as the rising expense of maintaining legacy systems like the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the 2G mobile network – both decades old and increasingly challenging to support”. The migration to digital systems would also create greater efficiencies in critical sectors, according to the Assembly Research team – for example, preventing 100 unnecessary ambulance trips each day and saving over 600,000 NHS staff hours (comparable to the annual workload of 350 full-time employees). Matthew Howett, founder and CEO of Assembly Research, stated: “For the first time, we've lifted the lid on legacy network migration and worked to understand the scope and scale of how key UK industries are still relying on aging fixed and mobile networks. Our research found that while the energy and water sectors are already well into their migrations, it’s vital that others follow to avoid growing costs and missed efficiencies.” Jon James, CEO of BT Business, added: “This research sends a clear message: Delaying the shift to digital carries a real cost to public services, the environment and the wider economy. Legacy systems are becoming increasingly unreliable and the case for action is urgent. BT is committed to guiding the UK’s critical national infrastructure sectors through this upgrade with the resilience and support they need.”

San Francisco-based Distyl AI, which has developed a platform called Distillery that turns company processes into AI workflows, has raised $175m in its Series B funding round at a $1.8bn valuation. The investors in this round, which follows a $20m Series A round announced in November 2024, include Lightspeed Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, DST Global, Coatue and Dell Technologies Capital. “Distyl works with Fortune 500 leaders in healthcare, telecommunications, insurance, manufacturing and financial services to deliver measurable outcomes today while preparing them to re-architect their business models for the AI era,” according to the company.

China’s space infrastructure is “expanding rapidly, supported by commercial and private enterprises, as well as technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, quantum computing and 6G research,” according to ABI Research. The developments “are tightly integrated with China’s ambitious plans to deliver next-generation connectivity solutions,” added the research firm, which expects China’s serviceable addressable market (SAM) for satellite direct to cellular (D2C) subscription services “could reach 30 million users by 2030, driven by the launch of new major LEO networks”. According to ABI Research analyst Rachel Kong, there are “opportunities in China’s space sector across a wide range of areas, including domestic commercial expansion in private and state-backed constellations, business opportunities in downstream applications, multi-application communication networks, and partnerships in adjacent technology areas. These opportunities are strongly supported by government policies, which are a key driver in ramping up investments and funding for national initiatives. Examples include the Space Silk Road Initiative, the New Infrastructure Policy, and the Space-Ground Integrated Information Network Plan. Currently, two mega constellations, Spacesail and Guowang, are launching satellites with the aim of building networks that could potentially include tens of thousands of satellites,” she added. ABI Research expects the number of active satellites put into orbit by Chinese companies to increase from more than 17,000 in 2025 to over 48,000 by 2032.

Cisco Systems has unveiled a Sovereign Critical Infrastructure portfolio for European companies that are looking for “more control and autonomy over their digital infrastructure and data,” the vendor announced. The new portfolio, which comprises Cisco’s “core product lines, from routing, switching and wireless, to collaboration, and select endpoint devices, enhanced by Cisco and Splunk security and observability solutions”, can be operated by customers “in their own air-gapped, ‘on-prem’ physical environments,” noted the vendor.
