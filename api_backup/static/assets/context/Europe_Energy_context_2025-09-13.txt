[TITLE]Hungary Ditches Moscow? Shell Grabs 10-Year Gas Deal in Surprise EU Energy Shake-Up:
[TEXT]
This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

In a subtle but strategic pivot, Hungary has inked a 10-year gas supply agreement with Shell (NYSE:SHEL), locking in 2 billion cubic meters of LNG starting in 2026. The dealannounced by Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto during the Gastech summit in Milancomes as the European Union barrels toward its self-imposed 2027 cutoff for Russian fossil fuel imports. For Shell, it's a win in the slow-moving realignment of European energy flows. For Hungary, it's an opening salvoone that could gradually rebalance its exposure to Moscow.

Budapest still holds firm ties to Russia's Gazprom, with a contract for 4.5 bcm per year running until 2036. That deal has been topped up since 2022, underscoring Hungary's energy pragmatism. But Szijjarto hinted that more Western supply deals could be coming, pending final terms. He also made no secret of Hungary's frustration with the EU's one-size-fits-all approach, arguing that the bloc's energy transition plan ignores Hungary's limited pipeline access to non-Russian flows. In short: this Shell deal may not be a full divorce from Gazprombut it's not business as usual either.

The longer arc may bend nuclear. Hungary is pushing ahead with plans to double its atomic energy output, banking on two new reactors to slash gas imports by half and meet 70% of national power demand internally. Szijjarto believes the first grid connections could come in the early 2030s. If that timeline holds, Hungary's energy math could look very different by mid-decadewith Shell as a key transitional player and Gazprom gradually stepping back from center stage.

[TITLE]NATO to beef up defence of Europe's eastern flank after Poland shot down drones:
[TEXT]
BRUSSELS/WARSAW/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - NATO announced plans to beef up the defence of Europe's eastern flank on Friday, two days after Poland shot down drones that had violated its airspace in the first known action of its kind by a member of the Western alliance during Russia's war in Ukraine.

At the United Nations, the United States called the airspace violations "alarming" and vowed to "defend every inch of NATO territory," remarks that appeared aimed at assuaging Washington's NATO allies afterPresident Donald Trump said Russia's drone incursion could have been a mistake.

Warsaw has portrayed the drone incursions as an attempt by Russia to test the capabilities of Poland and NATO to respond.

On Friday, Poland rejected Trump's suggestion that the incursions could have been a mistake, a rare contradiction of the U.S. president from one of Washington's closest European allies. Its foreign minister told Reuters Poland hoped Washington will take action to show solidarity with Warsaw.

Later on Friday, the U.S. joined Western allies in a statement to express concern

US' reported attempt to pressure G7 countries to hit China, India with tariffs over Russian oil shows its hegemony, will backfire: expert

Global Times

By Global Times Published: Sep 12, 2025 11:59 AM

The US reportedly will pressure the G7 to impose steep tariffs on China and India over their purchases of Russian oil, a move that a Chinese expert described as another attempt by Washington to use tariffs as a tool of hegemony.

The expert warned that this would not only further disrupt global trade but also strain relations with US allies and major trading partners such as China and India.

The US will pressure G7 countries to hit India and China with sharply higher tariffs for buying Russian oil in an attempt to force Moscow into peace talks with Ukraine, Financial Times reported on Friday, citing four unnamed people briefed on the plans.

In a video call on Friday, finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading economies will discuss a US proposal for a round of new measures as the US President Donald Trump steps up efforts to broker a peace deal in Ukraine, according to the report.

A US Treasury department spokesperson declined to state a figure for the planned tariffs but people familiar with the situation said the US had proposed levels of between 50 and 100 percent, the Financial Times reported.

This latest move came right after the US president this week urged the EU to impose up to 100 percent tariffs on China and India, but is now expanding the push to include G7 allies, according to the report.

The US is not able to win its-provoked tariff war and is therefore working to bind Europe and other allies to its strategic orbit, Bao Jianyun, dean and professor of the Department of International Politics at the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Friday.

However, before the Russia-Ukraine conflict, EU-Russia trade far exceeded that of the US, and Europe was already paying a much higher price than the US, Bao said.

According to data from Eurostat, in 2021, the bilateral trade volume between the EU and Russia reached 257.5 billion euros (around $302 billion).

While overall trade between the US and Russia in two-way goods totaled $36.1 billion in 2021, it remained far below EU-Russia trade levels, according to media reports.

He noted that if Europe spoils its trade ties with China and India, the consequences could be unbearable.

Bao further warned that the US's one-sided demand for its allies to impose high tariffs on others would not only intensify tensions between the US and its allies but also risk further disruption to global supply chains already affected by existing US tariffs.

Should the corresponding countermeasures take effect, the global trade landscape could change dramatically: the US's dominance would decline significantly, and its alliance system would gradually fragment and realign, the expert said.

Responding to a media inquiry about reports that the US president told European officials personally that he's willing to impose sweeping new tariffs on India and China to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table with Ukraine — but only if EU nations do so as well, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press conference on Wednesday that "China's position on the Ukraine crisis is objective and just. China did not create the crisis, nor is China a party to it."

We oppose making an issue of China or imposing so-called "economic pressure" on us, Lin said.

Previous, responding to media inquiry for comment that US Treasury Secretary warned that if China continues to buy Russian oil, China may face higher tariffs, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Guo Jiakun also said that China will take energy supply measures that are right for China based on our national interests.

"Tariff wars have no winners. Coercion and pressuring cannot solve problems. China will firmly safeguard its own sovereignty, security and development interests," Guo said.

[TITLE]EU wins Trump's focus on China, but can it deliver on 'impossible' demand?:
[TEXT]
For almost a year, European Union officials have been dangling the carrot of joint work on China policy in front of US President Donald Trump in an effort to keep him engaged in supporting Ukraine.

For months, their overtures were ignored. Now that the US leader has tuned in - but only on the condition of maximum tariffs - Europe finds itself in a bind.

On Wednesday evening, ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states were briefed by the bloc's sanctions envoy, David O'Sullivan, on his trip to Washington this week, according to three diplomatic sources.

[TITLE]Small Modular Reactors (SMR) Market Strategies, Market Forecasts Report 2025-2050 | High-Density Energy Solutions Complementing Solar and Wind for Sustainable Power Strategies:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Small Modular Reactors (SMR): Market Strategies, Market Forecasts 2025 to 2050" report from Wintergreen Research, Inc has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The study is designed to give a comprehensive overview of the Small Modular Reactor SMR market. Research represents a selection from the mountains of interview data available of the most relevant and cogent market materials, with selections made by the most senior analysts. Commentaries on every aspect of the market from independent analysts create an independent perspective in the evaluation of the market. In this manner, the study presents a comprehensive overview of what is going on in this market, assisting managers with designing market strategies likely to succeed.

Advanced nuclear technologies like the BWRX-300. a key pillar of GEH's energy transition, position companies for an energy leadership position. In addition to helping customers achieve decarbonization goals, the BWRX-300 is designed to reduce construction and operating. SMRs provide significant energy density. Value includes the ability to solve energy needs by combining SMR generated electricity with solar and wind electricity generation. Renewable energy does better when complimented with an energy dense solution.

In the world market of power-producing nuclear reactors, there is a move to embrace small modular reactors (SMRs). These can be assembled infactory, transported by ship or train, installed on site. SMRs can be connected to the electricity grid in a short time, significantly reducing the financial burden of the investment.

SMR nuclear energy equipment markets leverage compelling new technology for reactors and fuel greatly enhancing safety over what has been available for reactors.

Sodium-cooled fast reactors are in operation in Russia. In the US, Bill Gates leads TerraPower which is planning a sodium-cooled fast reactor along with molten salt energy storage. A TerraPower partnership with GE Hitachi's PRISM is evolving an integral fast reactor design, under the Natrium project. Bill Gates TerraPower and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy have brought together decades of design expertise and technical capabilities to develop the NatriumT technology, which features a cost-competitive sodium fast reactor combined with a molten salt energy storage system.

The ability to implement the moving assembly line in the SMR manufacturing process means the assembly for the reactor can be far less costly than building a reactor by hand. The TerraPower Natrium technology is one of the fastest and lowest-cost paths to provide world-changing, advanced clean energy.

Key Factors Driving Next Generation Nuclear SMR Market:

The need to replace fossil fuels

SMRs implement safe nuclear power.

Clean energy technology

Stable energy supply - More stable than solar, wind

Manufactured in a factory

Replace coal and fossil fuels

Address energy needs worldwide

Meet the demands of the economy - Economies of scale promise to make SMRs the least expensive energy.

[TITLE]Energy Secretary Wright slams Net Zero, calls it a “colossal train wreck” – NaturalNews.com:
[TEXT]
Energy Secretary Wright slams Net Zero, calls it a “colossal train wreck”

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright warns Europe's 2050 net-zero push is a "colossal train wreck" and a "monstrous impoverishment program," destabilizing economies, spiking energy prices and weakening security.

After Biden's alignment, the U.S. reversed course, exiting the Paris Agreement. ExxonMobils' CEO warns EU regulations impose "bone-crushing penalties," forcing U.S. firms to leave.

Europe's wind/solar obsession leads to shortages, proving unreliable energy. EV mandates strain grids without solving the core issue: where will stable power come from?

Once focused on stability, the IEA now pushes false "peak oil" claims. Wright threatens to cut U.S. funding unless it returns to objective analysis.

Europe cutting Russian gas worsened its crisis. Nations prioritizing reliable energy (like the U.S.) will dominate, while Europe's climate fanaticism fuels deindustrialization and poverty.

As Europe pushes forward with aggressive climate policies aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has issued a stark warning. The pursuit of these targets is not only unrealistic but actively harmful to economic stability, energy security and international trade.

"Net Zero 2050 is just a colossal train wreck," he told the Financial Times. Wright dismissed the net-zero agenda as a "monstrous human impoverishment program" that will inevitably collapse under its own weight. His remarks signal a growing transatlantic divide on energy policy, with the U.S. now openly rejecting Europe's climate-driven regulations as a threat to global prosperity.

Wright, a former oil and gas executive appointed under the second Trump administration, has been vocal in his criticism of climate alarmism. He argues that Europe's fixation on reducing carbon emissions has already led to soaring energy prices, deindustrialization and weakened energy security — problems that will only worsen if Brussels continues down its current path. (Related: US Department of Energy publishes scathing report tackling climate change alarmism and the Net Zero agenda.)

His concerns are not unfounded. The European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, set to take effect in January 2026, will impose levies on imports based on their carbon footprint – effectively penalizing U.S. energy exports. Similarly, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive threatens American companies with heavy compliance burdens and legal risks if they fail to meet stringent environmental and human rights standards.

The Biden administration had initially aligned with Europe's climate ambitions, rejoining the Paris Agreement and endorsing net-zero targets. However, under U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed leadership, the U.S. has reversed course, withdrawing from the Paris accord once more and openly challenging the feasibility of decarbonization.

Wright's latest comments underscore this shift, warning that the EU's climate policies could derail a major U.S.-EU trade deal designed to bolster energy security by replacing Russian fossil fuels with American exports. "If Europe doesn't hold up its end of the deal, the whole trade talks could fall apart," Wright said.

ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods echoed these concerns. He described EU regulations as "bone-crushing penalties" that could force American companies to abandon the European market altogether.

From energy security to climate alarmism

Beyond trade tensions, Wright's critique exposes a fundamental flaw in the green energy transition. Renewable energy relies on intermittent power sources like wind and solar, which cannot match the reliability of fossil fuels. Europe's rush to phase out natural gas – one of the cleanest hydrocarbons – has left it vulnerable to energy shortages, particularly during extreme weather events.

Brighteon.AI's Enoch engine recounts that the continent "began pivoting to renewable energy in the early 2000s, with Denmark, Germany and Spain leading the charge by heavily investing in wind and solar power to meet Kyoto Protocol targets. The British government, initially hesitant, later recognized wind power as essential for compliance."

Meanwhile, the push for electric vehicles has strained power grids without addressing the underlying issue: Where will the electricity come from? In the U.S., natural gas remains the dominant source, accounting for nearly 40 percent of power generation. Without it, blackouts would become inevitable.

The International Energy Agency (IEA), once a neutral arbiter of energy policy, has also come under fire for abandoning its original mandate of ensuring stable energy supplies in favor of promoting renewables. Wright has threatened to withdraw U.S. funding from the IEA unless it reforms, accusing the agency of pushing "total nonsense" predictions, such as the claim that global oil demand will peak this decade.

The stakes are high. Europe's energy crisis, exacerbated by its reliance on Russian gas, has already triggered economic pain and political backlash. Wright warns that if the EU continues down this path, it risks not only impoverishing its citizens – but also ceding global influence to nations that prioritize energy affordability over climate dogma.

Wright concluded his interview by lamenting that Europe's shrinking role in the global scene is "heartbreaking to see." But as the debate intensifies, one thing is clear. The net-zero agenda is facing its most serious challenge yet.

[TITLE]Green public procurement has great potential:
[TEXT]
In India’s race to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, the spotlight has largely been on renewable energy expansion, carbon markets, and industrial decarbonisation. These are essential, but an equally potent climate lever lies hidden in plain sight: public procurement.

Accounting for nearly 22 per cent of India’s GDP (

[TITLE]Bord Gáis, Pinergy to increase electricity prices:
[TEXT]
Bord Gáis Energy and Pinergy have announced price increases for residential electricity customers from next month.

The increase announced by Bord Gáis will see a 13.5% hike on standard unit rates while their standing charges will increase by 12% from 12 October.

This will increase a typical bill for Bord Gáis Energy electricity customers by an average of €18.16 per month, or €218 per year.

Pinergy, meanwhile, confirmed that its price change will result in a 9.83% increase to typical household costs from 13 October, equivalent to €199 annually based on a domestic customer using typical consumption.

There is no change to Pinergy's standing charge.

Bord Gáis Energy said the rise in electricity charges was in response to continued increases in network costs, the impact of wholesale energy markets and the higher cost of doing business. It added that it was its first price hike in three years.

Bord Gáis Energy has 369,000 domestic electricity customers.

Prices for its 270,000 gas customers remain unchanged, the company added.

Director of Customer and Commercial at Bord Gáis Energy Catherine Lonergan said this was the company's first price increase in three years, adding that in that time it had two price reductions across gas and electricity.

"We also absorbed network charges in 2024 saving households an average of €100 in electricity and €75 in gas," she said.

"Due to continued increases in network charges, the higher cost of doing business and the impact of wholesale energy market pricing, we're regrettably announcing a price increase for electricity customers," she said.

Watch: Energy prices 'being pushed close to peak of energy crisis', says Daragh Cassidy of Bonkers.ie

"However, I can confirm that there is no change to gas prices for our 270,000 gas customers and that our gas standing charge remains the lowest in the market."

She said that Bord Gáis Energy will continue to compete strongly in the Irish energy market and pass on savings whenever possible.

Pinergy's CEO Enda Gunnell, said it is their "first increase after three price decreases that we made over 2023 and into 2024".

Mr Gunnell said Pinergy absorbed increased network charges approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities last year.

"The planned investment in the electricity grid and infrastructure is urgently required but we would call on the exchequer to also play its role in ensuring much needed price stability and minimising the financial burden on consumers," he said.

Earlier this week, Electric Ireland said it would decrease gas prices for 140,000 customers by 4% from the beginning of November, while there will be no increase for the company's 1.1 million electricity customers ahead of the winter.

Energia recently said it would increase its electricity prices by up to 12.1% from 9 October, which will add more than €200 onto the annual bills of many customers.

Last month Flogas hiked its prices by an average of 7%.

Reacting to the latest energy price hikes, the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said: "Here we go again!"

"Another big energy bill hike on the way while Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael prepare to withdraw energy credits from households in the Budget," she said.

"It's a terrible decision. This rip-off must be brought to an end. Workers and families must be supported in the Budget."
