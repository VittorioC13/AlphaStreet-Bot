[TITLE]Pelthos Therapeutics Acquires Xepi® (ozenoxacin) Cream, 1% and Announces $18 Million Private Convertible Notes Financing:
[TEXT]
Acquisition adds complementary dermatology product to the Pelthos portfolio anchored by ZELSUVMI™

Xepi is a novel FDA-approved topical treatment for impetigo that addresses a critical unmet need in antibiotic-resistant skin infections caused by staph and strep infections, most commonly affecting children

Impetigo affects approximately 3 million people in the U.S. every year and is among the most common bacterial skin infections seen in pediatric offices

Private convertible notes financing will support the acquisition and re-launch of Xepi, accelerate the commercialization of ZELSUVMI for molluscum contagiosum, and for general working capital purposes

DURHAM, N.C., Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pelthos Therapeutics Inc. (NYSE American: PTHS), a biopharmaceutical company committed to commercializing innovative therapeutic products for unmet patient needs (“Pelthos”), today announced it has acquired the U.S. commercialization rights to Xepi® (ozenoxacin) Cream, 1%, from Biofrontera Inc. and Ferrer Internacional S.A. (the “Acquisition”). Xepi is a non-fluorinated quinolone antimicrobial indicated for the topical treatment of impetigo due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes in adult and pediatric patients two months of age and older.

The Company has also closed on an $18 million private convertible notes financing (the “Notes”) with existing investors, including Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: LGND) and a group of investors led by Murchinson Ltd (the “Investors”).

Xepi Acquisition

Under the terms of the Acquisition agreement, Pelthos will pay Biofrontera $3.0 million and Ferrer $1.2 million upfront, with additional payments based on the availability of commercial quantities of Xepi and the achievement of sales-based milestones. Pelthos will pay royalties on U.S. net sales of Xepi to Ferrer and the Investors.

“This acquisition represents an excellent investment opportunity and marks an exciting new chapter in the Pelthos growth story,” said Scott Plesha, CEO of Pelthos. “Xepi is well-positioned to address antimicrobial resistance in pediatric dermatology, and we believe it will provide physicians with an important alternative to first-line impetigo treatments. Offering another novel product to the pediatric and dermatology communities creates an increasingly favorable opportunity for Pelthos as it allows us to leverage our current commercial infrastructure to promote multiple innovative brands.”

Xepi was developed by Ferrer and Medimetriks Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and approved by the FDA in 2017. At the time of approval, Xepi was the first new novel treatment for impetigo in more than 10 years. Biofrontera has owned the U.S. rights to Xepi since 2019 but has not been actively promoting the product. Pelthos intends to re-launch Xepi in late 2026.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). It affects approximately 3 million people in the U.S. every year and is most common in children ages 2 to 5.1,2 Impetigo is among the most common bacterial skin infections seen in pediatric offices and spreads easily within families, in crowded settings, such as schools and childcare facilities.

“As bacterial resistance continues to rise, particularly to commonly used topical antibiotics like mupirocin, the need for effective alternatives in treating impetigo has never been greater,” said Lawrence A. Schachner, MD, Chair and Professor Emeritus at the University of Miami Department of Dermatology. “Xepi is one of the few treatment options for children that can act against both methicillin-resistant and mupirocin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We believe it is a significant therapeutic advancement for clinicians and patients facing infections that no longer respond to traditional therapies.”

Private Convertible Notes Financing

Pelthos has also closed on an $18 million convertible notes financing with the Investors. The Notes will be secured obligations of Pelthos and will bear interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. The Notes will mature on November 6, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted into shares of Pelthos common stock in accordance with their terms. The Notes will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $34.442, representing the price that is the lower of (i) the Official Closing Price immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement or (ii) the average Official Closing Price for the five trading days immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement. The Company anticipates that the proceeds of the financing will be used to acquire and relaunch Xepi, accelerate the commercialization of ZELSUVMI, and for general working capital purposes.

In addition to the Notes, the Investors will be entitled to a low single-digit royalty on U.S. net sales of Xepi and additional milestone payments and royalties on ZELSUVMI net sales in Japan, if ZELSUVMI is approved in Japan.

“The convertible notes transaction demonstrates the ongoing confidence of our existing investors. The additional capital from this transaction allows us to add a complementary product to our portfolio, strengthens our balance sheet, and will help support the commercial growth of ZELSUVMI, our novel medicine for molluscum contagiosum,” said Frank Knuettel II, CFO of Pelthos.

Sullivan & Worcester LLP and Paul Hastings LLP served as legal counsel to Pelthos. Piper Sandler and Lake Street Capital Markets LLC served as financial advisors to Pelthos on the Notes financing, and Roth Capital Partners, LLC advised Pelthos on the Xepi acquisition. Latham & Watkins LLP served as lead counsel to Ligand. Kelley Drye & Warren LLP and Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP represented the group of investors led by Murchinson Ltd.

The offer and sale of the Notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have not been, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and until so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws.

PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANIP) (ANI or the Company) today announced financial results and business highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

“ANI had another strong quarter in which we delivered record revenue and adjusted EBITDA, underscoring the strength of our Rare Disease and Generics business units,” said Nikhil Lalwani, President and CEO of ANI. “Our Rare Disease team delivered exceptional growth for our lead asset Cortrophin Gel and we now expect net revenues for our Rare Disease business to represent essentially half of total Company net revenues for 2025. We continue to believe in the strong multi-year growth potential of Cortrophin, and are driving this growth through strong commercial execution, investment in evidence generation to support its use and initiatives to enhance patient convenience.”

Mr. Lalwani continued, “Based on our strong third quarter performance, we are again raising our top- and bottom-line 2025 financial guidance. We now expect to grow total net revenue 39% to 42% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA 42% to 46% year-over-year. As we close out 2025 and head into 2026, we remain focused on advancing our strategic priority of growing our Rare Disease business to drive long-term value for our shareholders and reach more patients in need.”

(1) NIU-PS indication was merged into the ILUVIEN label in mid-2025; full year guidance includes YUTIQ revenue

Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights:

Rare Disease

Cortrophin Gel: Cortrophin Gel net revenues were $101.9 million for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 93.8% over the same period in 2024. During the quarter, the Company saw increased demand with the highest number of new patient starts and new cases initiated since launch. Cortrophin Gel grew across all targeted specialties driven by the expanded sales force for neurology, rheumatology and nephrology, and synergies from the combined ophthalmology sales force. Prescribing for acute gouty arthritis flares, for which Cortrophin Gel is the only approved ACTH therapy, remained a significant growth driver, representing over 15% of Cortrophin Gel use. The Company saw continued growth in prescriptions for the prefilled syringe, accounting for approximately 70% of new cases initiated. The Phase 4 trial evaluating Cortrophin Gel in acute gouty arthritis flares is ongoing.

ILUVIEN: ILUVIEN net revenues were $16.6 million for the third quarter of 2025. Net revenues were pressured due to further impact from continued reduced access for Medicare patients and utilization of the remaining YUTIQ units at physician offices. Adoption of ILUVIEN for NIU-PS began in the third quarter and the Company continued to make tangible progress toward full adoption of the label transition. Results from the NEW DAY clinical trial of ILUVIEN in patients with DME were presented at a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2025 Meeting, and in presentations at the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) Annual Meeting and the EURetina Innovation Spotlight 2025 Meeting.

Brands

Brands net revenues were $10.7 million for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 16.1% over the same period in 2024, reflecting an increase in demand for certain products.

Generics

Generics net revenues were $94.4 million in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 20.6% over the same period in 2024. The increase was driven by a successful partnered generic launch in the second half of the third quarter.

All comparisons are made versus the same period in 2024 unless otherwise stated.

Total net revenues for the third quarter of 2025 were $227.8 million, an increase of 53.6% over the prior year period. On an organic basis, excluding the acquisition of Alimera, total net revenues grew 46.2% year-over-year.

Net revenues for Rare Disease, which includes Cortrophin Gel and ILUVIEN, increased 109.9% to $118.5 million. Cortrophin Gel net revenues increased 93.8% to $101.9 million driven by increased volume. ILUVIEN net revenues were $16.6 million.

Net revenues for Brands increased 16.1% to $10.7 million driven by an increase in demand for certain products.

Net revenues for Generic pharmaceutical products increased 20.6% to $94.4 million driven by a partnered product launched in the third quarter and contribution from new product launches.

On a GAAP basis, gross margin increased from 57.5% to 59.0%, driven by the non-recurrence of costs of goods related to Alimera purchase accounting. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin decreased from 59.9% to 59.2%, primarily due to product mix, including lower gross margins on a partnered generic product that launched in the third quarter of 2025.

On a GAAP basis, research and development expenses increased 21.5% to $12.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, research and development expenses increased 36.0% to $11.8 million driven by higher investment to support future growth of Rare Disease and Generics.

On a GAAP basis, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 3.1% to $76.7 million, driven by non-recurrence of severance and equity payments and lower transaction and integration costs related to the Alimera transaction, tempered by higher Rare Disease sales and marketing costs and higher legal related costs. On a non-GAAP basis, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 41.1% to $63.6 million principally resulting from continued investment in Rare Disease sales and marketing activities and an overall increase in activities required to support the growth of the business.

On a GAAP basis, the Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $26.3 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2025 compared to net loss of $24.6 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $2.04 for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $1.34 in the prior year period.

Adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA for the third quarter of 2025 was $59.6 million, an increase of 69.8% from the third quarter of 2024, driven by increased Net Revenues and Gross Profit.

For reconciliations of adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see Table 3 and Table 4 below, respectively.

Liquidity

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $262.6 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $252.6 million in net accounts receivable and $633.1 million in principal value of outstanding debt (inclusive of our senior convertible notes).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA

ANI’s management considers adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA to be an important financial indicator of ANI’s operating performance, providing investors and analysts with a useful measure of operating results unaffected by non-cash stock-based compensation and differences in capital structures, tax structures, capital investment cycles, ages of related assets, and compensation structures among otherwise comparable companies. Management uses adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA when analyzing Company performance.

Adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding tax expense (benefit), interest expense, net, other (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, M&A transaction and integration expenses, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, unrealized (gain) loss on our investment in equity securities, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, intangible asset impairment charges, litigation expenses related to certain matters, severance expense, and certain other items that vary in frequency and impact on ANI’s results of operations. Adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, net income or loss reported under GAAP. A reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below.

ANI is not providing a reconciliation for the forward-looking full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance because it does not currently have sufficient information to accurately estimate all of the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation, including “with” and “without” tax provision information. As such, ANI’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results.

Adjusted non-GAAP Net Income

ANI’s management considers adjusted non-GAAP net income to be an important financial indicator of ANI’s operating performance, providing investors and analysts with a useful measure of operating results unaffected by the non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense, depreciation and amortization, M&A transaction and integration expenses, contingent consideration fair value adjustment, unrealized (gain) loss on our investment in equity securities, gain on sale of the former Oakville, Ontario manufacturing site, litigation expenses related to certain matters, severance expense, and certain other items that vary in frequency and impact on ANI’s results of operations. Management uses adjusted non-GAAP net income when analyzing Company performance.

Adjusted non-GAAP net income is defined as net income (loss), plus the non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense, depreciation and amortization, M&A transaction and integration expenses, contingent consideration fair value adjustment, unrealized (gain) loss on our investment in equity securities, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, intangible asset impairment charges, litigation expenses related to certain matters, severance expense, and certain other items that vary in frequency and impact on ANI’s results of operations, less the tax impact of these adjustments calculated using an estimated statutory tax rate. Management will continually analyze this metric and may include additional adjustments in the calculation in order to provide further understanding of ANI’s results. Adjusted non-GAAP net income should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, net income reported under GAAP. A reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP net income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below.

Adjusted non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share

ANI’s management considers adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be an important financial indicator of ANI’s operating performance, providing investors and analysts with a useful measure of operating results unaffected by the non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense, depreciation and amortization, M&A transaction and integration expenses, contingent consideration fair value adjustment, unrealized (gain) loss on our investment in equity securities, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, intangible asset impairment charges, litigation expenses related to certain matters, severance expense, and certain other items that vary in frequency and impact on ANI’s results of operations. Management uses adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when analyzing Company performance.

Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding exclude certain dilutive shares related to the 2029 senior convertible notes as they are intended to be covered by our capped call transactions. Our outstanding capped call transactions are intended to offset the dilutive effect of the 2029 convertible senior notes recognized in the calculation of GAAP diluted EPS in this reporting period in full, and therefore 502,000 shares and 593,000 shares for the three and nine months ended September 2025, have been excluded from the calculation of the Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Weighted-Average Shares outstanding, respectively.

Adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted non-GAAP net income, as defined above, divided by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Management will continually analyze this metric and may include additional adjustments in the calculation in order to provide further understanding of ANI’s results. Adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, diluted earnings (loss) per share reported under GAAP. A reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below.

ANI is not providing a reconciliation for the forward-looking full year 2025 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance because it does not currently have sufficient information to accurately estimate all of the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation, including “with” and “without” tax provision information. As such, ANI’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results.

Other non-GAAP metrics

ANI’s management considers non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses to be financial indicators of ANI’s operating performance, providing investors and analysts with useful measures of operating results unaffected by non-cash stock-based compensation expense, M&A transaction and integration expenses, litigation expenses related to certain matters, inventory step-up amortization, severance expense, and certain other items that vary in frequency and impact on ANI’s results of operations.

Management uses adjusted non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses when analyzing Company performance.

Non-GAAP research and development expenses is defined as research and development expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and certain other items that vary in frequency and impact on ANI’s results of operations.

Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses is defined as selling, general, and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, M&A transaction and integration expenses, litigation expenses related to certain matters, severance expense, and certain other items that vary in frequency and impact on ANI’s results of operations.

Each of adjusted non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses reported under GAAP, respectively.

A reconciliation of each of non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below.

ANI’s management also considers non-GAAP gross margin to be a financial indicator of ANI’s operating performance, providing investors and analysts with a useful measure of operating results unaffected by unaffected by non-cash stock-based compensation expense, inventory step-up amortization, and certain other items that vary in frequency and impact on ANI’s results of operations. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin when analyzing Company performance.

Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as adjusted non-GAAP net revenues less non-GAAP cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) divided by non-GAAP net revenues. Non-GAAP gross margin should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, gross margin reported under GAAP.

[TITLE]FDA recall of blood pressure pills due to cancer-causing contaminant may point to higher safety risks in older generic drugs:
[TEXT]
A generic blood pressure drug called prazosin, made by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is being recalled by the Food and Drug Administration because it contains elevated levels of cancer-causing chemicals called nitrosamines.

The recall, which Teva announced on Oct. 7, 2025, affects more than 580,000 prazosin capsules. Prazosin is prescribed to around 510,000 patients yearly and is used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder as well as high blood pressure.

I am a pharmacologist and pharmacist who has studied nitrosamine contamination of popular blood pressure, diabetes and heartburn drugs, as well as other issues in generic drug manufacturing.

Prazosin has been available as a generic medication for more than 25 years and, like many generics that have been around that long, is now produced by multiple manufacturers. This ratchets up competition on price, which may explain why older generics are more prone to manufacturing issues that may harm patient health.

What are nitrosamines and where do they come from?

Nitrosamines are by-products of many common chemical reactions. They form when a type of chemical building block called a nitrite group interacts with another type called an amine group.

Industrial processes like rocket fuel, rubber and sealant manufacturing can produce high concentrations of nitrosamines during chemical reactions. Bacon, pepperoni and salami are high in nitrite preservatives that interact with the amine groups in the meats to form small amounts of nitrosamines. The chemical reaction that happens when chlorinated water interacts with naturally occurring chemicals that contain nitrogen and oxygen can also form small amounts of nitrosamines.

Occasional and small exposures to nitrosamines are not thought to be dangerous. But some studies have found that certain nitrosamines are carcinogenic when ingested in high amounts for long periods of time

European regulators first discovered in 2018 that prescription drugs could also be contaminated when testing revealed that an active ingredient in a blood pressure drug called valsartan contained a nitrosamine chemical. Since the Chinese company that made the drug’s active ingredient sold it to multiple manufacturers of valsartan tablets, many companies, including Teva Pharmaceuticals, recalled the drug at the time.

The FDA then launched a major effort to identify nitrosamines in prescription and over-the-counter drugs and to define unsafe levels for tablets and capsules. It published an initial industry guidance in 2021 and an updated version in 2024.

Based on the agency’s new testing requirements, drugmakers have identified nitrosamine contamination in widely used blood pressure, diabetes, heartburn, antibiotic and smoking cessation drugs. Most of the recalled drugs were contaminated during the chemical processing at a manufacturing plant.

What should people who take prazosin do?

Teva Pharmaceuticals’ prazosin is just one of many generic versions – but it’s the only one that is contaminated. You can determine whether your medication came from Teva by looking at your prescription label. Search for the abbreviations MFG or MFR, which stand for “manufacturing” or “manufacturer.” If it says “MFG Teva” or “MFR Teva,” that means Teva Pharmaceuticals supplied the medication.

The first four numbers of a National Drug Code, abbreviated as NDC on the prescription label, also reveal the manufacturer or distributor. Teva products have the number 0093.

If Teva Pharmaceuticals is the distributor, a pharmacist can cross-reference your prescription number to obtain the lot number and compare it with the posted lot numbers on the FDA website for recalled prazosin. If your product has been recalled, your pharmacy may have other generic versions of prazosin in stock that are not part of this recall.

Based on its risk assessment for these tablets, the FDA gave the recall a Class II status, which means that the medication could cause “temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences.” If no other prazosin version exists at your pharmacy, do not stop taking your drug without talking with your physician first. The risk of temporarily taking tablets with an elevated amount of nitrosamines may be less than the risk of suddenly stopping this medication.

Your physician may also be able to prescribe an alternative treatment such as clonidine or trazodone.

Do older generics made overseas pose higher risks?

Until recently, it wasn’t possible to compare whether the safety records of generic drugs manufactured overseas differed from the same generics made in the U.S., because the FDA does not disclose which manufacturing plants companies use to create their tablets and capsules. But in a 2025 study, researchers managed to triangulate that information from an FDA dataset.

They found that the risk of serious adverse events was 54.3% higher with generics made in India as compared with those made in the United States. And the longer a drug has been available in generic form, the greater the difference in safety risk between its U.S.- and India-made forms. As my colleague and I wrote in a commentary accompanying the study, the findings suggest that when the market for generic drugs is crowded by multiple manufacturers, lower-priced options naturally sell better. As a result, manufacturers in developing countries are more apt to produce poorer quality products that are less expensive to produce.

Teva Pharmaceuticals has manufacturing plants around the world, including in India. The company has not disclosed where its recalled prazosin capsules and their active and inactive ingredients were manufactured.

The FDA publishes ratings on generic drug quality and claims that generics with an “A” rating meet the same manufacturing quality standards and achieve the same blood concentrations as brand-name drugs. But pharmacies can’t tell from those ratings if a drug comes from manufacturing plants that are at higher risk for quality issues.

Patients are at the mercy of choices pharmacies make in the generic versions of drugs they procure for their stores. In my view, if pharmacies could access reliable information about quality, they might be able to make choices that are safer for American consumers.

[TITLE]Tenaya Therapeutics Presents Promising Interim Clinical Data from MYPEAK™-1 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial of TN-201 Gene Therapy for the Treatment of MYBPC3-Associated Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy:
[TEXT]
MyPEAK-1 Data Presented During Late-Breaking Session at AHA Scientific Sessions 2025 with Simultaneous Publication in Cardiovascular Research

TN-201 Has Been Generally Well Tolerated at Both Doses

Longer-term Follow Up of Cohort 1 Patients Showed Consistent, Deeper, and Durable Improvement in Measures of Hypertrophy

Initial Cohort 2 Data Demonstrated Early Dose Responsive Increases in TN-201 Transduction and MyBP-C Protein Expression

Tenaya Management to Host Webcast Call for Analysts and Investors on Monday, November 10 at 8:00 a.m. EST

NEW ORLEANS and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tenaya Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNYA) announced that new interim safety and efficacy data from the company’s MyPEAK™-1 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of TN-201 were presented today during the Late-Breaking Science: Main Event session at the American Heart Association’s (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2025 by Milind Desai, M.D., MBA, director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center at Cleveland Clinic and vice chair of Cleveland Clinic’s Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute. These data, which included longer-term follow-up results for three patients dosed with TN-201 gene therapy at a dose of 3E13vg/kg (Cohort 1) and initial results for three patients who received TN-201 at a dose of 6E13 vg/kg (Cohort 2) were simultaneously published in Cardiovascular Research.

TN-201 is being developed for the potential treatment of MYBPC3-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition caused by insufficient levels of myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). Single administration of TN-201 gene therapy was generally well-tolerated at both the 3E13 vg/kg and 6E13 vg/kg dose levels and immunogenicity was well managed through monitoring and individualized tapering of immunosuppressives. TN-201 achieved robust transduction and durable expression with early dose-dependent increase in both transduction and MyBP-C protein expression. Among Cohort 1 patients for whom there was greater than one year of follow up, decreases in circulating biomarkers and reductions in measures of left ventricular hypertrophy deepened over time.

“These initial results are promising for a patient population that too often live with difficult, even dangerous, symptoms,” said Dr. Desai, an investigator for the MyPeak-1 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial. “In the past decade, we've made great progress in understanding and treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and as our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of HCM increases, research into gene therapies such as TN-201 offer the opportunity to further advance and improve patient care.”

“Results of TN-201 treatment are in line with our expectations for this stage of trial, with a manageable safety profile and dose-dependent MyBP-C protein level increases over time. In particular, the durable changes in multiple parameters of disease – biomarkers, hypertrophy and heart failure symptoms – all moving with directional consistency toward normalization after a single dose are an encouraging early signal of TN-201’s activity,” said Whit Tingley, M.D., Ph.D., Tenaya’s Chief Medical Officer. “We look forward to building on these data with continued long-term follow-up of Cohort 1 and the maturation of early results for Cohort 2, which will inform our plans for TN-201’s late-stage development.”

Interim results from the MyPEAK-1 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial

Data reported today includes safety, biopsy and leading indicators of efficacy for the three patients enrolled in Cohort 1 with follow-up ranging from Week 52-78, and safety for the three patients in Cohort 2, Week 12 biopsy for Patient 6 and Week 26 assessments for Patient 4 as of the July 2025 data cut off. Patient 5 was lost to further follow-up after week 12. All patients other than Patient 5 have completed every visit and remain on study.

All patients enrolled in MyPEAK-1 had serious burden of disease at baseline. All six had objectively severe nonobstructive HCM with levels of hypertrophy significantly above average for people with HCM All six were at sufficiently high risk of sudden cardiac death to warrant an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) device All experienced mild-to-moderate symptoms of heart failure that interfered in activities of daily living (New York Heart Association, or NYHA, Class II-III) Four of the six have previously undergone surgical myectomy

Safety data for all six patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 showed that TN-201 was generally well tolerated at both the 3E13 vg/kg and 6E13 vg/kg doses. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and all patients have tapered off immunosuppressive medicines.

Reversible, asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations (Grade 1-3) were the most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reported There were no signs of cardiotoxicities, including no declines in left ventricular ejection fraction, clinical myocarditis or ventricular arrhythmias There were two treatment-related AEs classified as serious due to inpatient treatment or monitoring: a Cohort 1 patient with Grade 2 transaminase elevation that responded to steroids and a Cohort 2 patient with Grade 1 elevation of complement factors that resolved without additional intervention Adjustments to monitoring and immunosuppression during Cohort 1 resulted in faster tapers and lower cumulative corticosteroid doses in Cohort 2, despite the higher TN-201 dose

MyBP-C protein levels increased over time, with early evidence of a substantial increase commensurate with higher dose in Cohort 2. TN-201 DNA transduction and TN-201 mRNA expression following similar dose response.

Tenaya reported that TN-201 transduction and TN-201 mRNA expression were robust. All three patients in Cohort 1 demonstrated sustained presence of TN-201 DNA in the heart and mRNA expression that increased over time, supporting the observed increases in MyBP-C level changes. In Cohort 1 patients, protein levels increased by an average of 4% from the first biopsy taken to Week 52. In Patient 3, the first patient for whom baseline biopsies were available, MyBP-C protein was shown to increase by 5% at Week 52. The first evaluable patient in Cohort 2 (Patient 6) demonstrated a clear dose response, and early MyBP-C expression increased by 14% after only 12 weeks post-dose. Of note, Patient 6 had a greater than 2-fold increase in transduction and expression at Week 12 relative to the averages for these measures observed across Cohort 1.

Multiple parameters, including biomarkers, hypertrophy, heart failure symptoms, associated with increased risks of complications or reduced survival, have improved among a majority of patients with greater than 26 weeks of follow-up. Cardiac Troponin I levels declined significantly (48%-74%) to normal or near-normal levels in all Cohort 1 patients. Cardiac troponin I is a predictive risk factor of cardiac AEs such as ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and progression to end-stage heart failure. ( 1 ) NT-proBNP, a biomarker of cardiac muscle strain, improved or remained stable in two of three Cohort 1 patients Cardiac Troponin I remained within the normal range and NT-proBNP remained stable for Patient 4 from Cohort 2 at their 26-Week assessment All three patients in Cohort 1 now have evidence of significant improvement in one or more measures of hypertrophy at Week 52, including notable reductions in left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) of between 21% and 39%. LVPWT for Patient 4 in Cohort 2 was stable at Week 26. Greater LVPWT is an independent risk factor for reduced long-term survival after septal myectomy. (2 ) Two out of three Cohort 1 patients saw reductions in overall left ventricular mass index (LVMI) of between 12% and 22% at Week 52. LVMI for Patient 4 in Cohort 2 was stable at Week 26 NYHA classification, a measure of the impact of heart failure symptoms on activities of daily living, improved in all patients by at least one class by Week 26, and all Cohort 1 patients are now NYHA Class I (asymptomatic).

While the interim results from MyPEAK-1 are promising, longer-term follow-up for all patients is required to further inform Tenaya’s understanding of TN-201’s potential as a treatment for MYBPC3-associated HCM. Tenaya plans to periodically report additional results from longer-term follow-up. These interim data were presented during the “Forgotten No More: The Current Belle of the Ball? Breakthrough Evolutions in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy” Late-Breaking Science: Main Event session during AHA 2025 and were published simultaneously in an article titled “First-in-human study of AAV9:MYBPC3 gene replacement therapy (TN-201) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Initial safety, pharmacodynamic, and imaging results from MyPEAK-1” in Cardiovascular Research.

[TITLE]Jade Biosciences Presents New Data Demonstrating a Favorable Preclinical Safety Profile of JADE101 and a Translational Analysis of APRIL Mediated Biomarker Responses at the American Society of Nephrol:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jade Biosciences, Inc. (“the Company” or “Jade”), (Nasdaq: JBIO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing best-in-class therapies for autoimmune diseases, today presented two posters for JADE101, its investigational anti-A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025.

JADE101 is designed to selectively inhibit APRIL, a key driver of pathogenic IgA production in IgAN, a progressive autoimmune disease that frequently leads to end-stage kidney disease over a patient’s lifetime. Jade has engineered JADE101 with properties intended to capture the full efficacy of APRIL pathway inhibition while enabling patient-friendly subcutaneous dosing, supported by a differentiated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile demonstrated in non-human primates (NHPs). JADE101 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial, with interim data expected in the first half of 2026 that is anticipated to define the dose and dose interval for future studies in IgAN patients.

“We believe the selective anti-APRIL class will represent the foundational therapeutic approach for treatment of IgAN, and JADE101 has been specifically engineered to deliver the full potential of this mechanism,” said Andrew King, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and Head of R&D at Jade Biosciences. “These new preclinical data in NHPs demonstrate that JADE101 is highly selective, is well tolerated at toxicological doses, and is not broadly immunosuppressive. Additionally, our translational modeling builds further confidence that biomarker responses observed in healthy volunteers are expected to translate into meaningful outcomes for patients with IgAN. Interim biomarker data from our ongoing Phase 1 healthy volunteer study are anticipated to define the dose and dosing interval selection for JADE101, with the goal of supporting rapid advancement into IgAN patient trials with a potentially best-in-class therapy.”

Nonclinical Safety Profile of JADE101 (Poster #SA-PO0255)

New preclinical safety data highlight JADE101’s favorable safety profile and support its potential as a selective, disease-modifying treatment with low risk of toxicity:

JADE101 was well tolerated in NHPs at all doses tested preclinically, including the highest dose evaluated in GLP toxicology studies, which was established as the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). These results provide wide safety margins that support the first-in-human doses being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial.

Across studies, JADE101 showed no off-target binding in a panel of more than 6,000 human proteins, no human tissue cross-reactivity, and no cytokine release in human whole blood assays.

In NHPs, JADE101 treatment resulted in reversible reductions in serum immunoglobulins consistent with its mechanism of action, including IgA and IgM reductions of approximately 55–68% and 62–75%, respectively, and a more modest IgG reduction of 35–48%, all of which returned toward baseline following JADE101 clearance.

Despite reductions in circulating immunoglobulins, JADE101-treated NHPs generated antibody responses to a test immunization (KLH) that were comparable to untreated controls, consistent with the preserved vaccination response observed in healthy volunteers following administration of a previous anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody.

JADE101 administration in NHPs did not impact serum concentrations of BAFF or inflammatory cytokines, resulted in no histological changes in tissues, and had no effect on circulating immune cell populations, including B, T, or NK cells - supporting its potential as a well-tolerated treatment, devoid of broad immune suppression.

Translational Modeling of Biomarker Responses to APRIL Inhibition (Poster #SA-PO0272)

A second presentation described a translational assessment of the consistency of biomarker responses to APRIL inhibition across NHPs, healthy volunteers and IgAN patients, and the associations between these biomarkers and clinical responses in IgAN. Biomarker responses to JADE101 in the ongoing healthy volunteer study are anticipated to define dose and dose interval selection for future clinical trials in IgAN patients:

Analyses demonstrated that in vitro APRIL binding affinity is predictive of in vivo IgA-lowering potency across NHP and human data sets, supporting that high APRIL binding affinity results in potent IgA reduction in vivo in NHPs and humans.

Clinical observations from healthy volunteers further demonstrate that high APRIL binding affinity is a key determinant of the magnitude and duration of free APRIL and IgA reduction at a given anti-APRIL dose level.

Pharmacokinetic and free APRIL suppression profiles of anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies were consistent between healthy volunteers and patients with IgAN, supporting the use of healthy volunteer PK and biomarker results for dose selection in IgAN patients.

Trial level analyses indicate the kinetics and magnitude of IgA reduction is highly consistent between healthy volunteers and IgAN patients (r = 0.93), and that the reduction of Gd-IgA1 measured in IgAN patients is highly consistent with the reductions in total IgA (r = 0.96). Furthermore, the early IgA reduction observed in IgAN patients is predictive of subsequent proteinuria reduction (r = 0.89).

The largest reductions in proteinuria and the highest rates of clinical remission (proteinuria < 0.3 g/day) in IgAN patients were observed with the highest levels of APRIL suppression.

These analyses suggest that pharmacokinetic and biomarker responses observed in healthy volunteers are informative of anticipated therapeutic responses in IgAN patients. The analysis also highlights that the depth and duration of APRIL suppression can be linked to anticipated reductions in total IgA, Gd-IgA1, and proteinuria that are ultimately associated with preserving kidney function and delivering disease-modifying clinical outcomes for patients with IgAN. Based on JADE101’s differentiated NHP pharmacokinetic profile, the Company anticipates the potential for convenient, infrequent, subcutaneous dosing.

Pipeline Highlights

UCART Clinical Programs

BALLI-01 study evaluating lasme-cel (UCART22)

Clinical data from the Phase 1 BALLI-01 study with lasme-cel for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL), were presented at the Cellectis’ R&D Day that took place on October 16, 2025. The presented data position lasme-cel as a potentially game-changing therapy for patients with r/r B-ALL.

In the Phase 1 of BALLI-01 study, 40 transplant ineligible third line or beyond (3L+) patients were dosed with lasme-cel: 18 patients (n=18) were dosed with product manufactured by an external CDMO (Process 1, or P1) and 22 patients (n=22) were dosed with Cellectis-manufactured product (Process 2, or P2).

Highlights include:

Efficacy: lasme-cel demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 68% with Process 2 product (n=22), and an ORR of 83% at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D; n=12) and 100% in the target Phase 2 population (n=9)

Safety: in Phase 1 (n=40), lasme-cel was generally well tolerated; there was one case of grade 2 immune effector cell–associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS), which resolved.

Durability: among patients who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), median overall survival was 14.8 months.

Depth of response in target Phase 2 population: the CR/CRi rate was 56%, with approximately 80% of these patients achieving MRD-negative status.

Transplant eligibility in target Phase 2 population: all patients (100%) became eligible for transplant, and 78% proceeded to transplantation.

The survival curve for this study suggests a clear benefit: patients who proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after lasme-cel therapy showed a trend to longer overall survival than those who did not undergo transplant.

The Phase 1 data showed that lasme-cel maintained its efficacy regardless of the number or type of prior lines of treatments, including CAR-T (60% of subjects), transplant (50% of patients), and blinatumomab (80% of subjects).

Following successful End-of-Phase 1 meetings with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Cellectis provided a registration path for lasme-cel in r/r ALL. The first interim analysis for the Phase 2 of the BALLI-01 trial is expected in Q4 2026. Cellectis anticipates submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in 2028.

Commercial Opportunity for Lasme-cel

As part of the R&D Day presentation, the Company discussed the potential commercial opportunity for lasme-cel in r/r B-ALL.

If approved for commercialization, Cellectis estimates that lasme-cel could achieve up to approximately $700 million in potential peak gross sales across the U.S., EU4 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain) and UK in 2035, corresponding to an estimation of

[TITLE]Immunocore presents Phase 1 data for hepatitis B candidate at AASLD’s The Liver Meeting:
[TEXT]
Single ascending dose data show IMC-I109V has manageable safety profile and antiviral activity

IMC-I109V is a bispecific T cell receptor targeting a peptide derived from HBsAg that is presented by HLA-A*02:01 on the surface of infected hepatocytes

(OXFORDSHIRE, England & CONSHOHOCKEN, Penn. & GAITHERSBURG, Md., US, November 7, 2025) Immunocore Holdings plc (Nasdaq: IMCR) (“Immunocore” or the “Company”), a commercial-stage biotechnology company pioneering and delivering transformative immunomodulating medicines to radically improve outcomes for patients with cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases, has today announced data from its Phase 1 trial of IMC-I109V, a TCR bispecific (ENVxCD3) candidate designed to specifically eliminate HBV-infected hepatocytes expressing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) via T cell redirection.

The data, presented in a poster at The Liver Meeting, organized by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, show that IMC-I109V is generally well tolerated in all evaluated doses and exhibits pharmacodynamic (PD) effects consistent with its mechanism of action, including reduction in HBsAg levels, clearance of which is indicative of resolved hepatitis B infection.

“Dose-dependent decreases in serum HBsAg following a single dose of IMC-I109V are promising and show that a T cell receptor-based approach to treating chronic HBV infection warrants further investigation,” said David Berman, Head of Research and Development. “These data – alongside the encouraging safety profile and antiviral activity seen in our ImmTAV candidate for HIV – reinforce the potential of our platform to achieve functional cures for chronic infectious diseases.”

The trial enrolled 20 participants in sequential cohorts evaluating ascending doses (0.8 mcg; 2.4 mcg; 7 mcg; 20 mcg) of IMC-I109V, given as a single IV infusion on day 1. Each dose was assessed for tolerability and PD activity, defined by either a ≥ 0.2 log 10 reduction in serum HBsAg or by predefined increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or serum IL-6 levels. Escalation to the next dose level was permitted for any dose that was deemed tolerable but was associated with PD activity in less than half the participants in a cohort.

Participants were evaluated for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and PD activity up to week 4.

At doses ≥ 7 mcg, consistent PD activity was observed, including a dose-dependent decrease in HBsAg, which typically reached a nadir by day 8. Reductions meeting the predetermined threshold of ≥ 0.2 log 10 IU/ml were seen in 4 individuals, 2/6 in the 7 mcg cohort and 2/8 in the 20 mcg cohort. In 3 of these 4 participants, HBsAg remained below pre-dose levels throughout follow-up. Reductions in HBsAg levels coincided with immune activation (IL-6 elevations) and transient elevations in ALT, which were expected based on the mechanism of action.

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were observed in 8 participants, including transient systemic symptoms (mostly Grade 1-2) in the 24h following infusion. ALT elevations (Grade 1-3), resolved to ≤ Grade 1 within 14 days. Bilirubin and prothrombin values remained within normal ranges throughout the study. The rapid resolution of all TRAEs was consistent with the short serum half-life (< 24h) of IMC-I109V.

One of 8 participants in the 20 mcg cohort developed Grade 2 cytokine release syndrome (fever, transient hypoxia and transient hypotension) within 4 hours of the end of infusion. This event responded rapidly to supportive treatment and corticosteroid therapy, resolving within 4 hours. Although dose-limiting toxicity criteria were not met, this event was classified as a serious adverse event (SAE) due to extension of the hospital stay (<1 day). Subsequently, 2 participants received the 20 mcg dose with corticosteroid premedication as an additional precaution. No SAEs occurred in these individuals.

IMC-I109V is designed to overcome HBV-specific T cell exhaustion by recruiting non-exhausted T cells to eliminate hepatocytes harboring covalently closed circular DNA or integrated HBV DNA.

The Company believes this first-in-human evidence of reductions in HBsAg via this novel mechanism supports further evaluation of IMC-I109V in multiple dose regimens.
