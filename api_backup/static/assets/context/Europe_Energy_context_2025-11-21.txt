European Energy has entered into a solar park operations agreement with Heartland, assuming responsibility for Gedmose solar park near Holstebro, Denmark, from January 2026.

This move marks the first time European Energy will operate a solar park it has not developed or owned, expanding its portfolio of operational activities within renewable energy.

The Gedmose solar park, owned by Heartland, was connected to the grid in 2021 and was Northern Europe’s largest at the time, with a capacity of 207MW.

Situated just outside Holstebro, the facility generates enough electricity to supply more than 50,000 households annually.

Under the new agreement, European Energy will further diversify its operational services.

The company currently is engaged in operational and asset management for 4GW of renewable energy capacity.

Electricity produced by the Gedmose solar park is sold to BESTSELLER, Normal, Nemlig.com, and Faerch under a power purchase agreement.

Heartland communications head Kasper Reggelsen said: “Gedmose solar park was established as part of our ambition to invest responsibly and with a long-term perspective in the green transition.

“In recent years, we have been reminded of the importance of a robust energy infrastructure that benefits everyone. We are pleased to gain a skilled partner to handle the day-to-day operations and ensure that the park continues to contribute efficiently to Denmark’s energy supply.”

European Energy plans to further expand its asset management and operations activities both in Denmark and across international markets.

European Energy asset management and operations EVP Jacob Saust Jacobsen said: “A key part of our strategic shift in asset management has been to offer our services to third-party owners – not only to the parks we develop ourselves.

“In recent years, we have also developed new technological solutions that enable us to optimise electricity production at a lower cost. Our ambition is for asset management to become a significant revenue driver for the company, and this agreement marks an important step forward in that direction.

“We therefore look forward to taking over the operations of Gedmose solar park and providing the owners with a stable and efficient partner.”

Last month, European Energy agreed to sell a 50% stake in its Saldus project in Latvia to Sampension, a Danish pension fund.

[TITLE]Germany Goes On LNG Import Terminal Building Spree:
[TEXT]
Three years ago, Germany led an EU-wide offensive against Russian pipeline gas imports. These imports were no longer wanted in Europe because of the war in Ukraine. They would be replaced with LNG—for a short while—because the EU, and Germany, were firmly on their way to net zero. Now, Germany is in the LNG game for the long haul, building import terminals with a target of over 70 million tons annually—including from Russia.

Reuters this week published an overview of Germany’s efforts to boost imports of liquefied natural gas, to replace the flows from Russia via the blown-up Nord Stream and the Ukrainian route, which got shut down by the Zelensky government, which did not extend a transit deal with Gazprom that expired last year. Besides LNG, Germany has access to Norwegian gas via the continent’s pipeline network, and, theoretically, pipeline gas from Azerbaijan via Turkey and Italy along the Southern Gas Corridor.

To date, Germany has five LNG import terminals featuring floating storage and regasification units. They are not all in operation yet, but when they are, they will provide the EU’s biggest gas consumer with an import capacity of 70.7 million tons of liquefied gas annually by 2030. This will make Germany the world’s fourth-largest LNG importer, after South Korea, China, and Japan. It would also prove that the net-zero push was doomed from the start, as no matter how many wind turbines and solar panels Germany puts up, it still needs a lot of gas.

Related: Pakistan to Launch Artificial Offshore Island To Jump-Start Oil Exploration

To be fair, Germany has succeeded in one thing it promised back in 2022 – to reduce gas consumption. Indeed, gas consumption in the country has fallen steadily since that year. Unfortunately, it was not for the reasons hoped for, namely, greater energy efficiency and a turn towards alternative sources of energy. No, gas consumption is down because industrial activity is down, and industrial activity is down because the gas available is mostly rather expensive.

This is not going to change, by the way, unless the predictions of a mega-glut of LNG on the horizon come true. LNG has always traded at a premium to pipeline gas because its production involves a much more complicated process than piping gas through a pipeline. On the spot market, LNG costs even more, which is why Germany broke another promise it had made even earlier than 2022 – to never again shackle itself to long-term gas delivery contracts. At the time, it looked achievable. Wind and solar were thriving, and soon, Europe’s industrial powerhouse would power itself with the sun and the wind. Alas, it couldn’t happen, and it didn’t. Long-term contracts are back in fashion.

Because of those long-term contracts, Germany plans to keep ramping up its import capacity for liquefied gas. One site, for instance, in the Baltic Sea, is scheduled to have a regasification capacity of 13.5 billion cu m by 2027. After that, the Mukran site could get another 5 billion cu m in import capacity annually, per plans drafted by its operator, Deutsche ReGas.

Another site, at Wilhelmshaven, is being prepared for alternative uses at some point. Operator Uniper, which built Germany’s first FSRU there in 2022, has plans to build an ammonia import facility there and a wind power installation with a capacity of 200 MW to produce green hydrogen. Germany is not giving up on its net-zero dream so easily, regardless of how many LNG import facilities it must build to keep the lights on and the factories going.

Meanwhile, transition activists are speculating that there is too much LNG import capacity in Europe already, and it will end up stranded as demand for gas declines under the onslaught of wind and solar output. This is what one such outlet, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, reported recently, saying the buildout of LNG import terminals had slowed down since 2022.

This, of course, is only natural as no country could be expected to keep building LNG import terminals at a constant pace until it has no more space left to build more. Yet the line of argument that outlets such as IEEFA use is that the energy transition would eventually destroy gas demand, leaving these structures, floating as many of them may be, useless after billions of euros were poured into their installation.

Before that happens, however, the billions would be flowing westward as Europe turns into the biggest buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas—under long-term deals, no less. Energy Intelligence reported this week that some of the deals that European energy companies are signing with LNG producers and traders are as long-term as 25 years, even though there is an option to sell them on if demand declines and the volumes are no longer needed.

For now, the volumes will be needed. U.S. LNG exports to Europe have soared in recent months as the continent rushes to stock up on the fuel for winter peak demand. In October, flows hit an all-time high of 10.7 million tons, up from 8.66 million tons a month earlier. Europe—and Germany—needs gas. If it can’t or won’t have it in pipeline form, it will need all the regasification terminals it can build.

[TITLE]French investor to finance construction of €50 million Kildare biomethane plant:
[TEXT]
French investor Eiffel Investment Group will step in to finance the development of a major Irish biomethane plant expected to cost €50 million and power up to 10,900 homes each year.

The production facility, which is based in Monasterevin, Co Kildare, is currently under construction, expected to start operating in 2026. It will be developed and operated by Irish-based Evergreen Agricultural Enterprises.

“This is an important step in delivering the project which will be the largest biomethane project in Ireland at the time of completion,” said Katarzyna Kubizna, one of the owners of Evergreen Agricultural Enterprises alongside Patrick Meade.

The plant will produce approximately 120 gigawatt-hours of renewable biomethane annually, with a net output of up to 109 gigawatt-hours per year after internal consumption.

“We are delighted to be at the forefront of this developing industry and are excited to continue to work with the Eiffel team in bringing the project through to completion,” she said.

The company agreed a deal with Gas Networks Ireland in October to connect the €50 million biomethane production plant in directly to the national gas network.

Biomethane is a renewable gas generated by the breakdown of organic waste products such as food and farm waste through a process called anaerobic digestion. After purification, it can be used similarly to natural gas.

The Evergreen previously said it expects the construction and operation of the plant to create up to 75 direct and indirect local jobs.

French asset manager Eiffel Investment Group is backed by the Impala group founded by entrepreneur Jacques Veyrat. The group has €8 billion of assets under management and is funded both by retail investors and institutional backers, such as insurance companies, pension funds, and banks.

Alexis Sarton, investment director at the Eiffel Investment Group said the project “combines technical excellence, environmental, sovereignty and economic value, and strong engagement with local stakeholders, an infrastructure model we promote across Europe.”

[TITLE]The Paris Agreement is working — just ask Big Oil – DW – 11:
[TEXT]
The louder the lobbying, the clearer the fear. Ten years on, the Paris Agreement has reshaped energy politics, and the pushback from the fossil fuel sector is still mounting.

In the decade since the historic Paris climate accord was signed, fossil fuel companies have been fighting hard to protect their business, pouring millions into lobbying and supporting climate-skeptic politicians — with success.

In the US, Donald Trump has again moved to pull out of the Paris Agreement and rolled back support for renewables in favor of oil and gas. Similar shifts are emerging elsewhere, as climate skeptic and denialist parties gain traction in Europe.

Across the corporate world, enthusiasm for environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks has also cooled amid political pushbacks and shifting market priorities. And at international climate conferences, the scale of lobbying by big oil and gas companies has been striking.

"At both COP28 and COP29, fossil fuel lobbyists showed up in the thousands, dwarfing many delegations, in particular those from the countries most vulnerable to climate change," said Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law in Washington. It's no different at this year's UN climate conference, COP30, in Brazil.

Together, these lobbying efforts have weakened climate policy, says Richard Blanchard, director of the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology at the UK's Loughborough University.

Keeping global temperatures down

Under the Paris Agreement, countries pledged to slow global warming to maximum of 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, and ideally no more the 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Now, the UN says that goal of 1.5 degrees is dead, and current pledges put the world on course for at least 2.6 degrees Celsius of warming by century's end. As more fossil fuels are burned, the world continues to see record-breaking heat and weather extremes.

While a recent study found climate change would be much worse without the Paris Agreement, the transition to a world powered by clean energy is happening too slowly.

"People are confused," says Blanchard. Importantly, "the amount of oil being drilled has not reduced since 2015."

But for some experts, the ferocity of this determination to keep extracting and using polluting energy sources is not a sign of the Paris Agreement's failure, but of its reach. The louder the resistance, the more it signals that the fossil fuel sector, reliant on burning oil and gas to maintain its business model, feels threatened.

"The Paris Agreement would severely curtail their profits," says Blanchard. Their lobbying efforts, he adds, are "evidence of their defensive position."

What is working in the Paris Agreement

That defensive position reflects a shifting energy landscape. Global investment in clean energy has outpaced fossil fuels every year since 2016. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), clean energy investment will hit $2.2 trillion in 2025 (€1.9 trillion) — double the $1.1 trillion expected for oil, gas and coal combined.

Renewables are also expanding at record speed, led by solar and followed by wind. Another IEA report projects clean energy capacity will grow faster through 2030 than it did over the previous five years in more than 80% of countries. China is driving much of that momentum through massive investment in solar and battery technology.

Some oil and gas giants are investing in green energy, but commitments vary. Exxon has backed carbon capture and hydrogen while still boosting oil and gas output, says Blanchard. BP, meanwhile, has scaled back renewable projects in favor of more drilling.

Fossil fuels still supply 80% of global primary energy. Even under optimistic clean-energy scenarios, oil and gas remain necessary through the 2030s and 2040s, as renewable generation, storage and grid capacity catch up.

For now, many producers are extracting as much as possible before stricter climate policies take hold, or before renewables become so cheap and reliable that fossil fuels are no longer as attractive.

Fossil fuel companies are anxious, says Blanchard. Market changes or regulations could make their hydrocarbon resources or infrastructure obsolete, leaving them with "stranded assets" and nothing more to show for their big investments.

Paris Agreement sent a signal to the world

According to the Paris Agreement, countries are free to set their own emission targets. The treaty's only enforcement tools are transparency and peer pressure — a "naming and shaming" system that many see as a major weakness.

But its real power lies not in setting emissions targets, but in enabling industrial transformation, argues Navroz Dubash, professor at Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs.

[TITLE]Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation Announces At-the-Money Equity Issuance Program:
[TEXT]
All amounts in U.S. dollars

BROOKFIELD, NEWS, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation (NYSE: BIPC; TSX: BIPC) (“BIPC”) today announced that it has made the necessary Canadian and U.S. securities filings to enable an “at the market” equity issuance program (the “ATM Program”).

Under the ATM Program, BIPC may, at its discretion, offer and sell up to $400 million (or the Canadian dollar equivalent) of class A exchangeable subordinate voting shares (the “BIPC Shares”) directly from treasury. These shares may be sold to the public from time to time at prevailing market prices through the Toronto Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or any other marketplace in Canada or the United States where BIPC Shares may be traded. As a result, sale prices of the BIPC Shares sold under the ATM Program, if any, may vary among purchasers and throughout the distribution period. The ATM Program will provide BIPC with flexibility to issue BIPC Shares directly into the market at times when conditions are favorable.

Each BIPC Share will be exchangeable at the option of the holder for one non-voting limited partnership unit (each, an “LP Unit”) of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (the “Partnership” and together with BIPC, “Brookfield Infrastructure”) (subject to adjustment to reflect certain capital events) or its cash equivalent (the form of payment to be determined at the election of BIPC).

Brookfield Infrastructure intends to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program, if any, to facilitate repurchases by the Partnership of its LP Units under its normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”) program (subject to compliance with applicable securities laws) and for general corporate purposes.

Overall, the ATM Program, if exercised, is expected to be non-dilutive to Brookfield Infrastructure, as the combined number of LP Units and BIPC Shares outstanding is intended to remain generally unchanged, though there may be temporary fluctuations over the course of the distributions.

The BIPC Shares will be offered pursuant to an equity distribution agreement dated November 19, 2025 (the “Distribution Agreement”) entered among the Partnership, BIPC and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and Scotia Capital Inc. (together, the “Canadian Agents”), and RBC Capital Markets, LLC and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. (together, the “U.S. Agents” and, together with the Canadian Agents, the “Agents”, each an “Agent”). Sales may be made through “at the market distributions” as defined in National Instrument 44-102 – Shelf Distributions and in sales deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and as otherwise permitted by applicable laws. The ATM Program will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all of the BIPC Shares subject to the Distribution Agreement, (ii) termination of the Distribution Agreement by BIPC or by the Agents as provided therein, or (iii) on February 28, 2027, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement.

The ATM Program is being undertaken in Canada pursuant to a Canadian prospectus supplement dated November 19, 2025 (the “Canadian Prospectus Supplement”) to the Partnership and BIPC’s Canadian short form base shelf prospectus dated January 29, 2025 (together with the Canadian Prospectus Supplement, the “Canadian Prospectus”), which has been filed in each of the provinces and territories of Canada, and in the United States pursuant to a U.S. prospectus supplement dated November 19, 2025 (the “U.S. Prospectus Supplement”) to BIPC’s and the Partnership’s U.S. base prospectus (together with the U.S. Prospectus Supplement, the “U.S. Prospectus”) included in their joint U.S. registration statement on Form F-3, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2024 (as amended on May 24, 2024, January 29, 2025 and April 15, 2025, and declared effective on April 24, 2025).

Before making an investment, potential investors should read the Canadian Prospectus or the U.S. Prospectus, as applicable, and other public filings by Brookfield Infrastructure

[TITLE]America Can Win the AI Race and Keep Energy Affordable, Southern Company Is Proving It:
[TEXT]
The following content is sponsored by Southern Company.

America doesn’t need to choose between winning the AI race and keeping energy affordable for hardworking families. At Southern Company, we’re proving both are possible by powering America’s most advanced industries, achieving energy dominance, and keeping energy affordable and reliable for the customers we’re privileged to serve.

While it may not be true everywhere, the Southeast is open for business. Utilities are effectively meeting the rising demand for electricity from new large-load customers, like AI data centers, while keeping energy rates more than 10 percent below the national average.

You may be asking how is that possible? It’s because our customer-first market structure allows us to work directly with new large-load customers to identify their needs, generate the necessary power to bring them online, and ensure they pay their fair share of system costs. This approach works: Atlanta is now the nation’s top destination for new data centers.

But being a top destination for economic development and helping ensure America wins the AI race is not even the best part. The real win is that we’re powering this growth and energy dominance while keeping energy rates more than 10 percent below the national average. In Georgia, for example, we recently secured a three-year base-rate freeze, which is a major victory for households and local businesses. Our belief is simple: building America’s future should never come at the expense of the people who make this country work.

Our commitment to delivering value to our customers is bolstered by the strong bipartisan leadership of federal, state, and local officials across our region. Our customers are benefiting from innovative approaches and common-sense rules around powering new large-load customers. A good example is new rules passed by the Georgia Public Service Commission that ensure the costs of serving energy-intensive facilities are borne by those customers directly, not from residential customers.

“Customers continue to be at the center of everything we do. Our focus on the customer underpins our disciplined approach to forecasting, pricing, contracting and deploying resources to serve this once-in-a-generation growth opportunity. And we continue to execute on those plans for the benefits of all of our customers.” — Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO, Southern Company.

For more than a century, Southern Company has been at the forefront of American energy innovation. We’ve powered economic growth and development across the Southeast and beyond. We just built the first new American nuclear plant in over 30 years, which is a historic milestone for reliable baseload power and proof that America can still do hard things.

We’re not stopping there. We’re planning to invest over $70 billion in energy infrastructure to support a growing economy and ensure the U.S. remains the world’s energy superpower.

We also understand that energy reliability isn’t just about powering growth, it’s about being prepared for the unexpected. When Hurricane Helene tore through the Southeast last year with 140 mph winds and devastating floods, it damaged critical infrastructure across our service territory. Power lines, transformers, and thousands of poles were destroyed. But we were ready. Southern Company activated teams across our system, and within just 11 days, we restored service to 99 percent of the nearly 1.5 million customers impacted by the storm.

[TITLE]Plenitude Buys 760 MW Neoen Portfolio in Major French Renewables Deal:
[TEXT]
Plenitude, the renewables and retail energy subsidiary of Eni (ENI), has moved to significantly strengthen its position in France by signing a deal to acquire a 760-MW portfolio of operating renewable assets from Neoen. The package includes 37 solar plants, 14 wind farms, and one battery storage facility spread across the country, collectively producing around 1.1 TWh of electricity per year.

The acquisition—still subject to regulatory approval—ranks among the largest renewable M&A transactions in the French market in recent years. It marks a major milestone in Plenitude’s 2025–2028 Strategic Plan, which targets 10 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2028. The added capacity will integrate with the company’s existing French portfolio, enabling operational synergies and further consolidating its presence in one of Europe’s most competitive power markets.

The deal also reinforces Plenitude’s broader integrated model, which spans renewables, energy solutions, retail supply, and EV charging. The company already serves about 1 million retail customers in France and aims to exceed 11 million across Europe by 2028 and 15 million by 2030.

CEO Stefano Goberti said the acquisition strengthens the company’s strategic trajectory, accelerating its expansion in a market where it is scaling both its energy solutions and e-mobility offerings.

For Neoen, one of France’s most prominent renewable developers, the sale showcases continued investor appetite for mature, subsidy-backed French assets at scale—a trend that has intensified as utilities and integrated energy players boost their European clean-energy portfolios.

Completion of the transaction will mark a notable step in Plenitude’s ongoing efforts to expand its renewable generation base while supporting Eni’s broader decarbonization objectives.
