[TITLE]What’s ahead for startups and VCs in 2026? Investors weigh in:
[TEXT]
Each year, we ask some top investors what they think the next year will bring. Last year, some investors thought the IPO market would be back up and running by now (which didn’t quite happen), while others thought the momentum behind AI was poised to accelerate (and they were right). This year, TechCrunch did the same thing, talking to five investors from various markets

[TITLE]What’s ahead for startups and VCs in 2026? Investors weigh in:
[TEXT]
Bigger, faster, better: bigger total addressable market, faster growth, better unit economics. We made 50 investments last year across 25 countries, and we expect to do more this year, so we’re seeing founders at very different stages and in very different markets. The strongest founders aren’t just showing what they’ve built so far — they’re helping investors understand where the business is going next. Real revenue and real customers still matter, but they’re not sufficient on their own. As an investor, I’m always asking: Where is this company today, and where could it realistically be in the next 12, 18, or 24 months? The founders who raise are the ones who can answer that question clearly and credibly.

We believe the funding markets will always be available for the best founders, but the bar will rise. At the earliest stages, especially in AI application software, I do expect fewer mega seed rounds given intense competition and capital already deployed across many categories. Founders will need to stand out with unique distribution channels or perspectives, not just by relying on a large market opportunity and strong backgrounds. Capital moats have already formed around crowded sectors. At the Series A and B stages, top-quartile rounds will require clear evidence of explosive momentum. The market has now adjusted to these expectations with increased scrutiny on the sustainability of revenue.

Raising in 2025 requires a shift from “visionary” to “battle-tested.” In previous years, capital has been a primary moat; now investors are wary of “pilot purgatory,” where enterprises test AI solutions without an urgent need to buy. In 2026, the bar is rising. Founders must prove to VCs they have more than just traction; they need a distribution advantage. Investors are digging deeper into repeatable sales engines, proprietary workflow/processes, and deep subject matter expertise that holds up against the “capital arms race.” VCs no longer care

[TITLE]China Starts State-Backed Venture Funds to Support Tech Startups:
[TEXT]
China has officially launched a national venture capital fund and three large regional funds, together worth billions of dollars, as part of a push to foster home-grown tech champions and improve investment efficiency.

The National Startup Investment Guidance Fund, as well as the three vehicles covering the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta and the Greater Bay Area, began operating on Friday, according to Xinhua News Agency.

The national fund is backed by 100 billion yuan from the Ministry of Finance, financed through the issuance of ultra-long special sovereign bonds, Guo Fangming, a Finance Ministry official, said at a briefing on Friday.

The three regional funds are set up through the national fund’s equity stakes in limited partnerships and are each expected to eventually grow to more than 50 billion yuan, Huo Fupeng, chairman of the state fund, said at the same event.

China is ramping up its push for technological breakthroughs as competition with the US heats up in areas such as semiconductors. Tighter fiscal conditions — including rising debt risks and weaker revenue — have forced the government to be more disciplined

[TEXT]
Three in four multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in mainland China have maintained or increased their investments in 2025, according to a recent KPMG survey, despite Washington stepping up efforts to decouple from Beijing and its allies following suit.

The survey published on Monday, polling 137 senior executives from global companies operating in the world's second-largest economy between June and September, revealed that only 1 per cent reported preparing to exit the market.

From an uncertain geopolitical environment that created an atmosphere of fear and fragility to the constantly evolving belligerent posture of the world’s two largest economies—the US and China—Indian businesses had to navigate a complex global landscape not only to stay resilient but also to find avenues for growth amid mounting challenges.India Inc had moments of caution, but it also made the most of the situation by recalibrating strategy and approach, choosing to invest time and energy in long-term growth rather than short-term gains. Many of these moves may not appear significant at the moment, as they are unlikely to yield immediate results, but over the longer run, they are expected to prove effective and bear fruit.One of the foremost challenges for India in 2025 was managing its approach towards China. In April, when China halted the supply of critical rare earth metals, essential for chips, weapons, electric vehicles and several other applications — India Inc, particularly automobile giants, knocked on the government’s door to secure supplies. Without intervention, the disruption threatened to derail India’s ambitious electric vehicle adoption plans.As industry flagged concerns, the government swiftly doubled down on diplomatic channels while simultaneously fast-tracking domestic measures. This included accelerated execution of the National Critical Mineral Mission , aimed at reducing regulatory bottlenecks and opening doors for private firms to scale up exploration and processing of rare earths. India also partnered with countries such as Australia, Japan and the US to explore alternative supply-chain routes.Although China partially eased the curbs later, the episode delivered a sharp jolt. It pushed India to prepare for future shocks, and crucial groundwork was laid to strengthen long-term resilience.Despite geopolitical headwinds and global uncertainty, India emerged as the world’s fourth-largest economy in 2025 in terms of GDP. India’s resilience stemmed largely from strong domestic consumption. As a consumption-driven economy, India was less vulnerable to the damage caused by Trump’s tariff war, which hit export-dependent economies like China harder. Manufacturing expansion — particularly in defence exports and a robust digital services sector also boosted investor confidence.GDP growth remained mostly in the 6–7% range, supported by public capital expenditure, services exports and sustained government spending on roads, transport and renewable energy. While corporate capex stayed relatively muted, India Inc’s balance sheets remained healthy.The 2025 Budget marked a decisive shift in India’s tax architecture, with a clear focus on simplifying compliance and boosting consumption. The government recalibrated income-tax slabs under the new regime to broaden the base, simplify compliance and put more disposable income in consumers’ hands.At the same time, the GST framework was streamlined, reducing multiple slabs to just two key rates — 5% and 18%. This not only eased the compliance burden for businesses but also strengthened digitisation and helped sustain business momentum across sectors.Investor confidence in India’s growth story was clearly reflected in a steady pipeline of IPOs on Dalal Street in 2025. From ICICI Prudential AMC — the country’s largest asset management company — to JSW Cement , manufacturing-linked firms such as Saatvik Green Energy and Manas Polymers, and niche industrial SME listings like Bai Kakaji Polymers and Admach, the market saw wide participation.Several marquee IPOs were oversubscribed multiple times, while many delivered healthy listing gains, reinforcing confidence in India’s long-term growth narrative.India witnessed a flurry of announcements and policy action aimed at building a manufacturing ecosystem focused on value addition and supply-chain resilience. Semiconductors gained priority, and incentives expanded under the PLI framework. Auto and EV companies scrambled to secure rare earth supplies from alternative sources, while defence manufacturing received a major boost as export order books swelled.India also sharpened its positioning from ‘Make in India’ to ‘Make in India, for the World’, projecting itself as a credible manufacturing hub capable of challenging China’s dominance. Manufacturing currently contributes about 17% to India’s GDP, but the government has set an ambitious target of raising this share to 25% by 2047. Decisions taken in 2025 — through initiatives such as PLI schemes, Make in India and support for sunrise sectors — are expected to be critical stepping stones.In 2025, trade policy emerged as a core economic tool. India concluded multiple trade agreements to diversify markets and counter tariff pressures. A landmark Free Trade Agreement with the UK was signed mid-year, followed by the finalisation of an FTA with New Zealand in December. India also concluded negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman in August, improving access to Gulf markets.Simultaneously, talks continued with the US, the EU and key Indo-Pacific partners, while ensuring protection for sensitive domestic sectors.As India heads into 2026, the questions are no longer about growth potential but about execution — whether the country can build deep manufacturing ecosystems, secure critical minerals, and strengthen technological capabilities for the long haul.

[TITLE]How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business:
[TEXT]
How Trump's 'crony capitalism' has shaken up U.S. business

toggle caption Pool/Getty Images North America

State capitalism. MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.

Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.

"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace," says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.

"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate," she adds. "It's just bad for the economy."

There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.

Sponsor Message

Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.

Lipton calls this capitalism by "schmoozing," and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.

"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products," she says. "If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody."

Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, "In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership."

China-style 'state capitalism'

Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or "rules-based" capitalism.

Sponsor Message

This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.

But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of "state capitalism," in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it "crony capitalism," meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.

"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that," says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.

In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried "

[TITLE]Emerge's 2025 Story of the Year: How the AI Race Fractured the Global Tech Order:
[TEXT]
In brief DeepSeek’s ultra-low-cost AI model shattered the assumption that U.S. chip dominance would indefinitely suppress China’s AI ambitions, triggering a global tech realignment.

By late 2025, the U.S. and China had severely decoupled their AI ecosystems—splitting hardware, software, standards, and supply chains—while embedding civilian AI advances into military doctrine.

The rivalry extended beyond bilateral conflict, forcing allies and emerging economies to choose between American-led proprietary control and China’s open-source influence, all while rare earths, data centers, and defense contracts became frontline assets in a new cold war over intelligence itself.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The great unraveling began with a single number: $256,000. DeepSeek, a year-old Chinese startup, claimed it spent that relatively small sum training an AI model that matched the capabilities of OpenAI—which spent over a hundred million dollars to get to the same place. When the app hit Apple's store in January, Nvidia lost $600 billion in a single trading day, which was the largest one-day wipeout in market history.

The technical feat aside, DeepSeek’s efficiency breakthrough quickly ignited a global contest far beyond benchmarks or code. Nvidia's China market share had collapsed from 95% to zero. Beijing banned all foreign AI chips from government data centers. The Pentagon signed $10 billion in AI defense contracts. And the world's two largest economies had split the technology stack into warring camps, from silicon to software to standards.

The AI war of 2025 was redrawing the map of global power.

DeepSeek's breakthrough exposed a strategic miscalculation that had defined American AI policy for years: the belief that controlling advanced chips would permanently cripple China's ambitions. The company trained its R1 model using older H800 GPUs—chips that fell below export control thresholds—proving that algorithmic efficiency could compensate for hardware disadvantages.

"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen—and as open source, a profound gift to the world," venture capitalist Marc Andreessen posted on X after testing it.

Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world. 🤖🫡 — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) January 24, 2025

The AI market entered panic mode. Stocks tanked, politicians started polishing their patriotic speeches, analysis exposed the intricacies of what could end up in a bubble, and enthusiasts mocked American models that cost orders of magnitude more than the Chinese counterparts, which were free, cheap and required a fraction of the money and resources to train.

Washington's response was swift and punishing. The Trump administration expanded export controls throughout the year, banning even downgraded chips designed specifically for the Chinese market. By April, Trump restricted Nvidia from shipping its H20 chips.

“While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Secruities, told CNN.

The tit-for-tat escalated into full decoupling. A new China's directive issued in September banned Nvidia, AMD, and Intel chips from any data center receiving government money—a market worth over $100 billion since 2021. Jensen Huang revealed the company's market share in China had hit "zero, compared to 95% in 2022."

﻿

“At the moment, we are 100% out of China,” Huang said. “I can’t imagine any policymaker thinking that’s a good idea—that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world to zero.” He called U.S. policy "a mistake" that would backfire by accelerating Chinese chip independence.

He was right. Huawei and domestic players like Cambricon now dominate China's AI infrastructure. By year's end, analysts projected Chinese chipmakers would capture 40% of the domestic AI server market—a stunning reversal from near-total American dominance just three years earlier.

But the semiconductor war was only the surface. Beneath it, America deployed its most potent weapon: control over the economics of the global market, setting up an "AI Action Plan" in July and a policy of tariffs and sanctions aimed at cementing its political and financial dominance.

In response, China began to exert control over the physical elements that make modern technology possible. In October, Beijing announced the strictest rare earth export controls in its history. The new restrictions didn't just limit sales—they applied the Foreign Direct Product Rule to rare earths for the first time, meaning even products made outside China using Chinese rare earth technology would require export licenses. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be automatically denied.

The target was unmistakable: America's defense industrial base. China controls 94% of permanent magnet production and 90% of rare earth refining—the elements essential for F-35 fighter jets, Tomahawk missiles, and the AI chips that power autonomous weapons. The expanded controls covered holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, each critical to defense systems.

The U.S. wasn’t caught flat-footed. In July, the Pentagon had invested $400 million in MP Materials, America's only rare earth miner, becoming its largest shareholder. The deal included a 10-year price floor of $110 per kilogram—nearly double the market rate—to protect domestic production from Chinese price dumping. But even with this investment, MP Materials would produce just 1,000 tons of neodymium-boron-iron magnets by year's end—less than 1% of China's 138,000-ton output.

"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earths strategic reserve," University of Pennsylvania finance professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC. The supply chain warfare had exposed a vulnerability more fundamental than chip design: America's military depended on adversary-controlled minerals to function.

The AI battle of the titans is continuing. In late November, Trump signed an executive order launching the Genesis Mission—a Department of Energy-led AI initiative the White House compared in "urgency and ambition" to the Manhattan Project.

The Genesis Mission aims to build an integrated AI platform that would harness decades of federal scientific datasets to train "scientific foundation models" and deploy AI agents for autonomous research and discovery. Its goals range from nuclear fusion to advanced manufacturing to semiconductor development, with the platform designed to give American researchers access to supercomputing resources and proprietary datasets no Chinese lab could match.

But whether the $400 million already invested in rare earth mining or the Genesis Mission's national laboratory network can offset China's manufacturing dominance remains unclear—but Washington is now treating AI supremacy as a matter of wartime urgency.

From trade war to actual war?

It turns out that China's advancements were the product of a Military-Civil Fusion Strategy, as the Marine Corps call it. Under Xi Jinping's oversight, China started to create an integrated ecosystem where nearly every technological advance can also serve military purposes.

PLA strategists envision AI transforming not just weapons but warfare itself. Large language models would conduct cognitive operations, manipulating adversary perceptions and decision-making. Swarms of obsolete fighters converted to autonomous drones would overwhelm defenses through sheer scale. The goal: transition to "intelligentized warfare" where speed of decision-making—measured in milliseconds—determines victory.

In the west, Silicon Valley's relationship with the Pentagon also underwent its own revolution. Tech giants that once banned military work now competed for defense contracts worth hundreds of billions. The whole trend started back in December 2024, when Palantir and Anduril announced a consortium to build AI infrastructure for the military.

OpenAI, which had prohibited weapons applications, reversed course and signed defense partnerships with the Pentagon. Google, which abandoned Project Maven in 2018 after employee protests, quietly returned with a $200 million Pentagon contract in July. Anthropic also started to adopt a more anti-China political stance, urging governments to intervene to hinder China's advances and securing a western dominance of the industry.

The battle for the consumer

While hardware wars raged and militaries mobilized, American companies staged a comeback in AI's most visible consumer domain: video generation. OpenAI's Sora 2, released in September, set new standards with synchronized audio, 4K resolution, and multi-shot storytelling. Google's Veo 3 and its 3.1 update followed, leveraging unrestricted access to H100 and H200 chips that Chinese competitors couldn't obtain.

Just a few months earlier, China's Kuaishou and other firms had led text-to-video development. Now American firms dominated, proving that in compute-intensive domains, hardware access remained decisive.

The American resurgence extended beyond video to the foundational models themselves. In November, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5—what the company called "the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use." The model became the first to break 80% on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring real-world software engineering capabilities, outperforming both OpenAI's GPT-5.1 and Google's Gemini 3 Pro. Anthropic claimed the model scored higher on its internal engineering tests than any human job candidate ever had. For an industry that had spent January panicking over DeepSeek's efficiency breakthrough, Claude Opus 4.5 served as a reminder that American labs still held the performance crown—at least for now.

China vs. world: Open-source models fight it out

2025 was also a great year for open-source models. In fact, one could argue that this was the year open-source AI caught up—and, again, it involved its own dose of the good old China vs America drama.

Image: NBC

Alibaba's Qwen family alone accounted for 40% of new language models uploaded monthly to Hugging Face, spawning over 100,000 derivatives and 600 million downloads. The open approach built soft power that export controls couldn't touch—developers worldwide could run Chinese models without restriction, creating a parallel ecosystem independent of American infrastructure.

And how can you prevent a global adoption of free open source models? With regulations.

China's DeepSeek faced bans across dozens of countries. Italy moved first in January, blocking the app over data privacy violations. Taiwan, Australia, South Korea, and multiple U.S. states and agencies followed. By July, NATO allies including the Czech Republic branded DeepSeek a "Trojan horse" for Beijing's intelligence services.

Meta's Llama used to be the most popular LLM in the community; the fourth generation was released this year. OpenAI also released GPT-oss, its only open source model in years. Besides that, the open-source LLM community didn't see much hype in America. Ai2 released a family of models trained in America from scratch, and other companies, including Perplexity, fine-tuned DeepSeek to make it more pro-US and anti-China in its responses.

Not everything is rivalry, though, when developers leave geopolitical fights aside and work towards common goals, they come up with nice products. The models developed by Nous Research—a research team from America, China, Europe and the UAE—is a good example of that.

Besides the China-US Cold-War 2.0, other governments also started to get more involved in AI, setting it as a key element of their public agendas.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE pledged $2 trillion in AI investments during Trump's May visit—money dwarfing American hyperscaler spending. Saudi Arabia's $600 billion commitment included partnerships with Nvidia, AMD, Google Cloud, and AWS to build 2,200 megawatts of data center capacity—more than four times the UAE's 500 megawatts.

Both nations walked a tightrope, wanting American chips and expertise while maintaining deep China ties through Huawei-built telecommunications infrastructure. Washington demanded they choose sides, imposing strict controls to ensure AI hardware didn't reach Beijing or Moscow.

Europe too mounted its own sovereignty bid. The European Commission unveiled a €200 billion InvestAI initiative in April, targeting AI gigafactories and data infrastructure to reduce dependence on American and Chinese technology. But by year's end, the €200 billion remained largely aspirational. Europe allocated just 18% of its €252 billion in venture capital to AI between 2020-2025, compared to America's 34% of $1.33 trillion.

The fracturing carries profound implications. Trade patterns are realigning. Military doctrines are being rewritten around AI-enabled warfare. Developing nations face pressure to choose between eastern and western standards—decisions that will shape their digital governance for decades.

China's bet on open-source democratization versus America's proprietary model represents competing visions of technological power. Beijing seeks influence through freely available tools that create dependencies subtler than export controls. Washington relies on maintaining leads in frontier capabilities and controlling access to the most powerful systems.

Neither strategy guarantees victory. China's open models gain adoption but sacrifice economic returns that fund development. America's closed systems generate revenue but risk irrelevance if developers migrate to unrestricted alternatives. Europe… is being Europe.

What began as a trade dispute over AI chips has metastasized into full-spectrum competition encompassing technology, ideology, resources, and military doctrine. China weaponized its rare earth monopoly. America mobilized its defense industrial base. Both nations fused civilian innovation with military applications in a race toward AI-enabled warfare that has no precedent in history.

The silicon iron curtain that descended in 2025 may prove as consequential as the one that divided Europe for half a century. Only this time, the fault line runs through every smartphone, data center, autonomous system, and permanent magnet that powers modern civilization. The great divide has begun.

[TITLE]Some Florida homebuyers are using AI to get homes without agents, saving thousands:
[TEXT]
Homebuyers in Florida have quietly begun closing on homes without using an agent — relying instead on artificial intelligence to search listings, generate offers and draft contracts.

Tech startup Homa says at least 10 homes have already closed end-to-end using its AI-powered system, with several more deals currently in escrow — a shift that could challenge a commission-driven industry already rattled by a recent landmark National Association of Realtors settlement.

Homa’s platform allows buyers to self-represent, cutting out the buyer’s agent commission — typically around 2.5% to 3% — and either pocket the savings or apply them toward closing costs.

Those savings can be substantial.

DJ, a 32-year-old pharmacist, said he bought a $420,000 home in the Tampa Bay area using Homa and saved $10,500 on a buyer’s agent commission.

Like many retirement communities, The Terraces serves as a tranquil refuge for a nucleus of older people who no longer can travel to faraway places or engage in bold adventures.

But they can still be thrust back to their days of wanderlust and thrill-seeking whenever caretakers at the community in Los Gatos, California, schedule a date for residents — many of whom are in their 80s and 90s — to take turns donning virtual reality headsets.

Within a matter of minutes, the headsets can transport them to Europe, immerse them in the ocean depths or send them soaring on breathtaking hang-gliding expeditions while they sit by each other. The selection of VR programming was curated by Rendever, a company that has turned a sometimes isolating form of technology into a catalyst for better cognition and social connections in 800 retirement communities in the United States and Canada.

A group of The Terraces residents who participated in a VR session earlier this year found themselves paddling their arms alongside their chairs as they swam with a pod of dolphins while watching one of Rendever’s 3D programs. “We got to go underwater and didn’t even have to hold our breath!” exclaimed 81-year-old Ginny Baird following the virtual submersion.

During a session featuring a virtual ride in a hot-air balloon, one resident gasped, “Oh my God!” Another shuddered, “It’s hard to watch!”

The Rendever technology can also be used to virtually take older adults back to the places where they grew up as children. For some, it will be the first time they’ve seen their hometowns in decades.

A virtual trip to her childhood neighborhood in New York City’s Queens borough helped sell Sue Livingstone, 84, on the merits of the VR technology even though she still is able to get out more often than many residents of The Terraces, which is located in Silicon Valley about 55 miles south of San Francisco.

“It isn’t just about being able to see it again, it’s about all the memories that it brings back,” Livingstone said. “There are a few people living here who never really leave their comfort zones. But if you could entice them to come down to try out a headset, they might find that they really enjoy it.”

Adrian Marshall, The Terraces’ community life director, said that once word about a VR experience spreads from one resident to another, more of the uninitiated typically become curious enough to try it out — even if it means missing out on playing Mexican Train, a dominoes-like board game that’s popular in the community.

“It turns into a conversation starter for them. It really does connect people,” Marshall said of Rendever’s VR programming. “It helps create a human bridge that makes them realize they share certain similarities and interests. It turns the artificial world into reality.”

Rendever, a privately owned company based in Somerville, Massachusetts, hopes to build upon its senior living platform with a recent grant from the National Institutes of Health that will provide nearly $4.5 million to study ways to reduce social isolation among seniors living at home and their caregivers.

Some studies have found VR programming presented in a limited viewing format can help older people maintain and improve cognitive functions, burnish memories and foster social connections with their families and fellow residents of care facilities. Experts say the technology may be useful as an addition to and not a replacement for other activities.

“There is always a risk of too much screen time,” Katherine “Kate” Dupuis, a neuropsychologist and professor who studies aging issues at Sheridan College in Canada, said. “But if you use it cautiously, with meaning and purpose, it can be very helpful. It can be an opportunity for the elderly to engage with someone and share a sense of wonder.”

VR headsets may be an easier way for older people to interact with technology instead of fumbling around with a smartphone or another device that requires navigating buttons or other mechanisms, said Pallabi Bhowmick, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who is examining the use of VR with older adults.

“The stereotypes that older adults aren’t willing to try new technology needs to change because they are willing and want to adapt to technologies that are meaningful to them,” Bhowmick said. “Besides helping them to relieve stress, be entertained and connect with other people, there is an intergenerational aspect that might help them build their relationships with younger people who find out they use VR and say, ‘Grandpa is cool!’”

Rendever CEO Kyle Rand’s interest in helping his own grandmother deal with the emotional and mental challenges of aging pushed him down a path that led him to cofound the company in 2016 after studying neuroengineering at Duke University.

“What really fascinates me about humans is just how much our brain depends on social connection and how much we learn from others,” Rand said. “A group of elderly residents who don’t really know each other that well can come together, spend 30 minutes in a VR experience together and then find themselves sitting down to have lunch together while continuing a conversation about the experience.”

It’s a large enough market that another VR specialist, Dallas-based Mynd Immersive, competes against Rendever with services tailored for senior living communities.

Besides helping create social connections, the VR programming from both Rendever and Mynd has been employed as a possible tool for potentially slowing down the deleterious effects of dementia. That’s how another Silicon Valley retirement village, the Forum, sometimes uses the technology.

Bob Rogallo, a Forum resident with dementia that has rendered him speechless, seemed to be enjoying taking a virtual hike through Glacier National Park in Montana as he nodded and smiled while celebrating his 83rd birthday with his wife of 61 years.

Sallie Rogallo, who doesn’t have dementia, said the experience brought back fond memories of the couple’s visits to the same park during the more than 30 years they spent cruising around the U.S. in their recreational vehicle.

“It made me wish I was 30 years younger so I could do it again,” she said of the virtual visit to Glacier. “This lets you get out of the same environment and either go to a new place or visit places where you have been.”

In another session at the Forum, 93-year-old Almut Schultz laughed with delight while viewing a virtual classical music performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado and later seemed to want to play with a puppy frolicking around in her VR headset.

“That was quite a session we had there,” Schultz said with a big grin after she took off her headset and returned to reality.

[TITLE]Inside the Tech Shifts That Reshaped Payments and Risk in 2025:
[TEXT]
In 2025, payments, banking and commerce crossed a quiet but consequential threshold. Technologies that once promised efficiency or differentiation became nonnegotiable foundations, reshaping how money moves, how risk is managed and how trust is built at scale. Across dozens of Trackers published this year, a consistent pattern emerged: The conversation shifted from “What’s new” to “What works,” advancing from experimentation to execution.

Whether the focus was automation in receivables and payables, real-time money movement, embedded finance, fraud orchestration or agentic artificial intelligence (AI), the same underlying truth surfaced again and again. Digital capabilities stopped functioning as bolt-ons and began operating as shared architecture, deeply embedded in workflows, decisioning and customer experience.

This year-end Tracker distills the five themes that most clearly defined that transition. Together, they reveal how institutions on the leading edge moved beyond point solutions toward integrated systems. Meanwhile, those that did not risked structural disadvantage in an increasingly real-time, AI-driven economy.

1. The Digital Divide: From Tools to Infrastructure

“Financial agility is no longer optional—it’s a necessity to keep up with rising capital costs, customer expectations, financial fraud and other variables that might arise without notice.” Carey O’Connor Kolaja

CEO, Versapay

“From Friction to Flow: AR Automation in 2025,” in collaboration with American Express

In payments, 2025 was the year digitization and automation became foundational.

Across banking, consumer payments and countless business verticals from hospitality to advertising, the Trackers repeatedly told the same story: Paper-based and manual payment tools were no longer enough. The industry directive switched from “Add automation” to “Rebuild the operating backbone,” relying on ever-more-sophisticated technologies to power finance. Payments, data and workflow were increasingly treated as a single system rather than disconnected functions.

Recurring signals:

Advanced technology reshaped both retail and member banking journeys. Trackers from Cantaloupe showed how self-service commerce powered by AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) transformed inventory management , loss prevention and real-time operational control . Meanwhile, Velera Trackers emphasized how digital onboarding, personalized engagement and mobile-first tools became essential to attracting and retaining both Gen Z credit union members and small to mid-sized businesses ( SMBs ).

AP and AR evolved from back-office functions into strategic revenue engines. American Express and Edenred Pay Trackers showed how accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) automation in business-to-business (B2B) payments improve both working capital management and revenue opportunities, driving organizational success. Finexio and FIS extended these themes, reframing AP and AR as growth levers that strengthen supplier relationships and cash-flow predictability.

Virtual cards became a structural layer in modern finance stacks. Trackers from American Express and WEX described how virtual cards became foundational to modern AP and expense workflows, embedding spend controls, data and automation directly into supplier systems, turning payments themselves into programmable infrastructure.

Why it mattered: Institutions that treated digital as the operational bedrock—not an overlay—unlocked scale, speed and resilience. Those that didn’t risked falling behind, no matter how many point solutions they deployed.

2. The Instant Shift: From Differentiator to Default

“We’re seeing a steep rise in interest across every banking and business sector for real-time payments. Where banks once asked which customers wanted it, now customers expect it and ask why it’s not available. This shift is driving banks to invest not just in receiving instant payments but also in letting customers originate them, opening new opportunities.” Jim Colassano

Senior Vice President, RTP® Business Product Management, The Clearing House

“The Real-Time Rush: FIs’ Race to Keep Up With Instant Payments Innovation”

Real-time payments crossed the psychological threshold in 2025.

What began as a special feature in earlier years became a baseline expectation. Across consumers, SMBs and large enterprises alike, faster money increasingly meant better experience—and anything slower felt broken.

Recurring signals:

Why it mattered: Speed alone stopped being the headline. Choice, reliability and liquidity became the real competitive edge, separating scalable real-time strategies from pilot programs.

3. The Embedded Evolution: From Consumer Magnet to B2B Standard

“The embedded finance revolution that transformed consumer payments is now reshaping B2B commerce—with far greater stakes. In 2025, businesses are embedding working capital, virtual cards and automated workflows directly into their platforms, turning financial operations into growth engines.” Sandy Weil

Chief Revenue Officer, Galileo

“The Next Frontier: Why Embedded B2B Finance Is Breaking Out in 2025”

Embedded finance moved from consumer convenience to business as usual.

In 2025, embedded payments, lending and B2B finance showed clear signs of maturity—particularly when aligned to specific verticals and workflows rather than deployed as generic platforms. The most successful implementations were nearly invisible, integrated directly into the systems where users already worked.

Recurring signals:

Embedded B2B payments and finance scaled inside AP and supplier networks. Finexio , Galileo and Worldpay Trackers showed how payments embedded within procurement and supplier workflows reduced friction and accelerated cash flow.

Core modernization became popular through modular layers rather than rip-and-replace. Finix , FIS , Galileo , Velera and WEX Trackers emphasized how low-code platforms, payment hubs and modular architectures allowed institutions to modernize incrementally without destabilizing legacy cores.

Vertical-first strategies outperformed horizontal “one-size-fits-all” models. Finix showed how verticals as diverse as education, healthcare and field services benefited from embedded payments and finance designed around industry-specific needs.

“Buy, don’t build” became the dominant philosophy. Galileo and WEX demonstrated how institutions prioritized speed and specialization over ownership, outsourcing embedded capabilities rather than developing them internally.

Why it mattered: Embedded finance worked best when it disappeared into context, tightly aligned to use case, industry and user intent. In 2025, execution mattered more than ambition.

4. The Safety Mandate: From Trust to Optimization

“Fraud is evolving too quickly for merchants to rely on one tool or one approach. Fraud orchestration brings those signals and decisions together so teams can protect revenue without adding friction.” Adam Hiatt

Vice President, Fraud Strategy, Spreedly

“Orchestrating Trust: The Future of Fraud Prevention in Payments”

Security stopped being a gatekeeper and became a growth lever.

One of the clearest shifts of 2025 was the reframing of fraud prevention. Rather than a defensive layer bolted onto payments, fraud management became part of experience design, revenue protection and trust.

Recurring signals:

Fraud orchestration became a strategic necessity as false declines emerged as a business risk. Spreedly and Worldpay Trackers showed how unnecessary declines erode revenue and loyalty, prompting merchants to replace siloed fraud tools with unified orchestration layers that coordinate identity signals, risk scoring and payment decisioning in real time .

AI-driven decisioning became standard across both consumer and B2B payments. Worldpay and The Clearing House highlighted how behavioral analytics, identity intelligence and real-time risk scoring converged into a unified decision layer, while Edenred Pay showed how AP teams increasingly rely on AI to detect anomalous supplier behavior and prevent invoice manipulation.

Why it mattered: The winners didn’t choose between security and experience. They engineered systems that delivered both—by design, not by compromise. That same convergence of trust, intelligence and orchestration set the stage for AI’s next evolution.

5. The AI Breakout: From Aid to Agent

“The story of agentic commerce is ultimately a story about confidence—confidence in technology, in partnerships and in possibility. As AI agents begin to transact for us, our collective responsibility is to ensure they do so safely, transparently and for the benefit of everyone.” Haydon Croker

SVP of Strategy and Acquisitions, Worldpay

“Agents of Change: How Agentic AI Is Redefining Commerce”

AI graduated from support tool to active participant in commerce and payments.

Rather than simply surfacing insights, AI took on agentic roles—coordinating decisions, triggering actions and adapting in real time as conditions changed. This was especially visible in payments, fraud and checkout environments, where speed and context are critical.

Recurring signals:

AI evolved from analytics to active coordination across B2B and consumer payment workflows. Edenred Pay , Finexio and FIS Trackers showed how AI now powers smarter invoice validation, supplier risk scoring, cash-flow forecasting and AR automation—turning data into real-time operational decisions. This shift laid the groundwork for the next phase of intelligence: AI agents.

Agentic systems operated within live workflows. Spreedly , Visa and Worldpay Trackers highlighted how AI began acting autonomously within defined guardrails, responding dynamically to risk, intent and transaction context.

Human intent, trust and explainability became as important as accuracy. Spreedly emphasized the need for transparency and human-aligned decisioning as AI systems took on more responsibility.

Why it mattered: Agentic AI marked a new milestone, where intelligence was defined not just by analysis and prediction but also by effective action and decision-making within controlled environments.

The Road to 2026

These five themes point to a broader inflection moment. In 2025, the payments and banking industry did not simply adopt new tools; it rewired how financial systems operate, make decisions and earn trust. Speed became expected, embedded finance became operational, security became strategic and AI became active rather than assistive.

Looking ahead to 2026, one signal looms especially large: blockchain’s gradual shift from experimentation to institutional infrastructure. As Citi’s blockchain Tracker underscored this year, tokenization, programmable money and regulated digital assets are no longer theoretical: They are shaping how liquidity, settlement and trust may function in the next generation of financial markets.

If 2025 was the year digital foundations solidified, 2026 may be the year those foundations support entirely new forms of financial coordination. The winners will be those who treat infrastructure, intelligence and trust not as separate initiatives but as a single system designed to scale.

[TITLE]Motive files for IPO, signaling next phase of fleet-tech arms race:
[TEXT]
Fleet telematics provider Motive has filed paperwork to go public, a move that could intensify competition in the commercial trucking technology market amid a prolonged freight downturn.

San Francisco-based Motive disclosed Tuesday that it filed a registration statement for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MTVE, according to company statements and regulatory filings. The company has not yet set a share price or offering size.

Motive provides AI-powered tools for fleet tracking, driver safety, compliance, equipment monitoring and spend management. Founded in 2013 as KeepTruckin, the company says it now serves nearly 100,000 customers across transportation, logistics, construction, energy and manufacturing.

Motive’s competitors in the fleet telematics market include Samsara (NYSE: IOT), Geotab (NYSE: GEO), Fleetio and Trimble (Nasdaq: TRMB), all offering comprehensive solutions for GPS tracking, ELD compliance, driver safety, fuel management and maintenance.

In September, Motive won a legal case against Samsara, with a judge ruling that Motive did not infringe on any valid Samsara patents.

Motive is backed by Alphabet’s venture capital arm, GV (Google Ventures).

For the trucking industry, Motive’s move toward public markets underscores how telematics and automation have evolved from optional add-ons into core infrastructure. Carriers continue to face thin margins, elevated insurance costs and tighter regulatory oversight — pressures that have driven adoption of dashcams, automated reporting and real-time vehicle data.
