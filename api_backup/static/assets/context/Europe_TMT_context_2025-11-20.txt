[TITLE]The State of the Open Social Web:
[TEXT]
With today’s news of a new leadership team for Mastodon, I thought it would be a good time to take stock of the state of the open social web.

I’m not new to this space, or an impartial observer: I co-founded Elgg, one of the first open source social networking platforms, over twenty years ago. It was used by governments, Fortune 500 companies, global NGOs, and universities, and embraced early open standards. Known, a social publishing platform I co-founded, was used by media companies to build award-winning communities. And I’m on the board of A New Social, a non-profit dedicated to bridging open social platforms.

What is the open social web?

When you think of social media, many of the platforms you think of are what we call proprietary: their underlying software is private to the companies that build them, and it’s very difficult to move your data or your connections anywhere else. They are, in a very real way, closed. The indie web movement goes so far as to call them silos.

These proprietary silos include:

Anyone whose brand or livelihood depends on these networks has created risk for themselves: there’s nothing to stop any of them from changing their business policies in a detrimental way, as X did when it labeled NPR as state-affiliated media. Any of these networks could disappear, as TikTok almost did in the US before being strong-armed into selling its US business to a Trump ally. And referrals to websites could dry up, as happened in Canada when Meta stopped linking to news sites.

Proprietary silos each have an owner that can, ultimately, do what it wants with them. At best, that can mean that users receive content through curated feeds that might suppress certain kinds of content (including links to certain publishers) and promote others. At worst, it means that traffic and reach could disappear at any time.

In contrast, open social web platforms are designed not to be silos. While each platform is built by a core vendor or community, they run on open protocols that anyone can build software for.

Why should you care?

Remember AOL? That was a closed silo. To publish content, you needed to have a relationship with AOL the company. But you don’t need to have a relationship with anyone in particular to publish a website.

The open social web works the same way as the web itself: it’s permissionless. You don’t need to have a relationship with anyone in particular to have a profile and gain reach. And that means nobody can take it away from you.

Just as AOL became less and less relevant, because maintaining a relationship with AOL the company was more friction than simply publishing a website, silos will become less important and the open social web will become more important over time.

It’s early days in that movement. The user bases are still small in comparison. Today, these networks are still mostly filled with early adopters. In my direct experience working with ProPublica, they’re more likely to engage with journalism and information, more likely to donate to non-profit causes, and more likely to re-share according to their values — perhaps because they’re people who have self-selected to move away from proprietary silos. That means these networks are worth engaging with now — and because they will continue to grow, doing so is a good investment in the future.

So what are those open social web platforms and what is their status today?

Prevailing open social web networks

There are two main open social web networks. This isn’t so much a rivalry as a technical consideration: each is based on a different open protocol.

I’ll describe them both in turn.

The Fediverse

You’ve probably heard of Mastodon. When Musk bought Twitter in late 2022, this was the first network that people flocked to, although it had been running for many years before that.

It can be hard for newcomers to get their head around. Whereas to join a silo network you just go to that network’s website and

[TITLE]Your Smartphone, Their Rules: How App Stores Enable Corporate-Government Censorship:
[TEXT]

Who controls what you can do on your mobile phone? What happens when your device can only run what the government decides is OK? We are dangerously close to this kind of totalitarian control, thanks to a combination of government overreach and technocratic infrastructure choices.

Most Americans have a smartphone, and the average American spends over 5 hours a day on their phone. While these devices are critical to most people’s daily lives, what they can actually do is shaped by what apps are readily available. A slim majority of American smartphone users use an iPhone, which means they can only install apps available from Apple’s AppStore. Nearly all the rest of US smartphone users use some variant of Android, and by default they get their apps from Google’s Play Store.

Collectively, these two app stores shape the universe of what is available to most people as they use the Internet and make their way through their daily lives. When those app stores block or limit apps based on government requests, they are shaping what people can do, say, communicate, and experience.

Recently, Apple pulled an app called ICEBlock from the AppStore, making it unavailable in one fell swoop. This app was designed to let people anonymously report public sightings of ICE agents. In the United States people absolutely have a First Amendment right to inform others

[TITLE]Physical AI Moves from Automation to a New Workforce Layer:
[TEXT]
Physical AI is emerging as the next stage of robotics as advances in sensing, perception and large AI models give machines capabilities that traditional automation never supported. Earlier robots followed fixed commands and worked only in predictable environments, struggling with the unpredictability found in everyday operations such as shifting layouts, varying item shapes, mixed lighting, and human movement.

That is beginning to change as research groups show how simulation, digital twins and multimodal learning pipelines enable robots to learn adaptive behaviors and carry those behaviors into real facilities with minimal retraining.

Meet the New Workforce

Work from Fraunhofer IESE describes how digital engineering techniques, including virtual replicas of factory floors and logistics routes, help robots build robust skills before they ever enter a building, reducing deployment risks and giving operators far more control over performance. These simulation workflows also allow robots to learn to navigate dynamic spaces and handle variation safely and consistently.

The World Economic Forum reported a similar shift underway in manufacturing. Their analysis explained how improvements in robot dexterity, machine perception, environment mapping and model-based reasoning are moving robots from isolated, fenced-off stations into shared work areas where they support production, inspection and transport tasks. According to their research, companies are beginning to treat robots as intelligent mobile systems that can adjust to new product lines, switch tasks and work next to people without requiring rigid constraints.

At the same time, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University highlighted how new sensor designs, tactile perception and simulation-to-reality training methods are enabling robots to operate reliably in crowded, multi-actor environments. Their work examines how robots trained on thousands of simulated scenarios can perform accurately in real workplaces, even as conditions shift hour by hour.

These developments are reshaping how companies think about robotics. Physical AI is becoming a dependable workforce layer that sits between human teams and digital systems. Robots equipped with physical AI can interpret high-level instructions, navigate corridors or warehouse aisles, adjust to real-time conditions and handle repetitive workflows at consistent speed.

Enterprises are beginning to use these systems to stabilize throughput, reduce error rates and maintain operational continuity during volatile staffing periods. The Wall Street Journal noted that companies in logistics, retail, healthcare and manufacturing are prioritizing robots that combine perception, reasoning and connected motion so physical workflows can run continuously and share real-time intelligence with planning platforms.

How Companies Are Putting Physical AI Into Practice

Amazon’s deployment of its Vulcan robot is one of the clearest examples of physical AI moving from research to frontline operations. Vulcan uses both vision and touch to pick and stow items in fulfillment centers, allowing it to handle flexible fabric storage pods and unpredictable product shapes. Amazon explained that Vulcan’s tactile systems let it respond to pressure, contact and motion in real time so it can complete tasks that previously depended on human dexterity. The robot is already deployed in U.S. and European sites and integrates directly into Amazon’s logistics software, allowing human associates and robots to coordinate assignments smoothly.

Walmart is expanding physical AI systems across its distribution network, using automation platforms that reduce unit-handling costs and improve throughput.

The company is also scaling its robotics footprint through a 2025 agreement in which Symbotic will acquire Walmart’s advanced systems and robotics business and develop AI-enabled automation for its pickup and delivery centers, reflecting a deeper move toward physical-AI-based logistics as reported by Reuters.

Other operators are moving in a similar direction. GXO Logistics recently expanded its physical AI pilots after reporting strong results from its 2025 deployment of an AI-powered narrow-aisle inventory robot that scans pallets, tracks stock levels and feeds real-time data into warehouse systems. GXO said the system performed well enough to justify expansion across U.S. and European sites. These examples show how enterprises are deploying physical AI not as experimental projects but as core operational infrastructure that stabilizes throughput, lowers cost and provides real-time visibility into physical workflows.

[TITLE]Public Money, Private Innovation: How Government Funding Built – and Sustains – America’s Technological Leadership:
[TEXT]
Yves here. We have regularly amplified the findings of Marianna Mazzucato’s seminal work, The Entrepreneurial State. She documented how the US funded basic research across many universities and fostered creative collaboration with business. That, contrary to ideology, made government, and not the private sector, the leader in innovation by regularly taking risks on fundamental investigation that companies were unable or unwilling to take.

The study below provides a new layer to this general picture. It shows that publicly funded patents that wind up being privately owned are disproportionately productive.

By Andrea Gazzani, Senior Economist Bank Of Italy, Joseba Martinez, Assistant Professor of Economics London Business School, Filippo Natoli, Senior Economist Bank Of Italy, and Paolo Surico, Professor of Economics London Business School. Originally published at VoxEU

The US has long been the world’s innovation powerhouse, based on a system that combines public funding with private initiative. Yet this model is under strain. Using newly digitised US patent data since 1950, this column shows that publicly funded but privately owned patents – just 2% of all US patents – account for around 20% of medium-term fluctuations in productivity and GDP growth. As funding cuts threaten the most productive funders of public R&D, the authors argue that America’s innovation edge rests on the visible hand of public support for basic research.

The US has long been the world’s innovation powerhouse. From semiconductors to the internet, from biotechnology to artificial intelligence, America’s scientific leadership has rested on an ecosystem that combines public funding with private initiative. Yet this model is under strain. Recent debates over proposed budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) come at a time when other economies — notably China and the EU — are increasing public investment in frontier technologies. These shifts have reignited a central question: how much of America’s innovation edge depends on public money?

In a new paper (Gazzani et al. 2025), we provide fresh empirical evidence on the macroeconomic impact of the post-war American innovation model — the one first envisioned by Vannevar Bush in Science, the Endless Frontier (1945). Using newly digitised US patent data that distinguish funding sources and ownership structures, we show that government-funded but privately owned patents — just 2% of all patents — account for roughly 20% of medium-term fluctuations in US productivity and GDP growth. These public–private innovations also crowd in private R&D and investment, underscoring the outsized returns to government support for basic research.

Our findings suggest that the US owes much of its technological dynamism not to the invisible hand of the market alone, but to what might be called the visible hand of government-enabled innovation.

The Global Race for Innovation Leadership

The US government’s role in shaping technological progress is often taken for granted. But in the current policy climate, where deficit concerns dominate, public research funding faces renewed scrutiny. The NIH and NSF — central pillars of American science since the 1950s — are under pressure even as China channels massive state resources into artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and green technologies. The EU, too, has expanded its Horizon Europe programme and national innovation funds to address its lagging productivity growth (see Aghion 2024, Bloom et al. 2019).

This is not the first time such a tension has surfaced. As argued by Mazzucato (2013), government agencies have long been the ‘entrepreneurial state’, de-risking the fundamental research that private firms later commercialise. Recent research has examined this theme from various angles — from the macroeconomic effects of public R&D (Fieldhouse and Mertens 2023) to the connection between fiscal policy in a high-debt environment and productivity growth (Fornaro and Wolf 2025). Our work complements this line of research by tracing, at the aggregate level, how different forms of public and private innovation have shaped US productivity dynamics over the past seven decades.

Mapping America’s Innovation Architecture

Following Bush’s blueprint, post-war US innovation has been built on three pillars:

Government funding for areas of public interest Universities and research institutes to conduct fundamental research Private firms to commercialise the resulting knowledge.

Using the Government Patent Register database (Gross and Sampat 2025), we classify all US patents granted since 1950 into three groups:

Public–private (funded by government, owned by a private entity)

(funded by government, owned by a private entity) Private–private (fully privately funded and owned)

(fully privately funded and owned) Public–public (funded and owned by the government)

We then link these time series to macroeconomic indicators such as total factor productivity (TFP), GDP, R&D expenditure, and investment. By controlling for the business cycle and showing that our innovation measures are not predicted by fiscal and monetary shocks, we isolate the medium-term co-movements between innovation activity and aggregate outcomes.

The results are striking. Figure 1 displays the macroeconomic effects of innovation, showing that public-private patents (first column) are characterised by the largest medium-term impact on both output (first row) and productivity (second row), doubling those of private sector innovations over the same horizons (second column). Government-funded but privately owned patents are also associated with sustained increases in private R&D spending, business investment, and real wages. Though public–private patents make up just 2% of the total, they account for

[TITLE]US has warned others to avoid loans from Chinese state banks. But it's the biggest recipient of all:
[TEXT]
A new report says China funneled billions in hidden loans to U.S. companies over the past quarter century, some targeting industries key to national security

US has warned others to avoid loans from Chinese state banks. But it's the biggest recipient of all

WASHINGTON -- For years, Washington has been warning others not to trust loans from Chinese state banks fueling its rise as a superpower. But a new report reveals an ironic twist: The United States is the biggest recipient of all — by far. And the security and technology implications have yet to be fully understood.

China’s state lenders have funneled $200 billion into U.S. businesses for a quarter of a century, but many of the loans have been kept secret because the money was first routed through shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Delaware and elsewhere that helped obscure their origins, according to AidData, a research lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.

More alarming, much of the lending was to help Chinese companies buy stakes in U.S. businesses, many tied to critical technology and national security, including a robotics maker, a semiconductor company and a biotech firm.

The report found a far more widespread and sophisticated lending network than previously thought — a web of financial obligations extending beyond developing countries to rich ones, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and other U.S. allies.

“China was playing chess while the rest of us were playing checkers,” said former White House investment adviser William Henagan, who worries the hidden lending has given China a chokehold on technologies. “Wars will be won or lost based on whether you can control products critical to running an economy."

While the U.S. still welcomes most foreign investment — and President Donald Trump has courted it — money from China has drawn particular scrutiny as the world's two biggest economies with opposing ideologies battle for global supremacy.

Deals financed by China’s state-owned banks, the ones studied in the AidData report, are especially problematic. The lenders are controlled by China's central government and the Communist Party's Central Financial Commission, and they are directed to advance China’s strategic goals.

In total, the AidData report found China lent more than $2 trillion from 2000 through 2023 around the world, double the highest previous estimates and a surprise to even longtime analysts of China's rise. And much of the lending to wealthy countries was focused on critical minerals and high-tech assets — rare earths and semiconductors needed for fighter jets, submarines, radar systems, precision-guided missiles and telecom networks.

“The U.S., under both (former President Joe) Biden and Trump, have been beating this drum for more than a decade that Beijing is a predatory lender,” said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. “The irony is very rich.”

Until now, a full accounting of China's state lending has never been published because much of the financing is buried beneath layers of secrecy, masked by Western-sounding shell companies and mislabeled by international databases as ordinary private financing.

“There is a complete lack of transparency that speaks to the lengths to which China goes, whether through shell companies or confidentiality agreements or redactions, to make it extremely difficult to come up with this full picture,” said Scott Nathan, the former head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., an agency set up in the first Trump term to invest in foreign projects deemed in the U.S. national interest.

Since the report’s last documented loan in 2023, U.S. scrutiny has gotten better. Screening mechanisms, such as the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., got beefed up in 2020 to protect sensitive sectors in the economy.

But China has gotten better, too, in part by setting up banks and branches overseas — more than 100 in recent years — that then lend to offshore entities, further clouding the origins of the money.

“In places where there are more cops on the beat," Parks said, “it has found ways to work around barriers to entry.”

Chinese state bank financing has touched projects across the U.S., particularly in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, the West Coast and along the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has renamed the Gulf of America. Many loans targeted critical high-tech industries, according to the report.

— In 2015, for instance, Chinese state-owned banks lent $1.2 billion to a private Chinese business to buy an 80% stake in Ironshore, a U.S. insurer whose clients included the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and undercover agents who might need help paying legal bills in case they got into trouble in their jobs.

U.S. regulators were unaware of the Chinese government involvement because the financing was funneled through a Cayman Island business with no obvious ties to China, according to the report. U.S. officials later realized the Chinese government could access information and ordered the Chinese buyer to divest.

— That same year, the Chinese government published “Made in China 2025," a list of 10 high-tech areas, such as semiconductors, biotechnology and robotics, where it wanted to reach 70% self-sufficiency within a decade. The next year, in 2016, the Export–Import Bank of China, a policy bank, provided $150 million in loans to help a Chinese company buy a robotics equipment company in Michigan.

After China’s adoption of the manufacturing master plan, the percentage of projects targeting sensitive sectors such as robotics, defense, quantum computing and biotechnology rose from 46% to 88% of China’s portfolio for cross-border acquisition lending, according to AidData.

— In 2017, a Delaware private equity firm using a Cayman Islands company tried to buy a U.S. chip maker; the deal was blocked when investigators discovered both companies were owned by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. That same Delaware company successfully bought a U.K. semiconductor maker that had to be divested when British authorities found out.

— And in 2022, the U.K. forced a Chinese company to divest another sensitive British firm in the industry, a designer of chips in Apple phones but potentially adaptable for military systems. The Chinese company had bought it through a company in the Netherlands that they owned. That Dutch firm is now accused of withholding semiconductors vital to automakers in the U.S.-China trade war.

To trace China's hidden lending, AidData dug through regulatory filings, private contracts and stock exchange disclosures in more than 200 countries written in multiple languages.

The effort to track China's state loans and investment started more than a decade ago when Beijing launched its Belt & Road Initiative to build infrastructure in developing countries. The project expanded sharply three years ago when the AidData team, which eventually grew to 140 researchers, realized many of the loans were landing in advanced economies such as the U.S., Australia, the Netherlands and Portugal, where acquisitions could allow it to access technology that Beijing considers essential to its global rise.

The report says the findings show a shift in the use of state credit from promoting economic development and social welfare to gaining geo-economic advantages.

“There’s global concern that this is part of a concerted effort to gain control over economic chokepoints and use this leverage,” said Brad Setser, an adviser to the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. “It’s important that we understand what they’re doing, and they don’t make it easy.”

[TITLE]Merz and Macron in push for European digital 'sovereignty' at Berlin summit:
[TEXT]
Europe must strive to lead in the AI race, top officials urged Tuesday at a summit focused on propelling the region to the forefront of the digital era and reducing its reliance on US tech titans.

As the Berlin gathering got underway, the EU also announced that Amazon and Microsoft cloud services could face stricter competition rules in the bloc as Brussels probes their market power.

The summit brought together leaders from Europe's tech sector, and was to be addressed by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron later Tuesday.

"Europe's goal is very simple: we want to lead, not follow, on AI and frontier technologies," European Commission digital chief Henna Virkkunen told the opening of the event.

"We have the market, we have the talent, we have the ambition. Now we must deliver scale in investment, innovation and uptake."

Europe is responding to calls to blaze its own digital path and take steps to catch up in the AI race against China and the United States.

[TITLE]LaLiga: ISPs Must Join Anti-Piracy War to Secure Broadcasting Rights * TorrentFreak:
[TEXT]
Companies acting as both TV broadcasters and ISPs, will face the most extreme anti-piracy obligations ever seen if they want to air LaLiga football matches from 2027. Mandatory support for LaLiga's anti-piracy strategy will include participation in legal action initiated by LaLiga, immediate site blocking "without need for judicial intervention", investigations into their own customers, plus "legal and extrajudicial action" targeting DNS, VPN, and reverse proxy providers.

For much of 2025, top-tier Spanish football league LaLiga has waged war against online piracy in controversial yet completely unapologetic fashion. A more single-minded approach may not have been deployed by any other entity, ever.

Launched around February, LaLiga’s persistent blocking of Cloudflare (and by extension, countless innocent customers) is a story still being told from distinct perspectives.

In LaLiga’s view, a court order granted it the necessary authority to block pirate sites. In the event that collateral damage even exists, that should be attributed to Cloudflare for a) harboring pirate sites and b) using innocent customers as ‘human shields’ by forcing them to use the same IP addresses as pirate sites. Cloudflare regrets that LaLiga saw fit to obtain a business-disrupting blocking order, without giving it an opportunity to appear in court, causing a rift that still hasn’t been bridged 10 months later.

Silent Cooperation No Longer Enough

The voices of the innocent sites and services, blocked by Spanish ISPs at LaLiga’s behest, have complained but haven’t really been heard. When approached by customers for comment, the ISPs carrying out the blocking haven’t been heard either, mostly because they have said very little indeed. Compliance with a court order has been mentioned in their roles as ISPs; as internet broadcasters with rights to air LaLiga broadcasts that presumably benefit from their own blocking? No comment.

The role of Spanish ISPs in whatever comes next won’t be a secret. As LaLiga opens up the bidding process for the seasons 2027/2028 until 2031/32, the league’s expectations are detailed in black and white.

First impressions raise questions of autonomy; specifically, how much independence will ISPs be required to sacrifice under an anti-piracy regime controlled by LaLiga, one in which it dictates policy, compels support for legal action, and mandates cooperation in investigations against their own customers.

Obligations to Collaborate

There’s little doubt that LaLiga views piracy seriously, but should any remain, none have any hope of surviving the obligations laid out in its anti-fraud policy.

The first paragraph states that successful bidders must ensure exclusive access to LaLiga content within the designated territory and implement at minimum several specified security measures. They include Digital Rights Management (DRM), anti-VPN systems, geo-blocking systems at the device and CDN levels, and security marking at both the source and CDN.

Visible watermarking is required to identify users, and measures must be in place to verify their locations. LaLiga also expects documentation to show the location and sources of any unauthorized retransmissions.

General Obligations

LaLiga says that its partners must “collaborate efficiently” and proactively, including against “the provision of public information aimed at promoting or facilitating unauthorized access to said contents,” whether on Facebook and YouTube, or on Whatsapp, Telegram, and Discord. User Generated Content (UGC) platforms, web-based illegal streaming sites, card-sharing services, IPTV suppliers, and BitTorrent-like systems such as Acestream, are all seen as legitimate targets.

Also under the spotlight, authorized entities “who exploit the content abusively and fraudulently.” When LaLiga initiates legal proceedings against these entities, its broadcasting partners are required to participate as an injured party.

LaLiga also places restrictions on the type of viewing devices broadcasters make available to their customers. LaLiga says that there are only three “safe environments” for installing software – Google Play Store, Huawei AppGallery and iOS Store. Functionality to load software from any other source must be prevented.

Create Synergies, Share Details of Users Detected as Pirates

When rights organization Promusicae sued Telefonica in 2005, demanding the identities of customers accused of pirating music, Telefonica fought all the way to Europe’s highest court to avoid handing over its customers’ personal details.

In 2008, the Court of Justice of the European Union handed Telefonica a landmark win.

But that was then, and this is now.

[T]he successful bidders who, by virtue of their status as telecommunications operators, are internet service providers, undertake to actively cooperate in judicial actions such as preliminary proceedings, aimed, at the request of LaLiga, at identifying those customers who access audiovisual content illicitly through the internet service, through illegal systems such as, for example, P2P (AceStream) or Cardsharing, avoiding formalizing an appeal against the judicial resolutions agreed upon in this area.

ISPs Must Promote Dynamic IP Address Blocking to the Courts

At a time when internet groups and researchers are issuing warnings over the dangers of IP address-based blocking, becoming a successful bidder for LaLiga broadcasting rights requires ISPs not to just ignore the advice, but to invest time and resources to ensure the courts endorse its use.

LaLiga says that the effectiveness of the measures must be promoted as effective against third-party intermediaries it perceives as undermining its blocking efforts.

They include VPN and DNS providers, anonymization services and, in a move unlikely to be well received at the White House, reverse proxy services. Despite receiving no direct mention here, a well-known American company would likely become a primary target.

Extracted from the original (Spanish)

The Successful Bidders also undertake to promote a joint policy against audiovisual fraud and to cooperate in speeding up the adoption of dynamic blocking of those websites and web resources identified as broadcasting, distributing, or sharing LALIGA content without consent, in particular, the modality of “live dynamic blocking” via IP, as well as through any of its technical modalities, collaborating to promote its adoption by the courts of justice and cooperating to achieve maximum effectiveness in the shortest possible time, providing, if necessary, the necessary personnel and means to ensure that such blocks, communicated by whoever is judicially designated for this purpose, take effect any day and time of the week immediately upon communication. The successful bidders undertake to promote, together with LaLiga, the appropriate judicial and extrajudicial actions to promote the effectiveness of the blocks, in particular against third-party intermediaries whose services are used for the direct or indirect circumvention of the aforementioned blocks, such as, for example, providers of VPNs, reverse proxies, anonymization services, DNS, and/or hosting services.

Immediate Blocking Without Need For Judicial Intervention

An issue as potentially serious as this deserves another direct quote. For obvious reasons the statement here is translated from the original Spanish, but the original document is linked below and available for review.

The Successful Bidders, regardless of whether they are established in the territory or not, voluntarily, expressly and directly undertake, without the need for judicial intervention, to agree to the immediate blocking of those domains, subdomains, IP addresses and web pages and resources that, for violating intellectual property rights and other related rights, are notified to them by LALIGA or by the entity designated by it through any means of notification that allows proof of receipt, who will provide as proof of this evidentiary support extracted and compiled through any of the trusted providers approved by the Spanish or European authorities, together with a technical report issued by their audiovisual anti-fraud department, thereby taking effective knowledge of the illicit nature of the actions of the domains, subdomains and IPs. Both the supporting evidence and the technical report will be recognized by all Successful Bidders as sufficient proof to directly and free of charge agree to the requested block, which will be facilitated immediately upon receipt of the request by LaLiga.

Surprisingly, the above isn’t even a full accounting of all requirements, far from it, so we’ll return to the topic later.

At this point it’s worth mentioning the tone of the document, which is absolutely uncompromising in both its determination and the instructions required to achieve its goals. On several occasions the Successful Bidders are warned that if they fail to meet LaLiga’s requirements, and then fail to improve or correct the issue at hand, they will have their contracts terminated.

Failure to comply with these obligations, or their partial or defective compliance, after a reasonable period has been provided for their correction, will be a mandatory cause for automatic termination of the contract, with written notification from LaLiga accompanied by a technical report from its Audiovisual Anti-Fraud Department demonstrating the verification of the non-compliance being sufficient proof for this.
