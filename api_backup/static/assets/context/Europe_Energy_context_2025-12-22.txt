[TITLE]Guyana Is Using Its Oil Revenues to Spark a Renewable Energy Boom:
[TEXT]
Since the discovery of vast oil reserves in Guyana around a decade ago, the South American country’s oil industry has grown significantly following investment from several international oil majors and the beginning of offshore production. As Guyana begins to see the revenue from its black gold, the government is reinvesting some of the money in renewables to diversify the energy mix and strengthen the country’s energy security. Guyana’s government aims to achieve 80 percent renewable energy in the electricity grid by 2040.

In February, the United Nations (UN) in Guyana announced the launch of the Just Energy Transition (JET) Seed Funding Initiative with financing from the Joint Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Fund. The initiative will provide funding to help Guyana undergo a green transition by implementing its Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) 2030. Investments will be made in expanding Guyana’s renewable energy capacity and promoting sustainable mobility. The UN will also provide technical and policy support.

The initiative will support the development of three solar-powered EV charging stations in strategic locations and the delivery of a technical training programme to develop a Guyanese workforce in the renewable energy sector. The UN aims to use the initiative to empower youth, women, and marginalized groups and ensure equitable access to opportunities.

The UN Development Programme’s Officer-in-Charge, Nadira Balram, stated, “The anticipated impact of this initiative is far-reaching. This initiative will create jobs and new economic opportunities. By equipping a new generation of technicians with specialised skills, we are fostering a workforce that is prepared for the transition to a green economy.”

At the national level, the President of Guyana, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, said in a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine that Guyana is using its newfound oil revenues to drive a green transition.

“Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatonnes of carbon,” said Irfaan Ali. “We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, and wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.”

One of the renewable energy industries that Guyana is looking to advance is solar power. Several companies have shown interest in the country’s solar potential, with multiple new solar projects expected to launch in the coming years. The government has gradually been expanding its solar energy capacity, with around 4.8 MW of solar power having been installed under the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Home Energy Systems. The off-grid solar power project launched in 2023 and aims to expand clean electricity access in the hinterland and riverine communities of the country that do not have access to the national grid. The government aims to supply and deliver 30,000 solar PV home energy units as part of the scheme.

In August, the Guyana Energy Agency commissioned a 0.6 MW grid-forming solar farm on the island of Leguan, at a cost of $1.4 million. The project will include a 1.2 MWh battery energy storage system. This follows the installation of a similar solar power system on Wakenaam Island in 2023 and is aimed at providing rural populations with greater energy security.

In November, the Indian green energy firm Oriana Power Limited announced it had been approved by the Guyana Energy Agency to develop a solar energy project in Guyana consisting of the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of a 3 MW grid-tied solar PV system at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport. The contract is valued at almost $2.5 million, and it is expected to be completed within three years.

In July, the government commissioned a 1.5 MW hydropower project, the Kumu plant, in Lethem. This follows the development of the 0.7 MW Moco Moco Hydropower Plant. While Guyana’s hydropower projects are relatively small-scale, the gradual development of the industry demonstrates the government’s commitment to diversifying Guyana’s energy mix.

Prime Minister Mark Phillips stated, “From 2020 to now, we’ve delivered 14.5 megawatts of renewable energy through solar and hydro projects. Today’s commissioning of the 1.5 MW Kumu Hydropower Station builds on that foundation, expanding our renewable energy portfolio while improving quality of life for residents in Region Nine.”

Guyana has transformed from a little-known South American country that was highly dependent on fossil fuel imports less than a decade ago to a growing global oil power. The exploitation of its oil resources is allowing the government to increase spending on green energy to diversify the country’s energy mix from the outset, a feat that has not been possible in most oil-rich countries. Meanwhile, additional technical and funding support from the UN is expected to help Guyana diversify its energy mix and enhance its energy security in the coming years.

[TITLE]What Happens to a Sanctioned Oil Tanker?:
[TEXT]
A 58,000-ton oil tanker called the Mikati was ploughing through the waters of the Indian Ocean one day when it got some bad news from faraway Brussels: it had been added to a list of sanctioned vessels in Russia’s shadow fleet.

The story of the Mikati, currently passing through the English Channel, illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of the European Union sanctions regime that now includes some 600 ships.

The EU listed the Mikati in July, following a similar decision by Britain in November last year. Built in 2003, its advanced age makes it a typical shadow fleet vessel -- as does the behavior that preceded its designation.

Suspicious Behavior

According to data provided to RFE/RL by Windward, a maritime intelligence company, the Mikati went through a series of name changes, was sold to an anonymous owner, and repeatedly turned off its AIS location transponders in the period before it was sanctioned.

This latter is regarded as a dangerous shipping practice by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and is only permitted under special circumstances. The Mikati also changed the flag it was registered under, switching to Sierra Leone.

“Sierra Leone's government outsourced management of its ship registry to a private company based in Cyprus,” Windward analyst Michelle Bockmann told RFE/RL, adding that the country was “the flag registry of choice” for shadow vessels.

Taken together, these indicators were evidence enough to get the Mikati blacklisted. The EU included the Mikati in its 18th sanctions package against Russia on July 18. It had an immediate impact.

Two days later the ship arrived in waters off Kochi, home to one of India’s largest oil refineries. But it did not unload the full cargo it had picked up in Russia’s Barents Sea port of Murmansk a month earlier.

The Mikati pauses off the coast of India on July 29. "The EU has now the ability to sanction ports in third countries for what they call the frustration of EU restrictive measures," said economist Benjamin Hilgenstock.

It’s not clear if there was a hitch or if the Mikati was following pre-arranged plans.

“Sometimes ships are sanctioned when they're already under way, so someone will have to give the buyer a call and ask if the deal is still on,” Benjamin Hilgenstock, a senior economist at the Kyiv-based KSE institute, told RFE/RL.

“They may be told ‘we need to figure this out first, so maybe wait a bit’ -- or ‘we’ll take your oil but only if you give it to us for a little less money,’” he added.

The Samoan Connection

In any case, something was stirring behind the scenes.

On July 25, the Mikati changed its registered owner and commercial manager, moving from Azerbaijan to Samoa, a nation of some 200,000 people in the South Pacific not known for having a thriving shipping industry.

The company listed, Alga Oceanic Ventures, appears to have no Internet presence.

Its address is a business complex called La Sanalele, where its neighbors have included another shipping manager, Faleola Nexus Ltd, operator of an oil tanker named Orion -- sanctioned by Britain and Ukraine for illicit trading in Russian crude.

Another neighbor was a Taiwanese company called Pro-Gain Group Corporation that was sanctioned by the United States in 2018 in connection with illegal dealings in North Korean coal and oil.

The Mikati’s sudden ownership switch was followed by a new voyage, north along the coast to Mangalore. There, on August 3, it signaled that it had unloaded.

“The 11-day delay was probably related to its sanctions and having to get new insurance,” Bockmann said. “That's a really good example of how EU sanctions are disruptive. But they have very little teeth.”

Indeed, despite sanctions, the Mikati unloaded its oil and stayed in service. Sanctioned vessels can’t visit EU ports or get Western insurance and have trouble finding professional crew. But they maintain the “right of innocent passage” through international waters.

An October study by kpler, a trade analytics company, found that “Russia has sustained its crude exports despite the logistical challenges posed by the recent escalation of sanctions targeting shadow fleet tonnage.”

EU vs US Sanctions

Sanctions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) were deemed considerably more effective than by the EU.

“This data set shows that India is OK with accepting European- and UK-sanctioned vessels, but they don't want to accept the OFAC-sanctioned vessels. And probably this shows that India is a bit more reluctant to find themselves in prospects of secondary sanctions by the US,” kpler analyst Panagiotis Krontiras told RFE/RL.

The kpler data details reductions in productivity, measured by the fall in kilometers traveled and tons of cargo carried, for ships under each sanction regime. For the US, there was a 70 percent average decline, for the EU -- 30 percent.

EU Sanctions Envoy David O’Sullivan told RFE/RL that “sanctions are always a bit leaky” and it was always possible to find “examples of a vessel that has nonetheless continued” to operate.

But, he added, “our figures show that once a vessel is sanctioned, it drops its ability to carry Russian oil by

[TITLE]Delfin's Fundraising Set to Slip Into Next Year:
[TEXT]
Delfin Midstream Inc, the developer of a $4.3B LNG export project off the coast of Louisiana, won't complete its planned fundraising until next year, according to people familiar with the matter.

Delfin Midstream Inc., the developer of a $4.3 billion liquefied natural gas export project off the coast of Louisiana, won’t complete its planned fundraising until next year, according to people familiar with the matter.

The closely held company had originally targeted closing the process in November. Efforts to finalize the debt and equity commitments for the Delfin LNG project are ongoing and involve complex transactions, said the people, who asked not be identified because the discussions are confidential. Delfin declined to comment.

LNG project developers in the US are racing to tie up financing before global supplies exceed demand, creating a glut that BloombergNEF expects to emerge by 2027. Global producers are set to add a record 300 billion cubic meters of annual export capacity by 2030, the International Energy Agency wrote in a recent report. That’s poised to reshape the market after years of scarcity.

Companies with agreements to take LNG produced at the Delfin project include German state energy company Securing Energy for Europe GmbH, UK energy company Centrica Plc and commodity trading houses Gunvor Group, Hartree Partners LP and Vitol Group. Vitol is also considering making an equity investment in the project, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in October.

Dibrugarh (Assam), Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Sunday lay the foundation stone for a Rs 10,600-crore brownfield ammonia-urea plant in Dibrugarh district of Assam, giving a fillip to the fertiliser requirement of the entire region.Modi arrived in Assam on Saturday on a two-day trip, during which he is set to unveil multiple projects worth Rs 15,600 crore, around three months before the state is due to go for assembly polls.On the second day of his visit, the PM will lay the foundation stone for a new brownfield ammonia-urea fertiliser project at Namrup within the existing premises of Brahmaputra Valley Fertiliser Corp Ltd (BVFCL), according to an official release by the Prime Minister's Office."Furthering PM's vision of farmers' welfare, the project, with an estimated investment of over Rs 10,600 crore, will meet fertiliser requirements of Assam and neighbouring states, reduce import dependence, generate substantial employment and catalyse regional economic development," it added.The PMO further said that the upcoming facility will stand as a cornerstone of industrial revival and farmer welfare.Following the 'Bhoomi Pujan' ceremony for the new unit -- Assam Valley Fertiliser and Chemical Company Ltd (AVFCCL) -- Modi will also address a public meeting, likely to be attended by thousands of people from several Upper Assam districts.Elections to the 126-member Assam Assembly are likely to take place in March-April next year.In July this year, AVFCCL was incorporated in Namrup in Dibrugarh district. A new plant within the existing premises of BVFCL was approved by the Union cabinet in March this year.AVFCCL is a joint venture between the Assam government, Oil India , National Fertilisers Ltd (NFL), Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Limited (HURL) and BVFCL, aimed at boosting fertiliser production in the Northeast.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her budget speech earlier this year, had announced a new urea plant at Namrup with an annual capacity of 12.7 lakh metric tonnes.PSU Brahmaputra Valley Fertiliser Corp Ltd (BVFCL) is the only urea-making facility in the entire eastern India. The facility started production in January 1969 as a part of the Hindustan Fertiliser Corp Ltd ( HFCL ).BVFCL was formed in April 2002 after hiving off the Namrup unit of HFCL. It is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers with 100 per cent shareholding by the Government of India.It is the first factory of its kind in India to use associated natural gas as basic raw material for producing nitrogenous fertiliser.The company has played a crucial role in the development of the northeastern region and providing the local farmers with urea fertiliser, which is produced from cheap and locally available domestic natural gas.As per the official website of the Department of Fertilisers, the company is now producing neem-coated urea and two organic fertilisers -- liquid bio fertiliser and vermicompost in the brand name of 'Mukta'.It is also trading in other fertilisers like SSP, MoP, DAP, Rock Phosphate and City Compost.BVFCL has two operable ammonia urea units at Namrup with small capacities and these were established in 1976 and 1987.

[TITLE]The Battery Boom Is Reshaping Power Markets:
[TEXT]
The uptake of utility-scale battery storage has grown significantly in recent years as more countries switch to renewables. Battery storage ensures that grids powered by less reliable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, can continue to deliver a stable supply of clean energy through the day and night.

The battery storage boom of recent years has been driven largely by the falling costs of lithium-ion batteries, which have made it possible for utilities worldwide to invest in more batteries. The cost of batteries has fallen by around 90 percent in the last 15 years, as commercial production has expanded. China is currently the world’s biggest battery producer, but several other regions are developing their manufacturing capacity, such as Europe, India, and the United States.

Energy storage additions worldwide are expected to break another record this year, driven by China and the U.S. Global annual energy storage deployment (excluding pumped hydropower plants) is expected to reach 92 GW in 2025, which is 23 percent higher than in 2024. China will contribute more than 50 percent of this capacity increase, while the U.S. will account for around 14 percent. The U.S. contribution of energy storage is impressive, given the difficult year faced by the wind and solar energy industries under the Trump administration. BloombergNEF expects cumulative energy storage capacity in 2035 to reach 2 terawatts, at eight times higher than the level in 2025.

In the United States, battery expansion has been met with mixed success. It is still difficult to convince utilities in certain areas of the country to invest in battery storage. Meanwhile, policymakers are often lukewarm

His work in export-import financing tied to infrastructure projects and engagement with cybersecurity firms to safeguard energy networks demonstrates a comprehensive strategy that blends entrepreneurship with societal impact.

“The goal is to make solutions that are not just innovative, but also practical and scalable. I want to show that renewable energy, infrastructure, and technology can work hand in hand to solve real-world problems. So, whether that’s rebuilding critical infrastructure or creating systems that are resilient for decades to come, we will be able to put a sustainable plan in place.” Singal explained.

Singal’s global reach is carefully targeted. From the Gulf region to Eastern Europe and select U.S. states, he identifies areas where infrastructure gaps intersect with high potential for sustainable energy adoption. By focusing on regions that combine regulatory openness, investor interest, and urgent need, he is creating a model for how entrepreneurial leadership can complement government and institutional efforts.

Observers note that Singal’s combination of ambition and pragmatism sets him apart. Many entrepreneurs focus narrowly on technology or investment, but Singal emphasizes direct implementation, strategic partnerships, and transparent engagement with stakeholders. This approach has positioned him as a subject matter expert and key influencer, capable of influencing both markets and policy.

In addition to his current projects, Singal is actively researching emerging trends in sustainable fuels and electrification. He has emphasized the importance of preparing for evolving regulatory standards, changing energy prices, and shifts in global supply chains; factors that often derail less-prepared initiatives. By anticipating these challenges, he is creating solutions that are both resilient and adaptable, ensuring that projects deliver tangible impact over the long term.

Looking ahead, Singal anticipates continued expansion of his initiatives, with a focus on preventive and sustainable solutions. By blending renewable energy deployment with innovative financing and digital oversight, he aims to stay ahead of emerging challenges in global energy security and sustainability.

“Private entrepreneurs have a huge role to play in the energy sector, going forward. The future is bright for all things green, and we need to be more conscious about the impact we’re making as investors. People have the power to make a real difference in this day and age. It’s no longer a dream; it’s very much a reality.” Concluded Singal.

By merging innovative technology with on-the-ground action, Singal’s initiatives illustrate a compelling model for how private entrepreneurs can drive real change, often faster and more efficiently than traditional institutional structures. His work highlights the potential for ethical, transparent leadership to influence not just markets, but communities and ecosystems, paving the way for a more sustainable and resilient future.

[TITLE]The Battery Boom Is Reshaping Power Markets:
[TEXT]
The uptake of utility-scale battery storage has grown significantly in recent years as more countries switch to renewables. Battery storage ensures that grids powered by less reliable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, can continue to deliver a stable supply of clean energy through the day and night.

The battery storage boom of recent years has been driven largely by the falling costs of lithium-ion batteries, which have made it possible for utilities worldwide to invest in more batteries. The cost of batteries has fallen by around 90 percent in the last 15 years, as commercial production has expanded. China is currently the world’s biggest battery producer, but several other regions are developing their manufacturing capacity, such as Europe, India, and the United States.

Energy storage additions worldwide are expected to break another record this year, driven by China and the U.S. Global annual energy storage deployment (excluding pumped hydropower plants) is expected to reach 92 GW in 2025, which is 23 percent higher than in 2024. China will contribute more than 50 percent of this capacity increase, while the U.S. will account for around 14 percent. The U.S. contribution of energy storage is impressive, given the difficult year faced by the wind and solar energy industries under the Trump administration. BloombergNEF expects cumulative energy storage capacity in 2035 to reach 2 terawatts, at eight times higher than the level in 2025.

In the United States, battery expansion has been met with mixed success. It is still difficult to convince utilities in certain areas of the country to invest in battery storage. Meanwhile, policymakers are often lukewarm

The move Thursday by the California Public Utilities Commission underscores its oft-conflicting policy goals: while the state is keen for power providers to fortify a grid that’s sparked catastrophic wildfires, doing so costs billions of dollars. Those expenses are typically passed on by utilities owned by PG&E Corp., Edison International and Sempra to homes and businesses. State regulators are also trying to minimize further inflation of utility bills.

On a 4-1 vote, returns for PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric — the state’s main investor-owned utilities — were set at a range of 9.78% to 10.03% compared to the national average of about 9.72%.

PG&E had asked for 11.3%, SoCal Edison wanted 11.75% and SDG&E called for 11.25%.
