[TITLE]Novartis announces plans to build flagship manufacturing hub in North Carolina:
[TEXT]
Expansion represents significant investment in North Carolina and is expected to create 700 new jobs in the state by end of 2030

Enables manufacturing of medicines across company’s main therapeutic areas in one geographic location

Marks latest milestone in company’s previously announced $23 billion investment in US infrastructure

East Hanover, November 19, 2025 – Novartis, a leading global innovative medicines company, today announced plans to expand its operations in North Carolina, creating a new flagship manufacturing hub with end-to-end manufacturing capabilities. The strategic investment is a major step to ensure all key Novartis medicines for US patients are manufactured in the US and delivered to patients across the country at scale.

This announcement is part of Novartis’ $23 billion investment in US-based infrastructure over the next five years, designed to increase manufacturing capacity and enable 100% of the company's key medicines to be produced end-to-end in the US.

As part of this flagship hub in North Carolina, Novartis will:

Build a new site in Durham with the construction of two new facilities dedicated to manufacturing biologics and sterile packaging

Build a new site in Morrisville with one facility for the production of solid dosage tablets and capsules, including packaging

Expand the scope of its existing Durham facility with the added capability to support sterile filling of biologics into syringes and vials

The company is on track to produce all its advanced technologies in the US with:

Cell and gene therapies manufactured in Morris Plains, NJ, and Durham, NC

Radioligand therapies manufactured coast-to-coast at facilities in Millburn, NJ, Indianapolis, IN, and Carlsbad, CA, and two new sites planned in Florida and Texas

xRNA therapies to be manufactured at a new facility whose location will be announced in the coming months

Currently, Novartis produces innovative, life-changing gene therapies in Durham. Together, the new and existing facilities will create a single hub, expanding capabilities to produce medicines across the company’s main therapeutic areas: oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular, renal and metabolic. The proximity of the facilities will allow teams and production processes to work in tandem – from manufacturing active ingredients to final packaging – and create efficiencies in its manufacturing.

“This announcement is a commitment to American innovation and to the patients we serve,” said Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. “By building a full, end-to-end manufacturing presence in North Carolina for our broader portfolio, we are expanding our capacity to deliver medical breakthroughs, securing a more resilient US supply chain, and investing in the local communities that make our mission possible.”

“North Carolina continues to lead in advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing, and Novartis’ expansion in the Triangle reflects our state’s talent and innovative spirit,” said Governor Josh Stein. “This investment will strengthen our state’s economy and ensure life-saving medicines continue to be made right in North Carolina.”

Anticipated to open in 2027-2028, the flagship manufacturing hub, encompassing more than 700,000 square feet between the existing campus and new facilities, is expected to create 700 new jobs at Novartis and more than 3,000 indirect jobs across the supply chain by the end of 2030.

This latest expansion builds on the existing Novartis presence – creating skilled jobs, fueling workforce growth, supporting local communities, and solidifying North Carolina’s strength in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

[TITLE]Vivos Therapeutics Reports Significant Revenue Growth During the Third Quarter 2025:
[TEXT]
Financial results highlighted by 78% sequential quarter over quarter revenue growth, showing the impact of the first full quarter of Sleep Center of Nevada operations

Management to host conference call today at 5:00 pm ET to review results and provide operational updates

LITTLETON, Colo., Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vivos Therapeutics, Inc. (“Vivos” or the “Company’’) (NASDAQ: VVOS), a leading medical device and healthcare services company specializing in the delivery of highly effective diagnostic procedures and proprietary treatments for sleep related breathing disorders (including all severities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and moderate to severe OSA in children), today reported financial results and operating highlights for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Kirk Huntsman, Vivos’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are very pleased to announce that our third quarter sequential revenue was up 78%, while same period year-over-year revenue increased 76%. This outstanding quarterly revenue increase represents exactly what we anticipated when we announced and executed our strategic pivot away from our historical reliance on a dental industry distribution channel and toward a direct affiliation with, or acquisition of, medical sleep practices and testing centers. This pivot was showcased by our June 2025 acquisition of The Sleep Center of Nevada (SCN).”

“Importantly, these results highlight the impact of our first full quarter of operations since our SCN acquisition,” continued Mr. Huntsman. “Even at this early stage, we are seeing the benefits of our strategic pivot in both revenue and gross profit, and these results provide us with confidence in where our new strategic affiliation and acquisition model will take us.”

“We believe significant local market growth potential remains in the Las Vegas area as we continue to integrate and optimize SCN’s operations and expand our capacity to meet what we have found to be overwhelming and growing patient demand. We are currently booking SCN patients for sleep testing out into the latter part of February 2026 as we work to rapidly add additional facilities, staff and providers. In addition, as previously announced, we are actively looking to extend our model into additional major markets beyond Las Vegas, whether through contractual alliances with, or acquisitions of, sleep medical practices,” concluded Mr. Huntsman.

Bradford Amman, Vivos’ Chief Financial Officer, added, “The launch of our new model at SCN required key investments in people and infrastructure in advance of full-capacity revenue generating operations. This resulted in some higher levels of expenses during the quarter. We expect this to continue near term as we seek to optimize SCN’s operations by driving revenue further, adding staff, and eventually getting more providers credentialed with insurance payors. During 2026, we expect to continue to add new sleep optimization teams, which we believe will eventually result in a reduction in cash burn and create the potential for profitable operations.”

Third Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Summary

Revenue was $6.8 million for the third quarter of 2025 and $13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $3.9 million and $11.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to higher product and service revenue, resulting from Vivos’ pivot in its sales, marketing and distribution model to focus on sleep center provider-based alliances and acquisitions, such as Vivos’ June 10, 2025 acquisition of SCN (Vivos Closes SCN Acquisition);

The SCN acquisition has allowed Vivos’ to place its proprietary and highly effective OSA diagnostic tools and therapies in front of far more patients and create powerful new revenue streams. During the third quarter, SCN added $2.2 million of diagnostic sleep testing revenue and $1.3 million of “treatment center” revenue, the latter being a new revenue stream arising from Vivos’ operation of SCN. These revenues are expected to ramp further as additional Vivos sleep optimization teams are formed and deployed.

These revenues are expected to ramp further as additional Vivos sleep optimization teams are formed and deployed. Gross profit was $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2025 and $7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with $2.3 million and $6.9 million for the comparable periods in 2024, reflective of the increase in product and service revenue;

Gross margin declined to 58% in the third quarter of 2025 from 60% in the third quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, gross margin was 55% compared to 61% in the same period in 2024. This decrease was expected due to pricing discounts, shifts in product and service mix and the transition to Vivos’ new sales, marketing and distribution model;

Operating expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 were $8.7 million, a 74% increase compared to $5.0 million in the same period a year ago, reflecting increased general and administrative expenses related to additional headcount related to the SCN acquisition and non-cash depreciation and amortization expense on assets acquired from SCN. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, operating expenses were $21.1 million versus $15.3 million in the same period in 2024.

The third quarter 2025 operating loss increased to $4.7 million compared to $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 and increased to $13.5 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2025 from $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $3.1 million and stockholders’ equity was $2.5 million, compared to cash and equivalents of $6.3 million and stockholders’ equity of $8.0 million respectively, as of December 31, 2024.

Updated Sleep Center Affiliation Model

Vivos has developed an updated sleep practice affiliation model to be implemented in situations where the sleep center or medical practice owners are not interested in being acquired, but are interested in making the full array of Vivos’ OSA diagnostic and treatment options available to their patients.

During the third quarter, Vivos entered into a management agreement with MISleep Solutions LLC to provide our full suite of Vivos treatments and services to OSA patients at a joint location in Auburn Hills, Michigan (which is near Detroit), and is anticipating seeing patients beginning in early December. Consistent with its updated approach, Vivos owns a supermajority equity stake in the management services company, with the sleep practice owning a minority ownership interest. Vivos is exploring similar arrangements in other major markets across the country.

Investor Call and 10-Q Filing

Vivos encourages investors and other interested parties to join its conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time. Management will discuss further details on topics including Vivos’ strategic collaborations and their anticipated effect on near-term revenue growth and cash burn.

[TITLE]Harrow Announces Closing of Acquisition of Melt Pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Harrow (Nasdaq: HROW), a leading provider of ophthalmic disease management solutions in North America, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Melt), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering non-opioid, non-IV therapies for sedation for medical procedures in the hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings. Melt’s product candidates, MELT-210, MELT-300, and MELT-400, are based on the proprietary Zydis® ODT (oral dissolving tablet) drug delivery platform. The closing of the Melt acquisition marks a strategic expansion of Harrow’s portfolio and reinforces its commitment to delivering innovative therapies that improve patient outcomes.

With global patent coverage and potential applications in ophthalmology, gastroenterology, dental care, and a wide range of outpatient procedures where sedation or anxiety management is needed, from diagnostic imaging to endoscopy procedures to pre-anesthesia, Melt’s drug candidates, including MELT-300, position Harrow to enter the multi-billion-dollar annual U.S. and global procedural sedation and anxiety market.

MELT-300 represents a transformative opportunity, building on more than a decade of real-world experience with MKO Melt® — a compounded sublingual sedation product sold by Harrow’s ImprimisRx subsidiary and currently administered by over 800 U.S. ophthalmic institutions, primarily for cataract surgery. As a potential FDA-approved successor, MELT-300 is a patented, sublingually delivered formulation of a fixed dose of midazolam (3mg) and ketamine (50mg) designed to provide rapid, predictable sedation without the need for intravenous administration. The MELT-300 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical programs previously demonstrated statistical superiority to midazolam alone. The innovative approach to sedation MELT-300 offers has the potential to transform patient experiences across a wide range of office-based and outpatient procedures, addressing the healthcare system’s growing demand to reduce exposure to opioids, including fentanyl.

“The development of MELT-300 marks a defining milestone for Harrow — our first product taken from ideation to the brink of commercialization. I still remember the first call we received

Furthermore, the integration of regenerative medicine approaches, including stem cell therapy and bioengineered liver tissues, holds promise for reducing transplant dependency in the future.

Treatment options for liver failure continue to diversify. In acute cases, rapid interventions such as N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity or urgent antiviral therapy for acute hepatitis can prevent progression to complete liver shutdown. For chronic liver failure, management focuses on controlling the underlying cause, preventing complications such as portal hypertension, and improving liver function through medications, dietary interventions, and lifestyle changes. Emerging technologies in hepatocyte transplantation and tissue engineering are being explored to provide temporary or permanent liver function restoration without the need for a donor organ. The trend toward personalized medicine, tailoring therapy based on genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors, is also gaining momentum in the liver failure market.

Despite advancements, the liver failure market faces several challenges. The shortage of donor organs remains the most significant barrier, with demand far outstripping supply in many countries. High costs associated with transplantation, artificial liver devices, and long-term immunosuppressive therapy limit access, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. Limited awareness of early liver disease symptoms contributes to late-stage diagnosis, where treatment options are more limited and less effective. Additionally, the complexity of managing comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease complicates treatment and increases healthcare costs. In rural and resource-limited settings, the lack of specialized hepatology centers and trained transplant teams further constrains patient outcomes.

Key players in the liver failure market include major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies such as Gilead Sciences, Inc., AbbVie Inc., and Boehringer Ingelheim, alongside transplant technology providers and medical device companies developing artificial liver support systems. These stakeholders are investing heavily in R&D to improve transplant success rates, develop novel anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory drugs, and bring bioartificial liver technologies to market. Strategic collaborations between academic research centers, biotechnology firms, and public health agencies are accelerating innovation and expanding treatment access. Patient advocacy groups and non-profit organizations are also playing a growing role in raising awareness, improving organ donation rates, and funding liver disease research.

The competitive landscape is characterized by both established pharmaceutical leaders and emerging biotechnology startups pursuing novel therapeutic pathways, including gene therapy for inherited liver conditions, RNA-based treatments for metabolic liver diseases, and immunomodulatory drugs to prevent transplant rejection. As research into regenerative medicine, stem cell applications, and artificial organ development progresses, the market is expected to diversify, offering patients more tailored and potentially curative options. With continued investment in diagnostics, donor management, and next-generation treatment modalities, the global liver failure market is poised for sustained growth, improving survival rates and quality of life for patients worldwide.

The global liver failure market is growing steadily, propelled by rising prevalence of chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis, alcohol-associated liver disease, and NAFLD/NASH, sustained improvements in care pathways, and broader awareness of liver health. Advances in therapeutics and interventions ranging from potent antivirals and anti-fibrotic candidates to optimized transplant surgery, machine-perfusion organ preservation, and artificial/bioartificial liver support systems are reshaping the treatment landscape by extending survival and bridging more patients to transplant.The rise of personalized medicine using genomics, phenotyping, and AI-driven risk stratification to tailor etiology-specific regimens and post-transplant immunosuppression is opening the door to more patient-centric solutions.

[TITLE]Mammography Systems Market to Reach US$ 5,719.51 Million by 2033 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global mammography systems market was valued at US$ 2,983.2 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 5,719.51 million by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% over the forecast period of 2025-2033.

The fundamental drive behind mammography systems market growth remains the unrelenting global burden of breast cancer. In 2024, an estimated 310,720 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the US alone. This is not a static figure; incidence rates have been slowly rising, particularly among women under 50. This demographic trend, coupled with an aging global population, ensures a sustained and growing base of individuals who require screening.

Furthermore, public health initiatives continue to bear fruit. In the United States, data from 2023 shows that approximately 80% of women aged 50 to 74 were up to date with breast cancer screening. While disparities persist—with screening rates varying from 58% in Wyoming to 77% in Rhode Island—the overall trend reflects a high level of awareness and acceptance of mammography as a critical preventative health measure.

The Evolving Target: From Age Brackets to Individualized Risk

For years, the target population in the Mammography systems market was straightforward: women over a certain age. However, 2025 is marked by a significant shift towards more personalized screening protocols. Major medical bodies are now recommending that women at average risk begin mammograms at age 40. This change alone expands the market, but the real nuance lies in the stratification of risk.

Guidelines now strongly recommend that all women, particularly Black women and those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, undergo a risk assessment by age 25. For those deemed high-risk due to genetic mutations (like BRCA1/2), a strong family history, or prior radiation therapy, the protocol is far more intensive. These women are often advised to begin annual screening as early as age 25 or 30, supplementing their yearly mammograms with breast MRIs. This tailored approach means that a simple mammogram is no longer the sole answer; demand is growing for a complementary suite of imaging tools.

The Elephant in the Room: The Breast Density Dilemma

Perhaps no single factor has impacted the mammography systems market landscape more in recent years than the issue of breast density. As of September 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that all mammography reports inform patients whether their breasts are "dense" or "not dense."

This is critical for two reasons:

Masking Effect: Dense breast tissue and tumors both appear white on a mammogram, making it significantly harder for radiologists to detect cancer. The sensitivity of a mammogram can drop from over 88% in fatty breasts to as low as 62% in extremely dense breasts. Increased Risk: Having dense breasts is an independent risk factor for developing breast cancer.

This heightened awareness is creating a powerful demand for technologies that can effectively image dense breast tissue, pushing the market beyond traditional 2D mammography.

The Rise of the Adjuncts: Mammography Is No Longer a Solo Act

The limitations of mammography systems market in dense breasts have opened the door for alternative and supplementary technologies. These are not replacing mammography but are being integrated alongside it, creating a multi-modal approach to breast screening.

Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS): This has emerged as the leading supplemental screening tool for women with dense breasts. Unlike a traditional mammogram, its effectiveness is not compromised by density. Studies have shown that adding an ABUS exam to a mammogram can significantly increase cancer detection. GE Healthcare's Invenia ABUS, the first FDA-approved system for this purpose, has been shown to find 35.7% more cancers in dense-breasted women when paired with mammography. The exam in the mammography systems market is relatively quick, often lasting just 15 minutes. ABUS is also being explored as a primary screening tool in low-resource settings where mammography is unavailable.

The exam in the mammography systems market is relatively quick, often lasting just 15 minutes. ABUS is also being explored as a primary screening tool in low-resource settings where mammography is unavailable. Breast MRI: For women at the highest risk, an annual breast MRI is now standard practice in addition to a mammogram. MRI is the most sensitive tool for detecting breast cancer, but its higher cost, the need for a contrast agent, and a higher rate of false positives limit its use for the general population.

The impact is clear: modern imaging centers are no longer just buying mammography systems. They are building breast imaging suites, where demand for advanced mammography is intrinsically linked to the demand for high-quality ultrasound and MRI systems.

The Accessibility Divide and the Affordability Hurdle

While technology races ahead, access remains a stark global challenge in the mammography systems market. The high cost of advanced systems, particularly 3D mammography (tomosynthesis) and AI-integrated platforms, is a major barrier for smaller clinics and healthcare systems in developing countries. Many of these regions also face a severe shortage of trained radiologists to interpret the images.

Cultural barriers and a lack of awareness can also impede screening uptake in many parts of the world. To bridge this gap, innovations like mobile mammography units are being explored to bring screening to rural and underserved populations, though these programs face their own logistical and financial challenges. Even in developed nations, disparities in access and quality of care persist, particularly among minority populations.

Debunking a Market Myth: Digital Mammography in 2025

By 2025, the mammography systems market has almost completely transitioned, with digital systems representing the vast majority of new sales and installations globally. The demand for analog systems is now negligible and confined to a very small, niche segment of the market.

The upcoming dominance of digital is driven by undeniable clinical and operational advantages. Digital mammography offers superior image contrast, the ability to manipulate images post-acquisition, and significantly lower radiation doses. Most critically, the development of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (3D mammography), which has become the standard of care in many nations for its proven ability to increase cancer detection rates by 27-50% and reduce recall rates, is an inherently digital technology.

The residual demand for analog systems stems in the mammography systems market purely from extreme cost constraints. These systems are sometimes sought as second-hand units in the most resource-limited settings in developing countries, where the capital for even a basic 2D digital system is unavailable. However, this is a "last resort" market, not a growth sector. The industry's focus, investment, and future are unequivocally digital.

The Arena of Titans: Competitive Dynamics in 2025

The mammography market is dominated by a handful of key players, each carving out a strategic position through technological innovation.

Hologic, Inc.: Long considered a market leader, Hologic pioneered the widespread adoption of 3D mammography (tomosynthesis). Their strength lies in a deep focus on the entire breast health continuum, from screening to biopsy. They are now heavily integrating AI to improve diagnostic confidence and workflow efficiency. GE HealthCare: GE is aggressively competing with a focus on workflow efficiency and patient comfort in the mammography systems market. Their latest Pristina Via system, showcased in late 2024 and 2025, boasts "zero-click" acquisition and faster cycle times to address the shortage of trained technologists. They are also a major force in the supplemental imaging space with their Invenia ABUS system and are heavily invested in AI through collaborations like their distribution of DeepHealth's SmartMammo AI software. Siemens Healthineers: Siemens' latest major innovation in the mammography systems market is the Mammomat B.brilliant system, which received FDA approval for its 3D technology in late 2024. Its key differentiators are speed and precision, offering a 50-degree wide-angle tomosynthesis scan in
