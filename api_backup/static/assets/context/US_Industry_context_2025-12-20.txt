Alnylam Pharmaceuticals is set to invest $250m in the expansion of its facility in Norton, Massachusetts, US, to meet the growing global demand for RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics.

This is claimed to become the first fully dedicated small-interfering RNA (siRNA) enzymatic-ligation manufacturing facility.

The facility expansion is intended to increase capacity, lower production expenses, and enable support for future medicine launches from the company’s development pipeline.

As part of this, the company’s next-generation, scalable enzymatic ligation manufacturing platform, known as siRELIS, has been accepted into the US Food and Drug Administration’s Emerging Technology Program.

The programme is expected to facilitate discussions with global health authorities regarding manufacturing approaches for oligonucleotide-based medicines.

This acceptance comes after pilot-scale production of zilebesiran, which is under investigation for decreasing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in hypertension patients, and nucresiran, being developed for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR).

[TITLE]Halo Pharma Enhances Manufacturing Capabilities with Macro-Pactor® Investment:
[TEXT]
New addition enhances manufacturing continuity and supports seamless progression from early-phase development to late-stage production

Macro-Pactor® to be online in Q1 2026

WHIPPANY, N.J., Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Halo Pharma, a leading CDMO specializing in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, is expanding its manufacturing capabilities at its Whippany, New Jersey facility with the addition of a Gerteis Macro-Pactor®, a versatile roller compactor that enhances the company’s ability to manage complex formulations, improve process efficiency, and deliver consistent solid-dose pharmaceutical products. The investment reinforces Halo Pharma’s position as a reliable partner for both development and commercial manufacturing as it allows for seamless scale up from Halo Whippany’s Gerties Mini-Pactor® currently used for development, clinical and small scall commercial manufacturing.

The Macro-Pactor is expected to be online in the first quarter of 2026. Its high throughput, superior dry-granulation performance, improved powder flow, and reduced variability will significantly expand Halo Pharma’s dry-granulation capabilities. It will improve formulation flexibility, process predictability, and granule quality. This technology is especially beneficial for the development of moisture-sensitive APIs, high-drug-load formulations, poor-flowing powders, potent compounds, and modified-release products within Halo Pharma’s portfolio.

“One of the major advantages of adding the Macro-Pactor is that the process parameters established during early-phase development translates almost directly into larger batch sizes,” says Satish Shetty, Senior Director, Product Development & Technical Services at Halo Pharma. “Since the equipment is engineered for both development and commercial throughput, it eliminates the typical disconnect between small-scale R&D and large-scale manufacturing, reducing scale-up risk, timelines, and the need for reformulation.”

Shetty adds that the Macro-Pactor’s closed, dust-contained design reduces operator exposure, minimizes product loss, and supports secure, regulatory-compliant handling. With fewer open processing steps, the system provides safer, more controlled operation for potent APIs and controlled substances.

Beyond scale-up, the Macro-Pactor supports Halo Pharma’s tech-transfer process. Its precise, data-rich control of critical process parameters enables smooth, low-risk transitions from lab-scale development to commercial manufacturing, strengthening the company’s Quality by Design (QbD) efforts. Fully compatible with existing upstream and downstream equipment, the system ensures efficient end-to-end processing and strengthens collaboration across R&D, process development, manufacturing, and quality teams.

"Investing in the Macro-Pactor reinforces Halo Pharma’s commitment to delivering high-quality, scalable manufacturing solutions for our clients. It ensures that they can confidently advance their programs with predictable outcomes and faster timelines," says Lee Karras, Group Chief Executive for the Noramco Group, parent company of Halo Pharma.

of Singapore selected as NeuroSigma’s manufacturing partner Investment led by Checkmate Capital as part of strategic partnership with Armstrong Asia

First commercial units to be delivered in March 2026

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuroSigma, Inc., a Los Angeles-based bioelectronics company, today announced completion of an approximately $1 million investment into a high-volume manufacturing line for the second-generation Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS) device for treating pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NeuroSigma’s manufacturing partner for the project is Singapore-based Armstrong Asia , a leading manufacturer for the medical, automotive and consumer electronics industries, with operations across Asia and partnerships around the globe. The investment was led by Checkmate Capital, a strategic advisory and investment group headquartered in Pasadena, California. The investment and manufacturing project are part of a collaboration between Armstrong and Checkmate, stemming from their July 2025 strategic memorandum of understanding (MOU) focused on the development and manufacturing of new technologies, particularly in the medical device industry.

“This investment enables cost-efficient and scalable manufacturing of the second-generation Monarch eTNS device,” said Colin Kealey, M.D., President and CEO of NeuroSigma. "As we move into 2026, we look forward to working with Armstrong Asia to deliver this innovative product to patients and families throughout the world."

“We would like to thank NeuroSigma and Checkmate for selecting Armstrong as their manufacturing partner for the second-generation Monarch eTNS device,” added Phyllis Ong, CEO of Armstrong Asia. “Armstrong’s engineering team is highly inspired to co-design and manufacture advanced medical devices, and we look forward to producing the device at scale to serve the millions of patients suffering from ADHD.”

In November 2025, NeuroSigma announced successful completion of its pilot commercialization program for the first-generation Monarch eTNS device. During the pilot phase, the company dispensed over 1,000 Monarch devices and over 100,000 of the daily disposable patches. Based on strong market demand, NeuroSigma is preparing to launch the second-generation Monarch eTNS device in late Q1 2026.

“Completion of this investment marks a significant milestone for NeuroSigma, Armstrong, and Checkmate,” said Tom Paschall, CEO of Checkmate Capital and NeuroSigma Director. “Within the medical device industry, we see favorable conditions for the external neurostimulation sector and the central nervous system therapeutics market in general. The Monarch eTNS device is a groundbreaking neuro-electronic product that provides patients, families, and physicians with an alternative to stimulant medications and the negative side effects associated with them.”

[TITLE]Kiwibank scraps plan for part-privatisation for now, due to Reserve Bank capital rule change:
[TEXT]
It said it had the capital required to grow.

Work had been underway to try to find investors to effectively buy stakes in Kiwibank.

This would have diluted the Government’s ownership of Kiwibank, but reduced the need for it to find money to inject into the bank to help it better compete with the big four Australian-owned banks.

KGC said its decision to scrap plans to part-privatise Kiwibank was driven by the Reserve Bank’s capital rule change and its strengthened funding position.

However, KGC hinted at it being difficult to put an attractive deal on the table for investors, while ensuring Kiwibank remained Kiwi-owned.

“While prospective investor feedback has been positive on Kiwibank’s performance and strategy, it appeared unlikely by the time of the Reserve Bank’s [bank capital] announcement, that terms would be able to be agreed with prospective investors that would meet KGC’s objectives for the transaction,” KGC said.

The Herald understands potential investors didn’t like the fact that if they wanted to sell their shares in Kiwibank, they’d have to sell them to the Government. The concern was, they might not have had much power to negotiate a good deal.

It was also difficult for KGC to promise investors they would be paid solid dividends in the near-term, as Kiwibank sought to grow.

And finally, there was uncertainty around whether Kiwibank would ultimately be listed on the NZX, like Air New Zealand and the electricity companies are.

National and Act are supportive of doing so, but the coalition Government has promised not to make any moves before the election.

KGC has been mindful of ensuring Kiwibank has sufficient capital to grow sustainably.

While it has been increasing its market share, growing too fast could require it to take on too much risk, by scooping up customers who can’t get loans from other banks for example.

While Kiwibank can compete on service, there are also limits on the extent to which it can compete on price, while remaining profitable.

Going back to the Reserve Bank, it estimated the mid-sized banks in the bucket it put Kiwibank in would be able to hold up to 21% less capital under its new rules, compared to what would have been the case once the old rules were fully implemented by 2028.

The Reserve Bank also expected its decision to release a more granular schedule for the amount of capital banks need to hold in relation to specific types of lending would help smaller and mid-sized banks better compete with the big banks.

Changing capital rules and giving Kiwibank access to more capital to help it grow were among the key recommendations the Commerce Commission made last year, further to a study it did on competition in the banking sector.

[TITLE]CEO of nuclear fusion firm Trump Media is merging with: High-velocity capital is 'critical' and concerns are secondary:
[TEXT]
The financially struggling Trump Media & Technology Group’s shocking, $6 billion merger with a nuclear fusion developer represents either a bet on more taxpayer dollars being invested in the first fusion player to go public—soon owned in part by the Trump family—or a belief that an influx of capital will speed up the launch of clean, limitless electricity that eventually will transform the global grid.

Trump Media’s struggling stock had plummeted nearly 70% year-to-date prior to the announcement. But the stock value spiked over 40% on the deal news with the market cap rising back above $4 billion on Dec. 18—even though TAE Technologies doesn’t plan to bring its first power plant online until 2031 to start generating revenues.

TAE Technologies CEO Michl Binderbauer recognizes the potential negative perception, but he told Fortune he’s eager to speed up the clean energy revolution that he is confident will come with the so-called merger of equals with Trump Media, which will become a Truth Social media, cryptocurrency, and fusion power conglomerate.

“In the end, if we get more scrutiny because of the deal we did, I actually don’t mind that,” Binderbauer said. “It’s perversely sounding, but I welcome it in a way because we let the technology speak.

“It’s big, bold and fast. You make a big bet with boldness at heart, and it allows you to run really fast,” he said. “I know our technology will succeed. Let it be adjudicated on a perhaps even deeper level. We need more energy; we need clean, scalable power.”

Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen government watchdog group, sees it quite differently as an obviously unethical cash grab by the president and his family.

“It’s a ridiculous merger. Why in the world would those two companies merge, and why would the markets respond positively?” Weissman said. “The markets are betting on the prospect of the Trump grift expanding and for … direct federal government payments to a company whose leading shareholder is the president of the United States.”

TAE has received federal Department of Energy grants dating back to Trump’s first term and continuing through the Biden administration. As part of a reorganization announced in November, the DOE is opening a new Office of Fusion.

The deal would value the merged company at $6 billion, including debt, and Binderbauer and Trump Media head Devin Nunes would serve as co-CEOs, they said. Shareholders of each company would own

[TITLE]Canada Banks Sit on Billions as Regulator Maintains Capital Rule:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s financial regulator left capital requirements unchanged for the country’s largest banks, pointing out that the lenders are sitting on a combined C$60 billion ($43.5 billion) in excess capital that could be deployed to boost economic activity.

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions said in a statement Thursday that the domestic stability buffer will remain at 3.5% after its semi-annual review, the fifth consecutive hold, signaling it believes systemic risks to the financial system are stable despite looming uncertainty with the North American free-trade deal up for review next year.

Canada’s six biggest banks must continue to have Common Equity Tier 1 capital of at least 11.5% of risk-weighted assets. They all comfortably exceed that ratio, with an average CET1 ratio of 13.6% reported in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.

That means they have C$60 billion more than the regulatory minimum, Peter Routledge, superintendent of financial institutions, told reporters on Thursday, adding that OSFI believes the lenders have “ample capacity to continue to grow and profit from their growth.”

It’s up to the banks’ boards and management teams to decide whether to use that excess capital to make more loans, he said.

“Ultimately, institutions determine how to allocate the capacity provided by their capital cushions,” Routledge said, noting that one of those choices may include “the provision of credit for Canadian businesses, including small- and medium-sized businesses, as they adapt to current conditions.”

Earlier this year, OSFI proposed easing some capital rules for certain corporate and real estate loans to encourage more lending to businesses. Those changes would see the regulator lower the risk weighting of those loans, which in turn would allow banks to lend more while holding the same amount of capital, but they won’t be finalized until late next year.

Routledge said the stability buffer has a different function than sector-specific risk weightings, taking into account risks across the whole system and economy.

The stability buffer is often compared to a rainy-day fund, intended to protect the financial system by ensuring lenders have enough capital to absorb losses in a downturn. OSFI lowered it in the early days of the pandemic to give banks more room to lend and help stimulate growth before raising it over time as the economy recovered.

“The major vulnerabilities in the banking system remain elevated but stable,” OSFI said in the statement, pointing to high household debt relative to income but noting that the metric is below historical peaks. It also pointed to global uncertainty and geopolitical risks. “Canadian corporate debt growth has moderated but credit quality is vulnerable to trade-related headwinds.”

Routledge said OSFI does not expect to increase the buffer from its current level “absent a significant change in vulnerabilities.”

The Canadian economy has been moderately resilient in recent months, with inflation holding steady near the Bank of Canada’s target and the labor market exhibiting some strength with job gains and a declining unemployment rate. Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of 2.6% in the third quarter, a notable rebound from a contraction earlier in the year.

Credit trends appear stable, though the Big Six banks did put aside more money for possibly bad loans in their fiscal fourth quarter than they did in the previous period. The major wildcard hanging over the country’s economy is next year’s renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

[TITLE]North American Construction Group Strengthens its Presence in Western Australia with the Acquisition of Iron Mine Contracting, a Diversified Mining Services Contractor:
[TEXT]
ACHESON, Alberta, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- North American Construction Group Ltd. (“NACG” or the “Company”) (TSX:NOA/NYSE:NOA) today announced that it has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement to acquire Iron Mine Contracting (“IMC”), a privately owned Western Australian diversified mining services contractor. The acquisition is valued at approximately $115 million (“the Transaction”). Concurrent with this announcement, the Company is providing a year-end update on its infrastructure and fleet optimization initiatives, along with its 2026 financial outlook. All references to dollars are in Canadian dollars.

Acquisition of Iron Mine Contracting

IMC is a diversified mining services contractor headquartered in Western Australia. The company provides a full suite of services, including contract mining, crushing, civil and tailings services to a blue-chip customer base. Its operations span key commodity sectors such as gold, iron ore and lithium backed by an established track record of safe and profitable operations.

IMC boasts a strong order book, currently exceeding $1.0 billion and including a recently awarded lithium mining contract with a three-year term. This backlog is supported by a strong pipeline of large mining and civil projects.

Joe Lambert, President and Chief Executive Officer of NACG, commented: “IMC represents a natural and strategic extension of our business into the Western Australian market. The IMC team has built a high-quality business with strong margins sharing NACG’s core culture of operational and safety excellence. This acquisition provides a great foundation to fast track our Western Australia growth strategy which is considered a global powerhouse for base metals, precious metals and critical & rare earth minerals. Combined with the MacKellar Group, we are now an Australian Tier 1 contractor capable of executing complex scopes across the entirety of Australia. IMC is a well-run business in a great market presenting a clear opportunity for low-capital growth by leveraging our underutilized Canadian assets and our highly skilled in-house maintenance team experienced in major component and whole machine rebuilds.”

“Partnering with NACG and the MacKellar Group is a strategic accelerator for IMC, allowing us to meet our customers’ expanding needs within a strong market. This significantly scales our growth potential while preserving the strong culture, agility and customer focus that have always defined our business,” said Clinton Keenan, Chief Executive Officer of IMC. “We look forward to immediately leveraging NACG’s balance sheet and extensive equipment fleet to pursue a greater number of larger projects as this partnership will surely expand our client base and commodity market presence.”

Highlights of the Transaction

The total estimated consideration of $115 million represents 2.5x of expected EBITDA in 2026, calculated prior to any realized synergies. The acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive, increasing NACG’s incremental earnings per share by approximately 20% in 2026.

The Transaction will be fully funded by senior-secured bank financing (65% of the purchase price) and vendor-provided debt financing (35% of the purchase price).

The estimated upfront payment of approximately $40 million will be funded by the Company’s existing revolving credit facility. In addition, NACG plans to assume secured equipment financing of $35 million. The remaining $40 million of the consideration will be addressed through structured earn-out and deferred payment mechanisms payable to the vendors over the next four years.

Strategic Rationale for and Highlights of the Acquisition

The acquisition of IMC is immediately accretive and strategically transformative for NACG, delivering key benefits:

Increased exposure to rare earth & critical minerals in Western Australia: step-change in geographic and commodity diversification with Western Australia set to immediately grow from 5% to 15% of our total earnings;

[TITLE]Bamburi Cement, Chinese Company Sign Ksh32 Billion Factory Construction Deal [Details]:
[TEXT]
Editor's Review Bamburi Cement has signed a Ksh32 billion Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with China-based Sinoma CBMI Construction Co., Ltd for the construction of a new clinkerisation factory in Matuga, Kwale County.

Bamburi Cement has signed a US$250 million (Ksh32 billion) Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with China-based Sinoma CBMI Construction Co., Ltd for the construction of a new clinkerisation factory in Matuga, Kwale County.

In a statement on Tuesday, December 16, the company said the project is part of Bamburi Cement’s strategy to expand its manufacturing operations, reduce reliance on imports, and support Kenya’s infrastructure development and economic transformation.

The clinkerisation plant will have a production capacity of 1.6 million tonnes per year and will incorporate advanced, carbon-neutral technologies aimed at reducing environmental impact.

Through the project, Bamburi Cement plans to more than double its clinker production from 1 million tonnes to 2.6 million tonnes, while cement production is expected to increase from 1.8 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes annually.

President William Ruto, who witnessed the signing of the agreement, said the government will support the Bamburi Cement project and other similar investments that promote value addition, job creation, and industrial growth.

"The Government of Kenya remains fully committed to supporting this project and similar investments that deepen value addition, create jobs, and strengthen our manufacturing base," he said.

Ruto stated that the cement industry plays a central role in Kenya’s economic development, noting that major infrastructure projects depend on a stable and competitive cement supply chain.

"The cement industry sits at the heart of our economic freedom agenda. Every road, power plant, dam, irrigation canal and factory depends on a reliable, competitive and sustainable cement value chain.

"Projects such as the Bamburi Clinker Line are not isolated investments, they are foundational catalysts for our national transformation," he added.

File image of President William Ruto speaking during the event

Ruto also highlighted the need for Kenya to reduce cement imports by utilizing its abundant local raw materials.

"It is not possible for us to continue importing cement, Kenya has an abundance of limestone and other raw materials for cement production," he further said.

The deal comes a year after Savannah Clinker Limited withdrew its offer to acquire Bamburi Cement.

In a statement on Wednesday, December 4, 2024, Capital Markets Authority (CMA) said it had approved the withdrawal of the offer, and gave Bamburi Cement shareholders, who had accepted the offer until Thursday to reconsider their decision.

"CMA would like to notify the shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc and the investing public that Savannah Clinker Limited has withdrawn its competing offer for the acquisition of the Bamburi Cement Plc shares today. CMA has also approved the withdrawal of the offer in line with the Capital Markets (Takeover and Mergers) Regulations, 2002.

"Following this development, shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc who had accepted the offer by Savannah Clinker Limited have until 5.00pm on Thursday, 5 December 2024 to reconsider their decision. Shareholders who do not change their decision will be deemed to have declined the offer by Amsons Industries (K) Limited and remain shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc," the statement read in part.

CMA further noted the only valid offer is the one from Amsons Industries (K) Limited which has already been approved by the Authority.

"Shareholders who had accepted either of the offers are free to withdraw their acceptance before the closure of the offer period at 5.00 pm on Thursday, 5 December 2024. Trading of Bamburi Cement Plc shares will be suspended from 9.00 am on 06 December 2024 to facilitate reconciliation," the statement concluded.

Savannah Clinker Limited's move to withdraw its offer came days after its Chairman, Benson Sande Ndeta, was arrested and subsequently arraigned in court.

Ndeta was arrested on charges of defrauding Absa Bank of $35 million, allegedly acting on behalf of Savannah Cement Limited.

He faced eight counts, including conspiracy to commit a felony and obtaining credit by false pretenses, which he denied.

After spending the weekend in custody, the High Court ordered his unconditional release, halting further prosecution pending a hearing set for January 30, 2025.

Rocket Lab advances US Space Force mission with early STP S30 launch

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Dec 18, 2025

Rocket Lab Corporation has successfully launched the STP-S30 mission for the U.S. Space Force's Space Systems Command, placing four DiskSat spacecraft into low Earth orbit and completing the task five months earlier than planned. The mission supports the Department of War's Space Test Program and is intended to mature technologies that preserve U.S. advantages in space operations.

The Electron rocket flight, designated Don't Be Such A Square, lifted off from Launch Complex 2 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island, Virginia, at 12:03 a.m. local time on December 18, corresponding to 05:03 UTC. The vehicle delivered the DiskSat payloads to a 550 kilometer circular low Earth orbit, meeting mission requirements for the Space Test Program.

DiskSat is a proposed alternative architecture to conventional CubeSat small satellites, designed to change how future small spacecraft are built, integrated, and priced. The platform aims to broaden options for commercial, government, and defense missions by altering form factor while maintaining compatibility with small launch vehicles and rideshare opportunities.

The STP-S30 mission was managed by Space Systems Command's System Delta 89 Capability Development Branch, led by Lt Col Cesar Rodriguez. The Aerospace Corporation developed the DiskSat spacecraft, with funding from NASA's Small Spacecraft and Distributed Systems program based at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley within the agency's Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

Working with the U.S. Space Force's Rocket Systems Launch Program, Rocket Lab advanced the launch timeline to fly the mission five months ahead of the original schedule. Rocket Lab received the STP-S30 task order in April 2024 under the Orbital Services Program 4 (OSP-4) contract, which supports rapid, flexible access to space for national security customers.

The Don't Be Such A Square mission extends a sequence of four Electron launches in three months from Launch Complex 2, all focused on national security and defense technology objectives for the Department of War. Over this period, Rocket Lab has provided dedicated small launch services for missions supporting defense and government partners from the Virginia site.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck says: "Rocket Lab's speed, streamlined operations, and reliability were on full display with this flawless Electron launch for STP-S30, and we're proud to be strengthening the nation's space capabilities. We're meeting the space access demands of the U.S. Space Force with our consistent execution, and this launch is another proud moment in Rocket Lab's long history of successful missions for defense, national security, and commercial space users."

Lt. Col. Brian Shimek, Director, Department of War Space Test Program, says: "We are immensely proud of this collaboration with Rocket Lab, the Capability Development Branch, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), The Aerospace Corporation, and the Rocket Systems Launch Program. Their exceptional teamwork and dedication have made this achievement possible. Proving these advanced technologies in the space environment is a critical step towards their integration into future operational Space Force systems, ensuring our nation maintains its edge in space. Accelerating this launch by five months underscores our commitment to rapidly delivering innovative capabilities to the Space Force. This achievement is a testament to the dedication and expertise of the entire STP-S30 team."

Don't Be Such A Square is Electron's 20th launch of 2025 and the company's 78th mission overall. With this flight, Rocket Lab extends its annual launch record and continues to build cadence from both New Zealand and U.S. launch sites in support of civil, commercial, and defense customers.

[TITLE]Rocket maker receives largest single job incentive award in Colorado history:
[TEXT]
The Colorado Economic Development Commission on Thursday approved its largest single incentive awards ever, extending $35.2 million in state tax credits to a rapidly growing developer and producer of solid rocket motors and hypersonic propulsion systems, matching the description of a company called Ursa Major.

In line with the practice of cloaking the names of applicants, the award was made to Project Ladybug. The Job Growth Incentive Tax Credits are conditioned on the unnamed company creating up to 1,850 jobs at an average annual wage of $128,108 over the next eight years.

Project Ladybug is a local aerospace company with 311 employees, including 255 in Colorado, which matches the headcount of Berthoud-based Ursa Major. The company told the state it was considering expanding in Mississippi, California and Ohio, a state where Ursa Major has a manufacturing plant. It appears the company will locate its expanded headquarters in Broomfield County.

The most telling clue is that the company in question received an Advanced Industries program award of $250,000 in 2017 from the state. That matches Ursa Major to a T.

Ursa Major raised $100 million in equity and $50 million in debt commitments in a Series E round that closed on Nov. 18, and now has an estimated value of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, according to CB Insights. That would make it a “unicorn” like SpaceX, just a lot smaller. The company has also disclosed that it has secured $115 million in contracts this year from commercial and defense industry customers.

Among the jobs it expects to add are roles in human resources, legal, finance, IT, market and compliance, as well as in production and research and development. Ursa Major broke ground on a new 400-acre solid rocket motor test site in Weld County on Sept. 10. That facility will allow it to design, build and test large solid rocket motor systems more efficiently.

“This facility represents a major step forward in our ability to deliver qualified SRMs that are scalable, flexible, and ready to meet the evolving threat environment,” said Dan Jablonsky, CEO of Ursa Major, in a release. “It’s a clear demonstration of our commitment and ability to rapidly advance and expand the American-made solid rocket motor industrial base that the country needs, ensuring warfighters will have the quality and quantity of SRMs needed to meet mission demands.”

The company is also making advances in liquid engine designs for hypersonic missiles, an emerging weapons system where the U.S. lags China and Russia. Those faster missiles can evade defense systems more easily and hit their targets more quickly, which is why the Department of Defense is pushing hard to close the gap.

Ursa Major’s Hadley H13 engine has been tested at sustained Mach 5+ hypersonic speeds and the company is also developing the Draper, a storable liquid engine with hypersonic applications.

Joe Laurienti, a former engineer at Blue Origin and SpaceX, founded Ursa Major Technologies in 2015. The company has grown to be an important player in the Front Range’s push to be recognized as “Aerospace Alley” or the next Silicon Valley of defense and aerospace.

Growing aerospace and defense companies and jobs is a priority for state economic development efforts. But the state tax credits offered are only useful when companies have profits to offset them. That often isn’t the case with startups and rapidly growing companies.

To boost the value of the incentives, state legislators in 2023 approved the CHIPS Refundable Tax Credits program that allows the state to pay out up to 80% of any credits not used to offset taxes for companies in advanced industries.

The commission on Thursday approved making $8 million in credits refundable to the company from this fiscal year’s allocation of $15 million per year under the program. It also agreed to earmark another $15 million from the next round of funding.

The credits awarded, if they are all claimed, will work out to a little more than $19,000 per job created.
