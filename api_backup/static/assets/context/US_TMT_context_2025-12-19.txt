A powerful rebound in tech dealmaking

Despite a forbidding backdrop of geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty, technology M&A has hit the accelerator. In the third quarter of 2025, transactions in the tech, media and telecom (TMT) sector reached $256 billion, a 51% jump on the previous quarter. The scale of the rebound is significant in a market that only recently seemed stuck in neutral.

The resurgence has been led by very large transactions. Deals worth $1 billion or more accounted for $220 billion of Q3 2025 value, spread across 37 mega-deals. The largest of these was the $55 billion takeover of Electronic Arts by a consortium including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, which alone absorbed more than a fifth of quarterly tech deal value. Buyers are once again prepared to commit serious capital. Yet, in an age of anxiety

[TITLE]US suspends technology deal with Britain: FT:
[TEXT]
The United States has suspended a technology deal it struck with Britain earlier this year, which was intended to boost ties in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy, the Financial Times reported on Monday.British officials on Monday confirmed the U.S. suspended the deal last week, the FT said, adding that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was pushing for Britain's concessions in areas of trade outside the tech partnership.U.S. officials were becoming increasingly frustrated with Britain's lack of willingness to address so-called non-tariff barriers , including rules and regulations governing food and industrial goods, the FT said.Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House and British government did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.In September, during Trump's visit to Britain, both countries agreed to a " Tech Prosperity Deal " to boost ties in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy.The U.S. is Britain's largest trading partner, and its big tech companies have already invested billions of dollars in their UK operations.

[TITLE]Nvidia buys AI software provider SchedMD to expand open-source AI push:
[TEXT]
Dec 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia said on Monday it acquired AI software firm SchedMD, as the chip designer doubles down on open-source technology ​and steps up investments in the artificial intelligence ecosystem to fend off ‌rising competition.

The chip designer built its reputation on speedy chips, but it also offers a range ‌of its own AI models, from physics simulations to self-driving vehicles, as open-source software that researchers and companies can use.

Its proprietary CUDA software, a standard among most developers, is a major selling point for its chips, making software key to ⁠maintaining its dominance in the ‌AI industry.

Nvidia shares were up 1.35% after the news and an earlier announcement of new open-source AI models.

SchedMD provides software ‍that helps schedule large computing jobs that can occupy a big share of a data center's server capacity.

Its technology, called Slurm, is open source, meaning developers and firms can ​access it for free, while the company sells engineering and maintenance support.

Financial terms ‌of the deal were not disclosed. Nvidia said it would continue to distribute SchedMD's software on an open-source basis.

"Slurm, which is supported on the latest Nvidia hardware, is also part of the critical infrastructure needed for generative AI, used by foundation model developers and AI builders to manage model training and inference ⁠needs," Nvidia said in a blog post.

Earlier ​on Monday, Nvidia unveiled a new family of ​open-source AI models that it says will be faster, cheaper and smarter than its previous offerings, as it faces a growing wave ‍of rival open-source ⁠models from Chinese AI labs.

SchedMD was founded in 2010 by Slurm software developers Morris "Moe" Jette and Danny Auble in Livermore, California, and the company ⁠currently employs 40 people, according to its website.

Its customers include cloud infrastructure firm CoreWeave and ‌the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, among others.

[TITLE]More Delays? US Broadband Funding Hits Potential Snag Over Procedural Error:
[TEXT]
A $42.5 billion program to expand high-speed internet in the US is facing new uncertainty after a government watchdog found that the Trump administration improperly overhauled it in June.

The Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program had cleared its last hurdles, and was beginning to distribute funds to states to help build fiber networks and pay for satellite services. But on Tuesday, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a ruling that could open the program to new delays and even lawsuits.

The GAO found that the Trump administration’s controversial changes to the BEAD program were substantial enough to require a Congressional review before they took effect. However, the agency in charge, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) within the Commerce Department, never sent a notice to Congress. Instead it cleared the reforms itself, and required all US states and territories to re-submit their BEAD proposals. Since then, over half of the proposals have been approved.

The GAO ruling has prompted the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband and Society to urge Congress to intervene. “As GAO’s analysis clearly shows, the June 6th policy notice that dramatically changed the BEAD Program can not take effect without Congressional review,” the group’s executive director, Revati Prasad, said in a statement.

The Trump reforms included prioritizing lower-cost options and opening more funding to satellite internet services, including SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon’s Leo, potentially taking it away from faster, but more expensive fiber installations.

The GAO told PCMag its role isn’t to enforce the ruling. Still, the office took up the matter on a request from Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). Last month, a group of three other Democratic lawmakers called out the Trump administration’s June reforms, claiming the changes violate the original intent of the funding. "Rural communities were especially poised to finally receive the same future-proof infrastructure that today connects urban centers and densely populated suburbs," the lawmakers wrote to the NTIA.

One major question is whether Democrats will use the GAO ruling to try and invalidate the Trump administration’s reforms to BEAD through a special procedure under the Congressional Review Act. The Democratic lawmakers didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Another issue is whether internet service providers will leverage the GAO ruling to file lawsuits because they were on track to receive a larger share of BEAD funding before the Trump administration changed the program. Currently, SpaceX and Amazon are slated to receive close to $1 billion collectively to serve close to 900,000 locations in the BEAD program, or about 22.5%. Fiber has been allocated to about 63% of the locations.

In the meantime, broadband experts are concerned that the BEAD program, which started in 2022 as part of former President Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will face even more delays and turmoil.

“[State broadband offices] are ready to jump out of a window at this point,” Kansas’s former director for the office of broadband development, Jade Piros de Carvalho, posted on LinkedIn.

The Commerce Department and NTIA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Indiana’s broadband office told PCMag: “We will, of course, comply with all federal requirements. Beyond that, we don’t have additional comments at this time.”

Asian stocks opened lower following US losses as global markets fell into a familiar, risk-off pattern with tech concerns weighing on stocks, and supporting shorter-maturity Treasuries and precious metals.Shares in Japan and Australia dropped along with equity futures for Hong Kong. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 declined 1.9% Wednesday with Nvidia Corp. slipping 3.8% to its lowest since September. The S&P 500 slid 1.2% to levels not seen in three weeks, breaching its 50-day moving average.Bitcoin was caught in the souring sentiment, falling more than 2% Wednesday, before retracing some of this week’s losses at Thursday’s open. US futures were fractionally higher after Micron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, gave an upbeat forecast late Wednesday.The heavy selling in tech was a sign investors are further questioning whether companies at the vanguard of the AI boom can keep justifying lofty valuations and ambitious spending. Concerns over the cost and viability of data center expansion, such as Oracle Corp.’s financing plans in Michigan, were fueling broader unease about the sector’s outlook.“AI remains the market’s defining investment theme, but signs of fatigue are emerging,” said Jack Ablin at Cresset Capital Management. “Sector valuations are elevated, infrastructure spending is unprecedented, and enthusiasm mirrors past speculative cycles.”Tech selling combined with comments from a Federal Reserve official supporting the case for interest-rate cuts to bid up two- and five-year Treasuries, popular havens. Longer-maturity Treasuries sold off, sending the 10-year yield one basis point higher to around 4.15% Wednesday.In commodities, gold and silver soared with the latter posting one of its best daily gains of the year to reach a new high. Oil bounced off a recent low against the backdrop of escalating geopolitical risk involving Russia and Venezuela.The sharp moves across asset classes suggested traders may be in for a busy holiday season, when thin liquidity can exacerbate market moves.As the year draws to a close, a clearer narrative has emerged in recent weeks: the mega-cap technology stocks that have powered this bull run may be losing their ability to carry the market on their own, according to Fawad Razaqzada at Forex.com.“Confidence in the sector is being challenged, particularly over whether stretched valuations and heavy spending on artificial intelligence can still be justified,” he said.Traders also geared up for Thursday’s US inflation reading amid a dose of skepticism as the consumer price index runs the risk of being less reliable than usual due to government-shutdown disruptions.In Asia, the yen edged higher early Thursday with the Bank of Japan expected to raise interest rates Friday to the highest level in three decades.Elsewhere, New Zealand’s economy rebounded more than economists had forecast in the third quarter, with falling interest rates helping drive output after a second-quarter contraction.Meanwhile, China Vanke Co., once the nation’s biggest homebuilder, lurched closer toward what would be one of the country’s largest-ever debt restructurings.

Google’s CC AI Agent

Google has announced CC, a new AI agent integrated across Gmail, Google Calendar, and Drive designed to help users plan and manage their daily workflow. The agent generates a personalized “Your Day Ahead” briefing each morning, consolidating upcoming meetings, tasks and relevant context to help users prioritize efficiently. Users can also request CC to draft emails, set appointments, create calendar links, and capture ideas in natural language via email prompts. CC is available in early access to Google AI Ultra and paid subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, with a waitlist open for broader access.

As reported by PYMNTS, OpenAI also released a similar offering on ChatGPT called Pulse.

Built atop Google’s Gemini family of generative models, CC exemplifies Google’s broader push toward proactive AI assistants that do more than respond to a user’s query, they anticipate needs and offer real-time productivity insights.

Unlike rudimentary AI chatbots, CC operates directly within users’ existing productivity workflows, positioning itself as a daily “second brain” rather than a standalone tool. Analysts see this as Google’s attempt to close the gap with rivals like Microsoft’s Copilot and OpenAI’s GPT-powered offerings that are increasingly embedded in workplace productivity tools.

OpenAI Talks With Amazon

In a development with potentially wide-ranging implications for the cloud and AI ecosystem, Amazon and OpenAI are reportedly in talks over a major investment that could top $10 billion and involve deeper collaboration on AI chips and infrastructure, according to Bloomberg. The discussions, still in progress, could see OpenAI lean more heavily on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and AWS-compatible AI silicon as part of its compute strategy.

For AWS, a deeper tie to OpenAI could strengthen its position against rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud in the highly competitive AI compute market. OpenAI’s computing needs are vast, and diversifying beyond Nvidia-centric GPU infrastructure potentially via custom AWS chips could reduce costs and increase scale.

Kindle’s ‘Ask This Book’ and ‘Recaps’

[TITLE]Texas Instruments opens new semiconductor factory in Sherman:
[TEXT]
The Brief Gov. Greg Abbott attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new $40 billion Texas Instruments plant in Sherman, which is expected to produce millions of semiconductor chips daily. The facility will create 3,000 jobs and aims to prevent future supply chain shortages for electronics, vehicles, and AI data centers. Texas is now positioned as a national leader in semiconductor manufacturing.

Gov. Greg Abbott helped to cut the ribbon on a new $40 billion factory that’s set to produce millions of semiconductor chips each day.

The Texas Instruments plant in Sherman will also create about 3,000 new jobs.

What we know:

This project has been years in the making.

It took 3.5 years to transform the empty plot of land in Sherman, located about 60 miles north of Dallas, into TI’s new 300mm semiconductor wafer fabrication facility.

Related article

It’s expected to produce millions of chips per day. That’s a big deal. The chips will be used to power all sorts of technology that people rely on daily.

The semiconductor chips will also help data centers that are popping up in Texas to meet the growing demand for artificial intelligence.

What they're saying:

Abbott joined the company’s president and CEO for a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

"Paving the way for safer and more connected vehicles, and making the electronics we depend on every day – from the medical devices monitoring your health to the smartphones in your pocket – smarter, more efficient, and more reliable," he said. "Texas Instruments has made a Texas-sized investment, adding billions of dollars in investment, as well as thousands more employees."

The governor said Texas is now leading the nation in semiconductor manufacturing.

Dr. Joshua Rhodes is a research scientist at the University of Texas. He said the semiconductor facility will make a huge difference in shortening the supply chain.

He pointed to the pandemic as an example, when thousands of new vehicles sat idle at car dealerships because there was a shortage of the chips needed to power the technology in those new cars.

"During the pandemic, we saw supply chain interruptions, meaning we couldn’t get other types of, or we couldn’t get the components we needed to make the products that we wanted to buy and consume," he said.

Dr. Rhodes believes TI’s new facility is also good for future business development.

"The more high-tech that we bring to the state, the more high-tech that then will come to the state," he said.
