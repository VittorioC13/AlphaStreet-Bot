[TITLE]Mark Zuckerberg Bets Billions On 'Startup Mode' As Meta's Superintelligence Unit Lures Alexandr Wang And Nat Friedman From Top AI Firms:
[TEXT]
Meta (NASDAQ:META) is reorganizing its artificial intelligence division around compact, high-impact teams as CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushes the company deeper into what he calls "superintelligence labs," Business Insider reported.

The company has carved out a secretive group named TBD Lab, staffed with elite engineers poached from leading AI startups and headed by Alexandr Wang, the founder of Scale AI. Meta recently spent $14 billion to acquire a stake in Scale AI as part of its superintelligence push, according to media reports.

Zuckerberg said on Meta's latest earnings call, he has "gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small, talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." He contrasted the new unit with the thousands of engineers who manage Facebook's news feed, pointing out a cultural move toward agility over scale.

The Small Team Philosophy Gains Momentum

According to an internal memo sent by Wang and reviewed by Business Insider, Meta has reorganized its artificial intelligence division into four specialized groups designed to push its "superintelligence labs" initiative forward.

Wang acknowledged in his memo that "org changes can be disruptive," but argued that restructuring was critical for Meta to compete in the race toward superintelligence.

The shift mirrors a broader Silicon Valley movement toward lean operations. Kashish Gupta, co-founder of Hightouch, a San Francisco AI startup valued at $1.2 billion, told Business Insider his company relies on about 55 engineers despite raising more than $132 million.

A major AI agent launch at the company was developed by only four people, he said, emphasizing that "the people prioritizing work are the engineers themselves or the people they work with."

Investor Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO who now leads Meta's Products and Applied Research group, has echoed this sentiment in a manifesto on his website, writing, "Smaller teams are better. Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun."

A Fierce AI Talent War

Meta has intensified its recruitment strategy by offering nine-figure compensation packages to attract engineers from rivals such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, The Wall Street Journal reported. Such high-stakes hiring reflects a belief that a handful of elite researchers can deliver breakthroughs with outsized impact.

[TITLE]Accelerated Innovation: AI-Ready Data Centre Solutions:
[TEXT]
In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising the way we live and work. Schneider Electric, a global leader in energy management and automation, is at the forefront of this transformation, driving innovation in AI-ready data centre solutions.

In its recent virtual AI broadcast, Schneider Electric unveiled several key developments and strategies aimed at addressing the growing energy demands of AI, while ensuring sustainability and efficiency.

The AI Revolution and Data Centres

AI is often described as the next industrial revolution, with the potential to enhance capabilities, improve production, transform operations and reduce risks. However, the backbone of this AI infrastructure is data centres, which are critical enablers of efficiency and decarbonisation.

As AI continues to advance, the energy demands of data centres are expected to double between 2022 and 2026, according to the International Energy Agency. This presents a significant challenge for the industry, which must scale quickly to seize AI opportunities while remaining sustainable.

Schneider Electric's AI-Ready Data Centre Solutions

Schneider Electric is committed to helping its customers deploy and operate AI-ready data centres. The company has made bold strides in tackling AI's massive energy demands through innovative solutions and strategic partnerships.

One of the key announcements made during the broadcast was Schneider Electric's agreement to acquire Motivair, a leader in liquid cooling and thermal management. Liquid cooling is seen as the future of AI data centres, and Motivair's expertise will enhance Schneider Electric's capabilities in this area.

In addition to this acquisition, Schneider Electric announced a significant investment to support the development of innovative and sustainable data centre solutions over the next three years. This investment will ensure that customers have a reliable partner to help them quickly deploy AI-ready data centres around the globe.

Partnership with NVIDIA

Schneider Electric also highlighted its partnership with NVIDIA, a leader in AI computing. Together, they have launched new data centre reference designs for sustainable liquid-cooled AI clusters, capable of supporting up to 132 kilowatts per rack. These designs are optimised to handle high-density liquid-cooled loads, enabling accelerated compute at scale.

Energy Strategy for the AI Era

One of the critical challenges facing the data centre industry is the need to decouple the growth of data centres from energy consumption. Schneider Electric is addressing this challenge through a comprehensive energy strategy that focuses on three primary areas: energy sourcing, on-site power generation and management of power sources.

Schneider Electric provides power sourcing services to ensure the availability of energy from any place and any source. Through its AlphaStruxure division, the company also offers on-site power generation solutions, including wind, solar, gas turbines, engines and hydrogen fuel cells. These solutions are designed to ensure the availability of energy and decrease the time to power facilities.

Sustainability and Decarbonisation

Sustainability is at the core of Schneider Electric's mission. The company is committed to helping its customers set, meet and even exceed their sustainability objectives in line with their AI strategy.

Schneider Electric's EcoDesign process ensures that environmental impact is considered at every stage of product development. For example, the new Galaxy VXL UPS, which was designed with sustainability in mind, reduces material used by two tonnes and operating costs by more than 50%.

As AI continues to drive efficiencies and productivity across industries, the energy demands of data centres will only increase. Schneider Electric is leading the way in developing innovative and sustainable solutions to meet these demands.

Through strategic partnerships, significant investments and a commitment to sustainability, Schneider Electric is helping to shape the future of AI-ready data centres. By working together, it is possible to bend the energy curve and decouple the growth of data centres from energy consumption, ensuring a more sustainable future for all.

Mark Bellis and colleagues argue health professionals must do more to counterbalance the arms industry’s influence on government, media, finance, and science and its damaging effects on human and planetary health

Defence and security are fundamental responsibilities of governments and can be used as compelling arguments for investment in arms. However, what types of weapons to acquire, the strength of national and international regulations controlling the deployment of arms, and how much governments spend on their acquisition are contentious issues. In 2025, deadly and destabilising armed conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan dominate headlines, shape geopolitics, and fuel public debates over the balance between domestic welfare and global security expenditure.

At the June 2025 NATO summit, members committed to raising defence related spending to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035.1 Average current spending by NATO members is around 2%. In the UK, this target would amount to almost half of UK government healthcare expenditure.2 ReArm Europe, a European Commission initiative, is mobilising an additional €800bn for defence.3 Political decisions on spending are not made in a vacuum. They are affected by the interlinked military, government, arms, and, increasingly, dual use industries (eg, artificial intelligence, drones, surveillance, space) whose motives extend beyond public protection into power and profit.45

War and conflict have major effects on health, at individual, population, and planetary levels.4 Like other industries, the arms sector’s impact on health is multiplied or moderated by the actions it takes and the regulations that control it. We define the commercial determinants of health as the “strategies and approaches used by the private sector to promote products and choices that are detrimental to health.”6

Our first article laid out why the arms industry, and the harms it incurs, should be examined as a commercial determinant of health.4 Here, we examine the tactics used by the global arms industry and their effects on health and wellbeing. We focus predominantly on arms used in conflict and for profit (box 1), recognising that arms industries are also in some cases, such as China and Russia, effectively parts of national military structures and governments.

Box 1 Features of the global arms industry * Market Products include weapons systems, ammunition and explosives, military services, surveillance and targeting technologies, dual use technologies, operational support, and training

The global arms market is highly concentrated and dominated by the US, which leads global exports (43% share in 2024), followed by France (9.6%), Russia (7.8%), and China (5.9%)7

Revenues from sales of the 100 largest arms and military companies reached $632bn (around £470bn; €540bn) in 20238

The industry has a global footprint. While major companies are headquartered in a few countries, their subsidiaries are widely dispersed, although lack of transparency limits information on them9

Trade association estimates suggest there were 181 500 employees in the UK defence sector in 2024,10 and 581 000 employees in the European defence industry in 202311 Ownership and control Most major arms companies, including Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, and Raytheon Technologies, are publicly listed and owned by a mix of institutional investors, pension funds, and individual shareholders. Others, such as NORINCO (China), Almaz-Antey (Russia), Hindustan Aeronautics (India), and Israel Aerospace Industries, are state owned9

Companies are funded through government contracts, foreign military and commercial sales, and private capital. The sector also receives substantial government subsidies1213 Transparency and accountability Many major arms companies lack transparency, particularly in public information
