[TITLE]Microsoft to invest over $15 billion in UAE, secures US export licenses for Nvidia chips:
[TEXT]
By Federico Maccioni

ABU DHABI (Reuters) -Microsoft plans to bring its total investment in the United Arab Emirates to $15 billion by the end of 2029 and has the Trump administration's approval to export Nvidia chips for its data centres there, a senior executive told Reuters on Monday.

The UAE has been spending billions of dollars to become a global artificial intelligence hub, leveraging its close relations with Washington to secure access to U.S. technology, including some of the world's most advanced chips.

"The biggest share of (the investment), by far, both looking back and looking forward, is the expansion of AI data centres across the UAE," Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in an interview.

"From our perspective, it's an investment that is critical to meet the demand here for the use of AI," he said on the sidelines of the ADIPEC energy conference in Abu Dhabi.

NEW ROUND OF CHIP EXPORT APPROVALS FROM TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

Microsoft invested $1.5 billion last year to take a minority stake in Abu Dhabi AI company G42, giving the U.S. tech giant a board seat, which is filled by Smith.

G42's past ties to China, however, have attracted scrutiny in Washington, due to concerns over Beijing's access to advanced semiconductors, including via third parties like the UAE.

G42 said last year it was working with U.S. partners and the Emirati government to comply with AI development and deployment standards. Smith said G42 had made "enormous progress" in implementing the systems required to comply with U.S. law.

Asked whether the Abu Dhabi firm would obtain direct access to the most advanced U.S. chips, he said he thought that would be "part of G42's future."

Smith said in a separate blog post on Microsoft's website on Monday that licences approved last year by the Biden administration allowed Microsoft to accumulate the equivalent of 21,500 Nvidia A100 GPUs in the UAE, based on a combination of A100, H100, and H200 chips.

The White House in September cleared for export an amount equivalent to a further 60,400 A100 chips, involving Nvidia's more advanced GB300 GPUs, he said, after the administration revised technology safeguards.

U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on China Chairman John Moolenaar, a Republican from Michigan, expressed concern about the deal.

"As the committee's work has shown, the UAE and China maintain a close technology partnership, and this past spring UAE officials deepened those ties with a visit to China," Moolenaar said in a statement. "I welcome the prospect of closer U.S. technology collaboration with the UAE—but it needs to come with the Emiratis verifiably and irreversibly choosing America."

New Delhi: In major relief for Vodafone Idea (Vi), the Supreme Court Monday modified its October 27 order and permitted the Centre to create a special package for the cash-strapped telco on its entire adjusted gross revenue (AGR) liabilities totalling more than ₹83,400 crore. The Vi stock surged nearly 10%.Last month, the apex court had restricted the relief to only the additional demand of ₹9,450 crore raised by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) until FY19. That directive had prompted Vi to approach a bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI), BR Gavai, for clarification.While senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi brought the issue to the notice of the top court Monday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the government, supported him.The CJI then modified the earlier order permitting the government to also “comprehensively reassess and reconcile all AGR dues up to FY 2016-17, including interest and penalty.”Following the revised order, shares of Vi surged 9.28% to close at ₹9.54 apiece on BSE Monday. The relief, however, will be restricted to Vi only, and its rival Bharti Airtel won’t get any benefit — as of now.While Vi had initially sought relief on the additional dues, it later sought amendment of its petition to cover the entire AGR dues, including waiver of the interest and penalty on the arrears.The revised Supreme Court order was not uploaded on the court’s website until the publication of this report. ET’s query to Vi regarding the modified apex court order remained unanswered. The latest court ruling allows the government now to chalk out a relief package for Vi, a relative straggler in the telecom sector.If the issue around the AGR dues is resolved, the company would be able to secure fresh capital, including its planned fundraising of ₹25,000 crore. A successful equity issue would dilute the government’s stake below the current 49%, providing the Centre with the option of converting additional dues into equity.Currently, the government owns a 48.99% stake in Vi, having converted some of the telco’s past dues into stock.The Aditya Birla Group and the UK’s Vodafone hold 9.50% and 16.07%, respectively, in the telco.ET reported Monday that New York-based private equity firm Tillman Global Holdings (TGH) was negotiating a $4-6-billion (around Rs 35,000-52,800 crore) investment in the financially struggling company and that it would take operational control.The proposed TGH investment, however, would fructify if the government were to provide a comprehensive package covering all the liabilities of Vi, including the AGR dues and spectrum payments, sources told ET.When the BSE sought clarification from Vi regarding the TGH talks, the company said it keeps exploring various opportunities and options to raise funds within the authorisations given by its board.In the absence of any relief from the government, Vi is scheduled to pay more than ₹18,000 crore in March next year as an instalment of AGR dues. Analysts, however, expect the Centre to provide relief to the company in the coming weeks and months, much ahead of the scheduled payments by March next year.The relief, they said, could be in the form of a partial waiver of dues or extension of timeline for payment of the dues, or a combination of the two.The apex court relief comes after several attempts by the company to overturn or modify the apex court’s 2019 ruling that had backed the DoT's definition of AGR and slapped telcos such as Vi and Bharti Airtel with thousands of crores of rupees in retrospective dues.Coming to the rescue of Vi, the government argued before the Supreme Court that the financial viability of the telco was tied to 200 million subscribers and also that the government had infused substantial equity to own 49% of the company.

[TITLE]Vodafone Idea shares surge 14% after SC clarifies AGR dues review:
[TEXT]
Shares of Vodafone Idea zoomed 14 per cent intra-day, after the Supreme Court clarified that the government could reassess all of the adjusted gross revenue dues of the telecom operator, including the penalty and interest.

Last week, the Supreme Court, while hearing the petition filed by Vodafone Idea on the AGR dues demand by the government, allowed the government the freedom to reconsider the dues by the company.

There was uncertainty, however, on whether the review of the dues would cover the entire amount of over ₹80,000 crore or was restricted only to additional dues of ₹9,500 crore.

‘big relief’

“There is no doubt that this should be a big relief to Vodafone Idea that the government can now reconsider the entire outstanding AGR liabilities… this means that any creditor would have the confidence that the money lent to them will be used for operations and expansion rather than settling its liabilities,” said Faisal Kawoosa, Chief Analyst, Techarc.

While a lot would depend on the government’s reassessment of the dues and how much relief it would grant the telco, “the intent is clear that the government wants to save the company,” said Prashant Singhal, Markets Leader and Telecommunications Leader, EY India.

loss of subscribers

Getting funds to invest in its infrastructure is imperative for the survival of Vodafone Idea, which has been steadily losing subscribers.

With over 17 per cent market share and wireless subscriber base of over 20 crore at the end of September, it is still a significant player in the market, said Singhal.

But loss of subscribers is also a thing that lenders are likely to factor in while taking any lending decision, said Kawoosa. “Yes, the SC clarification will make its case a positive, but that doesn’t mean that we will see lenders lining up,” he pointed out.

While the government backing as a major shareholder is a comfort, lenders would be wary that it may not be an easy borrower, he added.

TGH investment

Separately, responding to a news report that said US-based private equity firm TGH was in talks to invest $6 billion in it, Vodafone Idea said that it “keeps exploring various opportunities and options to raise funds within the authorisations given by the Board,” and added there was no proposal currently being considered by the board that required disclosure.

The telco’s shares ended up 9.7 per cent at ₹9.58 on the NSE.
