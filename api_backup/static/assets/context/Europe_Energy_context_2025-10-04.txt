[TITLE]Ukraine pitches plan to help US sell American oil to Europe and ice out Russia:
[TEXT]
Kyiv has pitched Washington on ways it could help the US replace Russia in oil sales to Europe — as President Trump pushes the continent to divest from Moscow’s energy sector to end its brutal war on Ukraine, The Post can exclusively reveal.

Pipelines deep beneath Ukraine’s surface could help funnel fuel either drilled in the country through the US-Ukraine mineral deal or shipped in from the US, Ukrainian Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk told The Post.

The potential partnership means American oil companies could replace Moscow in Europe’s energy sector.

“Ukraine’s gas and oil infrastructure has always been a key part of European energy security because Ukrainian territory was like a transit from Russia to Europe — and we have very, very good gas and oil infrastructure,” Grynchuk said.

“The US and other international partners could use this infrastructure for ensuring European energy security by supplying it and also the storage potential of gas and oil in Ukraine.”

Ukraine has the most liquid natural gas storage in all of Europe.

Peace and profit

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s top advisor, Andriy Yermak, said he briefly proposed the idea to US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly last week, telling The Post that Kyiv could help the US supplant Russia in providing oil to holdout European nations.

Should President Trump sign on, he could help end Russia’s war on Ukraine and boost the US economy in one swing by replacing Russian oil with American energy sales to Europe, Yermak said.

“I asked him to introduce me to your Secretary of Energy,” he said of his conversation with Waltz.

“I asked him that please, as soon as possible, please arrange the meetings [between US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Grynchuk,] and we can come.”

America’s potential interest in such an arrangement is unclear. Ukraine’s proposal is in the very early stages. Waltz’ and Wright’s offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

“We need to work together, because Ukraine is the responsible partner [over Russia,]” Yermak said. “We are open. Let’s see things together, and let’s work together.”

Weaning Europe off of Russia’s energy sector is a key factor in pressuring Russian dictator Volodymyr Putin to end his war on Ukraine, Trump has repeatedly said.

As Moscow’s main source of funding for its war needs, the US president has been adamant that Europe must stop buying Russian oil.

Critics have argued that it would hurt Europe’s energy security — but Yermak counters that it would also open up opportunities for other energy exporters, such as the US, to fill in the gap.

In addition to importing American energy products for sale in Europe, Grynchuk said the US and Ukraine could also use their shared mineral deal to sell energy native to Ukraine to European partners, Grynchuk said.

That minerals deal — which is already in place — would see Kyiv and Washington splitting profits 50/50 on Ukrainian oil pumped by American companies and distributed through Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

In the meantime, Ukraine’s state-owned Naftogaz this year began focusing on partnerships with US energy companies.

American LNG now makes up 8% of its total supply — up from zero before Trump took office, the company’s CEO Sergii Koretskyi told The Post.

“We would like that to increase. We have not enough of our own production of natural gas, and I do not see the possibility to reach our energy independence in terms of natural gas in the coming years,” he said.

“We are also happy to provide [US] companies with our infrastructure and underground storage, and we are happy to purchase [US] LNG resources for our own needs.”

European hold-outs

President Trump for weeks has been hounding the European Union to divest from Russian oil — the Kremlin’s main source of income fueling its war machine.

The main holdouts are Slovakia and Hungary, as well as non-EU states such as Turkey and Serbia.

[TITLE]France detains Russian ‘shadow’ tanker to disrupt war in Ukraine:
[TEXT]
Moscow has called France’s detention of the ship, and arrest of the captain, an act of piracy.

France has said it is increasing pressure on Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine by detaining an oil tanker suspected of operating as part of Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet” and putting its captain on trial.

France’s detention of the tanker is part of a new European strategy to block revenue funding Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said at an EU event in Copenhagen on Thursday.

“We want to increase pressure on Russia to convince it to return to the negotiating table,” Macron said. “We have now decided to take a step further by moving towards a policy of obstruction when we have suspicious ships in our waters that are involved in this trafficking.”

The tanker, called the Boracay, was sailing last week off the coast of Denmark and was cited by European naval experts as possibly being involved in drone flights over the country. A series of drone incidents near the country’s airports and military bases over the last week forced the closure of the Copenhagen airport, causing major disruptions.

Macron said he could not rule out a connection between the vessel and the drone incursions, but so far lacked proof. Moscow has denied any involvement.

French Navy commandos raided the Boracay on Saturday off western France.

An investigation led by the French navy concluded that the ship, coming from Russia and heading to India with a “large oil shipment,” was flying no flag, Stéphane Kellenberger, prosecutor of the western port city of Brest, said.

The United Nations has detailed rules governing how ships must fly flags at sea and identify themselves under the flag of the state granting them nationality.

The ship’s captain, a Chinese national, will stand trial in France in February. He faces up to one year in prison and a 150,000 euro ($176,000) fine if convicted.

In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Europe of stoking “hysteria” and called France’s actions an act of “piracy”.

“This is piracy. I am aware of this case – the tanker was seized in neutral waters without any justification,” Putin said on Thursday at a foreign policy forum in the southern resort city of Sochi, adding that there was no military cargo on the vessel.

“It’s piracy, and how do you deal with pirates?” Putin said. “You destroy them. It doesn’t mean that tomorrow a war will erupt all across the global ocean, but certainly the risk of confrontation will seriously increase.”

Russia has been accused of operating a “shadow fleet” of tankers made up of ageing ships bought used, often by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from nonsanctioning countries. Their role is to help Russia’s oil exporters elude the $60 per barrel price cap imposed by Ukraine’s allies.

Macron said “30 to 40 percent” of Russia’s war effort is “financed through the revenues of the shadow fleet”.

“It represents more than 30 billion euros. So it’s extremely important to increase the pressure on this shadow fleet, because it will clearly reduce the capacity to finance this war effort for Russia,” he said.

[TITLE]Ukraine can decimate Russian oil refineries, military bases if US extends help with intel, missiles: experts:
[TEXT]
Ukraine will have the power to decimate Russian oil refineries, crippling the main source of funding for its war machine, and launch an Operation Spider Web-style attack on more military bases if the US commits to sharing intelligence and long-range missiles, experts told The Post.

With President Trump reportedly green-lighting an intelligence-sharing agreement for strikes deep inside Russia, Ukraine will be capable of more precise and more destructive attacks against Moscow, said George Barros, of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.

And should the US fulfill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s request for Tomahawk cruise missiles — capable of reaching targets 1,500 miles away — the combination could bring Russia to its knees.

“Russia has always been protected by the tyranny of distance,” Barros said, “but with tomahawks and precise intelligence from the West, you have the payload plus the distance to take out big targets that Ukrainian systems just haven’t been able to hit.”

5 Ukraine has hit 16 out of 38 major Russian oil refineries in recent months, including the facility in Leningrad on Sept. 14. Astra

5 With the help of US intelligence, Ukraine would also be able to take out the Russian equipment that has bombarded Kyiv daily. AP

The newest intelligence-sharing agreement allows the Pentagon and US intel agencies to help Kyiv target oil refineries, pipelines and other infrastructure that provide the Kremlin with revenues and resources needed to sustain its bloody war on Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported.

John Hardie, of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, noted that Ukraine has already been able to hit 16 of 38 key oil refineries in recent months, with the number likely to go up with help from the US and NATO.

“These types of strikes create fuel shortages in Russia, force Moscow to limit exports, and ultimately hurt the Russian economy and ability to wage war,” Hardie said.

“And just as important, it brings the war home to Russians, who have been largely apathetic until the economic blows start coming in,” he added.

The attacks so far, however, haven’t completely destroyed a refinery.

A lucrative refinery near Volgograd, for instance, was targeted in August, but the damage only halted operations for a month, the BBC reported.

The Tomahawk missiles — considered one of the most powerful and effective long-range precision cruise missiles — could change that.

“A 100-kilogram (220-pound) warhead can cause some damage like what we’ve seen so far, but a 1,000-kilogram warhead would put Russian equipment out of commission for good,” Barros said.

In addition, Kyiv’s forces should be able to hit refineries they haven’t yet attacked, including the Kirishinefteorgsintez refinery in Northwestern Russia and the Perm refinery near the Ural Mountains, according to the Caspian Policy Center, which tracks Ukrainian strikes on Russia’s energy infrastructure.

Still, the gasoline shortage on the Russian market has so far reached 20%, or about 400,000 tons per month, causing major headaches for consumers, according to The Kommersant business daily.

Russia was also forced on Tuesday to extend its ban on gasoline exports and sign new restrictions on diesel shipments until the end of the year following the latest Ukraine strikes on Russian oil refineries.

But military analysts said that Ukraine is likely aiming for permission to strike more than just Russia’s energy facilities.

With American guidance and firepower, Ukraine could conduct more large-scale attacks on Russia’s defense infrastructure similar to Operation Spider Web, which took out 41 warplanes over the summer in a humiliating blow to Moscow, said Seth Jones, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank.

“Russia will now have to think about where their bases are located and where their weapons stockpiles are placed. Under the range of a Tomahawk missile, those sites are vulnerable now,” he said, noting that America’s intel network is “unparalleled.”

“Russia has always been good at hiding things, so they’ll try their best to mask their bases and stockpiles, but with good intelligence, Russia will have to be careful,” Jones added.

5 Experts said Russia would have to begin hiding its weapons and equipment once Ukraine is given US intelligence to conduct precision airstrikes. AP

Both Barros and Hardie echoed the need for Ukraine to take aim at Russia’s military industrial complex, with Moscow’s drone factories, soldier transportation routes and air defense systems standing as the prime targets.

However, should the US and NATO move forward with giving Ukraine more might, Russia might look to retaliate against Europe, Jones and Hardie warned.

“But I think what the West has seen is that Russia has a lot of bark and no bite,” Hardie said. “Putin was likely holding out hope that his troops could progress on the frontlines while aid stalled to Ukraine.

“Someone has to tell him that the lines in Ukraine won’t break,” he added.

[TITLE]The fast and sometimes furious reaction to Alberta's latest push for a pipeline through B.C.:
[TEXT]
After Alberta Premier Danielle Smith announced on Wednesday her government's intention to champion an application to the federal Major Projects Office for a new oil pipeline to the northwest coast of British Columbia, the reaction came fast and, in some cases, furious.

Numerous groups lined up with excitement and anticipation to back the premier's plans, while a host of others expressed reservation, doubt, fear and anger.

The premier wasted no time making her case directly to the jurisdiction most likely to stand in the way: British Columbia.

WATCH | Smith makes her pitch to the people of B.C. on CBC Vancouver's The Early Edition: Alberta premier pitches plan for pipeline project to northwest B.C. Duration 10:32 The Alberta government is proposing a new taxpayer-funded pipeline project that would extend to B.C.'s northwest coast. Premier Danielle Smith spoke with CBC's Stephen Quinn to pitch why she believes B.C. should get on board with the proposal, which has yet to be supported by B.C Premier David Eby or Indigenous leaders.

"It's very important for us to be able to get people on board with all of these nation-building projects; this is going to require co-operation between British Columbia and Alberta," Smith said.

"It's going to require a lot of Indigenous consultation with both Alberta bands as well as nations in British Columbia. And we want the consultation to begin early. We want it to be successful."

Judging from some of the initial response, however, that might be an uphill battle. A number of First Nations in B.C. quickly expressed their opposition to Smith's plan, as did B.C. Premier David Eby.

At the same time, the proposed pipeline — which has no specific route as of yet or private backer to actually build and operate it — did receive a fair share of enthusiastic support from business groups and federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

One thing is for certain: there are plenty of opinions

[TITLE]Nuclear fusion was always 30 years away—now it’s a matter of when, not if, fusion comes online to power AI:
[TEXT]
The breakthrough scientific moment for fusion power—and the potential for nearly limitless electricity from a so-called star in a jar—came at the end of 2022 when scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory successfully achieved “first ignition,” fusing atoms through extreme heat to generate more energy than the setup consumes for the first time ever.

The project’s principal designer, nuclear physicist Annie Kritcher, wasn’t content to keep the science in the lab after achieving what she deemed the “Wright brothers’ moment” for fusion. Kritcher cofounded Inertia Enterprises in August to bring the power to the actual grid. The potential promise of fusion is for consistent, clean power without radioactive waste, intermittency issues, or the dependence on foreign supply chains.

Inertia isn’t a lone startup promising hopes and dreams. There’s a group of companies now pursuing the commercialization of fusion within a decade—not some far-off timeline. The bottom line is many more scientists and business analysts are now convinced fusion energy powering our homes is just a matter of when, not if, even if the timeline estimates remain overly optimistic.

Roughly 60 years ago, pioneering Soviet physicist Lev Artsimovich said fusion power will be ready “when society needs it.” The combination of advances in science, technology—supercomputing and superconducting magnets—and, critically, money from AI hyperscalers and others makes fusion power a realistic option when the world is demanding much more electricity.

“Fusion is the holy grail of energy. It’s a clean, no-carbon, unlimited fuel source,” Kritcher told Fortune. “It’s powering hope for our generation and future generations to come.”

Whereas traditional nuclear fission energy creates power by splitting atoms, fusion uses heat to create energy by melding them together. In the simplest form, it fuses hydrogen found in water into an extremely hot, electrically charged state known as plasma to create helium—the same process that powers the sun. When executed properly, the process triggers endless reactions to make energy for electricity. But stars rely on overwhelming gravitational pressure to force their fusion. Here on Earth, creating and containing the pressure needed to force the reaction in a consistent, controlled way remains an engineering challenge.

“To power one person’s lifetime, it’s a bathtub of seawater and a laptop battery’s size of lithium,” Kritcher said. “It’s not a lot of materials, and there’s no [long-term] radioactive waste like we have with fission.”

Microsoft founder Bill Gates says the “coolest” things he’s working are fusion energy and next-generation nuclear fission projects.

“If you know how to build a fusion power plant, you can have unlimited energy anywhere and forever. It’s hard to overstate what a big deal that will be,” Gates said in an October 2 essay. “The availability and affordability of electricity is a huge limiting factor for virtually every sector of the economy today. Removing those limits could be as transformative as the invention of the steam engine before the Industrial Revolution.”

Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures investment firm financially backs fusion companies such as industry leader Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Type One Energy, and Zap Energy. The biggest challenge, as with all technology, is building the first one, Gates wrote. “We’re on the cusp of massive breakthroughs, and it’s clearer now than even before: The future of energy is subatomic.”

Kritcher’s project uses the world’s largest laser system at its California lab. She started Inertia with Jeff Lawson, the cofounder and former CEO of the Twilio cloud communications company and the current owner of The Onion satirical news publication. As CEO, Lawson’s bullishness on fusion is no joke.

Inertia follows the proven science while other companies use different fusion approaches that haven’t yet worked at scale, Lawson said. “That’s why fusion has been so elusive for decades. That’s why the running joke was always that fusion is 30 years away, and it’s been 70 years,” Lawson said.

“Now the big challenge we have is we have to go build the world’s largest laser, so that’ll be interesting and fun,” he said, laughing. He is hoping to complete the first pilot plant in the mid-2030s.

Inertia isn’t the leader in the fusion clubhouse when it comes to funding or construction, but it’s one of several in the hunt to prove it has the most scalable and affordable approach worldwide.

There likely will be multiple eventual fusion winners, said Prakash Sharma, head of scenarios and technologies for the Wood Mackenzie energy research firm, which projects that global electricity demand will nearly double by 2050, requiring $18 trillion in new investments.

While fusion power might enter the grid in a decade, he said, it will be closer to 2050 or beyond when fusion can grow to claim a notable chunk of the grid.

“It’s a question of when fusion becomes available, rather than a question of if,” Sharma said. “The challenges are being overcome, especially given the momentum behind the technologies and the interest from a number of different players like Google and Microsoft.”

Race against time

The Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) leads the fusion space in funding, contracts, and has the advantage of being founded earlier than most in 2018 through a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—well before the Livermore breakthrough.

CFS recently inked power purchase deals with Google and the Italian energy giant Eni for its first commercial fusion plant, ARC, slated to come online in the early 2030s just outside of Richmond, Virginia. If all goes as planned, which is no sure thing, the 400-megawatt plant would become the world’s first fusion plant providing steady power to the grid—enough to power

[TITLE]There Is No Green Transition Without Consequences:
[TEXT]
U.S. politics currently allow for vanishingly few areas of bipartisan consensus. But one thing government officials of all kinds tend to agree on is the importance of mining. In particular, they seek “transition minerals,” which are vital to the shift away from fossil fuels. These include lithium, cobalt, copper, and nickel (often called critical minerals, essential for rechargeable batteries), as well as rare-earth minerals such as yttrium, scandium, and lanthanides (integral components of green infrastructure). Freedom from dirty energy, it would appear, requires doubling down on the decidedly nonrenewable practice of mineral extraction.

The Biden administration devoted billions of dollars to building a domestic supply chain for critical minerals and called for half of all new cars to be electric or hybrid by 2030. Despite its well-documented hostility toward electric vehicles, the Trump administration recently took the unusual step of investing hundreds of millions of dollars in a private company to grow domestic mineral production. Donald Trump, like Joe Biden before him, craves Ukraine’s mineral wealth; the desire for mining access also partly motivated Trump’s threats to annex Greenland and Canada.

The mass deployment of technologies that these minerals make possible—fleets of electric cars; flocks of wind turbines; a cleaner energy grid—may be imperative if our society is to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and thereby avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change. Yet the green transition comes at a significant cost. The mining of minerals such as lithium “often leaves parts of the Earth itself uninhabitable,” the political scientist Thea Riofrancos writes in her astute new book, Extraction. As Riofrancos notes, approximately 69 percent of transition minerals—and a whopping 85 percent of lithium reserves—are in or near Indigenous or poor communities across the globe, rendering these groups disproportionately vulnerable to water contamination, displacement, and economic insecurity.

According to a number of recent books, the harmful consequences don’t stop there. The mining of cobalt often entails child labor, brutally described in Siddharth Kara’s 2023 best seller, Cobalt Red. Clashes between powerful political actors pursuing profit and local communities opposed to mines, in places as widespread as Peru and Pakistan, have led to “political upheaval, mayhem, and murder,” as the journalist Vince Beiser writes in his 2024 book, Power Metal.

Beiser describes the green transition as “a paradox” for human civilization: “We must do everything we can to stave off the catastrophes of climate change, but, in doing so, we may create a whole other set of catastrophes.” The reporter Ernest Scheyder poses a similar question in The War Below, also from 2024: What do we value more, the environment “or the lithium beneath it?”

In Extraction, Riofrancos moves well beyond this binary framing, and for this reason hers is by far the most clear-eyed of mining’s many recent chronicles. She takes seriously the costs of the green transition but argues that the paradox is, in fact, the result of false choices and a limited vision. She looks past mining sites to the policy choices of the world’s wealthiest corporate and political actors, located “all the way at the other end of far-flung supply chains.” In doing so, she suggests that a different, fairer, and greener world—one that demands less energy altogether—is possible.

The word extraction, as Riofrancos uses it, has a deliberately negative connotation. In adopting the term, she is pointedly conflating mining (the extraction of metals from the ground) with exploitation (the extraction of profits, often from faraway places and poor people’s labor). Just as Ta-Nehisi Coates used plunder to make clear that racism harms people not just interpersonally but materially, Riofrancos uses extraction to argue that mining is far more than shafts and tunnels and the removal of silver or copper; it is part and parcel of the unequal distribution of wealth, work, and waste.

In Riofrancos’s account, modern mineral mining was extractive from the start. No sooner had Christopher Columbus landed in the New World in 1492 than his men conscripted Indigenous Taíno people to dig up as much gold as they could find. Centuries of pillage followed, as colonial governors—in the Americas, in Africa, in Asia—compelled millions of enslaved or indentured laborers to mine precious metals that enriched European crowns and corporations, setting patterns that persisted, in some form, well past the end of formal colonialism.

Resistance to these practices also has deep roots. Starting in the 1920s and ’30s, a number of Latin American countries began nationalizing their oil and mining sectors. This trend went into hyperdrive in 1960, when Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela founded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), seeking to wrest control of the oil industry from the handful of U.S. and European companies that enjoyed a near-global monopoly. In the two decades that followed, nationalization was embraced by former colonies across Asia and Latin America, spurring the United States and wealthy European nations to start prioritizing domestic resource extraction.

The “oil shock” kicked off by OPEC also led Exxon to spend millions on finding a fossil-fuel alternative. Out of this research emerged the lithium-ion battery, first deployed at scale in early-2000s China. Over the next generation, Chinese companies began buying control of lithium mines around the world. Partly because of this access, China is now the world’s top exporter of batteries and solar panels (and nearly the top exporter of electric vehicles), and it is reportedly building three-quarters of solar and wind projects globally.

Riofrancos notes the predominance of China in the green transition, but the country is more of a specter than a fully realized subject of her study. Instead, she devotes far more attention to Latin America—and especially to Chile, where more than a third of global lithium reserves are located. After Chile nationalized its copper mines in 1971, U.S. officials backed a violent coup through which General Augusto Pinochet took power. Pinochet promptly reimbursed foreign mining companies, invited in foreign investors, and crushed domestic miners’ unions, moves with long-term ramifications. Today, in northern Chile, mining companies govern in all but name: They build local infrastructure and even provide social services. In exchange, Riofrancos writes, they expect local residents to quietly abide their presence.

Chilean lithium extraction occurs almost entirely in the country’s salt flats, striking desert landscapes that are home to thousands of flamingos and a great many Indigenous communities. The region’s plants, animals, and people bear the greatest environmental costs of the green transition. Mining companies have so exacerbated water scarcity that many Indigenous Chileans have had to give up herding. In China, as Riofrancos reports, the pollution flowing from mineral extraction has led to places where disproportionate rates of disease, including cancer, are the norm. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, women in cobalt-mining regions have reported reproductive-health concerns such as miscarriages and birth defects; cobalt mining has also polluted croplands. And in the United States, as Beiser writes in Power Metal, the mining industry is the leading emitter of toxic chemicals and “has sullied the watersheds of almost half of all the rivers in the American West.”

In the face of such extensive despoliation, grassroots opposition has emerged. Widespread demonstrations against lithium mining began in northern Chile in 2007 and spread around the world in the following years. In 2023, Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, who was elected in 2021 following protests against inequality and privatization, announced the creation of a state-owned lithium company and obliged future mining contracts to be “public-private partnerships.” This was part of a global trend: A third of the world’s countries have increased government control of their mining and energy industries since 2019. Even as Trump and China’s Xi Jinping seek to lock down global access to minerals, the inhabitants of mining regions continue to contest foreign dominance.

In 2024, Boric took steps to significantly expand lithium mining in the salt flats. Such a move is an example of what Riofrancos called “resource nationalism”—efforts by countries with abundant resources to increase control over them—in her previous book, Resource Radicals. The policy still countenances harmful mining, but with the intent of benefiting locals, not faraway CEOs or shareholders. African nations are hastening to restrict the export of key metals, hoping to generate domestic jobs and revenue. China, home to the majority of rare-earth-metal mining, recently did the same (possibly in response to the Trump administration’s tariff policies), a move that temporarily closed American auto plants. The United States and European Union are racing to “onshore” mineral production.

An approach that simply transfers the control or profits of mineral mining to a different party is no path out of the climate crisis—especially when that approach might lead to a “resource war.” Yet how to solve the paradox presented by transition minerals? The solutions widely on offer are plainly inadequate. For instance, in Power Metal, Beiser advocates for greater recycling and reuse of electronics, pushing readers to take up biking and “turn down the heating or cooling systems in your home a few degrees”—fine ideas as far as they go, which is not far at all.

Riofrancos writes that she, too, once felt overwhelmed by this conundrum. Upon returning from her first visit to the Chilean salt flats in 2019, she found herself asking: “If climate action requires more extraction, do the ends justify the means?” Yet since then, she has come to reject the premise of the question.

As Riofrancos writes, she was surprised to learn that existing studies of future mineral needs “assumed that the only way to eliminate emissions from transportation”—the second-largest source of carbon emissions—“is to replace individual gas-powered vehicles with individual electric vehicles.” So Riofrancos began working with the Climate & Community Institute to study the subject herself. Together, they posited different worlds—denser cities, less sprawl, a reimagined transportation sector in which many more commuters used mass transit or rode bikes—and learned that such scenarios require significantly less lithium, as much as 92 percent less by 2050. Such findings defy the zero-sum formulations; indeed, Riofrancos argues, a path to zero emissions that depends on electrifying personal vehicles is the slowest path to that goal (albeit one that might not demand larger societal shifts).

She calls for a just transition that not only phases out oil and gas but also can “transform the unequal social system” of the fossil-fuel era. Riofrancos does not detail how to reach this future (charting such a course would be beyond the scope of her project). And she acknowledges that some amount of mining will remain necessary, even as she advocates for a society that demands less extraction overall. But one can envision what some of those changes—challenging as they might be to implement—might look like: denser, public construction to reduce energy demand; direct government funding of electrification; a transition to community control over utilities and industries.

Riofrancos is clear that the solution, in her eyes, cannot just be “governing mining better.” In making such a demand, she echoes the philosopher Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, who calls for reparations—but not as a onetime money transfer. Instead, he seeks an approach to the climate crisis that can “reshape” the global order, not simply “manage its consequences.” Critical minerals are important if the future is to be a livable one, but their costs are very real. In Extraction, Riofrancos not only illustrates those costs; she suggests they are, at least to some extent, avoidable.

[TITLE]Trump’s $7.6 Billion Energy Cuts Hit California Grid Upgrade:
[TEXT]
The Trump administration’s plan to cancel billions of dollars for energy projects following the U.S. government shutdown includes an initiative to upgrade electric transmission lines in California.

A consortium that included the California Energy Commission and Southern California Edison was awarded a federal grant of $600 million for the upgrade last year, which was to allow faster access to clean energy. But that project — slated to improve 100 miles of transmission lines — will have its funding cut, according to a list from the Department of Energy.

The California Energy Commission, Southern California Edison, and PG&E Corporation, which is also a partner in the project, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares of Edison International, which operates Southern California Edison, fell as much as 2.3% before the start of regular trading in New York on Thursday.

The department plans to terminate financial awards supporting 223 projects, which is expected to result in savings of

[TITLE]Electric Trucks and Buses: A Challenge and Opportunity for Rural Co-Ops:
[TEXT]
By Dakoury Godo-Solo, Environmental Defense Fund and Lidiya Kassahun and Margarita Parra, Clean Energy Works

Rural electric co-ops face both challenges and opportunities as electric trucks and buses drive new demand. Proactive planning is essential to avoid costly grid upgrades, as well as missed economic and public health benefits.

A new report prepared by Clean Energy Works for EDF makes the case that by acting proactively now, rural co-ops can accommodate (and even attract) medium and heavy-duty EVs while also reducing long-term grid upgrade costs to their members.

Rural electric cooperatives have always thrived when they’ve looked ahead. Nearly a century ago, they brought power to places investor-owned utilities deemed too costly to serve. Today, they stand at another crossroads. Load growth is accelerating across the country, driven by artificial intelligence, new manufacturing, data centers and the electrification of homes and vehicles. Among these, the electrification of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles – delivery vans, school buses and long-haul trucks – presents both a challenge and an enormous opportunity for rural co-ops.

The challenge is straightforward: these vehicles require large amounts of power, often in locations where rural grids were not originally designed for it. A single electric school bus can draw as much electricity as several homes. An electrified truck stop may need a small town’s worth of power. For co-ops already stretched by aging infrastructure and flat revenues, the prospect of unanticipated high-power demand after years of steady or shrinking load can be daunting. Failure to overcome these challenges risks leaving behind rural communities while urban and suburban communities continue electrifying.

But the opportunity is just as clear. For co-op member-owners, truck and bus electrification can increase system utilization and put downward pressure on rates, as they can provide more revenue than a utility’s cost to serve them. Electric trucks and buses also provide enormous benefits to their owners and communities in which they operate. EVs can provide lower fuel and maintenance costs for operators and reduce air pollution in the communities in which they operate. And, through managed charging and vehicle-to-grid services, they can act as flexible loads or even mobile storage – adding new load while mitigating or deferring expensive upgrades and supporting resilient energy systems.

The new report Grid Readiness in Rural Electric Cooperatives for Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicle Electrification makes the case that by acting proactively now, rural co-ops can accommodate (and even attract) these beneficial loads while also reducing long-term grid upgrade costs to their members. Delaying planning until electrified fleets ask for service risks costlier upgrades and missing out on the first-mover advantage of serving this new load. Instead, co-ops can take practical steps now to make the most of electrification trends.

One step is strengthening relationships with capital providers. Co-ops already rely on the U.S. Department of Agriculture, CoBank and the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation for affordable grants and loans for new capital investments. Co-ops should ensure that transportation electrification is factored into grant and loan terms and the associated load forecasting when working with any of these entities. Aligning USDA grant cycles with the co-op’s capital investment timelines can also help avoid cash flow gaps that too often slow down rural projects.

Another step is to leverage available data and analytics. Tools developed by national labs and industry groups can forecast where electric vehicle demand is most likely to emerge – along freight corridors, near industrial hubs or in school districts eager to switch to electric buses. Many co-ops already use IT platforms like NISC or Meridian that could integrate these forecasting models, but don’t leverage these capabilities today. By applying better data, co-ops can target limited resources to the highest-priority sites.

Strategic grid planning and buildout also matters. Overlaying service territories with maps of priority freight corridors and other areas with a high likelihood of EV adoption can identify where the earliest loads will likely appear, allowing the co-op to anticipate future EV deployments and load growth. Building out the grid today for an all-electric future may be prohibitively expensive, but a phased approach – e.g. designing substations with room to upsize transformers as new loads emerge – keeps upfront costs lower while accommodating future growth.

Proactive engagement with fleet owners is similarly valuable. Companies nationwide have made firm commitments to electrify tens of thousands of delivery vehicles. More than 1,500 school districts in 54 states and territories have already deployed or committed to deploying electric school buses. Plans like these from businesses, schools, and government agencies will shape demand in co-op territories, but only if co-ops are part of the conversation early. Meeting with local fleet operators, requesting load letters in advance and coordinating on siting can turn potential surprises into well-managed projects.

Integrating medium- and heavy-duty vehicles into broader distributed energy resource strategies should be the final piece. Rural co-ops are already innovators here, piloting solar, battery storage and inclusive utility investment programs that enable energy upgrades for members. Adding electric trucks and buses into DER planning – particularly as mobile storage or components of microgrids – could help balance intermittent renewables and provide resilience during outages, offering additional community benefits on top of what the grid does today.

These actions are not just technical. They connect directly to the cooperative principles that guide co-ops: democratic control, concern for community and cooperation among cooperatives. Preparing for electric trucks and buses is
