[TITLE]Artificial Intelligence Renders the FDA’s Current Drug Approval Process to be Obsolete – The Health Care Blog:
[TEXT]
By STEVEN ZECOLA

Artificial intelligence (“AI”) has taken root in the field of drug discovery and development and already has shown signs of running past the traditional model of doing research. Congress should take note of these rapid changes and: 1) direct the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to phase down the government’s basic research grant program for non-Ai applicants, 2) require HHS to redirect these monies to fund nascent artificial intelligence applications, and 3) require HHS to revamp the roadmap for drug approvals of AI-driven trials to reflect the new capabilities for drug discovery and development.

Background

There are four distinguishing features of the U.S. healthcare industry.

First, the industry’s costs as a percentage of GNP have increased from 8% in 1980 to 17% today, and are expected to exceed 20% by 2030. The federal government subsidizes roughly one-third of these costs. These subsidies are not sustainable as healthcare costs continue to skyrocket, especially in the face of an overall $37 trillion federal deficit.

Second, the industry is regulated under a system that results in an average of 18 years of basic research and 12 years of clinical research for each drug approval. The clinical cost per newly approved drug now exceeds $2 billion. The economics of drug discovery are so unattractive to investors that the federal government and charitable foundations fund virtually all basic research. The federal government does so to the tune of $44 billion per year. When this cost is spread among the 50 or so drug approvals per year, it adds a cost of roughly $880 million to each drug, bringing the total cost to over $3 billion per drug approval. Worse yet, the process is getting slower and more costly each year. As such, drug discoveries under the current research approach will not be a significant contributor to lowering the overall healthcare costs.

Third, the Trump administration has undercut the federal government’s role in healthcare by firing several thousand employees from HHS. Thus, the agency can no longer effectively administer its previously adopted rules and regulations, and therefore, cannot be expected to shepherd drug discovery into lowering healthcare costs.

Fourth, on the positive side, artificial intelligence software combined with the massive and growing computational capacity of supercomputers have shown the potential to dramatically lower the cost of drug discovery and to radically shorten the timeline to identify effective treatments.

Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Drug Discovery

For the past decade, a handful of companies have been exploring advanced automation techniques to improve the many facets of the drug discovery process. Improvements can now be had in fulfilling regulatory documentation requirements, which today add up to as much as 30% of the cost of compliance. More significantly, Ai can be used to accurately create comprehensive clinical documents from raw data with citations and cross-references – and continually update and validate the documentation.

The top Ai drug discovery companies include Insilico Medicine, Atomwise, and Recursion, which leverage Ai to accelerate various stages of drug development, from target identification to clinical trials. Other notable companies are BenevolentAI, Insitro, Owkin, and Schrödinger, alongside technology providers like Nvidia that supply critical Ai infrastructure for the life sciences sector.

For example, Recursion uses biological experiments combined with machine learning to identify potential treatments faster than traditional methods. Additionally, it has created a platform with data and tools for biopharma and commercial users to utilize for drug discovery and development.

In exploring the various approaches, the real promise of Ai in drug discovery rests with knowledge creation. By enabling the efficient exploration of biological variability, Ai can dramatically increase the number of experiments by studying literally trillions of interactions between variables. This capability is particularly helpful for complex and costly maladies such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism, and for people with multiple chronic diseases. In other words, Ai can process vast amounts of biological data, uncover hidden causal relationships, and generate new actionable insights. The government should be focused on and encourage these capabilities because they hold the potential to improve the health of the nation’s most disadvantaged citizens and significantly cut the costs of providing care.

Healthcare Regulation Must Adapt to the AI Age

The potential for rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in the field of drug discovery requires a new regulatory model. Rather than applying the current regulatory process to the new Ai-driven research, the goal of the federal government should be to develop a regulatory process that accelerates effective cost-reducing combinations of multi-variable treatments.

For example, rather than discrete Phase I, II and III trials, all clinical work utilizing Ai should be collapsed into one elongated trial, given that Ai can be used to continually update and validate documentation. As participants are added to the trial, safety results can be examined and reported in real time. Once the trial surpasses a certain number such as 1000 participants with proven efficacy and meeting the specified safety protocols, it would be approved for roll-out. The role of the government in such an approach would be as auditor to validate the output of the trial. This function would include experimental validation, mechanistic understanding, and ethical oversight.

Summary

The healthcare industry has been failing the U.S. populace for many years with high costs and poor performance outcomes. The existing drug discovery process has offered relatively minor improvements to this equation.

On the other hand, the emerging AI discovery and development models are posed to beat traditional basic research projects to market by years – and at a fraction of the costs. To achieve the full potential of the new technology, an entirely new industry model is required. That is, the subsidies for basic research and the regulation of clinical trials using AI for discovery must change.

Any basic research project currently under review is at a distinct disadvantage to an AI-driven research project – and should not be funded. Rather the focus of government funds should be on AI-driven research, particularly those targeting Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, autism, and patients with multiple chronic diseases. These categories contribute to a majority of healthcare expenses in the U.S. and are the least likely to be cured by the traditional approach to research.

Additionally, regulation can leverage the documentation and continuous updating features of AI to collapse clinical trials into one continuous phase that can receive regulatory approval when the pre-set conditions for safety and efficacy are met after a specified number of participants have entered the trial.

MADRID and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oryzon Genomics, S.A. (ISIN Code: ES0167733015, ORY), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and a European leader in epigenetics, today reported financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and provided a corporate update on recent developments.

“We have secured over $60 million in the first half of 2025, marking a significant turnaround for Oryzon,” said Dr. Carlos Buesa, Oryzon’s Chief Executive Officer. “These proceeds enable us to advance our clinical programs with a renewed strategic focus on CNS, particularly in our studies in BPD, schizophrenia, and ASD.”

“Following the FDA’s feedback, the Company has strengthened its clinical, strategic, and regulatory teams by incorporating highly experienced professionals with deep expertise in late-stage clinical development and FDA-EMA interactions,” continued Dr. Buesa. “As part of our strategic plan to become a CNS-focused company and to further strengthen our balance sheet, we are exploring potential partnerships for our promising oncology-hematology asset iadademstat. We continue to enhance its value through ongoing collaborations and the generation of new clinical evidence under our CRADA agreement with the NCI, which requires only a minimal financial commitment from the Company.”

“The impressive data in first-line AML from the triple combination of venetoclax, azacitidine, and iadademstat — showing no dose-limiting toxicities and a 100% overall response rate — clearly illustrates the success of this strategy,” Dr. Buesa added. “We expect that additional promising results in MDS and other studies will continue to demonstrate the clinical relevance of iadademstat across different hematologic malignancies. We believe that the data to be presented at ASH, together with forthcoming results in SCD, will further support our efforts to identify the right partner to ensure that this drug ultimately reaches patients.”

Third Quarter and Recent Highlights

Vafidemstat:

Following submission of the clinical trial protocol for the PORTICO-2 Phase III trial with vafidemstat in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for approval in June, the Company received written feedback from the FDA in October. The FDA’s guidance covers different elements such as the selection of study endpoints and certain non-clinical considerations. Oryzon will incorporate these insights and resubmit the revised Phase III protocol.

As part of our strategic preparations to advance our late-stage pipeline and to enhance dialogue with the FDA and EMA, the Company has strengthened its clinical, strategic, and regulatory teams by incorporating highly experienced professionals as Senior Advisors: Dr. Iman Barilero, who brings extensive CNS experience from her nine-year tenure as Global Head of Regulatory Affairs at Lundbeck and will be acting as a Chief Regulatory Officer; Dr. Christopher Breder, MD PhD, a veteran drug developer who also spent several years of his career as a Medical Officer at the FDA; and Dr. Raymond Sanchez, former CMO of Cerevel Therapeutics. The Company plans to incorporate additional experts to further reinforce its development capabilities.

These appointments follow the recent incorporation of distinguished clinical and academic experts into our Clinical Advisory Board (CAB), including Dr. Alan Schatzberg (Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University from 1991 to 2010 and current Director of the Stanford Mood Disorders Center), Dr. Eric Hollander (Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Program), Dr. Emil Coccaro (Professor of Psychiatry at The Ohio State University College of Medicine and former Chair of Psychiatry & Behavioral Neuroscience at The University of Chicago (2004-2016)), and Dr. Sarah Fineberg (Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University).

Oryzon is preparing a new Phase II trial to evaluate vafidemstat for the treatment of aggression in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This trial, named HOPE-2, plans to include, inter alia, genetically-defined ASD subpopulations, such as individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), and will initially be conducted in Spain as part of the activities supported by the recently granted Med4Cure IPCEI EU initiative. In parallel with its clinical development efforts in ASD and PMS, Oryzon is collaborating as a sponsor of the first-ever PMS Burden of Illness study, led by CureShank, a research advocacy organization founded by families of individuals affected by PMS. This study, recently launched, aims to characterize the direct and indirect burden of PMS to patients, caregivers, and the US healthcare system.

The EVOLUTION Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating vafidemstat in patients with schizophrenia continues to enroll participants. This study aims to assess the efficacy of vafidemstat, with a primary focus on improving negative symptoms. As secondary endpoints, the trial will evaluate vafidemstat’s efficacy in improving cognitive impairment and positive symptoms in schizophrenia. Initially conducted only in Spain, the trial is now being expanded to additional EU countries.

Oryzon has continued to strengthen its patent portfolio for vafidemstat during this quarter, with an additional “Decision to grant” communication from the European patent office. The allowed claims cover the use of vafidemstat for the treatment of aggressiveness and social withdrawal associated with CNS diseases, including claims specifically aimed at the treatment of aggressiveness associated with BPD, ASD, Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions, as well as claims directed to treating social withdrawal associated with diseases such as schizophrenia or ASD. Once formally granted, this patent will remain in force until at least 2038, not including any potential patent term extension. Additional patents in this family have already been granted or allowed in Europe, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Russia, with applications pending in other countries.

Iadademstat:

The iadademstat triplet combination with venetoclax and azacitidine achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 100% (n=8) in a Phase I dose finding clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study, which continues active patient enrollment, has been accepted for presentation at the upcoming American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting (December 6–9, 2025, Orlando, Florida, USA). As reported in the ASH abstract, 88% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 12.5% achieved morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). After a median follow-up of nine months, the estimated six-month overall survival (OS) rate was 88%, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. This investigator-initiated study (IIS) is led by the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Knight Cancer Institute.

A second study in the same clinical setting, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and conducted under our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the NCI, continues to actively recruit patients and is expected to provide additional data to further substantiate the promising early results in first line AML.

The iadademstat combination with gilteritinib achieved a 67% overall response rate (8/12 patients) and a 58% complete response rate (CR + CRh + CRi; 7/12 patients) among the 12 evaluable patients treated at the dose currently under expansion in the open-label, multicenter Phase Ib FRIDA clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML harboring a FLT3 mutation (FLT3mut+). The activity observed at this dose was superior to both historical and real-world data reported for gilteritinib monotherapy. Three patients have proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The study, which continues to enroll patients, has been accepted for presentation at ASH-2025. The study is being conducted in the United States and will enroll up to approximately 45 patients. As reported in the ASH abstract, 34 patients had been enrolled at the data cut-off for abstract submission, with four dose level cohorts evaluated in the escalation phase. The combination was tolerable at the tested doses, and the study has progressed to the expansion phase at one selected pharmacologically active dose. Updated data will be presented at the congress.

A new randomized Phase II study of iadademstat in combination with ASTX727 (oral decitabine + cedazuridine) in patients with accelerated/blast phase (AP/BP) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), sponsored by the NCI under the CRADA with Oryzon, has recently started to enroll patients. The study has a dose escalation phase to identify the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of iadademstat + ASTX727, followed by a randomized phase which will investigate the efficacy of iadademstat + ASTX727 compared to ASTX727 monotherapy. A Trial-in-progress (TIP) abstract has been accepted for presentation at ASH-2025.

Enrollment has continued in the IIS Phase I dose-finding trial of iadademstat in combination with azacitidine in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), led by the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), and in the Phase I/II trial of iadademstat plus immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have initially received standard of care chemotherapy and immunotherapy, conducted and sponsored by the NCI under the CRADA with Oryzon.

Beyond oncology, Oryzon has expanded clinical evaluation of iadademstat into non-malignant hematological disorders, with a first trial in sickle cell disease (SCD). This multicenter, open-label Phase Ib trial, named RESTORE (REgulation of Sickling ThrOugh Reprogramming Epigenetics), will evaluate the safety and tolerability of iadademstat in adult patients with SCD, and determine its Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate iadademstat’s effect on inducing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression. Increases in HbF have already been recognized by the FDA as a clinically meaningful endpoint for the treatment of SCD. The trial, recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has started to enroll patients. The study is conducted across several sites in Spain and aims to enroll approximately 40 adult patients.

A new trial, which will evaluate iadademstat in essential thrombocythemia (ET), is currently in preparation, with Clinical Trial Application (CTA, the EU equivalent to an IND) submission to EMA planned for Q425.

Oryzon has strengthened its patent portfolio for iadademstat during this quarter, with “Decision to grant” communications from the European and Australian Patent Offices for patent applications entitled “Combinations of iadademstat for cancer therapy”. The allowed claims protect the use of iadademstat in combination with PD1 or PD-L1 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Once formally granted, the patents will remain in force until at least 2040, excluding potential patent term extensions. A corresponding patent has already been granted in Russia, with applications pending in the United States, Japan, China, and other territories.

Earlier stage programs:

ORY-4001, Oryzon’s highly selective histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor nominated as a clinical candidate for the treatment of certain neurological diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and others, continues to progress through IND enabling studies to prepare it for clinical studies.

Financial Update: Third quarter 2025 Financial Results

Research and development (R&D) expenses were $3.9 million and $9.6 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $1.9 and $7.1 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Key Market Drivers

Rising Prevalence of Autoimmune Diseases

The rising prevalence of autoimmune diseases represents a significant healthcare challenge worldwide. Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis, occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. As these conditions become more prevalent, there is a growing need for effective treatments, and this has led to an increase in the demand for immunosuppressants API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients). For instance, according to the Alzheimer's Association, over 6 million people in the U.S. were affected by Alzheimer's disease in 2023, making it the sixth leading cause of death, primarily impacting those aged 65 and older.

This number is projected to reach 12.7 million by 2050, significantly increasing the demand for drugs and microbial APIs related to Alzheimer's and similar neurodegenerative conditions, driving growth in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing. Healthcare awareness and diagnostics improve, more individuals are being correctly diagnosed with autoimmune diseases, leading to an increased demand for treatment options. Secondly, as life expectancy increases, the aging population is more susceptible to autoimmune conditions, further fueling the need for immunosuppressant medications. Thirdly, ongoing research and development efforts are leading to the discovery of newer and more targeted immunosuppressant drugs, which, in turn, are stimulating market growth.

The rising prevalence of autoimmune diseases is expected to drive significant growth in the immunosuppressants API market. This growth is not only beneficial for pharmaceutical companies but also for the countless individuals suffering from autoimmune disorders, as it promises better access to innovative and effective treatments that can help them manage their conditions and lead healthier lives.

Key Market Challenges

High Costs Associated With API

The high costs associated with Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in the immunosuppressants market pose a significant challenge to the growth of this sector. The complex and labor-intensive processes involved in manufacturing immunosuppressant APIs, along with the stringent quality control requirements and regulatory compliance, contribute to the elevated costs of production. The research and development phase for immunosuppressant drugs demands substantial investments in terms of time and resources. Identifying and synthesizing effective compounds, conducting preclinical and clinical trials, and meeting regulatory requirements can lead to substantial expenses. These costs are often passed on to consumers and healthcare systems, which can result in limited access to these vital medications, especially in lower-income regions.

The manufacturing of immunosuppressant apis requires specialized facilities, equipment, and highly skilled personnel to ensure product consistency and quality. Maintaining these facilities and adhering to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards further escalates production costs. These expenditures, again, contribute to the high price tags of immunosuppressant drugs, making them less affordable for many patients.

The ongoing research to develop more targeted and efficient immunosuppressants often involves the exploration of cutting-edge technologies and innovative drug delivery systems. While these advancements can lead to improved therapeutic outcomes, they can also add to the overall cost burden of drug production.

The high costs associated with immunosuppressant apis have the potential to impede their growth and accessibility.

[TITLE]Tenaya Therapeutics Presents Promising Interim Clinical Data from MYPEAK™-1 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial of TN-201 Gene Therapy for the Treatment of MYBPC3-Associated Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy:
[TEXT]
MyPEAK-1 Data Presented During Late-Breaking Session at AHA Scientific Sessions 2025 with Simultaneous Publication in Cardiovascular Research

TN-201 Has Been Generally Well Tolerated at Both Doses

Longer-term Follow Up of Cohort 1 Patients Showed Consistent, Deeper, and Durable Improvement in Measures of Hypertrophy

Initial Cohort 2 Data Demonstrated Early Dose Responsive Increases in TN-201 Transduction and MyBP-C Protein Expression

Tenaya Management to Host Webcast Call for Analysts and Investors on Monday, November 10 at 8:00 a.m. EST

NEW ORLEANS and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tenaya Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNYA) announced that new interim safety and efficacy data from the company’s MyPEAK™-1 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of TN-201 were presented today during the Late-Breaking Science: Main Event session at the American Heart Association’s (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2025 by Milind Desai, M.D., MBA, director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center at Cleveland Clinic and vice chair of Cleveland Clinic’s Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute. These data, which included longer-term follow-up results for three patients dosed with TN-201 gene therapy at a dose of 3E13vg/kg (Cohort 1) and initial results for three patients who received TN-201 at a dose of 6E13 vg/kg (Cohort 2) were simultaneously published in Cardiovascular Research.

TN-201 is being developed for the potential treatment of MYBPC3-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition caused by insufficient levels of myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). Single administration of TN-201 gene therapy was generally well-tolerated at both the 3E13 vg/kg and 6E13 vg/kg dose levels and immunogenicity was well managed through monitoring and individualized tapering of immunosuppressives. TN-201 achieved robust transduction and durable expression with early dose-dependent increase in both transduction and MyBP-C protein expression. Among Cohort 1 patients for whom there was greater than one year of follow up, decreases in circulating biomarkers and reductions in measures of left ventricular hypertrophy deepened over time.

“These initial results are promising for a patient population that too often live with difficult, even dangerous, symptoms,” said Dr. Desai, an investigator for the MyPeak-1 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial. “In the past decade, we've made great progress in understanding and treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and as our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of HCM increases, research into gene therapies such as TN-201 offer the opportunity to further advance and improve patient care.”

“Results of TN-201 treatment are in line with our expectations for this stage of trial, with a manageable safety profile and dose-dependent MyBP-C protein level increases over time. In particular, the durable changes in multiple parameters of disease – biomarkers, hypertrophy and heart failure symptoms – all moving with directional consistency toward normalization after a single dose are an encouraging early signal of TN-201’s activity,” said Whit Tingley, M.D., Ph.D., Tenaya’s Chief Medical Officer. “We look forward to building on these data with continued long-term follow-up of Cohort 1 and the maturation of early results for Cohort 2, which will inform our plans for TN-201’s late-stage development.”

Interim results from the MyPEAK-1 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial

Data reported today includes safety, biopsy and leading indicators of efficacy for the three patients enrolled in Cohort 1 with follow-up ranging from Week 52-78, and safety for the three patients in Cohort 2, Week 12 biopsy for Patient 6 and Week 26 assessments for Patient 4 as of the July 2025 data cut off. Patient 5 was lost to further follow-up after week 12. All patients other than Patient 5 have completed every visit and remain on study.

All patients enrolled in MyPEAK-1 had serious burden of disease at baseline. All six had objectively severe nonobstructive HCM with levels of hypertrophy significantly above average for people with HCM All six were at sufficiently high risk of sudden cardiac death to warrant an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) device All experienced mild-to-moderate symptoms of heart failure that interfered in activities of daily living (New York Heart Association, or NYHA, Class II-III) Four of the six have previously undergone surgical myectomy

Safety data for all six patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 showed that TN-201 was generally well tolerated at both the 3E13 vg/kg and 6E13 vg/kg doses. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and all patients have tapered off immunosuppressive medicines.

Reversible, asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations (Grade 1-3) were the most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reported There were no signs of cardiotoxicities, including no declines in left ventricular ejection fraction, clinical myocarditis or ventricular arrhythmias There were two treatment-related AEs classified as serious due to inpatient treatment or monitoring: a Cohort 1 patient with Grade 2 transaminase elevation that responded to steroids and a Cohort 2 patient with Grade 1 elevation of complement factors that resolved without additional intervention Adjustments to monitoring and immunosuppression during Cohort 1 resulted in faster tapers and lower cumulative corticosteroid doses in Cohort 2, despite the higher TN-201 dose

MyBP-C protein levels increased over time, with early evidence of a substantial increase commensurate with higher dose in Cohort 2. TN-201 DNA transduction and TN-201 mRNA expression following similar dose response.

Tenaya reported that TN-201 transduction and TN-201 mRNA expression were robust. All three patients in Cohort 1 demonstrated sustained presence of TN-201 DNA in the heart and mRNA expression that increased over time, supporting the observed increases in MyBP-C level changes. In Cohort 1 patients, protein levels increased by an average of 4% from the first biopsy taken to Week 52. In Patient 3, the first patient for whom baseline biopsies were available, MyBP-C protein was shown to increase by 5% at Week 52. The first evaluable patient in Cohort 2 (Patient 6) demonstrated a clear dose response, and early MyBP-C expression increased by 14% after only 12 weeks post-dose. Of note, Patient 6 had a greater than 2-fold increase in transduction and expression at Week 12 relative to the averages for these measures observed across Cohort 1.

Multiple parameters, including biomarkers, hypertrophy, heart failure symptoms, associated with increased risks of complications or reduced survival, have improved among a majority of patients with greater than 26 weeks of follow-up. Cardiac Troponin I levels declined significantly (48%-74%) to normal or near-normal levels in all Cohort 1 patients. Cardiac troponin I is a predictive risk factor of cardiac AEs such as ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and progression to end-stage heart failure. ( 1 ) NT-proBNP, a biomarker of cardiac muscle strain, improved or remained stable in two of three Cohort 1 patients Cardiac Troponin I remained within the normal range and NT-proBNP remained stable for Patient 4 from Cohort 2 at their 26-Week assessment All three patients in Cohort 1 now have evidence of significant improvement in one or more measures of hypertrophy at Week 52, including notable reductions in left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) of between 21% and 39%. LVPWT for Patient 4 in Cohort 2 was stable at Week 26. Greater LVPWT is an independent risk factor for reduced long-term survival after septal myectomy. (2 ) Two out of three Cohort 1 patients saw reductions in overall left ventricular mass index (LVMI) of between 12% and 22% at Week 52. LVMI for Patient 4 in Cohort 2 was stable at Week 26 NYHA classification, a measure of the impact of heart failure symptoms on activities of daily living, improved in all patients by at least one class by Week 26, and all Cohort 1 patients are now NYHA Class I (asymptomatic).

While the interim results from MyPEAK-1 are promising, longer-term follow-up for all patients is required to further inform Tenaya’s understanding of TN-201’s potential as a treatment for MYBPC3-associated HCM. Tenaya plans to periodically report additional results from longer-term follow-up. These interim data were presented during the “Forgotten No More: The Current Belle of the Ball? Breakthrough Evolutions in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy” Late-Breaking Science: Main Event session during AHA 2025 and were published simultaneously in an article titled “First-in-human study of AAV9:MYBPC3 gene replacement therapy (TN-201) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Initial safety, pharmacodynamic, and imaging results from MyPEAK-1” in Cardiovascular Research.

[TITLE]Jade Biosciences Presents New Data Demonstrating a Favorable Preclinical Safety Profile of JADE101 and a Translational Analysis of APRIL Mediated Biomarker Responses at the American Society of Nephrol:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jade Biosciences, Inc. (“the Company” or “Jade”), (Nasdaq: JBIO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing best-in-class therapies for autoimmune diseases, today presented two posters for JADE101, its investigational anti-A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025.

JADE101 is designed to selectively inhibit APRIL, a key driver of pathogenic IgA production in IgAN, a progressive autoimmune disease that frequently leads to end-stage kidney disease over a patient’s lifetime. Jade has engineered JADE101 with properties intended to capture the full efficacy of APRIL pathway inhibition while enabling patient-friendly subcutaneous dosing, supported by a differentiated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile demonstrated in non-human primates (NHPs). JADE101 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial, with interim data expected in the first half of 2026 that is anticipated to define the dose and dose interval for future studies in IgAN patients.

“We believe the selective anti-APRIL class will represent the foundational therapeutic approach for treatment of IgAN, and JADE101 has been specifically engineered to deliver the full potential of this mechanism,” said Andrew King, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and Head of R&D at Jade Biosciences. “These new preclinical data in NHPs demonstrate that JADE101 is highly selective, is well tolerated at toxicological doses, and is not broadly immunosuppressive. Additionally, our translational modeling builds further confidence that biomarker responses observed in healthy volunteers are expected to translate into meaningful outcomes for patients with IgAN. Interim biomarker data from our ongoing Phase 1 healthy volunteer study are anticipated to define the dose and dosing interval selection for JADE101, with the goal of supporting rapid advancement into IgAN patient trials with a potentially best-in-class therapy.”

Nonclinical Safety Profile of JADE101 (Poster #SA-PO0255)

New preclinical safety data highlight JADE101’s favorable safety profile and support its potential as a selective, disease-modifying treatment with low risk of toxicity:

JADE101 was well tolerated in NHPs at all doses tested preclinically, including the highest dose evaluated in GLP toxicology studies, which was established as the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). These results provide wide safety margins that support the first-in-human doses being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial.

Across studies, JADE101 showed no off-target binding in a panel of more than 6,000 human proteins, no human tissue cross-reactivity, and no cytokine release in human whole blood assays.

In NHPs, JADE101 treatment resulted in reversible reductions in serum immunoglobulins consistent with its mechanism of action, including IgA and IgM reductions of approximately 55–68% and 62–75%, respectively, and a more modest IgG reduction of 35–48%, all of which returned toward baseline following JADE101 clearance.

Despite reductions in circulating immunoglobulins, JADE101-treated NHPs generated antibody responses to a test immunization (KLH) that were comparable to untreated controls, consistent with the preserved vaccination response observed in healthy volunteers following administration of a previous anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody.

JADE101 administration in NHPs did not impact serum concentrations of BAFF or inflammatory cytokines, resulted in no histological changes in tissues, and had no effect on circulating immune cell populations, including B, T, or NK cells - supporting its potential as a well-tolerated treatment, devoid of broad immune suppression.

Translational Modeling of Biomarker Responses to APRIL Inhibition (Poster #SA-PO0272)

A second presentation described a translational assessment of the consistency of biomarker responses to APRIL inhibition across NHPs, healthy volunteers and IgAN patients, and the associations between these biomarkers and clinical responses in IgAN. Biomarker responses to JADE101 in the ongoing healthy volunteer study are anticipated to define dose and dose interval selection for future clinical trials in IgAN patients:

Analyses demonstrated that in vitro APRIL binding affinity is predictive of in vivo IgA-lowering potency across NHP and human data sets, supporting that high APRIL binding affinity results in potent IgA reduction in vivo in NHPs and humans.

Clinical observations from healthy volunteers further demonstrate that high APRIL binding affinity is a key determinant of the magnitude and duration of free APRIL and IgA reduction at a given anti-APRIL dose level.

Pharmacokinetic and free APRIL suppression profiles of anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies were consistent between healthy volunteers and patients with IgAN, supporting the use of healthy volunteer PK and biomarker results for dose selection in IgAN patients.

Trial level analyses indicate the kinetics and magnitude of IgA reduction is highly consistent between healthy volunteers and IgAN patients (r = 0.93), and that the reduction of Gd-IgA1 measured in IgAN patients is highly consistent with the reductions in total IgA (r = 0.96). Furthermore, the early IgA reduction observed in IgAN patients is predictive of subsequent proteinuria reduction (r = 0.89).

The largest reductions in proteinuria and the highest rates of clinical remission (proteinuria < 0.3 g/day) in IgAN patients were observed with the highest levels of APRIL suppression.

These analyses suggest that pharmacokinetic and biomarker responses observed in healthy volunteers are informative of anticipated therapeutic responses in IgAN patients. The analysis also highlights that the depth and duration of APRIL suppression can be linked to anticipated reductions in total IgA, Gd-IgA1, and proteinuria that are ultimately associated with preserving kidney function and delivering disease-modifying clinical outcomes for patients with IgAN. Based on JADE101’s differentiated NHP pharmacokinetic profile, the Company anticipates the potential for convenient, infrequent, subcutaneous dosing.

Pipeline Highlights

UCART Clinical Programs

BALLI-01 study evaluating lasme-cel (UCART22)

Clinical data from the Phase 1 BALLI-01 study with lasme-cel for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL), were presented at the Cellectis’ R&D Day that took place on October 16, 2025. The presented data position lasme-cel as a potentially game-changing therapy for patients with r/r B-ALL.

In the Phase 1 of BALLI-01 study, 40 transplant ineligible third line or beyond (3L+) patients were dosed with lasme-cel: 18 patients (n=18) were dosed with product manufactured by an external CDMO (Process 1, or P1) and 22 patients (n=22) were dosed with Cellectis-manufactured product (Process 2, or P2).

Highlights include:

Efficacy: lasme-cel demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 68% with Process 2 product (n=22), and an ORR of 83% at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D; n=12) and 100% in the target Phase 2 population (n=9)

Safety: in Phase 1 (n=40), lasme-cel was generally well tolerated; there was one case of grade 2 immune effector cell–associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS), which resolved.

Durability: among patients who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), median overall survival was 14.8 months.

Depth of response in target Phase 2 population: the CR/CRi rate was 56%, with approximately 80% of these patients achieving MRD-negative status.

Transplant eligibility in target Phase 2 population: all patients (100%) became eligible for transplant, and 78% proceeded to transplantation.

The survival curve for this study suggests a clear benefit: patients who proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after lasme-cel therapy showed a trend to longer overall survival than those who did not undergo transplant.

The Phase 1 data showed that lasme-cel maintained its efficacy regardless of the number or type of prior lines of treatments, including CAR-T (60% of subjects), transplant (50% of patients), and blinatumomab (80% of subjects).

Following successful End-of-Phase 1 meetings with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Cellectis provided a registration path for lasme-cel in r/r ALL. The first interim analysis for the Phase 2 of the BALLI-01 trial is expected in Q4 2026. Cellectis anticipates submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in 2028.

Commercial Opportunity for Lasme-cel

As part of the R&D Day presentation, the Company discussed the potential commercial opportunity for lasme-cel in r/r B-ALL.

If approved for commercialization, Cellectis estimates that lasme-cel could achieve up to approximately $700 million in potential peak gross sales across the U.S., EU4 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain) and UK in 2035, corresponding to an estimation of
