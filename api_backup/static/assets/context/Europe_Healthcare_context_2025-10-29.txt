[TITLE]Novo-backed MapLight valued at $787 million after shares jump in Nasdaq debut:
[TEXT]
By Arasu Kannagi Basil

(Reuters) -MapLight Therapeutics debuted on the Nasdaq on Monday with a valuation of $787 million, becoming the first company to go public under a rarely used regulatory provision since the start of the U.S. government shutdown.

Shares of the Redwood City, California-based company, which is developing treatments for central nervous system disorders, opened at $19 apiece, nearly 12% above the initial public offering price of $17.

With the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission closed due to the government shutdown, more than half a dozen companies have tapped a provision that allows registration statements to automatically become effective 20 days after filing, rather than wait for the regulator's approval.

MapLight, backed by Novo Nordisk's controlling shareholder Novo Holdings, raised $250.8 million in the IPO by selling 14.75 million shares. Affiliates of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs bought 476,707 shares of MapLight in a concurrent private placement.

The company's lead experimental drug candidate, ML-007C-MA, is currently being developed in mid-stage studies to treat schizophrenia, and hallucinations and delusions caused by the Alzheimer's disease.

Biotech IPOs are also making a nascent comeback after a months-long dry spell. The sector has been grappling with regulatory uncertainty and poor returns, side-lining many would-be issuers.

LB Pharmaceuticals, which debuted last month, was the first U.S. biotech to raise more than $50 million in an IPO since February. Drug developer Evommune is expected to go public next month.

"The biotech IPO market is slowly thawing but it remains constrained by the many 2021-2023 debuts that are still trading below their offer price," said IPOX Research Associate Lukas Muehlbauer.

"This challenging environment makes it especially difficult for early-clinical stage firms to convince investors, who are demanding proof-of-concept with later-stage data."

Optimism around further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve has also boosted sentiment, with the S&P Biotech ETF gaining more than 20% this year.

Key Factors Driving the Growth of the Gastroparesis Market

Rising Gastroparesis Prevalence

According to DelveInsight analysis, the United States accounted for approximately 715K cases of gastroparesis in 2024. These cases are anticipated to increase by 2034. This upward trend is driven by the rising prevalence of diabetes, the leading underlying cause, improved diagnostic tools enabling more accurate detection, and greater clinical awareness leading to higher diagnosis rates

GIMOTI’s Role in Optimizing Healthcare Efficiency

GIMOTI is the only approved drug demonstrated to reduce hospitalizations, emergency room visits, medical office visits, and associated healthcare costs compared to oral metoclopramide, providing a clear clinical and economic advantage.

Clinical Promise of Naronapride

Naronapride uniquely integrates 5-HT4 receptor agonist with D2 receptor antagonism within a single molecule. Given its promising clinical profile and the growing unmet need in gastrointestinal disorders, there is a compelling opportunity for Renexxion Ireland and Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH to expand its research into dual-targeted therapeutic approaches.

Novel Gastroparesis Competitive Landscape

Companies like Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Tradipitant), Neurogastrx (NG101), CinDome Pharma (Deudomperidone), Renexxion Ireland (Naronapride), Processa Pharmaceuticals and Intact Therapeutics (PCS12852), and others are investigating their key products for gastroparesis.

Emergence of Novel Drug Classes

The pipeline of novel therapeutic candidates targeting diverse mechanisms such as NK-1R antagonists (Tradipitant), 5-HT4 receptor agonists (PCS12852), D2 receptor antagonists (NG101), dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonists (CIN-102), and others demonstrates strong innovation and commitment to addressing unmet needs in gastroparesis treatment.

Gastroparesis Market Analysis

Managing gastroparesis remains challenging, focusing primarily on symptom relief and improving gastric motility rather than providing a definitive cure. Initial strategies often involve lifestyle modifications, including dietary adjustments, glycemic control, and adequate hydration, but these measures generally yield only modest benefits for most patients. Pharmacologic treatments form the cornerstone of therapy: prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin are used to promote gastric emptying, while antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, phenothiazines) and neuromodulators (tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, delta ligands) help manage nausea, vomiting, and related symptoms.

GIMOTI, a nasal form of metoclopramide, offers a non-oral option for those with persistent symptoms despite oral therapy. Nevertheless, many patients continue to experience inadequate symptom control. In severe, treatment-resistant cases, advanced interventions like gastric electrical stimulation or G-POEM may be considered, though both are invasive, expensive, and supported by limited evidence. Overall, existing treatments reveal significant unmet needs, emphasizing the necessity for safer, more effective, and accessible therapeutic options for gastroparesis.

The therapeutic landscape for gastroparesis is gradually evolving as new candidates progress through development. Companies including Vanda Pharmaceuticals (tradipitant), CinDome Pharma (deudomperidone), Processa Pharmaceuticals (PCS12852), Renexxion Ireland, Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH (Naronapride), Neurogastrx (NG101), and others are actively investigating treatments aimed at improving symptom management and overall disease control across the 7MM.

[TITLE]Neuphoria Therapeutics Adopts Limited-Duration Stockholder Rights Plan to Protect Integrity of Process:
[TEXT]
BURLINGTON, Mass., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neuphoria Therapeutics Inc. (“Neuphoria” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: NEUP), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing impactful treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders, today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) has determined to adopt a limited-duration stockholder rights plan (the “Rights Plan”), effective immediately. The Board adopted the Rights Plan in response to significant and rapid accumulations of the Company’s publicly traded common stock by certain investors.

The Rights Plan is intended to protect the interests of the Company and its stockholders, help ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to participate fairly in any strategic review process and to provide the Board time to make informed decisions. The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Neuphoria through open-market accumulation without paying all stockholders an appropriate control premium.

It is important to note that the Rights Plan does not preclude the Board from engaging with parties or considering proposals or other strategic alternatives that it believes recognize the full value of the Company and are in the best interests of Neuphoria and all stockholders.

The Rights Plan, which is similar to other plans adopted by publicly held companies, does not contain any dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the ability of the Board to redeem the rights.

In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock as of the close of business on October 27, 2025, the record date. Under the Rights Plan, the rights will become exercisable if an entity, person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Neuphoria’s outstanding common stock in a transaction not approved by the Board.

In the event that the rights become exercisable due to the ownership threshold being crossed after the date hereof, each right will entitle its holder (other than the person, entity or group triggering the Rights Plan, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) to purchase additional shares of common stock having a then-current market value of twice the exercise price of the rights. Any stockholders with beneficial ownership of the Company’s outstanding common stock at or above the applicable threshold prior to this announcement are grandfathered at their current ownership levels but are not permitted to increase their ownership without triggering the Rights Plan. In addition, the Rights Plan has customary flip-over and exchange features.

Subject to the terms of the Rights Plan, the rights will expire on October 27, 2026, unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by Neuphoria. Additional information regarding the Rights Plan will be contained in a Form 8-K to be filed by Neuphoria with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

[TITLE]Zenas BioPharma Announces Positive Results from Phase 2 MoonStone Trial of Obexelimab in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis:
[TEXT]
- Obexelimab met primary endpoint with a 95% relative reduction in new gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing T1 lesions compared with placebo, p=0.0009 -

WALTHAM, Mass., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zenas BioPharma, Inc. (“Zenas,” “Zenas BioPharma” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ZBIO), a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company committed to being a leader in the development and commercialization of transformative therapies for patients living with autoimmune diseases, today announced positive results from the Phase 2 MoonStone trial of obexelimab in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). Obexelimab met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a highly statistically significant 95% relative reduction in the cumulative number of new gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing (GdE) T1 hyperintense lesions over week 8 and week 12 compared with placebo (p=0.0009).

“These profound MoonStone trial results, including the near elimination of new GdE T1 lesions, provide strong evidence of the deep and sustained inhibitory mechanism of obexelimab and further validate the potential for obexelimab to become a meaningful therapy across multiple autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, which are currently being evaluated by Zenas in Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials,” said Lonnie Moulder, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Zenas.

Near-complete suppression of new GdE T1 hyperintense lesions, which are markers of active inflammation, was observed with obexelimab by 8 weeks of treatment and was sustained through week 12. The adjusted mean number of new GdE T1 hyperintense lesions per scan in the obexelimab group was 0.01 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.06) compared to 0.23 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.51) with placebo. Additionally, over weeks 8 and 12 of treatment, obexelimab significantly reduced the cumulative number of new and/or enlarging T2 weighted hyperintense lesions compared to placebo, which represent the amount of disease burden or chronic lesion load. The safety profile of obexelimab was consistent with that observed in prior completed trials, including cases of infections and hypersensitivity, most commonly mild injection site reactions.

“The observed clinical activity in the MoonStone trial, combined with obexelimab’s unique inhibitory mechanism of action, subcutaneous self-administration and tolerability profile, position obexelimab as a potential option to broadly address the pathogenic role of B cells in autoimmune diseases,” said Lisa von Moltke, M.D., Head of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer of Zenas. “With these highly statistically significant data, we look forward to reporting 24-week data in the first quarter of 2026, which will include additional secondary and exploratory endpoints that may inform obexelimab’s potential impact on disability progression and help us determine next steps for future development of obexelimab in relapsing MS.”

Zenas also expects to report topline results from the obexelimab Phase 3 INDIGO trial in IgG4-RD around year-end 2025 and topline results from the Phase 2 SunStone trial in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), mid-2026, as well as the 24-week MoonStone trial results in the first quarter of 2026. In addition, orelabrutinib, a potentially best-in-class, highly-selective central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant, oral, small molecule Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor, which Zenas recently in-licensed from InnoCare Pharma Limited, is now being studied in a global Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS). Zenas also expects to initiate a global Phase 3 trial of orelabrutinib in patients with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) in the first quarter of 2026.

[TITLE]Health Canada Grants Authorization for “LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that Health Canada has issued a Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) for humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody “LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) for the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (early AD) who are apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4*) non-carriers or heterozygotes and who have confirmed amyloid pathology. LEQEMBI is the first treatment for early AD that targets an underlying cause of the disease, to be authorized in Canada.

LEQEMBI selectively binds to soluble Aβ aggregates (protofibrils**), as well as insoluble Aβ aggregates (fibrils) which are a major component of Aβ plaques, thereby reducing both Aβ protofibrils and Aβ plaques in the brain. LEQEMBI is the first approved treatment shown to reduce the rate of disease progression and to slow cognitive and functional decline in adults with AD. LEQEMBI is also approved in 51 countries and regions including Japan,1 the United States,2 Europe,3 China,4 South Korea,5 Taiwan,6 and SaudiArabia,7 and applications have been filed in 9 countries.

The approval of LEQEMBI is based on the large global Phase 3 Clarity AD study. In the Clarity AD study, LEQEMBI met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results.8,9 LEQEMBI has been issued market authorization with conditions, pending the results of trials to verify its clinical benefit. Eisai plans to submit clinical assessment data captured from participants in real-world clinical practice.

AD is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80% of all cases.10 As of January 1, 2025, it is estimated there are more than 771,000 patients with dementia in Canada, which is expected to increase to approximately 1 million in 2030 and over 1.7 million in 2050.11 In addition, annual care provided by family and friends for those with dementia is equivalent to 290,000 full-time jobs, which is expected to increase to 690,000 full-time jobs in 2050.11

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with both Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. In Canada, Eisai Limited will distribute the product and conduct information provision activities. Eisai and Biogen are committed to working together with healthcare professionals and other stakeholders towards the early treatment of AD.

* Apolipoprotein E is a protein involved in the metabolism of lipid in humans. It is implicated in AD. People with only one (heterozygous) or no copy (non-carriers) of the ApoE ε4 gene are less likely to experience ARIA than people with two ApoE ε4 copies (homozygous).12

** Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.13 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.14
