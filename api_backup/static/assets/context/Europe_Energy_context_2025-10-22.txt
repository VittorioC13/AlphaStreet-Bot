[TITLE]Full ban on Russian gas imports on the table at EU Energy Ministers’ meeting:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 20 08:26

The European Union’s initiative to fully ban the import of gas and oil from Russia, as part of its sanctions over the war in Ukraine, is expected to move to the next stage today, as the bloc’s 27 Energy Ministers are set to adopt the measure.

Meeting in Luxembourg, the ministers aim to forge a common position on the total ban before the decision is finalized in negotiations with the European Parliament.

Members of the European Parliament already voted in favor of the proposal last week, paving the way for talks with the member state capitals.

According to the plan, imports of oil, pipeline natural gas, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be entirely and permanently prohibited by 2028 at the latest.

The ban, once agreed upon in talks with the European Parliament, will be adopted by simple majority vote — meaning countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, which still import Russian gas through pipelines, will not be able to veto it.

It is not ruled out that the measure could be implemented sooner, as efforts are underway to impose a ban on Russian gas imports under the upcoming package of sanctions against Moscow.

As of 2024, Russia still accounted for roughly one-fifth of all gas imports into the EU, with an even higher share in natural gas specifically. In the first half of 2025, EU member states imported Russian gas worth nearly €4.5 billion.

The sanctions can be formally adopted once all 27 member states agree — without the involvement of the European Parliament — allowing the process to move faster.

The punitive measures are described as temporary and can be lifted once the war in Ukraine ends and Brussels no longer sees any justification for maintaining them.

At the same time, the EU’s Foreign Ministers, also meeting today in Luxembourg, will discuss developments in the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is expected to join part of their session.

The Council will also discuss a proposal to use frozen Russian assets to finance a loan aimed at providing war reparations to Ukraine, as well as the EU’s 19th package of sanctions against Russia.

The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip will also be on the agenda. Although the EU has so far been sidelined in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, European officials emphasize that the Union intends to play an active role in efforts to restore stability in the Middle East.

[TITLE]US ready to tariff China over Russian oil buys, but Europe must follow, Bessent says:
[TEXT]
The United States is ready to impose tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil, but Washington's European allies must be willing to take part in such action, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a news conference on Wednesday.

"It is the purchase of Russian oil by China that fuels the Russian war machines. China buys 60%, six zero percent, of Russian energy. They buy 90 per cent of Iranian energy," he said.

The U.S. would produce photographs supplied by the Ukrainian government that showed Chinese parts were used in Russian drones operating in Ukraine, Bessent said through a spokesperson.

[TITLE]China’s Battery Giants Flood Overseas Markets As Exports Surge 220%:
[TEXT]
Last year, China's battery industry average utilization rate cratered to just a third of maximum capacity amid severe overcapacity following years of massive investment and expansion. This put smaller manufacturers under severe pressure and fueled further industry consolidation, while also forcing producers to increasingly seek overseas markets. Luckily, these efforts appear to be paying off: China Energy Storage Alliance has reported that Chinese battery storage forms secured ~200 overseas orders totalling 186 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the first half of this year, good for a more than 220% year-over-year surge. Not surprisingly, just 5.34 GWh– less than 3% of the total--came from the United States amid hefty tariffs by the Trump administration compared to nearly 60% that came from the Middle East, Europe and Australia.

Back in April, the Trump administration imposed duties of up to 3,521% on solar imports from Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand, with the finalized tariffs applying to shipments from China’s solar heavyweights, including JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) and Trina Solar. Further, Chinese firms are increasingly diversifying their production bases in a bid to mitigate growing tariff risks from Washington. Currently, Chinese solar manufacturers have installed ~80% of overseas capacity including solar wafers, solar cells and modules in Southeast Asia.

“The industry used to say that you either go overseas or exit the game,” said Gao Jifan, chairman of Trina Solar. “Now, due to tariffs, simply exporting isn’t enough; you must also localise production abroad.”

China’s battery storage sector is also benefiting from a rebound by the local markets thanks to policy support by Beijing. China’s National Energy Administration recently unveiled a plan to mobilize 250 billion yuan (~$32 billion) in new investment to build 180 gigawatts of new energy storage capacity by 2027. Lately, Chinese companies that operate in the energy storage space have been posting robust growth as fundamentals continue to improve. During the first half of 2025, 47 of 55 listed companies in the Chinese energy storage sector were profitable. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (OTCMKTS:CATL), one of the largest li-ion battery manufacturers in the world, reported H1 2025 operating revenue of RMB178.886 billion ($25.15 billion), good for a 7.3% increase year over year while net profit attributable to shareholders clocked in at RMB30.485 billion, up 33.33%. In its interim report, CATL revealed that sustained rapid growth in demand for energy storage cells driven by the global clean energy transition has been driving its impressive performance.

That said, battery storage expansion is expected to be a global trend: energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie has projected that global investment in battery storage will reach approximately $1.2 trillion by 2034. This investment will be needed to support the installation of over 5,900 GW of new wind and solar capacity during that period. The report emphasizes that advanced, grid-forming battery technology is crucial for maintaining grid stability as renewable energy sources become more prevalent.

U.S. Battery Storage Explodes

For years, battery systems have only played a marginal role in U.S. electricity networks, with power utilities focusing more on building out capacity from natural gas plants and renewable energy sources. According to energy data portal Cleanview, five years ago, the United States had 74 times more wind farm capacity and 30 times more solar capacity than battery capacity within its power generation system.

However, steady cost declines coupled with rising energy density levels have encouraged utilities to ramp up their battery installations, with battery storage output now exceeding other power sources in certain power markets. And, it’s boom time for the U.S. utility-scale battery storage market: currently, there are only around 5 times more solar and wind capacity in the country compared to battery capacity, thanks in large part to a 40% decline in battery prices since 2022. Currently, 19 states have installed 100 MW or more of utility-scale battery storage. According to Cleanview, there are just under 30,000 megawatts (MW) of utility battery capacity across the U.S., good for a massive 15-fold increase since 2020. For some context, the U.S. solar sector has added 84,200 MW over the timeframe, while the wind sector has increased its capacity by just 7,000 MW. Falling costs is the biggest reason for the surge in U.S. battery deployments: according to financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility-scale solar farms paired with batteries ranges from $50-$131 per megawatt hour (MWh). This makes the pair competitive with new natural gas peaking plants (LCOE of $47 to $170 per MWh) and even new coal-fired plants with LCOE of $114 per MWh.

According to Lazard's 2025 LCOE+ report, new-build renewable energy power plants are the most competitive form of power generation on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies). This is highly significant in the current era of unprecedented power demand growth in large part due to the AI boom and clean energy manufacturing. Renewables also stand out as the quickest-to-deploy generation resource, with the solar plus battery combination often boasting far shorter deployment times compared to constructing new natural gas power plants. California is, by far, the national leader in utility-scale battery storage, accounting for ~13,000 MW or about 42% of the national total. According to the California Energy Commission, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has installed ~21,000 MW of solar capacity and ~12,400 MW of battery capacity, allowing the state to rely heavily on batteries during peak demand periods.

[TITLE]EU Strikes Deal to Ban Russian Gas by End-2027:
[TEXT]
European Union energy ministers agreed a joint position on plans to ban all gas supplies from Russia by the end of 2027.

European Union energy ministers agreed a joint position on plans to ban all gas supplies from Russia by the end of 2027, as the bloc looks to definitively end its reliance on energy from Moscow.

A qualified majority of officials meeting in Luxembourg Monday supported the ban, which starts by prohibiting Russian supplies under existing short-term contracts by mid-June, with an exemption for landlocked countries such as Hungary and Slovakia. A prohibition on long-term deals follows 18 months later. Hungary and Slovakia did not support the ban.

The deal on Monday was a procedural step on the RePowerEU regulation, which aims to permanently end Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Negotiations with the European Parliament, which is calling for a faster exit from Russian gas and a halting of oil imports from the start of next year, can now start. The aim is to reach a final deal before the end of the year.

The EU is pursuing a two-pronged strategy to finally end its addiction to Russian fossil fuels after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022. The second strand involves a separate proposal to impose sanctions on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas from the start of 2027. It requires unanimity and is still being discussed.

Europe has been under pressure from the US to speed up moves to sever its energy ties with Moscow, and buy more American LNG. A joint statement on EU-US trade pledged $750 billion in energy deals between the two over the next three years.

The EU receives about 15% of its LNG supplies from Moscow, making Russia the second-largest provider of the fuel to Europe after the US, with the monthly bill for those imports ranging between €500 million ($584 million) and €700 million.

“This is not just for the present conflict,” Dan Jorgensen, the EU’s energy commissioner, said at the start of the meeting on Monday. “It’s for the future. Never again should we make this mistake.”

Spain said before the meeting it would back the RepowerEU deal, even though it had previously had reservations over whether the rules would be strong enough to break contracts with Russia.

“We understand that it’s legally robust,” said Joan Groizard, Spain’s secretary of state for energy. “We’ve learned that external dependence from any single country is not a good idea.”

Ministers are also discussing the energy situation in Ukraine and the EU’s electrification plans.

[TITLE]Rare Earth Boom: Defense Heavyweight Joins Critical Mineral Effort:
[TEXT]
The escalating geopolitical competition over critical mineral supply chains has driven a major corporate maneuver, as REalloys Inc., a company focused on establishing a North American mine-to-magnet rare earth pipeline, announced it has appointed Stephen S. duMont, president of GM Defense, as its non-executive chairman of the board of directors.

The move links one of North America’s leading defense industry figures directly to the effort to secure the materials essential for advanced military and green energy technologies. REalloys, which is in the process of merging with Blackboxstocks Inc. (NASDAQ: BLBX) is seeking to build a supply chain free of dependency on Chinese processing capacity, a strategic goal increasingly prioritized by Washington and Ottawa.

Tying Industrial Capacity to National Security

Mr. duMont brings three decades of experience in defense, aerospace, and national security, including senior executive roles at Raytheon Technologies, BAE Systems, and Boeing, in addition to his distinguished service as a U.S. Army attack helicopter pilot. His appointment signals a clear intent by REalloys to align its commercial growth directly with allied defense modernization efforts.

The company is focused on the vertical integration of rare earth elements, which are vital components in high-performance magnets used across the defense industrial base—from precision-guided missiles to radar systems—as well as in commercial products like electric vehicle motors and wind turbines. The announcement follows REalloys' recent commitment of a 10-year, 6.75 million ton offtake agreement with Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML) and a strategic supply commitment with St George Mining Limited (ASX: SGQ).

“REalloys stands at the heart of an effort critical to freedom, prosperity, and autonomy across the Western world,” said Stephen S. duMont, non-executive chairman of REalloys. He noted that the company is actively "driving a coordinated effort under Title 50 authorities, to ensure allied defense modernization, and broader U.S.–Canadian defense alignment to reinforce the supply chains that underpin both national and economic security."

The North American Imperative

The global critical minerals market remains overwhelmingly dominated by China, which processes the vast majority of rare earth elements into usable metal and magnet forms. This concentration has spurred the United States and Canada to invest heavily in creating resilient, Western-aligned alternatives.

REalloys is promoting a framework defined by its “no Chinese nexus” supply chain, aiming to keep processing, separation, refining, and magnet manufacturing entirely within North America or allied nations. This continental strategy is intended to be synergistic with major U.S.-Canadian initiatives, including NORAD modernization and the deepening of defense-industrial integration through cooperative agreements.

REalloys CEO Lipi Sternheim, the company’s founder and former executive chairman, stated that Mr. duMont’s defense background provides a unique perspective.

“His depth of experience with global defense systems and government relations will strengthen our ability to advance North America’s security and industrial resilience,” Sternheim said, adding that Mr. duMont’s guidance would help position REalloys “as a bridge between national defense priorities and the manufacturing capacity that underpins them.”

The new chairman joins an already robust board that includes former Canadian Ambassador to the United States David MacNaughton and former Premier of Saskatchewan Brad Wall, further cementing the company’s focus on policy, diplomacy, and industrial competitiveness within the U.S.-Canadian economic framework.

Executive Transition

In conjunction with the appointment, REalloys announced a change in its executive suite, with David Argyle resigning as Chief Executive Officer and director. Founder Lipi Sternheim stepped into the CEO role, a transition the company attributes to its goal of rapidly scaling its vertically integrated operation to meet the demand for secure rare earth magnet capacity.

The strategic leadership changes underscore the high-stakes environment in which critical mineral companies now operate, where corporate growth is increasingly inseparable from national security objectives. The confluence of defense leadership and industrial supply chain efforts reflects the West's broader push for self-reliance in the materials that power both its economy and its military capabilities.

Other companies to keep an eye on in the critical mineral race

General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) is one of the world’s largest automakers and a pivotal force in America’s industrial base, bridging the commercial and defense sectors through cutting-edge mobility innovation. The company’s role in the energy transition is underscored by its massive investment in electric vehicles, battery technology, and domestic manufacturing. Through its Ultium battery platform, GM has built a vertically integrated EV supply chain spanning battery cells, modules, and packs — and has partnered with key material suppliers such as MP Materials and Lithium Americas to secure critical mineral inputs within North America.

Beyond its consumer operations, GM Defense, a wholly owned subsidiary, has become a cornerstone of the company’s diversification strategy. It designs and delivers advanced, electrified, and autonomous defense and government mobility solutions for the U.S. military and allied partners. Recent projects include the Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) based on Chevrolet’s Colorado ZR2 platform, and the development of electric tactical vehicles using Ultium battery technology — efforts that directly align with the Pentagon’s modernization and energy resilience goals.

This dual commercial-defense strategy positions GM as far more than a traditional automaker. By combining industrial scale, advanced manufacturing, and proprietary energy technologies, GM is re-establishing the United States as a global leader in both clean transportation and next-generation defense mobility. The company’s ability to merge innovation across its automotive and defense divisions makes it a strategic asset in the broader context of national security, supply chain resilience, and technological sovereignty.

MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP) is the operator of the Mountain Pass mine in California, the only rare earth mining and processing facility of scale in North America. The company is primarily focused on producing neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr), which is essential for manufacturing the high-strength permanent magnets that power electric vehicle traction motors, wind turbines, and robotics. Its operation at Mountain Pass, one of the world's richest rare earth deposits, represents a crucial step in re-establishing a domestic supply chain for these strategic elements, a capability that had been largely lost to foreign competitors over the past few decades.

The company's existence is a key strategic advantage for the U.S. and its allies, as rare earth elements are non-substitutable in many high-tech and military applications. By localizing the production of raw materials, MP Materials addresses a significant point of vulnerability in the Western manufacturing base, providing a secure alternative to offshore supply. This effort is seen as vital for the ongoing energy transition and for maintaining technological superiority in the global arena.

MP Materials is aggressively moving toward full vertical integration by advancing its Stage III plan to manufacture finished magnets in the United States. It has begun NdPr metal production at its new facility in Fort Worth, Texas, which is a major step toward creating a complete mine-to-magnet supply chain. Furthermore, the company has secured high-profile commercial agreements, including a long-term supply contract with General Motors for its electric vehicle magnets, cementing its role as a fundamental supplier to America's industrial future.

Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) is the world's largest producer of lithium, a material foundational to the lithium-ion batteries that power nearly all modern electric transportation and energy storage systems. The company operates a globally diversified portfolio that includes hard rock mines in Australia, brine operations in Chile, and the Silver Peak brine operation in Nevada—the only active lithium-producing resource in the U.S.

The global transition away from fossil fuels places Albemarle in a uniquely significant position, as the energy storage industry cannot meet its goals without a massive and reliable supply of lithium. By controlling a substantial portion of the world’s output and possessing advanced processing capabilities, the company is a primary enabler of the electric vehicle revolution.

The company is significantly investing in expanding its operational footprint across its global segments to keep pace with soaring demand. In North Carolina, Albemarle is working to reopen its historic Kings Mountain hard rock mine, and it is also expanding its conversion capacities in the U.S. and abroad. These investments are driven by a strategy to increase resource diversity and production volumes, signaling a clear commitment to maintaining its leadership role as a foundational supplier to the Western battery supply chain for the foreseeable future.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) is a major international mining company with world-class assets primarily focused on the production of copper, gold, and molybdenum. While it is often viewed through the lens of traditional mining, its massive copper output is what places it squarely in the critical minerals discussion. Copper is arguably the most essential metal for electrification, vital for every part of the energy transition, from electrical wiring and transmission lines to wind turbines and electric vehicle components.

The company's importance stems from copper's unmatched electrical conductivity and the sheer volume of the metal required to support a modern, electrified economy. Every electric vehicle uses approximately four times more copper than a conventional car, and the buildout of renewable energy infrastructure requires vast quantities of the metal.

Freeport-McMoRan is focusing its capital and operational efforts on maximizing output from its significant, long-lived copper operations, such as the Grasberg complex in Indonesia and its assets in the Americas. The company is particularly focused on expanding its underground mining operations to access deeper, high-grade ore, ensuring a long-term supply pipeline.

BHP Group (NYSE: BHP) is a globally diversified resource company with a portfolio that spans iron ore, coal, and petroleum, but its strategic focus has increasingly shifted toward "future-facing commodities" like copper and nickel. The company's massive operational scale and access to long-life assets make it a critical player in securing the raw materials for a lower-carbon future.

The sheer size and stability of BHP's operations provide a necessary bulwark against the supply volatility inherent in smaller, riskier projects. Its established presence in key mining jurisdictions, particularly Chile and Australia, helps ensure that the massive amounts of copper and nickel needed to support global decarbonization efforts can be brought to market reliably.

In line with its strategic push, the company has been actively seeking out opportunities to expand its copper and nickel footprint. It is a co-owner in the massive Resolution Copper project in Arizona, which, if fully developed, could become a significant source of U.S. copper. BHP is also investing in its Nickel West operations in Australia, with the goal of producing materials suitable for the battery supply chain, cementing its role in powering next-generation technologies.

Rio Tinto Group (NYSE: RIO) is a multinational mining giant that produces a wide range of materials, including aluminum, iron ore, and diamonds, but it is aggressively developing its portfolio of battery and critical minerals.

Rio Tinto holds one of the world's largest undeveloped lithium projects, Jadar, in Serbia, which underscores its potential to significantly influence the global lithium market should it come to fruition. Moreover, the company’s efforts to recover critical minerals like scandium from waste streams at its existing facilities in Canada demonstrate a commitment to innovative, responsible sourcing. This diversification of supply is crucial for reducing the Western world’s reliance on concentrated supply chains.

Beyond its major new lithium project, the company is expanding its copper production, a necessity for global electrification. Rio Tinto is investing $55 million in its Kennecott operations in Utah to start underground mining and significantly expand the production of high-quality copper. In addition, its Resolution Copper joint venture with BHP in Arizona, if approved, has the potential to supply a quarter of the U.S. demand for the metal over a multi-decade span.

Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM) is primarily recognized as the world's leading gold company, but it also produces significant quantities of copper as a byproduct and through dedicated operations. Copper is the core critical mineral in Newmont's portfolio, with its output coming from world-class assets across the Americas and Australia. This exposure ensures the company remains relevant to the broader critical minerals discourse, despite its focus on precious metals.

The copper produced by a major, established miner like Newmont is vital because of the scale and certainty of its supply. In the race to electrify, every ounce of new copper is crucial, and Newmont’s operations provide a stable, long-term source from politically favorable jurisdictions.

The company is leveraging its global presence and technical expertise to maintain and enhance its copper production profile. Newmont has actively acquired and developed operations like the Boddington mine in Australia, which produces both gold and copper, and it continues to invest in projects that will prolong the life and increase the output of its copper assets. Its strategy aims to maximize value from all metals discovered, positioning it to benefit from the soaring demand for both gold and base metals.

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE: LAC) is a pure-play lithium resource developer, centered on its flagship Thacker Pass project in Nevada, which represents one of the largest known lithium resources in the United States. The company's business model is focused on bringing this massive clay-based lithium resource into commercial production to serve the burgeoning North American electric vehicle and battery manufacturing sector.

The strategic significance of Lithium Americas is immense, as the Thacker Pass project is a foundational piece of the U.S. effort to establish a comprehensive domestic electric vehicle supply chain.

[TITLE]China’s Battery Giants Flood Overseas Markets As Exports Surge 220%:
[TEXT]
Last year, China's battery industry average utilization rate cratered to just a third of maximum capacity amid severe overcapacity following years of massive investment and expansion. This put smaller manufacturers under severe pressure and fueled further industry consolidation, while also forcing producers to increasingly seek overseas markets. Luckily, these efforts appear to be paying off: China Energy Storage Alliance has reported that Chinese battery storage forms secured ~200 overseas orders totalling 186 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the first half of this year, good for a more than 220% year-over-year surge. Not surprisingly, just 5.34 GWh– less than 3% of the total--came from the United States amid hefty tariffs by the Trump administration compared to nearly 60% that came from the Middle East, Europe and Australia.

Back in April, the Trump administration imposed duties of up to 3,521% on solar imports from Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand, with the finalized tariffs applying to shipments from China’s solar heavyweights, including JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) and Trina Solar. Further, Chinese firms are increasingly diversifying their production bases in a bid to mitigate growing tariff risks from Washington. Currently, Chinese solar manufacturers have installed ~80% of overseas capacity including solar wafers, solar cells and modules in Southeast Asia.

“The industry used to say that you either go overseas or exit the game,” said Gao Jifan, chairman of Trina Solar. “Now, due to tariffs, simply exporting isn’t enough; you must also localise production abroad.”

China’s battery storage sector is also benefiting from a rebound by the local markets thanks to policy support by Beijing. China’s National Energy Administration recently unveiled a plan to mobilize 250 billion yuan (~$32 billion) in new investment to build 180 gigawatts of new energy storage capacity by 2027. Lately, Chinese companies that operate in the energy storage space have been posting robust growth as fundamentals continue to improve. During the first half of 2025, 47 of 55 listed companies in the Chinese energy storage sector were profitable. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (OTCMKTS:CATL), one of the largest li-ion battery manufacturers in the world, reported H1 2025 operating revenue of RMB178.886 billion ($25.15 billion), good for a 7.3% increase year over year while net profit attributable to shareholders clocked in at RMB30.485 billion, up 33.33%. In its interim report, CATL revealed that sustained rapid growth in demand for energy storage cells driven by the global clean energy transition has been driving its impressive performance.

That said, battery storage expansion is expected to be a global trend: energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie has projected that global investment in battery storage will reach approximately $1.2 trillion by 2034. This investment will be needed to support the installation of over 5,900 GW of new wind and solar capacity during that period. The report emphasizes that advanced, grid-forming battery technology is crucial for maintaining grid stability as renewable energy sources become more prevalent.

U.S. Battery Storage Explodes

For years, battery systems have only played a marginal role in U.S. electricity networks, with power utilities focusing more on building out capacity from natural gas plants and renewable energy sources. According to energy data portal Cleanview, five years ago, the United States had 74 times more wind farm capacity and 30 times more solar capacity than battery capacity within its power generation system.

However, steady cost declines coupled with rising energy density levels have encouraged utilities to ramp up their battery installations, with battery storage output now exceeding other power sources in certain power markets. And, it’s boom time for the U.S. utility-scale battery storage market: currently, there are only around 5 times more solar and wind capacity in the country compared to battery capacity, thanks in large part to a 40% decline in battery prices since 2022. Currently, 19 states have installed 100 MW or more of utility-scale battery storage. According to Cleanview, there are just under 30,000 megawatts (MW) of utility battery capacity across the U.S., good for a massive 15-fold increase since 2020. For some context, the U.S. solar sector has added 84,200 MW over the timeframe, while the wind sector has increased its capacity by just 7,000 MW. Falling costs is the biggest reason for the surge in U.S. battery deployments: according to financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility-scale solar farms paired with batteries ranges from $50-$131 per megawatt hour (MWh). This makes the pair competitive with new natural gas peaking plants (LCOE of $47 to $170 per MWh) and even new coal-fired plants with LCOE of $114 per MWh.

According to Lazard's 2025 LCOE+ report, new-build renewable energy power plants are the most competitive form of power generation on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies). This is highly significant in the current era of unprecedented power demand growth in large part due to the AI boom and clean energy manufacturing. Renewables also stand out as the quickest-to-deploy generation resource, with the solar plus battery combination often boasting far shorter deployment times compared to constructing new natural gas power plants. California is, by far, the national leader in utility-scale battery storage, accounting for ~13,000 MW or about 42% of the national total. According to the California Energy Commission, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has installed ~21,000 MW of solar capacity and ~12,400 MW of battery capacity, allowing the state to rely heavily on batteries during peak demand periods.

[TITLE]Europe’s Aging Grids Buckle Under Renewable Energy Demands:
[TEXT]
The world’s power grids need a major upgrade to keep pace with growing rates of electrification and the ever-increasing energy demands of big data. A cleaner energy landscape means a whole lot more electricity demand, as we switch from gas-powered vehicles and appliances to newer, cleaner models that need to plug into the grid to charge. This means that expanding grid capacity and making our aging grids smarter and more flexible will be essential to maintaining energy security for the future – but grid infrastructure remains woefully neglected, and we’re already starting to see some of the fallout.

“To achieve countries’ national energy and climate goals, the world’s electricity use needs to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one,” states a 2023 report from the International Energy Agency. As a result, grids need to expand at an unprecedented rate. “Reaching national goals also means adding or refurbishing a total of over 80 million kilometres of grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid,” the report goes on to say.

Failure to prioritize investing in grid modernization and expansion poses a major threat to the clean energy transition and to energy security as grids become increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy are variable, meaning that their production levels wax and wane according to factors that have nothing to do with demand trends. Plus, energy production is increasingly dispersed, especially so thanks to the proliferation of residential solar panels. These factors introduce an extra level of complexity for grids that were designed with just a few major utilities in mind, and with only one direction of energy flow.

All of this is already leading to some hiccups for grid stability. In Europe, where renewable expansion and EV adoption have soared, critical grid congestion and catastrophic blackouts have become an increasing issue. At the end of April, cascading grid failures in Spain and Portugal resulted in the worst blackout in European history, and highlighted how woefully insufficient grid investment has been to date. At the time, Eurelectric reported that the “extraordinary event” in Iberia served as “a stark reminder that the grid is the backbone of our society. With electricity playing an increasingly important role in our society, we need to create all the conditions to enable a secure electricity supply.”

Unfortunately, many countries are now facing the consequences of failing to create all of those conditions. In the Netherlands, massive success with clean energy capacity installation and EV adoption without commensurate grid infrastructure expansion has resulted in a new norm of power cuts and energy consumption austerity measures. And it’s going to take a lot of money and time to fix the issue.

"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this," Damien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, recently told the BBC. The problem is causing ripples throughout the Netherlands economy. New housing, for example, is now facing long waiting lists in order to connect to grids that are already operating over maximum capacity.

But the issue is not limited to the Netherlands. Much of Europe has neglected to properly invest in grid infrastructure as a part of national clean energy planning. "We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate," Ernst went on to say.
