[TITLE]ADNOC Wins Another Long-Term LNG Deal with Indian Oil:
[TEXT]
'By 2029, IndianOil is set to become ADNOC's largest LNG customer, with a total offtake of 2.2 MMtpa - comprising 1.2 MMtpa from ADNOC's Das Island operations and one MMtpa from the Ruwais LNG project'.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. PJSC (ADNOC) said Wednesday it had signed an agreement to supply one million metric tons per annum (MMtpa) from the Ruwais LNG project to Indian Oil Corp. Ltd.

Targeted to start production 2028, the facility on the Persian Gulf coast would more than double ADNOC’s LNG output.

“To date, over eight MMtpa of the project’s 9.6 MMtpa production capacity has been committed to international customers through long-term agreements, underscoring strong global demand for ADNOC’s lower-carbon LNG”, ADNOC said in a statement.

The offtake announced Wednesday is in addition to a 14-year contract between the two state-owned companies, announced February, for up to 1.2 MMtpa from the Das Island liquefaction facility. Deliveries are to start 2026 for the volumes from the Das Island facility, which has a capacity of six MMtpa.

The companies did not disclose the value of the new agreement. February’s agreement was valued $7-9 billion.

Under the new agreement, “LNG cargoes can be delivered to any port across India, supporting the country’s growing energy needs and enhancing its energy security”, ADNOC said.

“By 2029, IndianOil is set to become ADNOC’s largest LNG customer, with a total offtake of 2.2 MMtpa - comprising 1.2 MMtpa from ADNOC’s Das Island operations and one MMtpa from the Ruwais LNG project”.

“The SPA [sale and purchase agreement] highlights the success of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement signed between the UAE and India in 2022, which continues to foster deeper bilateral trade and energy cooperation”, ADNOC added.

Last August, ADNOC, through ADNOC Gas PLC, and another Indian state-owned company, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. (HPCL), announced a heads of agreement for the delivery of 500,000 metric tons a year of LNG from Das Island for 10 years to India.

HPCL said it would receive the LNG at the recently commissioned Chhara LNG Terminal in Gujarat “to meet the demand of its refineries, City Gas Distribution Network and for marketing to downstream customers”.

Last year ADNOC inked a 10-year agreement to supply 500,000 metric tons per year of LNG to state-owned GAIL India Ltd.

This year ADNOC has now announced six LNG export agreements. Besides the HPCL agreement and the two Indian Oil agreements, the other agreements are with Japanese companies JERA Co. Inc. and Osaka Gas Co. Ltd. and Germany’s state-owned SEFE Securing Energy for Europe GmbH.

As announced January, the $450-million agreement with JERA lasts three years. The LNG will come from the Das Island facility. The companies did not disclose the volume.

In February ADNOC announced a 15-year agreement with Osaka Gas for up to 800,000 metric tons per year, mostly from Ruwais LNG. “Under the agreement, LNG cargoes will be shipped to the destination ports of Osaka Gas and its Singapore-based subsidiary, Osaka Gas Energy Supply and Trading Pte. Ltd.”, ADNOC said.

In July ADNOC and SEFE announced an agreement for 700,000 metric tons per year of Das Island LNG for three years starting 2025.

SEFE chief commercial officer Frederic Barnaud said in a

China-Afghan oil deal ends amid charges of hostage-taking and contract breach

The recent collapse of a high-profile Chinese oil deal in Afghanistan sheds light on the often opaque relationship between Beijing and the Taliban.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Four years ago this month, the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan and the U.S. withdrew. Chinese investors quickly stepped in as Kabul faced Western sanctions. Their first major investment was in oil fields, but that deal recently fell apart. The Taliban and the Chinese company are trading accusations at each other. As NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports, the saga sheds light on the often opaque relationship between Beijing and the Taliban.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: (Speaking in non-English language).

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: In 2023, Afghanistan's Ariana TV network news showed turbaned officials and hard-hatted engineers turning on oil wells in northern Afghanistan's Amu Darya River Basin. China and Afghanistan signed a 25-year contract to produce oil with China pledging to invest $540 million in the first three years. But after 2.5 years, the deal fell apart, with both sides blaming each other. Two Chinese employees of the joint venture, Afg-Chin Oil and Gas Limited, spoke with NPR. They requested that we not use their names or voices because they feared retribution from the Chinese government and the Taliban. We use voice actors to read their quotes. One employee explained what happened to his colleagues in June.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR #1: (As employee #1, reading) The Taliban forcibly took over our joint venture oil fields and unreasonably drove our Chinese personnel out of the oil field at gunpoint.

KUHN: He says the Taliban detained 12 Chinese employees in Kabul and confiscated their passports. In June, Afghanistan's Ministry of Mines and Petroleum said it was canceling the contract because the Chinese side didn't deliver promised investments or pay royalties on time. The Chinese company disputes this account. Their employee said the Ministry of Mines sent them a private verbal message offering a deal.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR #1: (As employee #1, reading) They told us, you give us a written pledge saying you're voluntarily terminating the contract and we're not forcing you to do it.

KUHN: He says that they also demanded that the Chinese side leave them all their equipment and their Kabul bank account with millions of dollars in it.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR #1: (As employee #1, reading) If you do these three things, I reckon you'll get your passports back quickly.

KUHN: The Ministry of Mines and Petroleum did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. One Afghan source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed that Chinese employees' passports were confiscated, but denies they were detained. He requested that his name and voice not be used because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media.

(SOUNDBITE OF JET FLYING OVERHEAD)

KUHN: After the U.S. withdrawal four years ago, China was the first country to appoint an envoy to Afghanistan. A second Chinese employee said his company did not invest in Afghanistan just for financial gain.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR #2: (As employee #2, reading) We had hoped that we could help them develop, improve citizens' lives and help their interim government to function and be stable. Their stability is good for China and China's Xinjiang region.

KUHN: Xinjiang borders eastern Afghanistan. The second employee says the oil fields created thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue for the Afghan government, but the Taliban was still not satisfied.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ACTOR #2: (As employee #2, reading) Their business mindset does not include win-win outcomes. Like a bandit committing a robbery, they think, if I like it, then it's mine.

KUHN: Last week, the two employees told NPR the Taliban let eight Chinese employees return to China while four remain in Kabul, and it's not clear when they'll be able to leave. This happened as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was visiting Afghanistan. The Chinese embassy in Washington said they were not aware of this case but attach importance to protecting Chinese nationals overseas. Former Afghan diplomat Omar Samad says both countries need to protect their long-term interests in good relations.

OMAR SAMAD: I think that both sides, not just the Afghans, may want to be a bit more sober about this and realize that this one particular deal may jeopardize overall relations if it's not handled properly.

KUHN: Afghanistan says it's open to partnering with other foreign investors to operate the Amu Darya oil fields. But the Chinese employees warned that unless the Taliban treat foreign investors better, they're unlikely to find any new partners.

[TITLE]Alberta eyes Japanese refining investment to boost oil exports, sources say:
[TEXT]
Alberta is considering a financial investment in Japan's refining sector, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters news agency.

It's an attempt to reduce the province's overwhelming dependence on top trade partner the United States for oil exports.

Alberta's government is in early-stage talks with several Japanese crude oil refiners to explore a joint venture in which it could help fund the construction of a coker unit that would enable one or more Japanese companies to process heavy crude produced in Alberta's oilsands, the sources said.

Any deal would be unprecedented for Alberta, which has not previously made energy infrastructure investments in foreign countries. But the province is keen to increase its oil exports since last year's opening of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which increased Canada's capacity to ship oil via the Pacific coast.

A deal with Japan would help bolster oil flows on Trans Mountain — Canada's only east-west oil pipeline — and would also help make the case for a new export pipeline that the Alberta government is lobbying for.

[TITLE]Renewable energy investment in the Kyrgyz Republic:
[TEXT]
the UK is partnering with the Kyrgyz Republic to develop a flexible financial model that will support informed decision-making on sovereign guarantees for renewable energy projects

the project aims to contribute to unlocking foreign direct investment and accelerate the scale-up of solar, wind and small hydropower projects

The United Kingdom and the Kyrgyz Republic have launched a new partnership to strengthen the enabling environment for renewable energy investment. The project was formally introduced at a meeting in Bishkek, attended by the representatives from the Kyrgyz authorities as well as from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO)-funded Green Cities, Infrastructure and Energy Programme (GCIEP).

The project aims to support the Kyrgyz government in developing a flexible financial model that enables risk-informed decision-making on renewable energy investments.

The model will help project future payment obligations and estimate the potential scale of financial guarantees under various renewable energy growth scenarios. Running from July to December 2025, the project will also include training for relevant government officials to ensure effective use of the model and promote ownership and sustainability beyond the project’s duration.

The Kyrgyz Republics’ electricity sector faces growing challenges. The electricity system depends heavily on ageing hydropower plants that are increasingly vulnerable to seasonal variation and climate change. As a result, the country has experienced rising winter electricity deficits, over 20% of its electricity supply was imported in 2024.

To address these issues, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic aims to diversify the generation mix and increase the share of renewable electricity generation to at least 10% by 2027. With significant potential for solar, wind and small hydropower, and the opportunity to export electricity via the CASA-1000 project, the country is well-position to become one of the regional leaders in green energy.

However, investment is constrained by challenges in issuing government guarantees, as the fiscal impact is often difficult to estimate. This project will help relevant government entities to assess the fiscal implications of issuing sovereign guarantees and explore alternative de-risking mechanisms to attract private sector investment into the renewable energy sector.

Mr Nicholas Bowler, British Ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic, said:

The UK’s Centre of Expertise works with countries to accelerate sustainable urban development and resilient infrastructure. This collaboration is a strong example of how UK expertise can support the Kyrgyz Republic in improving the enabling environment and developing a pipeline of investable renewable energy projects.

Background

The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has established a Centre of Expertise for Green Cities, Infrastructure and Energy (GCIE) to coordinate UK leadership in cities and infrastructure and respond to the impacts of climate change and poverty by accelerating the delivery of sustainable cities and resilient infrastructure.

The Centre of Expertise is part of the British Investment Partnerships approach – the UK’s economic and development offer to partner countries. The Green Cities, Infrastructure and Energy Programme (GCIEP) is the main delivery mechanism of the GCIE Centre of Expertise. The programme is managed by a PwC-led Alliance, including Mott MacDonald, Adam Smith International, Engineers Against Poverty and MDY Legal.
