[TITLE]U.S. Shale Turns From Drilling Faster to Recovering More Oil:
[TEXT]
It has been an eventful year for U.S. shale oil and gas. Low prices—at least in oil—a double down on capital discipline, and drilling efficiency gains that pushed the U.S. total to a record high again were the hallmarks of 2025. The next frontier? Recovery rates.

Recovery rates for shale oil wells are much lower than the rates for conventional wells. The average is around and below 10%, compared with 30% to 35% for conventional wells. Given the prominence of shale basins in the United States’ total oil production, it was only a matter of time before recovery rates came into the spotlight. With the Trump administration’s prioritization of energy, the time was right.

Wood Mackenzie recently reported on the administration’s signals to the energy industry that it is time to start paying closer attention to recovery rates and ways of boosting them. The report cited the assistant secretary of energy, Kyle Haustveit, who was appointed head of the new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office at the Department of Energy, as saying the industry should strive to double recovery rates from shale wells.

“Today for oil reservoirs we recover roughly 10% of the oil in place,” Haustveit said at a recent industry event. “We can repeat the shale revolution with the resource we’ve already characterised, the wells we’ve already drilled, through the infrastructure that’s been built.”

Like Energy Secretary Chris Wright, assistant secretary Haustveit is an industry veteran. As Wood Mackenzie points out, Haustveit, formerly with Devon Energy, had been involved in developing drilling optimization techniques, which makes him a perfect choice for the effort to boost recovery rates—an effort, which the industry is already making.

U.S. oil production topped 13.6 million barrels daily earlier this year. The continued growth came despite a decline in the number of active rigs and despite persistently low international oil prices. It also came despite the fact that, as Energy Intelligence noted in a recent industry report, drilling productivity is deteriorating.

The report cited KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts as reporting drilling productivity declines of between 8% in the Midland Basin to as much as 27% in the Eagle Ford. The analysts called the productivity decline “pervasive” and said it was a result of both field maturation, which is a natural process, and of what the report called efficiency tradeoffs. Specifically, the well productivity decline was attributed to the energy industry’s newfound focus on capital discipline and cost cuts, which, per Energy Intelligence, “means fewer opportunities to chase aggressive growth.”

This is where recovery rate improvement comes in. According to the above report, the industry expects that it will be recovery rates that will drive shale oil production growth over the ten years, replacing faster drilling. Wood Mackenzie said that this year has seen a significant increase in interest in boosting recovery rates. The consultancy noted Exxon’s CEO, who set a target for doubling recovery rates back in 2023.

At a recent presentation, the supermajor provided some details on how it was going on about it: with artificial intelligence used for development planning, extra-long laterals, and improved, lightweight proppants. The latter alone has contributed to Exxon’s expectation of higher overall output this year. Chevron is also zeroing in on higher recovery rates, with Wood Mac citing CEO Mike Wirth as saying recently that “the biggest opportunity is to recover more of the molecules that are in the ground.”

Analysts have been warning that U.S. shale production is about to suffer a reversal of fortunes because of its high costs, compared to conventional oil, as benchmark prices remain stuck in a lower-than-optimal range, pressured by a consistent flow of reports of a glut. Last month, Kpler warned that shale oil production in the United States could see a 700,000-bpd drop by the end of 2026 if the U.S. benchmark falls to $50 per barrel and stays there for long enough. Currently, WTI is trading at below $58 per barrel.

However, it doesn’t necessarily have to be all about output growth, as one senior Wood Mac research noted. “When people in the industry or the government talk about doubling recovery, that does not necessarily mean doubling production rates,” Robert Clarke, VP of upstream research at the consultancy, said. “It’s about how you can sustain production at around its current levels for as long as possible, for as low a cost as possible,” Clarke explained.

Recovery rates and their improvement are going to become even more important for the U.S. energy industry in the coming years, according to Wood Mackenzie. The topic may well shape the next phase of the shale industry’s development, as the consultancy argues it will not be a question of whether oil producers want to spend time and money on it. They will be forced to, for lack of any other areas of performance improvement that could deliver the same results.

[TITLE]Gavin Newsom Sticks It To California Ratepayers:
[TEXT]
The Ivanpah concentrated-solar project has been an environmental and economic disaster.

Launched in 2014, the $2.2 billion solar facility located 230 miles northeast of Los Angeles, was designed to produce 392 megawatts of electricity by focusing sunlight on 459-foot-high towers. At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, then-Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz claimed the sprawling project, which covers nearly six square miles of the Mojave Desert, was a “shining example” of America’s leadership in solar energy.

But Ivanpah was a flop. It never generated more than 75% of its planned electricity output. It relies heavily on natural gas to ensure its complex generators operate properly. The juice it produces is absurdly expensive. And it has been a disaster for wildlife. Some 6,000 birds are being killed every year while flying between the mirrors and the towers. The project also required relocating endangered desert tortoises. Even the goofballs at the Sierra Club, an outfit that has never met a solar, wind, or battery project it couldn’t slobber over, have called Ivanpah a “financial boondoggle and environmental disaster.”

In January, Pacific Gas & Electric, California’s largest utility, announced it was terminating power purchase agreements it signed 15 years ago and the plant, which is operated, and partially owned by Houston-based NRG, would be shuttered and dismantled. Those contracts were expected to run through 2039. Ending the contracts, PG&E said, “will save customers money.” But last week, the California Public Utility Commission rejected the proposed shutdown and ordered the plant to stay open. Why? Shelving the project would threaten the state’s efforts to achieve its renewable energy targets. The agency also said that the transmission and distribution infrastructure that ratepayers have already paid for would be “stranded.”

What a load of crap. As one insider told me, the California Independent System Operator recently issued a forecast which showed the state will have to rely even more on imported electricity in the coming years. With the state’s goal of achieving 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045 in jeopardy, this insider told me, the state “can’t afford to let go of any renewables no matter how uneconomic...Important to keep up appearances no matter what it costs.”

[TITLE]Ford to scale back electric vehicle plans, taking $19.5bn hit:

Ford to scale back electric vehicle plans, taking $19.5bn hit

The business case for leaning heavily into EV production, specifically large-sized EV models, has "eroded", Ford said in a statement, "due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes".

Ford said it expects its profits to take a $19.5bn (£14.6bn) hit as a result of the strategic shift, which comes as the Trump administration eases fuel economy rules.

The company will instead invest in producing profitable hybrid and gas-powered vehicles and smaller, more affordable EV models.

Ford is backing away from plans to manufacture large electric vehicles, the US carmaker said on Monday, citing lacklustre demand and recent regulatory changes under US President Donald Trump.

"This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford," Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, said in a statement.

"The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities," Mr Farley added, pointing to trucks, vans, hybrid vehicles and the company's energy storage business.

As part of Ford's changes to its EV plans, the company said it will no longer produce a purely electric version of its popular F-150 pickup truck. The F-150 Lightening will instead be redesigned as a hybrid vehicle, with a gas-powered generator.

Ford also said it will cancel its new electric van to focus on manufacturing gas and hybrid models.

The carmaker's decision to alter its EV plans follows a similar announcement from General Motors in October. General Motors said it would take a $1.6bn hit as it rolls back its EV ambitions amid weakening demand.

EV adoption in the US has lagged behind the industry in places such as China, the UK and Europe. Analysts point to comparatively weak government support for the sector.

The Trump administration has taken steps in recent months to roll back incentives and regulations that had been expected to lead to increased take-up of electric cars.

A government subsidy previously helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,608) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles. But that tax credit ended in September.

Carmakers had expected EV momentum to slow with the end of the tax credit. At the time, Mr Farley said the EV industry would be "smaller, way smaller than we thought".

And earlier this month, Trump announced plans to loosen fuel economy rules, reversing another Biden-era policy that had raised hopes of an EV boom. The Biden administration's standards were expected to prevent more than 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

Farley celebrated the loosened rules alongside other car industry leaders. He called the change a "victory of common sense", through environmental groups criticised it as a step backward for the industry and public health.

The new fuel economy standards, he added, were "aligned with customer demand".

The US changes come as the European Union is expected to water down its plan to effectively ban new combustion engine cars from 2035.

Germany has lobbied on behalf of its car manufacturers for changes to the plan, arguing they were facing stiff competition from rivals in China.

The European Commission it set to make an announcement on the scheme on Tuesday.

[TITLE]Trump plans envision major U.S. investment in Russia, restoring oil flows to Europe, WSJ says:
[TEXT]
MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

[TITLE]How green hydrogen could power industries from steel-making to farming:
[TEXT]
Many industries are eyeing up hydrogen as a source of clean energy, but with supplies of green hydrogen limited, we should prioritise the areas where it could have the most positive impact on carbon emissions, say researchers

Green hydrogen has many possible uses Bernat Armangue/Associated Press/Alamy

Hydrogen, the most abundant element, gives off energy when combined with oxygen, and the only by-product is water. That is why politicians have touted it as the Swiss Army Knife of climate change, able to power a huge array of vehicles and industrial processes that currently run on fossil fuels.

However, 99 per cent of the hydrogen supply today is “grey” hydrogen, produced by breaking down methane or coal gas, a process that releases carbon dioxide. To reach net-zero emissions, many countries plan to rely instead on “blue” hydrogen, where this CO2 would be captured at the smokestack and injected underground, or “green” hydrogen, which is produced by splitting water with renewable electricity.

Green hydrogen is “an important bet that Western countries should be doing” to compete with China on clean technologies, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said at a conference on 3 December.

The problem is that low-carbon hydrogen is at least twice as expensive as grey hydrogen. Ramping up production so it gets cheaper will require government subsidies. While places like the European Union are supporting the industry, President Donald Trump has begun to cancel the low-carbon hydrogen hubs planned under a $7 billion programme in the US.

Because of these headwinds, analyst firm BloombergNEF has halved its low-carbon hydrogen production forecast to just 5.5 million tonnes by 2030, roughly 5 per cent of current grey hydrogen consumption. With supply limited, governments and companies should focus only on those clean hydrogen uses that make the most sense for the climate and the economy, experts say.

[TITLE]Uniper Approves Its First Scottish Solar Project:
[TEXT]
The German power and gas utility expects to achieve generation at the 45-MW Berryhill Solar Farm just north of Dundee next year.

Uniper SE said it has decided to proceed constructing its first solar project in Scotland, the 45-megawatt (MW) Berryhill Solar Farm just north of Dundee.

The German power and gas utility expects to start construction "early 2026" and fire up the facility later in the year.

Berryhill's output, from about 150,000 solar panels, would be enough "to power the equivalent of over 12,500 UK households each year, 1/5th the population of Angus - contributing to the UK’s net zero targets", Uniper said in an online statement.

"The project has been developed jointly with partner Solar2 and Uniper plans to start the construction process as its sole owner", Uniper said.

Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, the district network operator, is responsible for installing the nine-kilometer (5.59 miles) medium-voltage cable to connect the solar farm to the grid's point of connection at the Charleston substation on the Kingsway in Dundee, according to Uniper.

The project had obtained planning permission from the Angus Council in 2022, which was modified 2024, it said.

"Once operational, there will be a community benefit fund associated with the project which will be agreed with the applicable local community council - Muirhead, Birkhill and Liff Council", Uniper said.

[TITLE]Utility watchdogs accuse PGE of skirting new law meant to make data centers pay for rising demand:
[TEXT]
QTS Data Centers in Hillsboro on Oct. 11, 2024. Despite data centers driving overall system demand growth for Portland General Electric, the company does not plan to directly assign new costs associated with meeting that demand to the data centers.

The company doesn’t plan to simply assign the costs of energy investments needed to support data centers, to data centers, but to focus on all drivers of “peak demand”

Oregon’s largest electrical utility is proposing to make residential customers pay at least part of the long-term cost of supplying large data centers, despite a new law requiring it to charge the centers’ developers, not other customers.

This summer, Oregon became one of just a few states to pass a law requiring data centers to foot the costs of growing energy and transmission infrastructure that’s needed to power them.

The POWER Act mandated Oregon’s three monopoly electric utilities create a separate rate class for data centers to ensure residential customers and other medium and industrial customers weren’t subsidizing the new costs associated with the data centers’ anomalous growth.

But months after the law passed, a plan to comply with the new law from Oregon’s largest electric utility — Portland General Electric — reveals the company could be trying to find a work-around that would only directly charge data centers for the first three years of costs associated with a typical 50-year infrastructure investment.

Residential customers and other customers would help pay for the rest over the remaining 47 years.

Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens’ Utility Board, said PGE’s plan invokes a “twisted logic” to try and skirt the new law. The utilities’ watchdog group was established by Oregon voters in 1984 to represent the interests of the state’s consumers who are captive to the monopoly utilities.

PGE Spokesperson Drew Hanson says it will ensure all customers “pay their fair share of system costs.”

The three-member Oregon Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a decision on PGE’s plan at the end of April.

Data centers drive overall growth

Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville that require enormous amounts of energy to operate.

Between 2013 and 2023, Oregon’s overall electricity consumption rose by more than 20%, the analysis found, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

“Data centers undoubtedly drove a major share, if not almost all, of this growth,” analysts wrote.

PGE serves 930,000 customers, and absorbed the most data center load growth of any private utility in the state during the last decade, according to that analysis.

The company also raised residential rates 50% during the last five years in part to pay for system upgrades and growth.

As a customer class, residential users’ demand on PGE’s system has grown by
