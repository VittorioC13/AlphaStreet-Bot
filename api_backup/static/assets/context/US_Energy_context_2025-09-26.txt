[TITLE]Lithium Booming as U.S. Government Seeks to Negotiate an Equity Stake in U.S. Biggest Lithium Mine:
[TEXT]
PALM BEACH, Fla., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - Lithium is a critical mineral needed to produce batteries, which are vital for America's national security and economic resilience. The current EV battery supply chain has a global footprint, with battery minerals traveling an average of 50,000 miles from extraction to battery cell production. The U.S. currently produces less than 1% of the global supply of lithium. An over reliance on foreign critical minerals could jeopardize U.S. defense capabilities, infrastructure development and technological innovation. Lithium Americas has previously closed a $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program for financing the construction of the processing facilities at Thacker Pass. According to Reuters, Washington is seeking an equity stake of as much as 10% in Lithium Americas as it renegotiates terms of the company's $2.26 billion Energy Department loan for its Thacker Pass lithium project with General Motors, two people familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The proposed stake is the latest example of the Trump administration intervening directly in the American economy as it has in taking stakes in Intel MP Materials and other U.S. tech and minerals firms to promote industries it sees as critical to national security. The project has long been touted by both Republicans and Democrats as a key way to boost U.S. critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world's largest lithium processor. Active Companies in the mining industry this week include US Critical Metals Corp. (OTCQB: USCMF) (CSE: USCM), Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE: LAC) (TSX: LAC), Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), Standard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE American SLI) (TSXV: SLI), Sigma Lithium Corporation (NASDAQ: SGML).

The loan has a 24-year term, with interest rates based on the U.S. Treasury rate as each tranche is drawn. The first draw on the loan was slated to be made earlier this month but Washington officials sought to renegotiate terms amid concerns

[TITLE]An oil and gas giant signed a $1 billion deal with Commonwealth Fusion Systems:
[TEXT]
The agreement will see Eni purchase electricity from Commonwealth’s first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. The facility is still in the planning stages but is scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.

The news comes a few weeks after Commonwealth announced a $863 million funding round, bringing its total funding raised to date to nearly $3 billion. The fusion company also announced earlier this year that Google would be its first commercial power customer for the Virginia plant.

Commonwealth, a spinout from MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is widely considered one of the leading companies in fusion power. Investment in the company represents nearly one-third of the total global investment in private fusion companies. (MIT Technology Review is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)

Eni has invested in Commonwealth since 2018 and participated in the latest fundraising round. The vast majority of the company’s business is in oil and gas, but in recent years it’s made investments in technologies like biofuels and renewables.

“A company like us—we cannot stay and wait for things to happen,” says Lorenzo Fiorillo, Eni’s director of technology, research and development, and digital.

One open question is what, exactly, Eni plans to do with this electricity. When asked

[TITLE]Chevron Strikes Deal With Israel To Build Natural Gas Supply Pipeline To Egypt:
[TEXT]
Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has signed a deal with Israel Natural Gas Lines, Israel’s state-owned pipeline operator, to begin construction of the Nitzana natural gas pipeline that will transport natural gas from the giant Leviathan Gas Field to Egypt. Scheduled to be completed in three years, the $610 million pipeline is expected to ease Egypt’s ongoing energy crisis, which currently spends billions of dollars every year importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet surging domestic energy demand. The Nitzana pipeline will transport ~600 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, bringing Israel's total export capacity to Egypt to more than 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. Israel’s NewMed is the largest shareholder in Leviathan, with a 45.3% working interest; Chevron is the operator with a 39.7% working interest, while Ratio Energies. (TASE: RATI) has 15%. Founded in 1992, Ratio Energy is one of Israel's leading energy partnerships, with a mission to develop and produce natural gas and oil.

Egypt's natural gas production has declined rapidly over the years due to the natural depletion of mature fields, including the Zohr gas field. Coupled with a lack of significant new discoveries since 2015, surging domestic demand for electricity, and past financial issues such as hard currency shortages and payment arrears to foreign companies, Egypt now finds itself in a tenuous position, becoming a net gas importer since 2022, and relying on imported Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as well as pipeline gas from Israel. Last year, Egypt imported a record 981 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Israel, good for 18.2% year-over-year increase. Egypt imports up to 20% of its gas from Israel. Last month, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced that the $35-billion gas supply agreement signed with Israel’s NewMed Energy was extended until 2040. But the fate of these gas flows now hangs in the balance, with tensions in the Middle East escalating after the Israeli military ordered residents of Gaza City to evacuate.

Last month, Netanyahu declared that he is "deeply committed to the vision of Greater Israel,’’ encompassing parts of Arab countries stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile. According to Israel Hayom, Netanyahu has instructed officials "not to move forward with the massive gas deal with Egypt without his personal approval.”

On its part, Chevron is now moving on three major geopolitical fronts at once: finalizing terms for the Nitzana pipeline to ship Israeli gas into Egypt, bidding for offshore blocks near Crete that Libya claims as its own and preparing a final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion. Together, the moves put the U.S. major at the center of the East Mediterranean’s most combustible mix of energy ambition and maritime dispute. Chevron has partnered with Greece’s HelleniQ Energy to bid for exploration rights in offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese. Athens views this development as a major step towards asserting its sovereignty over the contested waters. Waters south of Crete and the Peloponnese are contested due to a 2019 Turkey-Libya maritime agreement that ignores Greece's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims and is a response to potential hydrocarbon reserves in the area. Greece claims these areas based on international law, while Turkey disputes that islands like Crete can generate EEZs and views the situation as a geopolitical power struggle. Libya also claims significant portions of the area, aligning with Turkey's position.

Meanwhile, observers are awaiting Chevron’s final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion amid security concerns. However, Chevron and its partners, NewMed Energy and Ratio Energies, now expect to take the FID on the Leviathan Phase 1B expansion, which includes drilling, subsea systems, and a potential floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility, in the fourth quarter of 2025. This expansion is projected to significantly increase the field's annual production capacity and is supported by a recent historic gas export deal, a revised development plan approved by Israel in August 2025, and ongoing contract negotiations with potential customers.

Discovered in 2010, the Leviathan is located approximately 130 km off the shores of Haifa. The 330-square kilometer field holds ~22.9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, making it the largest natural gas reservoir in the Mediterranean, and one of the largest producing assets in the region. Production is facilitated by 4 subsea wells that are connected to an offshore platform via a subsea manifold and two 120 km long pipelines, where all processing of gas takes place. The gas is then piped to shore into the Israeli national grid and distributed to clients in Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.

Rectification note: The original article incorrectly stated that NewMed is the operator of the Leviathan gas field. The current operator is Chevron.
