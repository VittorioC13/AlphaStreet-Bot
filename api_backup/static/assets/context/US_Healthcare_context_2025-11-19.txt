[TITLE]Ramsey Theory Group CEO Dan Herbatschek Announces New Enhancements to Its AI-Driven Healthcare Delivery System Erdos Medical and Increased Adoption in Los Angeles:
[TEXT]
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ramsey Theory Group, the applied-mathematics-driven software and AI innovation firm, today announced new enhancements to its flagship healthcare delivery platform, Erdos Medical. CEO Dan Herbatschek stated that the update introduces advanced interoperability, AI-assisted patient engagement, and expanded compliance architecture designed to help healthcare providers securely connect with patients through a unified, user-friendly virtual ecosystem.

Erdos Medical has quickly become one of Ramsey Theory Group’s most transformative products—empowering clinics, hospitals, and private practices to deliver patient-centered virtual care without compromising compliance, privacy, or data integrity. According to the American Hospital Association, more than 76% of U.S. hospitals now offer telehealth services, but only 38% fully integrate virtual workflows with EHR systems. In Los Angeles County alone, virtual care visits grew by over 60% in 2024, yet most providers still face compliance gaps and data fragmentation.

“Los Angeles County has been an exceptionally strong market for us this year, while Erdos Medical has proven to successfully bring AI-driven and secure automation to human-centered healthcare nationwide,” said Dan Herbatschek, CEO of Ramsey Theory Group. “These new enhancements make it easier for providers to scale virtual operations, reduce administrative friction, and deliver better outcomes—without the security gaps or inefficiencies that have long plagued legacy telehealth systems.”

Key Provider Benefits

[TITLE]Salarius Pharmaceuticals and Decoy Therapeutics Complete Merger:
[TEXT]
Strategic transaction supports the advancement of Decoy’s rapid computational design and manufacturing of innovative peptide conjugate therapeutics through its IMP3ACT™ platform

Combined company has pro forma cash of $14 million following merger and closing of recent public offering

HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SLRX) (“Salarius” or the “Company”) and Decoy Therapeutics (“Decoy”) announce the completion of their strategic merger with the combined company now focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

“I’d like to thank both the Salarius and Decoy teams for their hard work and dedication in completing this transaction, which supports the advancement of next-generation therapeutics through our proprietary IMP3ACT Platform,” said Frederick “Rick” Pierce, Chief Executive Officer of Salarius and former Chief Executive Officer of Decoy. “By combining artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and high-speed synthesis techniques, we rapidly design, engineer and manufacture peptide conjugate drug candidates that target serious unmet medical needs. Our technology and innovations in manufacturing allow for advancing new therapies from lab to clinic to commercialization with unprecedented speed. We anticipate multiple value-creating inflection points in the coming year, initially targeting unmet needs in respiratory infectious diseases and gastroenterology (GI) oncology indications.”

Prior to this merger, Decoy attracted financing from institutional investors as well as significant non-dilutive capital from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Seed Fund, the Google AI startup program and the NVIDIA Inception program, among other sources. Decoy also received QuickFire Challenge award funding provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) through BLUE KNIGHT™, a legacy collaboration between Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS and BARDA within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

Then new company will be renamed Decoy Therapeutics. In addition to Decoy’s Co-founder Mr. Pierce serving as Chief Executive Officer, the new company is led by Decoy’s Co-founder Chief Scientific Officer Barbara Hibner, by Decoy’s Chief Business Officer Peter Marschel, by Decoy’s Chief Technology Officer Mike Lipp and by Decoy’s acting Chief Medical Officer and Scientific Advisory Board Chair Shahin Gharakhanian, M.D. Salarius’ current Chief Financial Officer and former acting Chief Executive Officer Mark Rosenblum will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company.

[TITLE]Bio-Strategies and Leadership Team Briefs Policymakers on Biosecurity Solutions in DC:
[TEXT]
Hoover Institution (Stanford, CA) — Hoover Institution Science and Senior fellow Drew Endy traveled to Washington, DC this month to brief policymakers on Biosecurity Really, a new report from the Bio-Strategies & Leadership (BSL) program. Biosecurity Really provides a frank assessment of rising biosecurity risks and a holistic strategy for making biosecurity real going forward.

Over two days of engagement, Endy and members of the BSL team met with members of Congress, congressional staff, and senior administration officials across government for wide-ranging discussions of biotechnology and biosecurity issues. Conversations focused on the report’s findings and its nine planks of policy recommendations. Across a dozen meetings, Endy also shared research on opportunities to strengthen America’s leadership in biology and biotechnology, including through expanded investment in foundational research.

As part of the visit, BSL hosted a “mini biosecurity boot camp,” attended by a bipartisan cohort of 20 mid- to senior-level congressional staffers from both chambers, key committees, and commissions. The Congressional Leadership Accelerator for Biosecurity event featured nearly a dozen expert speakers from government, industry, and academia. The half-day program combined lightning talks with panel discussions designed to build practical fluency in core biosecurity concepts, including the role of biological intelligence (aka BIOINT) and approaches to “using biology to secure biology,” as detailed in the Biosecurity Really report.

"Biology is a strategic domain—this means we need to be smart and fast in our innovations and thoughtful and serious about security,” Hoover Distinguished Visiting Fellow Mike Kuiken said. “Congress needs practical biosecurity fluency, not just policy papers. Our boot camp gave Hill staff the technical grounding to understand how biological intelligence works and why 'using biology to secure biology' isn't science fiction—it's the only viable path forward.” Kuiken continued, “The bipartisan engagement we saw reflects growing recognition that America's biotechnology leadership depends on getting biosecurity right, and getting biosecurity right requires advancing our understanding of biology itself."

The leadership program marks the second BSL boot camp designed specifically for congressional staff. BSL’s next congressional leadership experience will be a two-day intensive camp covering both biotechnology innovation and biosecurity to take place in February 2026 on Stanford’s campus. Prospective applicants can learn more about the program and apply here.

Endy and Hoover Visiting Fellow Josh Hodges also spoke at an “Ideas Uncorked” event hosted by Hoover’s Media and Government Relations team. Speaking before an audience of more than 70 attendees, the pair explored the national security implications of emerging biotechnologies and highlighted opportunities for policymakers to strengthen US biosecurity.

“Biotechnology is like computing in 1975,” Endy said. “Back then most thought computers would always be big machines in basements; but those on the frontier understood that computing was about to become pervasive, networked, and personal. Helping leaders understand how biotechnology is poised for—and undergoing—qualitative change is critical to realize and secure flourishing futures.”

BSL’s policy engagements in Washington reflect the program’s commitment to equipping decision makers with the knowledge and ideas needed to act on biology soon enough to matter.

[TITLE]AIIMS Jammu invites diaspora medical professionals to strengthen healthcare back home:
[TEXT]
STATE TIMES NEWS

JAMMU: AIIMS Jammu urges global diaspora doctors to join its expanding academic, clinical and research programs, highlighting new tech, collaborations and services, and offering honorarium plus travel and stay.

Seeking to reverse the longstanding trend of medical brain drain amid shortage of specialised human resources, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Jammu has called upon medical professionals from Jammu & Kashmir working abroad to support the institution’s growth and contribute to healthcare delivery back home.

In an official communication, Executive Director and CEO Prof. (Dr.) Shakti Kumar Gupta has invited members of the global medical community-and particularly those with roots in the region-to join AIIMS Jammu in its growing academic, clinical, and research ecosystem.

Prof. Gupta, an alumnus of AIIMS Delhi and a noted administrator, said the institute is entering its second year of operational excellence and is rapidly emerging as one of India’s leading centres of medical education and healthcare delivery.

The communication highlights the institute’s expanding collaborations, including partnerships with IIT Jammu, IIM Jammu, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), USA, aimed at bolstering translational research, innovation, and global academic exchange.

AIIMS Jammu has introduced several digital and patient-centred initiatives, including an Indoor Navigation App, Patient Care Coordinators, Rogi Sahayak Mitras, and the extensive use of Artificial Intelligence in radiology, pathology, and clinical decision support.

“Healthcare outreach has also been strengthened through camps, OPDs in remote and border regions, telemedicine programmes, and public-awareness campaigns,” said Dr Gupta.

The Institute’s Centre for Advanced Genomics and Precision Medicine is conducting pioneering work in precision oncology and genetic research, with samples and research support drawn from agencies such as the ICMR, SERB, and NAMS.

New clinical services, including Radiation Oncology and Chemotherapy Day Care, have expanded cancer treatment options in the region. AIIMS Jammu has also been designated a “Pain-Free AIIMS” by the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu & Kashmir, recognising its commitment to safe and compassionate pain management.

Upcoming upgrades such as Total Laboratory Automation (TLA) and dry-slide biochemistry platforms are expected to further strengthen diagnostic accuracy and sustainability. The institute has also invested heavily in a state-of-the-art Digital Library to support research, learning, and academic collaboration.

Prof. Gupta emphasised that diaspora professionals could play a transformative role across teaching, research, observership, mentorship, and patient-care domains.

“Your contribution through collaboration, innovation, and shared expertise will inspire us to reach greater heights in healthcare delivery,” he stated, adding that AIIMS Jammu “looks forward to hosting you on its green, vibrant, and inspiring campus-where knowledge blooms and collaboration thrives.”

As a gesture of appreciation for their service, AIIMS Jammu has announced a token honorarium of Rs 5,000 per day, along with free lodging and travel facilities for visiting medical professionals.

Welcoming the initiative, Prof. K. Ganapathy, eminent neurosurgeon, Past President Neurological Society of India and PP Telemedicine Society of India said, alumni and senior professors could play a pivotal role by teaching, supporting research, mentoring students, and sharing their global expertise.

Recalling his visit to AIIMS Jammu a fortnight ago, Dr. Ganapathy lauded the institution’s faculty, state-of-the-art infrastructure and innovative use of technology in healthcare. “It is impossible to separate excellence in medical education from robust infrastructure and advanced technology. AIIMS Jammu has set benchmarks in both,” he said, noting initiatives such as the first-of-its-kind MBA programme in hospital administration offered by AIIMS Jammu jointly with IIT Jammu and IIM Jammu.

However, he emphasised that the institution’s greatest need now is human resources. Joining AIIMS Jammu is a great opportunity for professional growth. “I wish I was several decades younger” he remarked, adding that experienced specialists and super-specialists from other parts of India and overseas spending time at this AIIMS can make a difference.

Prof. Ganapathy added that he would recommend this excellent initiative to his colleagues practicing in the UK, US and other countries and encouraged overseas clinicians to actively consider contributing to the institution’s growth.
