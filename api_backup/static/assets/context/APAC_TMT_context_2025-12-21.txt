[TITLE]Arm China, AI start-up RabbitPre among mainland Chinese tech firms expanding in Hong Kong:
[TEXT]
A growing number of mainland Chinese tech firms are tapping Hong Kong for research talent and overseas expansion, as the Asian financial hub moves to attract Big Tech and start-ups to boost its technology sector.

Arm China, the Chinese unit of British semiconductor firm Arm Holdings, would establish a chip intellectual property research and development centre in Hong Kong in 2026 that would focus on artificial intelligence and robotics, Arm China senior technical director Zou Wei said last month.

The new centre would be located at the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, and aimed to recruit around 100 people within three years, according to Zou.

[TITLE]CNBC's The China Connection newsletter: Why Sam’s Club is in a sweet spot as China faces consumption worries:
[TEXT]
This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Sam's Club, the membership-based warehouse retail arm of Walmart, opened its new store in Beijing last month, followed by another one in Shanghai on Tuesday. They drew large crowds, snarling traffic for hours and keeping consumers in long queues.

American membership warehouse clubs are telling something more nuanced: they are finding success in drawing consumers who are willing to pay a hefty membership fee in exchange for premium goods at reasonable prices. On top of that, those stores provide no-frill "treasure-hunt" shopping experiences to sweeten the deal.

Latest data from China showed a key gauge on consumption falling to its weakest level in nearly three years. But it does not capture the full story.

YANGZHOU, CHINA - NOVEMBER 12, 2025 - Citizens shop at the first Sam's Club in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China on November 12, 2025.

Such warehouse stores have long been known as places to buy large quantities of household staples at cheaper prices.

Even though it's less typical in China, where grocery habits have historically skewed toward high-frequency, smaller-basket shopping, this retail model is starting to find its customers.

"Here they do buy it because of the value and niche products," said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidal Wave Solutions. He said residents in his compound often ask in group chats whether others want to split oversized packs.

Sam's Club has leaned into that proposition: a shopping experience and product lineup distinct from conventional supermarkets and online retailers, paired with annual membership fees ranging from 260 yuan to 680 yuan ($37-$97). Shoppers get modest discounts — but the bigger draw is access to curated merchandise that they can't find elsewhere.

"It's a membership model that consumers pay the membership fee upfront, and as a result, they get a full set of services," said Weiwen Han, a Hong Kong-based partner at Bain & Company.

Walmart's success

Walmart entered China in 1996 with its first hypermarket and Sam's Club warehouse chain in Shenzhen.

But the hypermarket format — which combines a supermarket and department store — has lost momentum as digital retail took off. Sprawling online marketplaces, such as Alibaba and JD.com , with their aggressive discounts and convenience, have squeezed out traditional grocers and foreign players such as France-based Carrefour.

Walmart has closed almost 150 hypermarkets in China since 2020, with just 279 stores operational as of July, down from 412 in 2020.

But Sam's Club has proven an enduring strength for the company. The chain has turned warehouses into both shopping destinations and e-commerce delivery hubs, while filling shelves with products consumers can't easily comparison-shop elsewhere, including exclusive items under its house brand Member's Mark and Marketside.

Beyond online grocery ordering and delivery, the clubs offer an offline experience where shoppers can browse and "treasure hunt" — something local e-commerce players struggle to replicate, Han said.

The bet is paying off. Sam's Club has become one of the China's fastest-growing foreign retailers, with 56 outlets nationwide, compared to Costco's seven stores in the country. The market also helped fuel Walmart's strongest net sales growth globally. In the third quarter, Walmart's net sales in China surged 21.9% year on year to $6.1 billion, exceeding the broader Walmart International segment's average growth rate of 10.8%.

'Let's go to Disney'

That blend of curated products and digital convenience helps explain why the model has gained traction with affluent shoppers — and why one store visit can translate into multiple online orders.

Many shoppers won't return often in person. They'll make one trip to browse, then rely on the mobile app for five to 10 deliveries from the same store, said Curtis Alan Ferguson, former president of Coca-Cola Greater China and Korea and now managing partner at Ventech China, a venture capital firm focused on consumer startups.

For some, the appeal is the outing itself — a well-designed, predictable version of discovery shopping. "It's more of a … 'let's go to Disney' here," Ferguson said.

Aside from the physical shopping experience, Walmart says speed is part of the stickiness. "Our team in China delivers extremely fast, with nearly 80% of digital orders delivered within one hour," Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.

Ferguson said suppliers also like working with Sam's Club because the volumes can justify unique packaging or sizes. "People bend over backwards to give [Sam's Club] the quality they desire," he said. "If you have … Sam's or Costco pulling your brand … that gives you some other cachet."

Hard to copy — even with local muscle

Few local rivals have managed to seriously challenge Sam's Club and Costco in membership retail — and not for lack of trying.

Alibaba's Freshippo, the Chinese tech giant's grocery business, shuttered its last members-only store in August.

However, regional chain Pangdonglai, which started in Xuchang, a city in the heartland of Henan, is widely viewed as a standout success.

Pangdonglai's appeal is that it operates on a "people-first philosophy" where emotional value and trust matter more than scale, said Olivia Plotnick, founder of Shanghai-based marketing agency Wai Social.

But the Henan store has struggled to scale beyond its home base. Its distinctive culture and high operational standards can be difficult to replicate — and to defend — in larger, more competitive cities, said Plotnick.

"Consumers with real demand for premium value are still willing to pay, but those seeking rational, low-price essentials are shifting toward discount formats," Plotnick said.

As China's consumer slump drags on, the warehouse clubs that offer quality goods at reasonable prices, and provide a store experience that online competitors can't easily rival, are emerging as rare bright spots in the sector.

Rich Asian investors are plowing record money into complex stock bets that saddled them with big losses just a few years ago. Issuance of structured products linked to Hong Kong and Singapore equities has surged 80% this year to a record of more than $200 billion, according to estimates from BNP Paribas SA, one of the top issuers. Products known as accumulators-which make their holders continuously buy stocks at preset levels-and fixed-coupon notes that offer monthly returns are particularly popular.The revival coincides with a surge in Asia's equities driven by the artificial intelligence frenzy. Typically marketed by private banks to wealthy clients, structured-note bets this year have been concentrated in Chinese mega-caps such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, a shift away from US names like Nvidia Corp. The instruments help holders build exposure to stocks in a more controlled way, though their complex structure means losses can worsen under certain conditions."Issuance was very limited for the last few years, up until September of last year," said Tony Lee, of JPMorgan Chase & Co., referring to notes tied to Asian stocks. “Because of the recovery of the Chinese market, the product underlyings have shifted from US stocks into Hong Kong stocks.”While US investors’ appetite toward structured products has been growing, Asia remains the main market. More than 60% of the global sales came from the region in the first seven months of 2025, led by China and Hong Kong, according to industry data provider SRP.The instruments generally offer a smaller maximum payout than stocks, but some investors are lured by their regular, fixed payments that are usually higher than bond yields, or by the embedded protection they offer.Yet the risks can be overlooked: The Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, the Covid outbreak and China’s internet crackdown that triggered a multi-year stock slump are just a few incidents that handed steep losses to investors.Traded over-the-counter, accumulators are contracts that force investors to buy a set amount of underlying securities at a fixed price over regular intervals. In a rising market, the purchase price is usually at a discount. During downturns, however, holders are often locked into buying at above-market prices.At CA Indosuez Wealth Management, some of the most-traded accumulators require investors to purchase double the initially agreed amount of Alibaba shares if the stock price drops more a certain amount, often between 10% and 20% of the level at the start of the investment, according to Ting May Woo, the firm’s head of advisory solutions in Singapore.For fixed-coupon notes, the return is typically tied to an asset such as an equity gauge, single stock or group of shares. Barclays Plc recently offered one that pays an annualized coupon of 9% every month and has the principle linked to the performance of Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan, according to a term sheet seen by Bloomberg. If any of the three stocks drops 28% or more from its price at the investment entry, holders have to buy its shares at a higher price than the current trading level or settle in cash at losses.Alibaba is the most popular underlying asset among the structured notes issued in Asia this year, according to Daniel So, senior trading strategist at Goldhorse Capital Management, which runs a fintech platform that offers pricing of structured notes. The coupon offered by notes tied to Chinese AI names often ranges between 10% and 20% annualized, higher than the 10% to 12% for those tracking an index, he said.Demand is surging as the stocks rally. Alibaba shares jumped nearly 90% this year in Hong Kong, while the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 26% to end years of underperformance against US peers.At Royal Bank of Canada, between 30% and 40% of the equity-linked notes tracked Hong Kong-listed equities in 2025, according to Kin Lok Lee, head of structured products for the wealth-management arm in Hong Kong. That’s up from about 20% in 2024, when around 80% of the fixed-coupon products were linked to US names, he added.“Investors who buy these notes usually can accept the worst-case scenario — which is to buy these shares at pre-determined strike levels higher than market prices — because they hold the belief that these stocks will eventually recover,” Goldhorse’s So said.It’s not uncommon for wealthy investors to take on leverage, allowing them to boost bets and amplify returns, according to CA Indosuez’s Woo. Of course, the losses would also get amplified in an adverse scenario.The challenge for BNP Paribas is to manage risk given that the current notes are concentrated on a small number of names, according to Charles-Edouard Garnier, the bank’s head of equity-derivatives sales for Asia-ex Japan. Still, this year’s market gains have spurred risk taking and reinvestment as products terminated early with share prices climbing beyond knock-out levels before maturity.“I wouldn’t be surprised to have another very decent growth next year, assuming that the market doesn’t collapse,” he said.
