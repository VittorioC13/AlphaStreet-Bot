[TITLE]WeRide CEO pitches robotaxi safety as shares start trading in HK:
[TEXT]
Shares of WeRide start trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange today, just over a year after the robotaxi firm forayed into U.S. markets with a Nasdaq listing. For founder and CEO Tony Han, the offering is part of a global strategy to fund the expensive but necessary research behind the company’s autonomous-driving tech.

WeRide’s shares are now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. WeRide elected for a dual primary listing, which will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy the stock through the city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme.

“We want to make our stock more accessible to investors all over the world,” Han told Fortune in late October, on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum. “China is a very important market, both for consumers and also for investors. A Hong Kong dual listing actually helps some potential investors who can only invest in the Hong Kong stock market to buy our stock.”

Han says the funds raised through the Hong Kong listing will help the robotaxi firm continue to spend on R&D and deployment. “We will still need to raise more funds,” he said, “so this will put WeRide in a much better position to access more funds.”

Fellow robotaxi firm Pony AI also starts trading in Hong Kong today after its own IPO on that exchange. Like WeRide, Pony AI listed on the Nasdaq late last year.

Hong Kong’s IPO market is booming as Chinese firms hope to leverage the city’s access to both international and mainland Chinese capital. Firms listed in mainland China, including home appliance manufacturer Midea and battery-maker CATL, have launched secondary listings in Hong Kong in order to draw international investment.

Yet several U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also considering primary listings in Hong Kong in order to access mainland Chinese investors. There’s also a geopolitical dimension: U.S.-listed Chinese firms may see Hong Kong as a backup in the event the Trump administration decides to delist them from U.S. exchanges, as part of a yearslong dispute between Washington and Beijing over auditing standards.

The city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme allows certified investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Southbound flows hit a record $110 billion in the first seven months of the year, according to the South China Morning Post citing data from Wind, already greater than the entire total in 2024.

Investors are flocking to AI firms and “new consumption”—think Pop Mart and Labubu. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up around 32% for the year so far; by comparison, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is up 22%.

WeRide raised $308 million in its Hong Kong IPO, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Shares were priced at 27.10 Hong Kong dollars, a slight discount to the stock’s Nasdaq price at Monday’s close.

WeRide HK-listed shares fell almost 12% on their first day of Hong Kong trading; the firm’s shares have lost over 40% of their value since the U.S. IPO. Pony AI’s HK shares fell around 14%.

Self-driving cars: A social good?

Tony Han, formerly chief scientist at Baidu’s autonomous vehicle unit, founded WeRide in 2017. Based in Guangzhou, the self-driving vehicle company operates in several major Chinese cities, as well as markets outside China. The company has deployments in Singapore, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. WeRide is now testing or operating vehicles in 30 cities across 11 countries.

WeRide is a member of this year’s Future 50, Fortune’s annual ranking of companies with the greatest potential for growth. The firm is also a member of this year’s Change the World list, which highlights companies that are doing social good through their business models.

Han evangelizes the many ways that self-driving vehicles—and moving away from a car-centric culture—can improve society. He predicts that accident rates will be “drastically reduced” once cars are put in the hands of computers as opposed to humans.

“Most accidents, we find, are due to human factors,” Han explained, citing the effects of drinking, drowsiness, and distraction on human drivers. “Machines won’t be drunk, won’t overdose. Machines are very reliable. Fatal accident rates for robotaxis are much lower than human drivers.”

Less congestion could be another benefit of automated vehicles. “Robotaxis will never speed, will never just cut in line,” he said. “Traffic will just flow much more smoothly.”

There’s a broader economic argument for self-driving cars in countries whose populations are rapidly aging as birth rates decline—a particularly thorny problem in China and elsewhere in Asia. “With such huge markets, we will need lots of labor in transport and mobility,” Han said. “If we are shorthanded, then we have to use AI to replace the shortage, to fill the gap between demand and requirements.”

That extends to public transport and public services. WeRide runs robobuses, robosweepers, and other automated forms of public transit and city vehicles. “The cost of bus drivers in a developed economy is quite high,” Han explained. If these costs can be reduced through automation, he argued, then cities can expand their transit systems and “help build more eco-friendly transportation for the whole planet.”

The robotaxi business

WeRide reported $27.9 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, a 32% jump from the same period a year earlier. Still, the company reported a $110 million net loss for that same period, owing in large part to spending of $90 million on research and development, approaching the $107 million spent on R&D for all of 2024.

Robotaxis remain an expensive and unprofitable proposition. An HSBC report in July pointed out that self-driving cars have a lot of hidden costs, including remote supervisors, charging and parking infrastructure, and tech support. The bank suggested that robotaxis might not break even until about eight years after launch.

Yet HSBC also predicted that robotaxis will likely reach their commercial potential in China first, owing to greater adoption and acceptance of robotaxi technologies.

Chinese companies are leading the global push for robotaxis. In addition to WeRide and Pony AI, Baidu is also expanding its robotaxi offerings through its Apollo Go vehicles.

China also manufactures many of the components that go into self-driving cars. One key component producer is Hesai Technology, the world’s leading producer of automotive lidar sensors, which are used by robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to recognize their environment and avoid obstacles.

Global ride-share companies are taking notice. WeRide is offering its Middle Eastern robotaxis through a partnership with Uber. Singaporean ride-hailing firm Grab has also made a strategic equity investment in WeRide, and is working with the Chinese firm to offer its Robotaxi GXRs and robobuses in Singapore starting next year.

Singaporean transit company ComfortDelGro, meanwhile, is working with Pony AI to explore offering robotaxis, while Lyft is collaborating with Baidu to test its Apollo Go self-driving cars in Europe.

By comparison, U.S.-based robotaxi operations are proving to be a lot slower in global expansion. Waymo currently operates in Tokyo and London.

Han isn’t surprised that global firms are now embracing Chinese robotaxis. After all, if China offers the best product, why wouldn’t foreign firms want to cooperate with it?

“When I was a teenager, we bought electronics from Japan, tools from Germany, and computers from the U.S. It’s very normal. It’s very normal,” Han said.

“If WeRide can supply good robotaxi technology and services to Uber, and in turn, Uber and WeRide together bring a very efficient and comfortable taxi service to ordinary people; why shouldn’t we do that?”

Clarification, Nov. 6, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify that WeRide will offer both robotaxi and robobus services in Singapore, as well as to note the total number of markets the firm operates in.

The gloom on Wall Street spread across Asia on Wednesday, with key indexes tumbling as a global tech sell-off deepened.

In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 Index slid as much as 4.7%, led by chip test provider Adventest, which plunged 11%.

In South Korea, the Kospi index dropped as much as 6.2% as chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix sank 8.2% and 9.5%, respectively. The declines erased much of the Kospi's 20% surge in October.

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company tumbled 3%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index fell as much as 2.9%.

The downturn reflected a "gloomy and damp portrayal of risk," wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Australian brokerage Pepperstone, in a Wednesday note.

AI hype cycle hits reality check

That sentiment marks a sharp contrast with the optimism that has fueled markets this year, as investors piled into artificial intelligence plays that sent valuations to new highs.

But concerns are mounting that some companies' valuations have outpaced their actual progress — and that they may struggle to deliver on lofty AI ambitions despite pouring billions into the technology.

Adding to the selling pressure was Michael Burry, the famed "Big Short" investor, whose hedge fund disclosed short bets against Palantir and Nvidia on Monday.

"Investors are sitting on huge stock market gains, and some might have taken profits today, especially in AI-related stocks, in response to Burry's filing news," wrote veteran analyst Ed Yardeni.

On Tuesday, shares of AI-powered data analytics firm Palantir tumbled 8% following its third-quarter earnings report and Burry's disclosure, despite solid results and upbeat guidance.

Other major tech names — including AMD, Oracle, and Nvidia — also dropped, dragging the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 down 2.1%.

"There is fear of an AI correction, and if it comes, it will sweep the rest of the market with it due to the heavyweight of the leading names," wrote Louis Navellier, the founder and chief investment officer at asset manager Navellier and Associates.

He wrote that while this earnings season has featured companies consistently beating forecasts, investors are showing signs of resistance to high valuations. He also still recommends Nvidia and Palantir.

Despite the selloff, "we can't lose sight that it was only last week that the indexes were at all-time highs, and profit-taking is the normal course of action," Navellier wrote.

Palantir's stock remains up 152% year to date, while Nvidia — which closed 4% lower on Tuesday — is still up 48% over the same period.

Still, the selling may not be over.

"Simplistically, there aren't many reasons to buy here, and until we move closer to Nvidia's earnings on 19 November, the market lacks a short-term catalyst," wrote Pepperstone's Weston.

Japan's Nikkei 225 plunged below the 50,000 mark on Wednesday before paring losses amid a wider decline in Asia markets as investors fled AI-related stocks.

The Nikkei lost 2.5% to close at 50,212.27 after falling over 4%, while the Topix was down 1.26% to close at 3,268.29. Shares in Japan's SoftBank Group plunged more than 10% Wednesday amid a broader drop in Asian AI-linked companies, tracking declines in U.S. peers.

South Korea's Kospi fell over 2% to end the trading day at 4,004.42, with chip heavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix posting losses of over 4% and 1% respectively. The small-cap Kosdaq shed 2.66% to end the trading day at 901.89.

The South Korean won weakened as much as 0.6% to 1,449.50 against the greenback, the lowest since April, data from LSEG showed.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was flat at 25,935.41 while mainland China's CSI 300 was up 0.19% at 4,627.26.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.13% to 8,802, posting a comparatively modest loss.

The big story

TradFi meets DeFi in Hong Kong

Hong Kong has been quick to follow Washington's lead, allowing exchange-traded funds tracking spot last year, and went a step further by approving spot ether ETFs to trade nearly three months before the U.S. did. Bitcoin, often likened to digital gold, remains the most recognized cryptocurrency. Ether, another major digital currency on the Ethereum network, is used both for payments and as "gas" to pay for computation and run smart contracts on decentralized applications. Ethereum Foundation's co-executive director Tomasz K. Stańczak, speaking at a digital assets forum Sunday on the sidelines of Hong Kong's FinTech week, noted that over 60% of stablecoins —cryptocurrencies pegged to government-issued currencies— are deployed on the Ethereum network.

[TITLE]International stocks slide as concerns about AI and tech company values spread:
[TEXT]
HONG KONG — International markets plunged Wednesday as stocks across the Asia-Pacific region sold off on worries about the sky-high valuations of artificial intelligence and tech companies.

The Kospi stock index in South Korea plunged more than 6% at its lowest point. Japan’s Nikkei 225 average slid about 4.5%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index tumbled more than 1%. Stocks in Taiwan also fell around 2.5%.

European markets also opened lower.

The pan-European STOXX 600 dropped as much as 0.7%, while Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.2% at its lowest, and Germany’s benchmark stock index took a hit of 0.7%. The markets clawed back some of their losses later.

U.S. stock futures, an indication of where markets will open, showed that losses were likely to continue Wednesday after the opening bell rings in New York. S&P 500 futures pointed to a drop of 0.5%, and Nasdaq futures indicated a decline of about 1% on Wednesday.

While Asian markets pared some of their losses from earlier in the day, the indices closed lower across the board, which economists said was an indicator of how reliant tech companies, even in Asia, are on the U.S.

“There are some Asian economies — Taiwan the most, followed by South Korea — that are really dependent on U.S. tech companies,” said Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong.

“It’s about the export of chips and more generally the ecosystem,” she said. “It’s very correlated.”

The selloff came after a day of significant selling in the United States that brought the recent global market rally to a halt. The S&P 500 closed Tuesday down 1.1%, the Nasdaq tumbled 2%, and the Russell 2000 fell 1.8%.

The largest publicly traded company in the world, Nvidia, dropped nearly 4% on Tuesday. Palantir, another AI firm whose business involves government contracts, sank nearly 8% even after it beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations.

“If you look at the graph for the whole index and how much that index has been contributed by AI stocks, you just can’t believe that’s sustainable,” García-Herrero said.

Last week, the Kospi hit a record high, fueled by gains in AI stocks. Taiwan’s benchmark index, TWI, has gained 20% this year, driven in part by the 40% gain seen by TSMC, which supplies chips to Nvidia and other tech companies.

But on Wednesday, the months-long rally came to a grinding halt after overvaluation warnings from Wall Street, resulting in a steep selloff, with shares of global electronics giant Samsung falling 5.5% and chipmaker SK Hynix dropping more than 6%.

SoftBank, a major investor in AI firms, sank more than 14%, wiping out more than $30 billion in market value.

Late Monday, the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley warned that a possible market pullback may be on the horizon. Matters were made worse by lackluster earnings Tuesday afternoon from Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer, both of which manufacture chips used for AI services.

Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and the companies that produce AI services has been overflowing for months. Companies from Amazon to Microsoft to OpenAI have announced a steady stream of multibillion-dollar deals with one another, raising questions over the sustainability of the industry and its sources of funding.

U.S. stocks are coming off a remarkable run, repeatedly setting recent record highs. For the year so far, the S&P 500 is still up more than 15%. The Nasdaq Composite, which more closely tracks the largest tech companies, has still gained more than 20% this year.

Mithil Aggarwal reported from Hong Kong, and Steve Kopack reported from New York.
