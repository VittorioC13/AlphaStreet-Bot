[TITLE]AIG Gets Approval to Acquire Everest Renewals in 6 EU Countries – in Time for Jan. 1:
[TEXT]
AIG announced it has received approval to proceed with the acquisition of Everest Group’s renewals in Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Ireland.

The European Union deal is part of AIG’s $2 billion acquisition of Everest’s retail commercial insurance renewal rights, initially announced in October.

Starting January 1, 2026, Everest renewals in these six countries will transfer to AIG capacity, AIG explained in its October announcement.

AIG said it received approval to proceed with the transaction in the EU-listed countries on Friday, December 12.

“We purchased the renewal rights for approximately $300 million with a potential downward adjustment of up to $70 million, depending on how much of the portfolio is renewed with AIG,” according to AIG’s Chairman & CEO Peter Zaffino, in an analysts’ call to discuss Q3 2025 results on November 5.

“In terms of the portfolio, it’s well diversified across geographies and classes of business. The largest portion of the in-force eligible gross premiums written is in the United States at $1.3 billion, followed by Europe at $400 million, the UK at $150 million, Australia at $80 million and Singapore at $70 million,” Zaffino continued.

“Approximately 60% of this portfolio will renew in the first half of 2026. Canada, Latin America and certain lines of business, including aviation, surety and wholesale are specifically excluded,” he said.

“We intend to make the renewals as seamless as possible, and we are fully committed to partnering with brokers and clients to renew all of Everest’s expiring capacity and terms,” according to Paride Della Rosa, chief executive officer, AIG EMEA, in a memo issued to UK brokers to discuss today’s European renewal announcement.

Exposure to all liabilities will remain with Everest, which also will continue to administer claims with respect to its policies, AIG said.

“We expect these renewal rights transactions to drive incremental growth in our general insurance portfolio, and we will be able to write these policies within our existing balance sheet with no incremental capital required,” Zaffino said in October.

“This transaction adds further scale to AIG’s upper middle and large account retail insurance book, providing an opportunity to drive premium growth without adding meaningful costs,” he said in the Q3 earnings call. “The actions we have taken over the past several years have positioned us with the balance sheet and liquidity to pursue compelling opportunities when they materialize.”

Also in October, AIG announced it would become a minority equity investor in Convex Group Ltd., the Bermuda-based specialty insurer and reinsurer. In a deal expected to close in the first half of 2026, private equity firm Onex Corp. will acquire a 63% equity stake in Convex for approximately $3.8 billion, while AIG will acquire a 35% equity stake in Convex for approximately $2.1 billion. The balance will be owned by the Convex management team.

“We announced strategic investments with Convex Group, Onex Corp. and a transaction with Everest Group. These will strengthen AIG’s long-term value and strategic positioning, and we expect they will be earnings, EPS and ROE accretive one year after closing…,” Zafino said in the Q3 earnings call.

Tilray stock soars on 3 major cannabis triggers today

Cannabis company rides triple wave of Trump policy buzz, reverse split effects and new vape product launch

Tilray Brands is riding a perfect storm of cannabis industry catalysts that sent the stock climbing on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. The company finds itself at the intersection of Washington policy speculation, corporate restructuring and fresh product launches—a combination that’s turning heads across the investment community.

The cannabis sector extended Friday’s explosive rally as global trading opened, with investors scrambling to understand what a potential shift in federal marijuana policy could mean for companies like Tilray. But the story goes deeper than just regulatory headlines.

Trump Schedule III expectations electrify the sector

The biggest driver behind Monday’s cannabis stock surge came from growing expectations that President Donald Trump could direct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug. Reports first surfaced late last week suggesting the administration is prepared to pursue this reclassification through executive action, moving cannabis away from its current Schedule I status.

The Washington Post described the discussions as an effort to dramatically loosen federal restrictions, though the move would not legalize or decriminalize marijuana nationwide. That distinction matters for everyday consumers, but for publicly traded cannabis companies, Schedule III represents a potential transformation of their business landscape.

The reclassification could ease the burden of federal tax rules that have historically prevented cannabis businesses from taking standard deductions—one of the biggest reasons profitability has remained elusive across the sector. Lower federal restrictions could also make banks, payment processors and institutional investors more willing to work with cannabis-linked businesses, addressing one of the industry’s most persistent challenges.

Reuters reported broad strength across cannabis equities in early European trading, with Canopy Growth leading the charge and Tilray among the prominent movers extending Friday’s momentum. The rally reflects investor optimism

Bentleys and Scottish salmon to benefit from UK-South Korea trade deal

The UK and South Korea have finalised a trade deal aimed at boosting exports of luxury Bentley cars, Scottish salmon and Guinness canned in Britain. The government said the agreement was an extension of its current tariff-free deal on most goods and services traded between the countries and would "support thousands of UK jobs and grow the economy". It marks the fourth trade agreement struck since Labour took office, following deals with the European Union, the US and India. But UK economic growth, the government's top priority, has remained sluggish and the BBC understands part of the US agreement, regarding technology, has stalled.

The so-called "Tech Prosperity Deal" was signed by US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in September. The government said the deal secured £150bn worth of US investment, which it said would create 7,600 jobs, with firms such as Microsoft and Google pledging to spend billions in the UK. It also sought to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power. However, talks on the agreement are now being held up because of US concerns

[TITLE]UK lands trade deal with South Korea to boost jobs and exports:
[TEXT]
UK services firms eye £400 million boost thanks to deal that also locks in tariff-free access across 98% of tariff lines.

Bentley, Scottish Salmon and Guinness among iconic exports to benefit

Deal follows landmark trade agreements with EU, US, and India which together will add billions of pounds and thousands of jobs to UK economy.

The UK and South Korea have finalised a free trade deal which will boost exports, support thousands of UK jobs and grow the economy.

The deal, announced by Trade Minister Chris Bryant and his Korean counterpart Minister Yeo Han-koo at Samsung KX in London on Monday [December 15] is the fourth trade deal the UK government has agreed this year following agreements with India, the EU and the US. It follows high-level talks between the UK and South Korean governments last week.

The deal with South Korea, the 12th largest economy in the world, is expected to grow UK services exports by £400 million including improved access to South Korea’s expanding financial market.

Vital automotive, pharmaceutical and food and drink industries have also been protected and global supply chains secured. Some £2 billion of UK exports were weeks away from facing costly tariff hikes but will now benefit from the deal thanks to permanent preferential access to one of Asia’s most advanced economies.

Iconic goods from across the country such as Guinness canned in Runcorn, Bentleys manufactured in Crewe, and salmon from Scotland will remain competitive in South Korea’s fast-growing import market, which is expected to grow by 26% by 2035.

The deal will legitimise the use of e-contracts and other digital technology making it quicker, cheaper and easier for UK firms to sell to Korea, cementing the UK-South Korea trade partnership as one of the most advanced in the world.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

This is a huge win for British business and working people and marks our 4th major agreement in 2025 after the EU, India and US. From food to TV, music and more, Korean culture is already influential here in the UK. This deal making trade even easier between us will help boost the economy - supporting jobs and growth which will be felt all over the country.

Trade Minister Chris Bryant said:

Korean culture has taken off in the UK, with millions of Brits already binge watching great Korean TV like Squid Game and streaming K-pop artists like Blackpink - but this trade deal will take our relationship to the next level, with hundreds of millions of pounds and vast opportunities unlocked for businesses. Today’s agreement secures the UK as a global leader in digital trade and innovation while boosting our world class services sector, supporting iconic brands, and giving cast-iron protections to our key industries to speed up economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.

Korean Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo said:

The upgraded Korea-UK FTA will strengthen the free-market system in a trade environment with heightened uncertainty. In particular, it will be an opportunity to enhance economic cooperation ties with the UK, a key partner in Europe. The upgraded Korea-UK FTA has established a considerable number of comprehensive cooperation norms, including market liberalisation, digital trade, and cooperation for supply chains stabilisation, to strengthen the Korea – UK trading relationship.

The advanced digital wins align with the UK’s flagship Trade Strategy which emphasises going further on digital provisions in trade agreements than ever before.

The deal will also:

Secure continued and permanent tariff-free access across 98% of tariff lines – the same terms the EU has with South Korea

Create opportunities for British businesses of all sizes which stand to benefit from South Korea’s growing import market, forecast to grow by 26% by 2035

Update rules of origin which will simplify tariff-free access and will open doors for greater diversification across supply chains for sectors such as automotive and pharmaceuticals.

Strengthen UK access to South Korea’s expanding financial market – building on £1.1 billion in financial and insurance exports in 2024.

Help smaller businesses, which make up over 99% of UK businesses, by streamlining custom processes and reducing non-tariff barriers.

Frank-Steffen Walliser, Chairman and CEO of Bentley Motors, said:

South Korea is a key market for Bentley and the luxury vehicle market. To secure immediate ongoing access to South Korea and a positive long term trade deal, is great news. Smooth international trade is vital to UK automotive business growth. So, securing trading relations with South Korea and with other partners across the 60 plus markets in which we operate is business critical. We welcome this collaborative approach from the UK Government and look forward to future trade discussions.

Nik Jhangiani, Interim Chief Executive, Diageo, said:

I commend Sir Chris Bryant and his South Korean counterpart Jung-Kwan Kim in securing a new trade agreement between the UK and South Korea. The deal will support export growth for Guinness, canned in Runcorn, and help satisfy the growing demand from South Korean consumers for the world’s number one stout.

Hannah Gurga, Director General for the Association of British Insurers, said:

We welcome the UK-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, which will enable UK non-life insurers to continue providing cover directly into the South Korean market. We support South Korea’s pledge to publish clear guidance on cross-border data rules and limit further data localisation restrictions for UK financial services. These measures will help insurers and reinsurers operate with greater certainty and continue serving customers effectively. South Korea is a growing financial hub and an important market for the UK insurance sector, offering significant opportunities for future collaboration.

Richard Molyneux, Chief Finance Officer at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which is one of the UK companies that will benefit, said:

We welcome this free trade agreement and the benefits it will provide our clients in South Korea, which is an important market for JLR.

It signals a new golden age of UK-South Korea relations, epitomised by Virgin Atlantic launching daily flights from London to Seoul in 2026.

The agreement follows a string of huge trade wins: the FTA signed with India in July could add £4.8 billion to the UK economy, the state visit following the US deal agreed in May secured £150 billion in investment commitments from US companies and the EU deal could add nearly £9 billion to the UK economy by 2040.

Notes to editors:

The government is committed to transparency throughout our trade programme.

The conclusion summary setting out what we have agreed as part of this deal will be published at 22:30 Monday 15 December on GOV.UK, and a technical note will follow shortly.

[TITLE]It’s Official: New York City’s Getting Three Casinos:
[TEXT]
After a years-long approval process, the New York State Gaming Commission has officially awarded gaming licenses to casinos at Resorts World and Metropolitan Park in Queens and at Bally’s in the Bronx.

The Metropolitan Park casino, a combined effort between Hard Rock International and New York Mets’ owner Steve Cohen, paves the way for an $8.1 billion complex that will see the conversion of 50 acres surrounding Citi Field into “New York’s next great sports and entertainment destination,” according to a Metropolitan Park announcement following the commission’s decision. The project will produce “25 acres of new public park space, 23,000 union jobs, and over $1.75 billion in community benefits and infrastructure improvements,” the announcement said.

SEE ALSO: Developer Plans to Convert Religious Building in Williamsburg Into 99 Apartments

The area will see the introduction of a Hard Rock Hotel; a 5,650-capacity, theater-style venue for live entertainment; park space, athletic fields and playgrounds that will represent “more new park and community space than Bryant Park, the High Line and Union Square Park combined;” and a “complete transformation” of the 7 train’s Mets-Willets Point station, according to the announcement.

This effort will also see the development of an all-affordable housing project with 450 new housing units.

“Since the day I bought the team, the community and Mets fans have made it clear to me that we can and should do better with the area around the ballpark,” Cohen said in the announcement. “Now, we are going to be able to deliver the sports and entertainment district that our fans have been asking for.”

The Bally’s casino, slated for Ferry Point Park in the Bronx, will be a $4 billion effort set to include a 500-room hotel, a 2,000-seat event center, a nightclub and a spa, as well as new food and beverage outlets and retail shops. An existing golf course designed by golf legend Jack Nicklaus will also be part of the complex.

Bally’s effort is scheduled to create $765 million in local benefits, including “infrastructure and transit upgrades, funding for schools and organizations, NYPD substations and more,” according to the Bronx Times.

Bally’s Chairman Soo Kim previously shared with the Times that construction would begin immediately, and should be completed ahead of a previously declared mid-2030 timeline.

The Resorts World casino in Jamaica, Queens, will see an expansion of an existing racino near Aqueduct Racetrack that already featured over 5,800 slot machines and electronic table games.

The casino’s owner, the Genting Group, had proposed a $7.5 billion investment in the project to include a new 1,600-room hotel, an arena, and more than 30 new restaurants and bars, according to Bloomberg. They also offered the state a 56 percent levy on revenue from slot machines, the highest percentage of the three new casinos.

“Resorts World New York City thanks the New York State Gaming Commission for today’s final approval,” Robert DeSalvio, president of Genting Americas East, said in a statement. “We look forward to opening within months as New York City’s first full commercial casino.”

The commission made clear that each company must appoint an external monitor for at least five years to ensure that all the promised community benefits see the light of day.

The three projects are expected to bring substantial tax revenue to New York State.

“Using conservative assumptions, the board’s consultants projected incremental annual gaming tax revenue of nearly $1 billion in 2036, totaling approximately $7 billion between 2027 and 2036 plus $1.5 billion in licensing fees, with additional state and local taxes, hotel occupancy and others projected to generate approximately $5.9 billion,” Greg Reimers, a member of the New York Gaming Facility Location Board, explained during that board’s Dec. 1 approval of the three projects, as Commercial Observer reported at the time. “No alternative scenarios produce comparable revenue or fiscal benefits. Each project proposes to deliver substantial community benefits, including infrastructure and transit improvements.”

As with that vote, detractors of the legal gaming facilities screamed in disapproval as today’s licenses were granted, shouting “Shame on you!” at the board members, according to Yahoo News.

But some local politicians could not have disagreed more.

“From the first blueprints to the final vote, the pocket aces that are Metropolitan Park and Resorts World have both embodied what it means to be community-centered, with each offering unparalleled neighborhood benefits packages that will strengthen our physical and societal infrastructure,” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said in a statement once the vote from the seven-member board was finalized.

[TITLE]What your cheap clothes cost the planet:
[TEXT]
This story is a partnership between Grist and The Nation.

The Atacama desert in Chile is one of the most beautiful and forbidding places on Earth, so dry that it’s sometimes used by scientists to test run Mars missions. Most years the area sees less than half a centimeter of rain, but this past September unusually heavy precipitation brought forth a desert bloom, blanketing the ground with delicate purple flowers that disappeared as quickly as they’d appeared.

It was a rare treat for locals used to grimmer ornamentation: Since 2001, colorful mountains of used clothing have been the main feature growing across the Atacama. By the time the largest mound was set on fire in 2022, it contained some 100,000 tons of discarded fabric, roughly the weight of an aircraft carrier. Today, piles like it continue to grow.

This fashion graveyard has become so large that some outlets have dubbed it the “great fashion garbage patch.” It owes its growth to the nearby duty-free port of Iquique, where Chile imports all manner of international goods without customs or taxes — including heaps of used clothing from the United States, Europe, and Asia. While the best items are resold to international markets, overwhelming volumes of cheap fast-fashion pieces don’t make the cut. Instead, they are dumped in the desert — an open secret that the government largely ignores. The burnings, whether they’re intended to destroy the evidence or make more space, fill nearby towns with smoky, unhealthy air.

Activists have been fighting against this desert dumping for years, documenting the burnings and suing both the federal and local governments to stop it. But the real blame for Chile’s mess lies beyond the country’s borders. From the moment these garments are spun from fibers to the time of their undignified disposal, they are part of a vast global pollution machine — one that has grown massively as the world economy has globalized and factories have begun pumping out ever-cheaper, ever-faster styles to customers half a world away.

This new hyper-vast, hyper-fast-fashion system is phenomenally destructive. Today, the clothing trade generates some 170 billion garments a year — roughly half of which wind up being thrown out within that year, and almost all of which despoil the world’s land, air, and seas. In the process, it generates as much as 10 percent of all planet-warming emissions, making it the second-largest industrial polluter, while also holding the distinction of being the world’s second-largest consumer and polluter of water. When all its many offenses are cataloged and counted, fashion is the third-most-polluting industry on the planet, after energy and food.

Things weren’t always this bad. While fashion has long left trails of environmental devastation in its wake — just ask the poor snowy egret, sacrificed by the thousands to decorate a generation of women’s hats — it was kept in relative check, even as globalization ramped up, by a 1974 trade agreement known as the Multi Fibre Arrangement. This agreement allowed nations to regulate the number of textile and clothing imports allowed into their countries, thereby protecting domestic production. But its expiration on January 1, 2005, essentially heralded fashion’s NAFTA moment. Low-cost goods from countries such as China and Bangladesh began flooding the United States and the European Union, which undercut domestic production in developing countries by saturating those markets with used clothing. The loosening of the century-old de minimis loophole in 2016, which allowed packages under $800 to enter the United States without tariffs, allowed Shein and Temu, the notorious Chinese e-commerce giants, to grow exponentially.

Some observers of the fashion industry have speculated that it might be on the cusp of a reckoning. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, together with Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, has sent shock waves through the industry, rattling U.S. consumers — and with them, major brands like Shein and Temu. Both have already begun to compensate for the drop in U.S. sales by redirecting their efforts toward Europe and Australia while moving their operations to other countries. Other companies, meanwhile, have simply begun offsetting their losses by trimming their sustainability efforts, raising serious fears of an even faster race to the bottom.

All of which raises the questions: How did we get into this situation? And, more important, how do we get out?

The typical fast-fashion jeans are worn only seven times before being tossed, giving the garment a carbon footprint that is more than 10 times higher per wear than traditional denim.

Step 1: A dirty, bloated underbelly

To understand how our garments got so noxious, it helps to go back to the beginning: to how our clothes become clothes in the first place. Take any item of attire — from Lululemon athleisure leggings to the summer of 2024’s viral Uniqlo baby tee; from the swankiest gowns to the most nondescript knockoff jeans — and the story is almost always the same: Most clothes start their lives deep in the ground, either as seeds of cotton or in the nearly 342 million barrels of crude oil that go into the making of synthetic fabrics every year. Most of the problems start with one of these two origin stories.

Today, synthetic fibers make up nearly 70 percent of all textile production. Polyester has become particularly ubiquitous across styles and brands, whether those brands are fast-fashion behemoths or rarefied luxury houses. Its soft, stretchy nature can mimic traditional textiles or be engineered into modern, high-performance meshes. Its low cost — just half the price of cotton in some instances — makes it an attractive option for brands and suppliers looking to snag profits while offering lower prices to customers.

But beneath its malleable folds lies a nasty business. Commercialized by the chemical giant DuPont in the mid-1900s, the process of making polyester involves superheating two petroleum-based chemicals — ethylene glycol (also used in antifreeze) and terephthalic acid (commonly used in plastic bottles) — and extruding the mixture through tiny holes to form yarn. In 2015, this process was estimated to produce as much annual carbon pollution as 180 coal-fired power plants. As the resulting polyfabrics are woven, washed, treated, and sewn into garments, they continually shed plastic microfibers.

Meanwhile, plant-based fibers like linen and cotton, which currently make up a quarter of global textile production, come with their own complications. Compared to other major crops, cotton is considered resource-intensive, earning a reputation among environmental organizations, such as the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Justice Foundation, as particularly thirsty, based on the amount of water it consumes, and dirty, based on the quantity of chemical pesticides used to grow it. The cotton fiber needed to manufacture a classic jeans-and-tee outfit requires roughly 500 gallons of irrigation water (and an additional 1,500 gallons of rainwater) to grow. And while cotton takes up a little less than 3 percent of all farmable land, its production accounts for some 5 percent of all pesticide sales and 10 percent of insecticide sales.

Other, less common fashion fabrics, such as viscose (made from the pulp of more than 100 million trees per year), come with their own environmental trade-offs — a 2023 report found that nearly a third of those trees came from old-growth or endangered forests. Over the past decade, blended fabrics that mix various types of synthetic fibers and organic ones have become increasingly common, creating an engineering headache for recycling initiatives and spreading plastic’s presence ever further.

The environmental impact of your jacket Higher impact: Quilted jackets stuffed with down — generally goose feathers — have been standard-issue for the last century. But polyester fill has begun to dominate the market, and manufacturers have relied on a toxic group of chemicals known as PFAS to waterproof the jackets. These “forever chemicals” don’t degrade naturally, and they have infiltrated drinking water, farmland, and the human body. Down carries its own baggage: It often involves plucking feathers from birds while they’re still alive. Lower impact: Brands have begun developing alternatives to PFAS in anticipation of bans that went into effect in 2025 in California and New York. Patagonia and Vaude have phased out PFAS use entirely, while Gore-Tex, Fjällräven, and Sympatex all offer PFAS-free options. Patagonia, Houdini, and Cotopaxi have also revamped their process for making synthetic fill to use recycled and plant-based materials and produce less emissions.

The environmental impact of your T-shirt Higher impact: Growing, weaving, dyeing, and manufacturing cotton into a T-shirt can require more than 700 gallons of water — enough for a single person to drink for 900 days. Cotton cultivation also requires heavy chemical use; some estimates indicate the crop accounts for roughly 16 percent of all insecticides sold worldwide. Lower impact: Hemp-jersey blends can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of a T-shirt. Hemp has low water needs, requiring as much as 90 percent less water than cotton. And because the plant sequesters a lot of CO2 as it grows, its overall carbon footprint is significantly lower than that of other fibers.

Step 2: Toxic textiles

Once the requisite materials have been grown, harvested, or extracted from DuPont’s primordial ooze, they’re turned into fabric, bleached, and dyed. This is an enormously toxic process that’s estimated to be responsible for 20 percent of water pollution worldwide. Pesticides used to grow cotton are flushed into waterways, along with bleach and the heavy metals — such as cadmium, chromium, lead, and arsenic — found in dye.

[TITLE]What Your Cheap Clothes Cost the Planet:
[TEXT]
The Atacama Desert in Chile is one of the most beautiful and forbidding places on earth, so dry that it’s sometimes used by scientists to test-run Mars missions. Most years, the area sees less than half a centimeter of rain, but this past September unusually heavy precipitation brought forth a desert bloom, blanketing the ground with delicate purple flowers that disappeared as quickly as they’d appeared.

It was a rare treat for locals used to grimmer ornamentation: Since 2001, colorful mountains of used clothing have been the main feature growing across the Atacama. By the time the largest mound was set on fire in 2022, it contained some 100,000 tons of discarded fabric, roughly the weight of an aircraft carrier. Today, piles like it continue to grow.

This fashion graveyard has become so large that some outlets have dubbed it the “great fashion garbage patch.” It owes its growth to the nearby duty-free port of Iquique, where Chile imports all manner of international goods without customs or taxes—including heaps of used clothing from the United States, Europe, and Asia. While the best items are resold to international markets, overwhelming volumes of cheap, fast-fashion pieces don’t make the cut. Instead, they are dumped in the desert—an open secret that the government largely ignores. The burnings, whether they’re intended to destroy the evidence or make more space, fill nearby towns with smoky, unhealthy air.

Activists have been fighting against this desert dumping for years, documenting the burnings and suing both the federal and local governments to stop it. But the real blame for Chile’s mess lies beyond the country’s borders. From the moment these garments are spun up from fibers to the time of their undignified disposal, they are part of a vast global pollution machine—one that has grown massively as the world economy has globalized and factories have begun pumping out ever-cheaper, ever-faster styles to customers half a world away.

This new hyper-vast, hyper-fast fashion system is phenomenally destructive. Today, the clothing trade generates some 170 billion garments a year—roughly half of which wind up being thrown out within that year, and almost all of which despoil the world’s land, air, and seas. In the process, it generates as much as 10 percent of all planet-warming emissions, making it the second-largest industrial polluter, while also holding the distinction of being the world’s second-­largest consumer and polluter of water. When all its many offenses are cataloged and counted, fashion is the third-most-polluting industry on the planet, after energy and food.

Things weren’t always this bad. While fashion has long left trails of environmental devastation in its wake—just ask the poor snowy egret, sacrificed by the thousands to decorate a generation of women’s hats—it was kept in relative check, even as globalization ramped up, by a 1974 trade agreement known as the Multi Fibre Arrangement. This agreement allowed nations to regulate the number of textile and clothing imports allowed into their countries, thereby protecting domestic production. But its expiration on January 1, 2005, essentially heralded fashion’s NAFTA moment. Low-cost goods from countries such as China and Bangladesh began flooding the United States and the European Union and undercutting domestic production in developing countries by saturating their markets with used clothing. The loosening of the century-­old de minimis loophole in 2016, which allowed packages under $800 to enter the United States without tariffs, allowed Shein and Temu, the notorious Chinese e-commerce giants, to grow exponentially.

Some observers of the fashion industry have speculated that it might be on the cusp of a reckoning. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, together with Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, has sent shock waves through the industry, rattling US consumers—and with them, major brands like Shein and Temu. Both have already begun to compensate for the drop in US sales by redirecting their efforts toward Europe and Australia while moving their operations to other countries. Other companies, meanwhile, have simply begun offsetting their losses by trimming their sustainability efforts, raising serious fears of an even faster race to the bottom.

All of which raises the question: How did we get into this situation? And, more important, how do we get out?

To understand how our garments got so noxious, it helps to go back to the beginning: to how our clothes become clothes in the first place. Take any item of attire—from Lululemon athleisure leggings to the summer of 2024’s viral Uniqlo baby tee, from the swankiest gowns to the most nondescript knockoff jeans—and the story is almost always the same: Most clothes start their lives deep in the ground, either as seeds of cotton or in the nearly 342 million barrels of crude oil that go into the making of synthetic fabrics every year. Most of the problems start with one of these two origin stories.

[TITLE]Unicorns Gallop Back on the Beauty M&A Scene in 2025:
[TEXT]
Beauty M&A activity picked up strongly in 2025, as did valuations that gained unicorn status again despite strong headwinds and market apprehension following an extremely quiet 2024.

U.S. tariffs, a weak dollar and geopolitical unrest were among the hurdles faced, but the pace of deals accelerated nonetheless. The run wound down 2025 with the biggest bang of them all: L’Oréal’s 4 billion euro deal for the Kering Beauty business, which was announced on Oct. 19 and is an industry game changer.

“The beginning of the year started with a lot of anticipation for activity, and then in some ways, it was pulled back a bit because of the tariffs and the macroeconomic headwinds,” said Marissa Lepor, managing director and head of beauty and personal care at The Sage Group.

“But the second half was pretty active from an M&A perspective, especially as there was a bit of a shakeout between the teams that could navigate the tariffs, still connect with customers and really had the margin to play around with,” she continued. “Ultimately, the macroeconomic shifts were kind of a test of brand and team, and the ones that were able to navigate it really shined even more.”

L’Oréal led the M&A charge, but many a strategic as well as other investors were acquisitive, homing in on all categories and driving up valuations to $1 billion.

The French beauty giant made a host of transactions across all segments. But the Kering deal was a game changer.

“This L’Oréal deal has completely changed the power play,” Nnenna Onuba, founder of 100 Allies and an M&A strategist, formerly of Rothschilds, told WWD Beauty Inc in early November. She voiced the sentiment of many.

“There is going to be downward pressure on all of the sector,” Onuba continued. “It’s going to flow to retailers, investors, founders — everyone’s going to feel the weight of this.”

The 4 billion euro strategic partnership between L’Oréal and Kering extends from prestige and niche fragrance, making L’Oréal the clear leader in the category, especially with the acquisition of The House of Creed, into luxury beauty and wellness.

Still, there was an acquisition involving the sector that dwarfed L’Oreal’s purchase of Kering Beauty. Kimberly-Clark Corp. revealed in November that it will acquire Kenvue Inc., owner of brands including Neutrogena, Aveeno, OGX and Tylenol, in a deal valued at $48.7 billion. That transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and was devised to create a major global health and wellness leader.

As for L’Oréal’s other acquisitions, it revealed in early December that the group would double its stake in Galderma, the pure-play dermatology leader that’s among the largest in injectables, to 20 percent, highlighting the beauty giant’s increasing focus on the burgeoning aesthetics market. Financial terms of the deal transaction were not disclosed, but the 10 percent stake is valued at

[TITLE]Why Walmart-backed Flipkart is finally moving its headquarters to India:
[TEXT]
Walmart-controlled Flipkart received a key approval to shift its domicile back to India, a prerequisite for a local listing, in a move that reflects a shift in India-US economic ties amid prolonged bilateral trade negotiations.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the re-domiciling scheme on Friday, according to an order reviewed by Mint.

The restructuring is fair and not prejudicial to the interests of shareholders or creditors, the tribunal said, while clearing India-based Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd’s intra-group amalgamation scheme involving eight Singapore-incorporated entities. The combined entity will be called Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd.

The NCLT approval for re-domiciling follows the Singapore High Court’s clearance a few weeks ago. The only remaining requirement is the Press Note 3 (PN3) security clearance, which is necessary under India's foreign direct investment (FDI) rules.

PN3 clearance is needed for overseas investments in sensitive sectors or from countries sharing a land border with India, a move largely targeted at China to curb opportunistic takeovers and acquisitions of Indian companies during the covid-19 pandemic.

Tencent, a Chinese tech company, owns around 5% of Flipkart. US retail giant Walmart Inc holds a controlling stake in Flipkart and exercises full operational and strategic control.

PN3 clearance procedural?

The Flipkart case involves “a very small (Chinese) investment, and is purely financial in nature. Typically, concerns arise only when there is a technology partnership involved, which is not the case here, or when the stake exceeds 10%. A 5% holding, that too without any control, is a no-brainer," the second person quoted earlier said.

“Press Note 3 is procedural in this case because it is a very small investment, with no operational or board role," said this person, who is involved in the process of the proposed changes to Press Note 3.

“In fact, Tencent has written to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) to clarify that the investment is purely financial in nature and carries no board representation or control," this person said.

Mint reported on 5 September that India is exploring whether a company with a small shareholding from a China-based or connected entity can be considered a ‘Chinese’ firm, as New Delhi prepares to ease curbs on investments from its neighbouring nation to counter US tariffs.

Queries emailed to the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT), Union finance and external affairs ministries, Flipkart and Tencent remained unanswered until press time.

Merger scheme

Under the approved scheme, seven Flipkart group companies that are currently incorporated in Singapore will first merge into Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd in India. After this, Flipkart Private Ltd, the main Singapore-based holding company of the group, will also merge into the Indian company, completing the shift of Flipkart’s corporate base from Singapore to India.

The tribunal noted that the restructuring is aimed at simplifying Flipkart’s holding structure, reducing multiple layers of ownership, cutting compliance and administrative costs, and improving operational efficiency by consolidating decision-making in India.

It also recorded that the merger does not involve any corporate debt restructuring and that Flipkart Internet has no secured creditors, while all equity shareholders and unsecured creditors have given their consent, allowing the tribunal to dispense with meetings.

Regulatory concerns raised by authorities, including the regional director, Income Tax Department; Reserve Bank of India, Competition Commission of India (CCI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), were examined in detail. The tribunal noted Flipkart’s undertakings on Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) compliance, settlement of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) dues, payment of statutory liabilities, preservation of records, and protection of employee interests across all merging entities.

The tribunal also recorded that the merger qualifies for an intra-group exemption under competition law and does not require prior CCI approval, though a notice was still served.

The tribunal observed that although Flipkart Internet is a loss-making entity, the Companies Act, 2013 does not bar such firms from undertaking restructuring, and the commercial rationale of the scheme falls within the domain of shareholders rather than judicial scrutiny.

Potential IPO

Shifting the holding company to India aligns governance with where business is conducted and simplifies compliance, the people quoted earlier said. It also prepares the company for a potential domestic public listing, which requires the parent entity to be incorporated in India.

“The re-domiciling is also a crucial structural prerequisite for any eventual public listing in India, as market regulators require the parent entity to be domiciled in the country," said the first of the two persons cited earlier.

An industry expert, requesting anonymity, said as Flipkart’s core operations, revenues, sellers, consumers and data are all based in India, being domiciled overseas increasingly creates regulatory complexity. “Moving the holding company to India aligns the corporate structure with the jurisdiction where business is actually conducted, making compliance with India’s e-commerce, data protection, competition and consumer laws more straightforward."

Vivek Jalan, partner at Tax Connect Advisory Services LLP, a multi-disciplinary consulting firm, said by shifting its base from Singapore to India, Flipkart “aligns its tax residence with where key management and commercial decisions are actually taken". “This allows the company to gain greater tax certainty and avoid potential disputes over residency and profit attribution, while bringing its structure in line with India’s evolving tax compliance framework."

India-US ties

Flipkart’s shift to India has been underway for more than a year, involving detailed legal restructuring and regulatory coordination in both Singapore and India.

The NCLT approval comes as India and the US are attempting to resolve legacy issues around digital taxation, e-commerce policies and investment transparency.

“The decision reinforces India’s argument that its policy and regulatory framework is becoming more predictable and investment-friendly," said Abhash Kumar, a policy expert. “Even with unresolved frictions in the India–US relationship, such moves help demonstrate that large global investors continue to see long-term value and certainty in the Indian market."

According to experts, Flipkart’s re-domiciling is a marker of maturing India–US trade and investment cooperation, occurring at a time when both countries are reassessing supply-chain dependencies and digital regulation frameworks.

For the US, it underscores how India continues to be a strategic destination for large-scale investments despite trade frictions. For India, Walmart’s continued expansion reinforces the government’s narrative that global capital remains confident about its regulatory direction.

“This move reflects a deeper convergence in India–US economic thinking, where trusted capital, supply-chain resilience and regulatory alignment are becoming central to bilateral engagement," said Amit Singh, associate professor at the Special Centre for National Security Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Re-domiciling decisions like this signal a shift from transactional investment flows to more strategic, long-term cooperation."

Step 1: A dirty, bloated underbelly

To understand how our garments got so noxious, it helps to go back to the beginning: to how our clothes become clothes in the first place. Take any item of attire — from Lululemon athleisure leggings to the summer of 2024’s viral Uniqlo baby tee; from the swankiest gowns to the most nondescript knockoff jeans — and the story is almost always the same: Most clothes start their lives deep in the ground, either as seeds of cotton or in the nearly 342 million barrels of crude oil that go into the making of synthetic fabrics every year. Most of the problems start with one of these two origin stories.

Today, synthetic fibers make up nearly 70 percent of all textile production. Polyester has become particularly ubiquitous across styles and brands, whether those brands are fast-fashion behemoths or rarefied luxury houses. Its soft, stretchy nature can mimic traditional textiles or be engineered into modern, high-performance meshes. Its low cost — just half the price of cotton in some instances — makes it an attractive option for brands and suppliers looking to snag profits while offering lower prices to customers.

But beneath its malleable folds lies a nasty business. Commercialized by the chemical giant DuPont in the mid-1900s, the process of making polyester involves superheating two petroleum-based chemicals — ethylene glycol (also used in antifreeze) and terephthalic acid (commonly used in plastic bottles) — and extruding the mixture through tiny holes to form yarn. In 2015, this process was estimated to produce as much annual carbon pollution as 180 coal-fired power plants. As the resulting polyfabrics are woven, washed, treated, and sewn into garments, they continually shed plastic microfibers.

Meanwhile, plant-based fibers like linen and cotton, which currently make up a quarter of global textile production, come with their own complications. Compared to other major crops, cotton is considered resource-intensive, earning a reputation among environmental organizations, such as the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Justice Foundation, as particularly thirsty, based on the amount of water it consumes, and dirty, based on the quantity of chemical pesticides used to grow it. The cotton fiber needed to manufacture a classic jeans-and-tee outfit requires roughly 500 gallons of irrigation water (and an additional 1,500 gallons of rainwater) to grow. And while cotton takes up a little less than 3 percent of all farmable land, its production accounts for some 5 percent of all pesticide sales and 10 percent of insecticide sales.

Other, less common fashion fabrics, such as viscose (made from the pulp of more than 100 million trees per year), come with their own environmental trade-offs — a 2023 report found that nearly a third of those trees came from old-growth or endangered forests. Over the past decade, blended fabrics that mix various types of synthetic fibers and organic ones have become increasingly common, creating an engineering headache for recycling initiatives and spreading plastic’s presence ever further.

The environmental impact of your jacket Higher impact: Quilted jackets stuffed with down — generally goose feathers — have been standard-issue for the last century. But polyester fill has begun to dominate the market, and manufacturers have relied on a toxic group of chemicals known as PFAS to waterproof the jackets. These “forever chemicals” don’t degrade naturally, and they have infiltrated drinking water, farmland, and the human body. Down carries its own baggage: It often involves plucking feathers from birds while they’re still alive. Lower impact: Brands have begun developing alternatives to PFAS in anticipation of bans that went into effect in 2025 in California and New York. Patagonia and Vaude have phased out PFAS use entirely, while Gore-Tex, Fjällräven, and Sympatex all offer PFAS-free options. Patagonia, Houdini, and Cotopaxi have also revamped their process for making synthetic fill to use recycled and plant-based materials and produce less emissions.

The environmental impact of your T-shirt Higher impact: Growing, weaving, dyeing, and manufacturing cotton into a T-shirt can require more than 700 gallons of water — enough for a single person to drink for 900 days. Cotton cultivation also requires heavy chemical use; some estimates indicate the crop accounts for roughly 16 percent of all insecticides sold worldwide. Lower impact: Hemp-jersey blends can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of a T-shirt. Hemp has low water needs, requiring as much as 90 percent less water than cotton. And because the plant sequesters a lot of CO2 as it grows, its overall carbon footprint is significantly lower than that of other fibers.

Step 2: Toxic textiles

Once the requisite materials have been grown, harvested, or extracted from DuPont’s primordial ooze, they’re turned into fabric, bleached, and dyed. This is an enormously toxic process that’s estimated to be responsible for 20 percent of water pollution worldwide. Pesticides used to grow cotton are flushed into waterways, along with bleach and the heavy metals — such as cadmium, chromium, lead, and arsenic — found in dye. The World Bank has identified at least 72 toxic chemicals involved in the standard industrial dyeing process, and once those chemicals make their way into aquifers, the knock-on effects are dire.

Dark sludge from clothing factories fills nearby lakes and streams, blocking the light needed for photosynthesis and destroying aquatic ecosystems. Even rinsing synthetic fabrics sends microplastics racing down the drain, and experts estimate that

The elimination of the de minimis exemption, together with Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, has sent shock waves through the industry, rattling US consumers—and with them, major brands like Shein and Temu. Both have already begun to compensate for the drop in US sales by redirecting their efforts toward Europe and Australia while moving their operations to other countries. Other companies, meanwhile, have simply begun offsetting their losses by trimming their sustainability efforts, raising serious fears of an even faster race to the bottom.

All of which raises the question: How did we get into this situation? And, more important, how do we get out?

To understand how our garments got so noxious, it helps to go back to the beginning: to how our clothes become clothes in the first place. Take any item of attire—from Lululemon athleisure leggings to the summer of 2024’s viral Uniqlo baby tee, from the swankiest gowns to the most nondescript knockoff jeans—and the story is almost always the same: Most clothes start their lives deep in the ground, either as seeds of cotton or in the nearly 342 million barrels of crude oil that go into the making of synthetic fabrics every year. Most of the problems start with one of these two origin stories.
