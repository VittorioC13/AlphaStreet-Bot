[TITLE]Eni Seals Billion-Dollar Fusion Energy Deal with U.S. Partner:
[TEXT]
U.S. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), which is developing fusion energy, has signed a more than $1-billion power purchase agreement with Italy’s energy major Eni as the two companies continue to partner to bring fusion power to commercial use.

Nuclear fusion has long been considered the answer to zero-emission by-product-free energy generation. However, no one has cracked the nuclear fusion code yet because of the challenges associated with the environment in which the process could take place.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems believes fusion power from its power plant in Chesterfield County, Virginia, could connect to the grid in the early 2030s.

Commonwealth, a spinout from MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is a private fusion company and has Eni as a strategic partner for the industrial development of magnetic confinement fusion.

Under the power purchase agreement (PPA) agreement announced today, Eni will buy power from CFS’s 400 MW ARC fusion power plant in Virginia, which is expected to connect to the grid in the early 2030s, Eni said on Monday.

“The agreement with Eni demonstrates the value of fusion energy on the grid. It is a big vote of confidence to have Eni, who has contributed to our execution since the beginning, buy the power we intend to make in Virginia,” said Bob Mumgaard, co-founder and CEO of CFS.

“Our fusion power attracts diverse customers across the world — from hyperscalers to traditional energy leaders — because of the promise of clean, almost limitless energy.”

The deal with Eni is the second offtake agreement CFS has signed in three months for its first grid-scale fusion power plant.

In late June, CFS signed its first commercial commitment for its future fusion plant with Google.

The tech giant, which has been an investor in CFS since 2021, signed an offtake agreement for 200 MW of clean fusion power from the Virginia plant.

Last month, CFS announced it raised $863 million in a Series B2 funding round to help the company complete its SPARC fusion demonstration machine and advance work on its first power plant in Virginia.

[TITLE]An oil and gas giant signed a $1 billion deal with Commonwealth Fusion Systems:
[TEXT]
The agreement will see Eni purchase electricity from Commonwealth’s first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. The facility is still in the planning stages but is scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.

The news comes a few weeks after Commonwealth announced a $863 million funding round, bringing its total funding raised to date to nearly $3 billion. The fusion company also announced earlier this year that Google would be its first commercial power customer for the Virginia plant.

Commonwealth, a spinout from MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is widely considered one of the leading companies in fusion power. Investment in the company represents nearly one-third of the total global investment in private fusion companies. (MIT Technology Review is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)

Eni has invested in Commonwealth since 2018 and participated in the latest fundraising round. The vast majority of the company’s business is in oil and gas, but in recent years it’s made investments in technologies like biofuels and renewables.

“A company like us—we cannot stay and wait for things to happen,” says Lorenzo Fiorillo, Eni’s director of technology, research and development, and digital.

One open question is what, exactly, Eni plans to do with this electricity. When asked

Sept. 17 (UPI) -- President Gustavo Petro said Ecopetrol should sell its stake in a Texas oil field it operates with multinational Occidental Petroleum and use the proceeds to fund clean energy projects in Colombia.

"Insisting on oil and coal is a national economic suicide because it destroys jobs. And it is literally a global collective suicide. Capital must -- and if it does not want to, it must be forced -- to leave the hydrocarbons sector, or humanity will become extinct," the president said on his X account.

Ecopetrol is Colombia's largest company and one of the leading oil and gas producers in Latin America, engaged in exploration, production, transportation, refining and marketing. The Colombian government holds
