U.S. stock futures slipped early Tuesday as investors paused after Monday’s powerful AI rally and turned attention to the federal government’s reopening talks. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.28%, S&P 500 dipped 0.18%, and Dow Jones inched 0.07% lower at 3:41 a.m. EST on November 11. The drop came after a strong session Monday, when the Nasdaq surged 2.27% for its best day since May, the S&P 500 gained 1.54%, and the Dow rose 0.81%, fueled by optimism over progress in Washington.The Senate late Monday voted 60–40 to advance a bill funding the government through January 30, 2026, signaling an end to the longest shutdown in U.S. history, with eight Democrats joining Republicans.The AI sector dominated gains Monday as Nvidia jumped 5.8%, Alphabet climbed 4%, and Microsoft rose 1.9%, ending its eight-day losing streak. Investors returned to riskier tech names after last week’s sell-off, betting on sustained AI demand despite profit-taking.Paramount Skydance soared 6.6% in after-hours trading after upbeat Q3 earnings, while BigBear.ai surged more than 15% on strong results and its Ask Sage acquisition. Quantum computing firm Rigetti fell 2% after missing revenue forecasts, showing how quickly sentiment shifts across the AI and tech space.Markets now await fresh signals from the Federal Reserve and Washington. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index is due later today, alongside remarks from Fed Governor Michael Barr.Major economic reports including CPI, PPI, and retail sales remain delayed due to the ongoing shutdown.

[TITLE]39 firms honoured in 1st Asia ESG Positive Impact Awards:
[TEXT]
PETALING JAYA: The role of the public and private sectors in ­driving sustainability took centre stage at the Asia ESG Positive Impact Awards (PIA) 2025 as 39 winners from across Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia took home a total of 52 awards in recognition of their environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts.

The awards mark the first regional accolades for the Asia ESG Positive Impact Consortium (A-EPIC), which was launched in 2024 by Star Media Group (SMG) from Malaysia, KG Media from Indonesia and the Inquirer Group of Companies from the Philippines.

The winners were awarded based on 12 different categories, which included biodiversity conservation, waste management, renewable energy, energy efficiency, supply chain management, innovative partnership and transformation, by an international panel of judges.

Social achievements and contributions were also acknowledged through the categories of diversity, equity and inclusion; relations with local communities; human rights and labour standards; ­talent management; and good health and well-being.

They had all previously won in the consortium’s local awards – ESG PIA by SMG, Lestari Awards by KG Media and ESG Edge Impact Awards by the Inquirer Group of Companies.

These companies consisted of small and medium enterprises to mid-tier, as well as large corporations and were honoured for their exceptional dedication to sustainability, championing climate ­resilience, and ethical business practices.

Guest of honour Energy Transition and Water Transfor­mation Deputy Minister Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir praised the winning companies for leading ESG efforts across the region.

“Climate change, resource scarcity and social inequality know no borders and therefore, neither can our solutions.

“Under the National Energy Transition Roadmap, we are working towards achieving 70% renewable capacity by 2050.”

“Government action alone is not enough, as we need the ­commitment of the private sector, civil society and media organisations to raise awareness, mobilise communities and drive lasting behavioural change.

“We firmly believe that regional collaboration is key to accelerating a just, equitable and ­inclusive energy transition,” he said in his speech at the awards ceremony yesterday at Sunway Resort Hotel.

He said the awards served as an important platform to elevate corporate efforts in ESG leadership while shaping public values around sustainability.

“Through these awards, we see how collaboration between Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines can foster a shared sustainability mindset across South-East Asia.

“This partnership sends a strong message that Asia is not only ready to adopt global sustainability standards, but we are ready to lead, with solutions rooted in our cultural strengths, economic priorities and community values.

“Your efforts remind us that sustainability is not a final destination, but an ongoing commitment grounded in integrity and continuous improvement,” he added.

SMG group chief executive officer Chan Seng Fatt said the awards marked a historic milestone towards making sustainability a defining force in business, society and the economy going forward.

“This is not just another award but a movement – a collective step forward for regional collaboration among media giants in our evolution beyond just reporting and becoming connectors.

“Through linking businesses, policymakers, investors and ­communities through these awards, we media giants now help to exchange knowledge and accelerate the ESG transformation.

“By celebrating these winners, we accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices across our countries and inspire more businesses to embed ESG into their strategies,” he said in his speech at the event.

Chan added that the awards also showcased the increased importance of inclusiveness ­during the ESG transition through the recognition of every organisation, whether they are large or small.

He called on all stakeholders to use the awards as a catalyst to deepen partnerships, share best practices, and scale solutions that deliver measurable impact for the good of all.

“Together, let us build a region that is responsible, resilient, and ready for the future – a region that turns purpose into progress and ambition into action,” he added.

Philippine Daily Inquirer chief operating officer Rudyard Arbolado said the awards were not just a recognition of ESG efforts but a platform for change.

“Celebrating achievement is important, but the greater value lies in showcasing what’s possible and in sharing successful models that can inspire and educate others.

“We want to show that ESG is not just a compliance exercise or a CSR checkbox. It is a core driver of value, growth, and resilience in today’s business environment,” he said at the event.

KG Media sustainability vice president Wisnu Nugroho hoped that the awards would become a rallying point for a shared ESG transformation throughout the region.

“By celebrating authentic, measurable impact, we want to inspire companies to embed ESG in their DNA, not as compliance, but as culture. Over time, this recognition should shape a generation of enterprises that drive inclusive growth, protect natural capital, and define the region’s future economy through responsibility and resilience,” he said at the event.

“Together, we can amplify the stories of progress and collaboration that make sustainability not just a Western benchmark, but an Asian movement that is rooted in empathy, inclusivity and a collective vision for the future, he added.

Sime Darby Property chief marketing and sales officer Datuk Lai Shu Wei said the awards accelerate practical ESG adoption across industries in the region through the showcase of proven frameworks.

“It reinforces that nature and development can be integrated meaningfully when supported by clear frameworks, encouraging others to translate similar ambitions into practice.

“This shifts sustainability from an intention to proven evidence, positioning long-term value creation as the future norm rather than an exception,” he said.

Also present at the event were the Philippine Ambassador to Malaysia Maria Angela A. Ponce, Indonesia Deputy Chief of Mission to Malaysia Danang Waskito, DBKL valuation and property management department deputy director Siti Maizun Arshad, SMG chairman Tan Sri Wong Foon Meng, SMG chief operating officer Lydia Wang and SMG chief content officer Datin Paduka Esther Ng.

The Asia ESG PIA was the culmination of the consortium’s year-long efforts, including the Asia ESG Summit 2025, which began on Nov 5 and ends today. It is a platform for companies to engage with thought leaders and decision-makers in shaping the region’s sustainable future.

Besides Indonesia and the Philippines, the A-EPIC’s inaugural summit also saw participation of delegates from Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Germany, Singapore, Brunei and South Africa.

Both the awards and the ­summit are organised by SMG with Sime Darby Property as the Urban Biodiversity Partner.
