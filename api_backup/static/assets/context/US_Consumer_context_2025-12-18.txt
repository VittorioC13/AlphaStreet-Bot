[TITLE]Bain Capital Real Estate, 11North Partners Close $1.6B Raise for Retail Real Estate – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners, a real estate investment firm, have secured $1.6 billion in new capital commitments for a joint venture operating platform that specializes in acquiring grocery-anchored, open-air retail centers.

The two investment firms formed the platform in April 2024 with the intention of creating a portfolio of open-air retail centers across different markets that are all supported by the shared tailwinds of population growth and income growth. The platform purchases both single assets and large portfolios of retail centers using investor capital.

The $1.6 billion capital raise is largely funded by two unnamed institutional investors, who Brian Harper, founder and managing partner of 11North, described in prepared remarks as “two of the largest and most respected investors in the world.”

“Our shared vision with Bain Capital was to build a platform that could thoughtfully invest across both core-plus and value-add opportunities,” said Harper. “This first capital raise delivers on that vision and positions us to scale with discipline.”

Altogether, by sourcing additional capital from a Bain Capital Real Estate Fund III, the open-air retail center platform managed by the joint venture has more than $2 billion of investable equity to play with going into 2026.

“[This retail platform] reflects how we invest across Bain Capital Real Estate — thematically, with advantage, and with discipline in partnership with aligned operators who bring deep domain expertise,” said Ryan Cotton, head of Bain Capital Real Estate.

Deals the joint partnership has executed in recent months include a $395 million acquisition of 10 assets across Florida and South Carolina in August 2025 and the purchase of three retail centers in Oklahoma City — Nichols Hills Plaza, The Triangle at Classen Curve and Classen Curve — for $212 million in June 2025.

Martha Kelley, managing director at Bain Capital Real Estate, said in a statement that the two firms are mutually attracted to “durable sector trends” in open-air retail, notable strong sales metrics, new consumer shopping patterns, and the rise of online omnichannel shopping, which includes buying online and picking up at a store.

“These dynamics create a supportive environment for necessity-based centers in strong, accessible locations,” said Kelley. “With the right partnership in place, we believe we are well positioned to continue assembling a best-in-class portfolio that delivers lasting value for our investors.”

[TITLE]Numerator November Consumer Price Index Reveals Prices for Everyday Goods Up 2.2% vs. 2024:
[TEXT]
CHICAGO, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Numerator, a data and technology company providing insights into consumer behavior, released its November 2025 Numerator Consumer Price Index (CPI) with an advance read on inflation trends across everyday consumer goods. According to Numerator, prices for everyday household purchases increased 0.38% in November, following a 0.03% increase in October and a 0.66% increase in September. In November, prices for everyday goods are up 2.2% versus a year ago.

Similar to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Numerator CPI tracks prices and changes in consumer purchases over time. The data cover approximately 20% of the consumption basket captured in the overall PCE price index, and closely tracks the PCE Food & Beverage index, offering a reliable signal of retail price changes experienced by U.S. consumers.

“Inflation for everyday consumer purchases appears to be stuck between 2% and 2.5% per year, above the 0.5% to 1.5% inflation we were seeing prior to the pandemic,” said Leo Feler, Chief Economist, Numerator. “These are groceries and personal care items that consumers buy most frequently. It’s not surprising that inflation and affordability remain top of mind for consumers.”

Additional key findings from Numerator’s November CPI:

Prices for everyday household goods increased 0.38% month over month in November, following a 0.03% increase in October and a 0.66% increase in September.

Prices for everyday household goods are up 2.2% year over year.

November shows the 3rd highest monthly rate of inflation since the beginning of the year.

METHODOLOGY:

Numerator’s consumer inflation measure is constructed using both base-period and current-period quantity weights to combine item prices, an approach that is consistent with the structure of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ PCE Price Index.

The index is calculated from verified, item-level transactions provided by a panel of 200,000 geographically and demographically representative U.S. households. These data include purchases across categories such as grocery, household goods, and health and beauty. The data capture changes in consumer purchasing behavior when prices change, including brand switching, downsizing, and shifts in where consumers buy.

Values are aggregated monthly to produce index levels and month-over-month and year-over-year percent changes, providing a current view of inflation trends. The dataset uses verified household purchase data from the demand side, offering visibility into consumer behavior as prices evolve.

The Numerator CPI’s year-over-year inflation measure has a 0.93 correlation with the PCE Food and Beverage index since 2019.

About Numerator:

Numerator is a data and tech company bringing speed and scale to market research. Numerator blends first-party data from over 1 million US households with advanced technology to provide 360-degree consumer understanding for the market research industry that has been slow to change. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, Numerator has 5,400 employees worldwide; 80 of the top 100 CPG brands’ manufacturers are Numerator clients.

[TITLE]Capital One Lounge DFW: Grab n Go Now On Request, Hot Food Weaker — Maintenance Cited:
[TEXT]
Has the food at the Capital One lounge at DFW decline a lot? I’ve noticed on several visits that the food isn’t as good as it was when they first opened. And across lounges I’ve seen strategies to cut back on grab ‘n go as well.

There doesn’t seem to be as much as there used to be. At the outset they had these large bags – which just served to encourage guests to fill the bags. Their most recent lounge, JFK, has staff getting guests the food items – this discourages anyone that experiences shame from asking for scores of items. My most recent visit to DFW had less than ever before. The hot items were also pretty mid.

Irregular operations meant that I had nearly a 2.5 hour connection at the Dallas A gates.

My Austin to Dallas flight was delayed, and I was going to misconnect.

So I first got backed up both on a later Austin – Dallas flight and a later connecting flight. And then I confirmed the later connection.

All that was available was a non-extra legroom middle seat in economy and I took it. Fortunately the guy next to me at the aisle got an upgrade after boarding, and nobody was brought on to replace him even though the flight was full. So I shifted over to the window and had an empty middle. That made for a perfectly fine flight, even though it’s still a tight space for working on my laptop.

In the air I checked the wait time for the Capital One lounge and it surprisingly said just ‘5-10 minutes’. So I didn’t join the wait list then. Instead, I waited until I landed and joined through the app as I walked off the aircraft – for both the American Express lounge and for the Capital One lounge (and figured if both took a long time I’d use my Royal Jordanian status for American’s Flagship lounge). I headed over to the D concourse.

Capital One came back in one minute . I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case.

. I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case. American Express took 27 minutes. I didn’t remove myself from the list because they don’t give you a wait time estimate, and I wanted to compare how long it would take (plus I considered that I might want to switch for variety’s sake0.

When I checked in at Capital One, the woman at the desk seemed a bit bored, and was terse in checking me in. In the past, large tables were reserved for larger parties, but that didn’t seem to be the case today and staff weren’t proactively seating people as I’d seen in the past.

The only open spot in the lounge was a larger table that hadn’t been cleared. I took it, but I felt badly, because I was solo and it could have accommodated a party of four. I needed to use the bathroom but there was an 8-person deep line for that, so I waited and managed to return once the line had dwindled.

What was striking, though, was the food service on this visit.

The grab ‘n go section was closed.

Grab ‘n go items replaced at least half the hot food.

Pastries were simpler.

The ice machine by the self-serve soda was gone.

A sppkesperson shared,

We are working to resolve a small temporary maintenance issue at our grab-and-go station. During this time, some of those offerings have been temporarily relocated to the hot food service area however the entire grab and go menu is available upon request. This is not our standard operating procedure, and we anticipate the station will be operational soon.

I was there for a pass by the ‘rituals cart’ which in this case was jasmine tea and a macaron cookie. It seems like the cookie might have been a bit more nicely presented than in a shrink-wrapped package? And maybe some options for teas? Still, having some personal service rather than just buffet is a really nice experience.

National airport’s ‘Landing’ which is really a complimentary sit-down restaurant remains my favorite in the Capital One portfolio. JFK is the best lounge – based on size, experiences and offerings. DFW was first, and is now four years old. Recent visits haven’t been as good as earlier ones, and like Denver it is frequently very very busy. I want to see it getting a little love.

[TITLE]Apollo Funds to Acquire Prosol Group, a Leading French Fresh Food Retailer:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced that Apollo-managed funds (the “Apollo Funds”) have agreed to acquire a majority stake in Prosol Group (“Prosol” or the “Company”), the multi-specialist in fresh food businesses and food retail in France, from Ardian. Prosol’s existing shareholders and management team will reinvest alongside the Apollo Funds.

Founded in 1992, Prosol has differentiated itself by building a proprietary, vertically integrated supply chain, sourcing fresh, quality products resulting in a highly loyal and fast-growing customer base. Prosol operates nearly 450 stores across France under two main banners: Grand Frais, where it provides the fruits, vegetables, dairy and fish; and Fresh., a fully owned chain of stores that sell fruits, vegetables, dairy, fish, and meat. By working with over 2,300 partners to source premium produce and focusing on best-in-class in-store experiences, Prosol’s retail concept has developed a leading position among customers, with Grand Frais achieving high consumer sentiment in France. Prosol’s portfolio of retail brands also includes La Boulangerie du Marché, mon-marché.fr, BioFrais, and Banco Fresco in Italy.

Alex van Hoek, Lead Partner for European Private Equity at Apollo, said, “Prosol is a clear category leader in fresh food retail, with a powerful customer proposition and outstanding sourcing model. Under the leadership of Jean-Paul, the Company has demonstrated consistent organic growth over time, providing shoppers with exceptional quality products, breadth of assortment and strong value for money. As Prosol looks to expand its estate both in France and internationally, Apollo will draw on our extensive retail expertise to support the management team’s growth plans while maintaining the distinctive identity beloved by customers.”

Jean-Paul Mochet, Chief Executive Officer at Prosol, said, “This investment marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Prosol and is testament to not only the strength of our business, but also the deep relationships we have formed with our suppliers and customers. With the support and expertise of such a strong partner in Apollo, we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term growth ambitions and bring our distinctive retail concept to more customers across Europe.”

Apollo’s private equity business has a long and successful track record of transforming businesses spanning more than 35 years, including significant experience in the retail and consumer sector. Apollo has been actively investing in France for more than two decades and today has

[TITLE]‘Dynamic pricing’ used to raise costs of everything from food and Uber rides to museum visits:
[TEXT]
If you feel like you’re being nickel-and-dimed everywhere you shop – you probably are.

Instacart has been using a shady AI algorithm that charges different prices to different customers on the same grocery items in the same stores without telling them, according to an explosive study released by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative earlier this week.

At a Target store in North Canton, Ohio, for example, the popular grocery app charged one customer $2.99 for Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter – while other Instacart users paid as much as $3.59 for the same jar picked up from the same location, the study found.

But it’s not just Instacart using cutting-edge tech to set higher prices. So-called “dynamic pricing” practices have been used by rideshares Uber and Lyft; Las Vegas convenience stores; children’s museums and zoos; and even your local grocery stores.

4 One customer at Caesars Palace noted that his wife was charged $10 for a Snickers bar and Gatorade and the next day, he was charged $14 for the same items Tam Nguyen / NYPost Design

Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and Kroger have already rolled out electronic price tags that allow workers to raise shelf prices in a matter of minutes. Walmart has said it’s planning to add the tags to thousands of stores by 2026.

Variable pricing is nothing new, but artificial intelligence has made it easier for companies of all sizes to leverage dynamic pricing – and “when something is easier to use, it becomes easy also to take advantage of,” said Pascal Yammine, CEO at Zilliant, an AI-driven pricing optimization firm.

Wendy’s faced heated backlash last year over its plans to invest $20 million in digital menu boards that could change the price of a Dave’s burger in real time – but it quickly walked back the comments, saying it “will not implement surge pricing … We didn’t use that phrase.”

While businesses have always adjusted prices to find the highest amount a customer will fork over, now artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms and massive troves of user data are allowing companies to be more exacting than ever.

“The problem isn’t that companies across multiple industries are using AI for dynamic pricing or even surge pricing,” Yammine said. “The problem is more around transparency and trust.”

Variable pricing, after all, can benefit consumers in some ways – offering discounts when they bulk-buy at Costco, allowing them to compare Amazon prices to other retailers online, and saving them money on plane tickets and vacations when they book during off-seasons, he noted.

The problem arises when data collection and algorithms are used without customers’ knowledge, experts said.

Just last month, the Justice Department settled its case against real estate tech firm RealPage, which allegedly used “completely sensitive information” to jack up rents for tenants.

Around the same time, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul made New York the first state to prohibit the use of algorithmic tools in setting rent prices.

Furious New Yorkers have blasted “slime balls” Uber and Lyft for hiking prices when subway lines are shut down during rainstorms – reportedly charging $80 for a 10-minute ride to work.

People have also reported being charged higher Uber fares when using a personal credit card instead of a corporate one. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog suggested in a report that Uber might charge more on users with low phone batteries — the idea seeming to be that customers are more likely to pay higher prices when they’re desperate — though the company denied this.

Or your best friends just got married, an occasion that merits a Christmas present to commemorate their love and top off whatever you grabbed from their registry (so what if it’s in the three figures? Love is priceless).

If any of these scenarios apply to you or you’re just itching for a worthy enough self-gift after all the curveballs 2025 threw at you, our editors, who know a thing or two

[TITLE]11 Predictions for Tech & eCom in 2026:
[TEXT]
What this post covers:

Every year, Bill D’Alessandro and I make predictions about where eCommerce is headed. Here are our 11 predictions for 2026, covering everything from AI-powered advertising to tariffs to the fate of lifestyle e-commerce brands.

My 5 predictions for 2026

Bill’s 6 predictions for 2026

Why there’s a steak dinner on the line this year

Quick note on stakes: we got called out last year for being too generous, grading ourselves on our 2025 predictions. Fair criticism. So this year, we’re feeding the transcript into Claude and Grok at the end of 2026 and letting AI declare a winner.

Loser buys the winner a steak dinner. And feeds them the first bite. (Humiliations galore).

Here’s what I’m betting on:

My Predictions

1. LLMs will launch ad platforms that make Meta’s targeting look primitive.

Meta knows your interests. ChatGPT knows you’re afraid your business partner resents you, you’ve Googled “signs of burnout” four times this month, and you’re one bad quarter away from seriously considering selling.

When OpenAI launches ads, the targeting won’t just be precise. It will feel telepathic. Early movers win big.

2. Tariffs on China will settle between 30-50%, not higher.

Inflation is creeping up and economic growth looks soft. Trump responds to markets, and when the bond market freaked out earlier this year, tariffs got walked back fast. I don’t see him shooting a wounded economy when things are already shaky.

3. The AI bubble won’t pop in 2026.

Counter to prevailing opinion here. The NASDAQ’s forward PE is around 27x right now. During the 2000 tech bubble, it was north of 100x. Government AI spending is also roughly 5x what tech spending was back in 2000, adjusted for inflation. The fundamentals look different this time.

4. Major platforms will start testing “verified human” content badges.

I created a fresh X account recently and was shocked. Roughly a third of the videos in my feed looked AI-generated. Trust is eroding fast. I think we’ll see at least one major platform experiment with certifying content as human-created this year.

5. Video and audio editing will be largely automated at 7/10 quality.

Descript can almost do this now. By year end, I think you’ll be able to drop raw footage into an AI, tell it what matters, and get a polished edit back. Scrappy founders will produce content that used to require a full production team.

Bill’s Predictions

1. 2026 will be the year of the K-shaped economy.

Big tech and the Mag 7 continue to run, maybe up another 20%+, while the real economy and average consumer struggles. For eCommerce, Bill thinks you either need to go up-market selling to affluent consumers, or go down-market with sharp pricing on essentials. The middle is dangerous.

2. Inflation will be north of 3% in 2026.

Bill sees no political will to cut spending, which means continued deficit spending, which means inflation. He thinks this is sticky for the next decade, not just 2026. His advice: position your portfolio and your business for a persistent inflationary environment.

3. AI will completely take over Meta ads content.

Bill’s seen proof of concepts from big brands running pipelines that spit out 100 novel ads per day. AI reads reviews, pulls brand assets, generates stills and soon video, and launches directly through the API. He thinks 2026 is when this goes mainstream.

4. The lifestyle brand is dead.

Unless you have strong IP protection or a top 5-10% brand, single-digit million eCommerce businesses are going to get crushed. Larger players building AI-powered machines will outspend you, out-test you, and tolerate higher CACs than you can.

5. M&A will be gang busters at the high end and anemic at the low end.

Deals above $1B are up 19% year over year. Deals in the small and mid-size range dropped 18%. Bill thinks this continues: top-tier businesses will command eye-popping multiples, while typical eCommerce brands struggle to transact at all.

6. Bitcoin will dip below $70K but finish above $100K.

Bill sees competing pressures: a struggling consumer hurts Bitcoin as a risk asset, but inflation helps Bitcoin as digital gold. He thinks volatility comes first half of the year with a dip below $70K, then recovery as the inflation narrative takes hold.

You can listen to the full episode here.

When OpenAI launches ads, the targeting won’t just be precise. It will feel telepathic.

Want a real peek into the future?

Predictions are fun, but they’re not your best bet for truly staying ahead of the curve.

What you really want is to plug into a braintrust of a thousand seven and eight-figure store owners who are discussing what’s working, what’s not, and what to expect going forward.

[TITLE]Could digital product passports transform customer experience?:

Digital product passports have the potential to revamp the customer experience by reshaping the relationship between brands, products and consumers, experts say.

These comprehensive digital records contain data on a product's sustainability footprint that can be read through a QR code or RFID tag on the product.

Today, the customer and product experiences are often separated, but DPPs force “those two worlds to merge,” said Aslan Patov, founder and CEO of Renascence Consulting.

“CX doesn’t end at the checkout — it continues into the life of the product itself,” Patov said. “It stretches CX into years, not minutes. The product itself becomes a customer service channel.”

DPPs aim to boost circularity and sustainability by providing consumers with one-click access to detailed information
