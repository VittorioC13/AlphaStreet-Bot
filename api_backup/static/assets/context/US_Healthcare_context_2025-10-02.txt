[TITLE]J.P. Morgan Doubles Down on 2 Healthcare Facility Stocks:
[TEXT]
The first JPM pick we’re looking at here is Concentra Group Holdings, the largest outpatient provider of occupational health services in the US market. The company’s services include physical exams, physical therapy, tests and screenings, and onsite workplace clinics. Concentra traces its roots to 1979, and in its current incarnation boasts a market cap of $2.65 billion, employs a network of 11,000 health professionals, physicians, clinicians, and support personnel, and its network can see more than 50,000 patients every day.

We’ve turned to the TipRanks database to see how the broader Wall Street community views them as well. Let’s dive in.

Building on this thesis, Rossi has highlighted two healthcare facility stocks he sees as well-positioned to thrive under these conditions. These companies, the analyst argues, can protect their business models while capitalizing on strong secular demand.

“The group shares favorable secular tailwinds derived from 1) an aging population in the U.S. that is increasing in aggregate acuity; 2) payer preference given cost savings potential on the lower cost of care within outpatient settings vs traditional inpatient; and 3) patient preference given ease of access. Collectively, these names also operate in fragmented industries possessing sizable market opportunities, with M&A serving as a meaningful growth lever and lower leverage allowing for greater optionality on upside opportunities,” Rossi noted.

Against this backdrop, J.P. Morgan analyst Benjamin Rossi sees the current outpatient landscape as especially favorable for healthcare facility stocks with less exposure to federal reimbursements, given both the OBBBA-driven changes to Medicaid and the continuing rate pressure in Medicare.

In fact, the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ that Trump recently signed into law contains several provisions that cut back on Medicaid spending, including stricter checks on eligibility, as well as work requirements for eligibility, along with reductions in federal Medicaid grant funding to the states. Medicaid isn’t likely to disappear, but the program is likely to see substantial changes.
