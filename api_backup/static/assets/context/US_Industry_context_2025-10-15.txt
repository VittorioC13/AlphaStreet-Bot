Dublin, Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Additive Manufacturing Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2032 - By Product, Technology, Grade, Application, End-user, Region: (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East and Africa)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global additive manufacturing market size is likely to be valued at US$ 26 Bn in 2025 and is estimated to reach US$ 132 Bn by 2032, expanding at an impressive CAGR of 26.12%

Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has revolutionized the way products are designed and manufactured across industries such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and consumer goods. As the demand for customized, lightweight, and complex components increases, the adoption of additive manufacturing technologies continues to gain momentum.

Additive Manufacturing Market - Report Scope:

Additive manufacturing involves the process of creating three-dimensional objects from digital models by layering materials such as polymers, metals, and ceramics. It is increasingly being adopted for prototyping, tooling, and production of functional parts, offering benefits like material efficiency, reduced lead times, and enhanced design flexibility. The market is seeing accelerated growth with advancements in technology, rising demand for low-volume customized production, and expansion in industrial-grade 3D printing applications.

Key Market Drivers:

The growth of the additive manufacturing market is largely driven by the increasing demand for rapid prototyping and customized manufacturing across key industries. Automotive and aerospace sectors are leveraging the technology for lightweight components, while the healthcare industry is adopting it for personalized implants and prosthetics. Cost reduction in production and reduced material waste further enhance its appeal. Additionally, technological innovations, such as multi-material printing and AI-driven design optimization, are expanding its use cases and boosting adoption globally.

Market Restraints:

Despite the promising growth, the additive manufacturing market faces a few significant challenges. High initial investment costs for industrial-grade 3D printers and related software can deter small and mid-sized enterprises. Limited availability of advanced materials and lack of standardization in printing processes also act as bottlenecks. Furthermore, concerns over intellectual property protection and limited awareness

LAUPHEIM, Germany, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With a time capsule ceremony and panel discussion on October 10th, Rentschler Biopharma SE celebrated the progress at its new buffer media station, which is currently under construction at the company’s headquarters in Laupheim. This project represents the largest single investment in the company’s history at the German site and marks an important contribution to strengthening the competitiveness of both Rentschler Biopharma and the biotechnology sector in Germany and Europe.

It symbolizes Rentschler Biopharma’s commitment to scientific and technological progress and honors the contributions of employees and partners who made this milestone possible. The time capsule bears the message “Together We Build” – a symbol of shared responsibility for the future of healthcare. In a panel discussion, members of Rentschler Biopharma’s Executive Board, together with the Managing Director of the NXTGN Startup Factory, discussed how investments and innovation are shaping future viability and competitiveness in the biotech sector. Key topics included the attractiveness of Germany as a biotech hub and the importance of partnerships in driving innovation, competitiveness, and reliability of supply.

Benedikt von Braunmühl, Chief Executive Officer of Rentschler Biopharma, commented: “At Rentschler Biopharma, we invest with foresight in infrastructure that ensures stability and sustainable growth – always keeping in mind our clients and, above all, patients worldwide.

With additional capacity for buffer and media solutions, we are laying the foundation to respond flexibly to our clients’ growing needs while ensuring patients have reliable access to therapies.”

Dr. Michael Zyder, Managing Director of NXTGN, added: “Innovation requires reliability. Especially at a time when the future of Germany as a biotech hub is widely debated, the collaboration between Rentschler Biopharma and the NXTGN Startup Factory demonstrates what truly matters: a partnership of equals that connects novel ideas from research and start-ups with industrial implementation – strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and strategic sovereignty.”
