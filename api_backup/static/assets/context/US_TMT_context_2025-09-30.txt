[TITLE]Enfabrica’s ACF-S and EMFASYS architecture could change how AI clusters process tens of thousands of chips efficiently:
[TEXT]
Nvidia’s acquisition brings Enfabrica engineers directly into its AI ecosystem

EMFASYS chassis pools up to 18TB of memory for GPU clusters

Elastic memory fabric frees HBM for time-sensitive AI tasks efficiently

Nvidia’s decision to spend more than $900 million on Enfabrica was something of a surprise, especially as it came alongside a separate $5 billion investment in Intel.

According to ServeTheHome, “Enfabrica has the coolest technology,” likely because of its unique approach to solving one of AI’s largest scaling problems: tying tens of thousands of computing chips together so they can operate as a single system without wasting resources.

This deal suggests Nvidia believes solving interconnect bottlenecks is just as critical as securing chip production capacity.

A unique approach to data fabrics

Enfabrica’s Accelerated Compute Fabric Switch (ACF-S) architecture was built with PCIe lanes on one side and high-speed networking on the other.

Its ACF-S “Millennium” device is a 3.2Tbps network chip with 128 PCIe lanes that can connect GPUs, NICs, and other devices while maintaining flexibility.

The company’s design allows data to move between ports or across the chip with minimal latency, bridging Ethernet and PCIe/CXL technologies.

For AI clusters, this means higher use and fewer idle GPUs waiting for data, which translates into better return on investment for costly hardware.

[TITLE]Kodiak Completes Business Combination with Ares Acquisition Corporation II to Accelerate Journey as a Leading AI-Powered Autonomous Vehicle Technology Company:
[TEXT]
Kodiak AI, Inc. is expected to commence trading on Nasdaq under ticker symbols “KDK” and “KDKRW” on September 25, 2025

Kodiak’s ~$2.5 billion valuation is among the largest operating company de-SPAC transactions of 2025 to date

This milestone, together with Kodiak’s track record in deploying revenue generating autonomous technology, underscores its leadership in the autonomous vehicle sector

Kodiak and Ares Acquisition Corporation II have raised over $275 million before expenses to help Kodiak accelerate its go-to-market strategy

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. and NEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kodiak AI, Inc. (“ Kodiak ” or the “ Company ”), a leading provider of AI-powered autonomous vehicle technology, today announced that Kodiak Robotics, Inc. successfully completed its business combination with Ares Acquisition Corporation II (NYSE: AACT) (“ AACT ”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company. The business combination was approved by AACT shareholders on September 23, 2025. In connection with the closing, AACT was renamed Kodiak AI, Inc. Kodiak AI, Inc.’s common stock and public warrants are expected to begin trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “ Nasdaq ”) on September 25, 2025 under the ticker symbols “KDK” and “KDKRW,” respectively.

In connection with its business combination with AACT, Kodiak received more than $212.5 million from certain institutional investors, including $145 million in PIPE funding and approximately $62.9 million in trust cash from AACT, before expenses.

“The transportation industry faces growing challenges, including safety risks, rising costs, and driver shortages,” said Don Burnette, Founder and CEO of Kodiak. “Going public with the support of our partners at AACT marks an important step in Kodiak’s journey to help transform how freight moves by providing our driverless solution to customers. The Kodiak Driver is already on the road, safely and reliably delivering freight every day for paying customers without a human in the cab. Our driverless operations show that autonomy is no longer a future promise but a reality today. Thanks to our Kodiak team members for their extraordinary dedication in helping us achieve this milestone, and I am eager to begin our next chapter as a public company with the support of our new and existing investors.”

Kodiak’s next-generation AI-powered autonomous driving system, the Kodiak Driver, is designed to help address critical challenges in the trucking industry and the public sector, including a significant labor shortage, rising costs, and demand for shorter delivery timelines. The Kodiak Driver integrates learnings from real-world experience across commercial trucking and public sector applications to continuously improve AI models and increase reliability and efficiency in a wide range of environments. With approximately 3 million on-road autonomous miles and over 3,000 paid driverless hours logged to date, the Kodiak Driver is already delivering value to customers. The Company has already achieved significant commercial milestones:

In 2024, Kodiak became the first company to announce delivery of driverless semi-trucks to a paying customer, Atlas Energy Solutions (NYSE: AESI), which in 2025 placed an initial order of 100 trucks.

Today, Atlas owns and operates a fleet of eight Kodiak Driver-powered driverless trucks, operating day and night, up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Kodiak has delivered over 7,300 loads for on-highway customers including Maersk, IKEA, J.B. Hunt, Bridgestone, C.R. England, and more.

“When we launched AACT, we set out to find a differentiated business primed for commercial growth and well-positioned to enter the public markets,” said Allyson Satin, Chief Operating Officer of AACT and Partner at Ares Management Corporation (“ Ares ”). “Kodiak has distinguished itself through its innovative technology, which is already integrated into customer fleets and utilized for daily, revenue-generating driverless freight operations. We are confident in Don and his team as they continue to execute on their strategy to scale as a public company, improve the safety and efficiency of the freight industry and create long-term value for investors. On behalf of AACT and Ares, I want to congratulate the entire Kodiak organization, and we look forward to our continued partnership.”

By accessing the public markets through its combination with AACT, the Company is well-positioned to scale its commercialization of the Kodiak Driver. The Company is leveraging both public capital and strategic investor alignment to capture a share of the estimated $4+ trillion global freight market. Kodiak has partnered with Roush Industries, Inc., a leading vehicle upfitter, to scale its production of autonomous trucks equipped with the Kodiak Driver. Roush delivered its first Kodiak Driver-powered truck in August 2025.

The Kodiak Driver combines advanced AI-powered software with a modular hardware system designed to integrate seamlessly into customers’ existing fleets. The platform delivers scalable, safe, and efficient autonomous trucking by leveraging learnings from millions of real-world miles across every Kodiak Driver-powered vehicle, ensuring that advancements made by one truck benefit the entire fleet. Kodiak offers its technology through a Driver-as-a-Service model, in which customers pay a per-mile or per-vehicle licensing fee to access driverless operations and ongoing support.

Investor Celebration and Bell-Ringing Ceremony

To celebrate its expected public market debut on September 25, 2025, Kodiak will display a Kodiak Driver-powered truck in Times Square, and ring the Nasdaq opening bell at 9:30 a.m. ET. Executives, board members, and key investors will gather to mark this milestone. The ceremony can be streamed live and replayed on the Nasdaq website at https://www.nasdaq.com/marketsite/bell-ringing-ceremony .

[TITLE]Exclusive: AI software testing startup Synthesized receives $20 million Series A venture round:
[TEXT]
Synthesized, a London- and New York-based startup that uses artificial intelligence to automate software testing, has raised $20 million in new venture capital funding, as demand for quality assurance tools surges across the tech industry.

The Series A funding round was led by Redalpine Venture Partners, with participation from IQ Capital, Mercia Ventures, UBS and Seedcamp. Deutsche Bank, which previously invested in the company and is also a customer of Synthesized, invested in the new funding round as well.

The company did not disclose its valuation following the funding round.

Synthesized hopes to take advantage of a surging demand for software quality assurance, its founder and CEO Nicolai Baldin told Fortune. With the increasing popularity of “vibe coding”—using AI to write computer software simply from a description of what the software should do–as well as AI-powered coding assistants that provide suggestions to human coders, testing the resulting code to ensure that it works well and doesn’t introduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities is more important than ever.

“We are making sure we really identify those things which are going to break your app, at the data level, on the environment level, and help you expose those breakage points,” Baldin said. “This is absolutely critical because those traditional [testing] coordinators, they don’t do that.”

The need for this kind of testing is growing rapidly. Spending on automated software evaluation tools is expected to reach $10.6 billion by 2033, up from $1.9 billion in 2023, according to a market research report from Market.us.

“Synthesized is tackling one of the most urgent and overlooked challenges in the age of AI: how to test, validate, and trust what we build,” Daniel Graf, General Partner at Redalpine, said in a statement. “Their platform doesn’t just generate high-quality test data—it lays the foundation for a new class of autonomous QA agents that will transform how modern software is verified and shipped.”

Baldin founded Synthesized in 2020 after completing a PhD. in machine learning and statistics from the University of Cambridge. Initially, the company focused on automated testing of machine learning algorithms to find the edge cases on which these AI models would fail. The company also developed tools for assessing the bias in machine learning models. But the company has now moved into the testing of traditional kinds of rule-based software too.

Baldin said the company has focused on what he calls the most complex parts of the testing process, which he said was creating realistic data and environments for assessing enterprise software.

Surveys of developers have consistently found that waiting for quality assurance testing leads to significant bottlenecks in software development. A 2023 study by consulting firm CapGemini’s technology services arm Sogeti found that 80% of software delays are the result of delays in setting up and running assurance tests, while a 2022 Forrester Research report found that 40% of quality assurance budgets are lost to manual test data management.

Synthesized is able to speed these processes up significantly. The company says that by using its software Deutsche Bank has cut in half the time it takes to find test data for its software evaluations and that other customers have seen their QA costs reduced by 40%.

The startup’s testing software works on a customer’s own cloud or on-premesis servers, reducing security and data privacy concerns. “You don’t need to transfer code to us,” Baldin said.

Synthesized is hardly the only company trying to apply AI methods to software testing. The space is increasingly crowded, with other startups such as TestFort, QASolve, Ranger, Quash, Zencoder, and a clutch of other new entrants competing for marketshare against traditional software testing services from the likes of IBM, Micro Focus (now part of Open Text), and Perforce Software.

Baldin says that Synthesized will use the new funding to double the size of its expansion across North America and Europe, with plans to double its 35-person team over the next year. The company currently operates offices in London and New York, with virtual operations in Japan.

[TITLE]Sprinklr adds AI agents for marketing, CCaaS, more:
[TEXT]
Sprinklr released several agentic AI tools and copilots and previewed others designed to automate marketing, customer service and customer feedback -- and to bridge marketing and service processes.

Available now are Sprinklr AI Agents, a low-code agent builder platform; Sprinklr Copilot, an agent-assist tool for customer service that offers contextual help during calls and summarizations afterward; and AI Customer Feedback Management, analysis tools for solicited survey feedback and unsolicited customer input on channels such as social media.

Telephony for its contact center-as-a-service (CCaaS) platform, which the company said is already being used by customers in more than 100 countries and is handling more than 2 million calls a day, is planned for November release.

In January, Sprinklr plans to release workforce management tools that can orchestrate collaboration between human and AI agents. The company is also developing agent customizations for 18 vertical industries, including banking, retail and telecommunications. Sprinklr plans to roll out the first five this week, and the rest are scheduled for release through next January.

Customer service teams have adopted generative and agentic AI faster than other facets of CX because they were ready for the technology, said Abhishek Priyam, vice president of product management at Sprinklr. Not only had service teams adopted rules-based chatbots before the rise of generative AI, but they also had hardened metrics to measure contact center performance and could demonstrate strengths and where improvements were needed.

"A lot of agentic workflows were built very early just by replacing NLP [natural language processing] with generative AI; that acted as a foundation for speeding up customer support adoption," Priyam said. "That particular business function was already ahead -- and people started to double down on [AI]."

Sprinklr launched in 2009 as a social media management platform but has since expanded more deeply into CX by adding marketing workflows, email support, live chat, conversational commerce and CCaaS. When the company released its CCaaS in 2022, it quickly followed with a 40,000-agent contact center deal with Deutsche Telekom. That set in motion a series of events that ultimately led to a new CEO and the retooling of its product line.

Sprinklr's no-code agent design environment includes vertical industry customizations.

[TITLE]Private Real Estate Capital Favors Big Four Asset Classes Over Alternatives: Report – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
It seems old money enjoys safe bets.

A new report from NAREIT documenting 10 years of investment trends found that private real estate owners are far more likely to park their capital in four traditional asset classes — office, industrial, apartments and retail — compared to active managers, who prefer alternatives like data centers, hospitals and senior housing.

The national real estate investment trust trade group tracked an index of National Council of Real Estate Investment Funds (NCREIF) Open End Diversified Core Equity funds — also known as ODCE funds — which is effectively a benchmark of privately managed real estate funds that holds a value of $272 billion.

Nareit found that, between 2015 and 2025, private real estate funds allocated 90 percent of their capital into the big four asset classes (office, retail, industrial and multifamily), while active managers of public markets, notably REITs, allocated only 31 percent of capital into those same asset classes.

“The shares of the index and active managers are similar for each property sector, but ODCE’s allocations are substantially different,” wrote Nicole Funari, vice president of research at Nareit. “While ODCE’s largest allocation is industrial at a 35 percent share, the index’s largest allocation is retail at 15 percent, and for active managers it is telecommunications at 17 percent.”

The private funds tracked by ODCE work like this: On one hand, this index tracks private real estate bought and sold and invested in, like another type of investment sale, but it also examines the funds created by private owners and investors who aim to buy and sell real estate by sourcing private capital. Unlike public REITs, which source capital on the open market and issue dividends for the benefit of shareholders, these private funds merely source capital to fuel investment activity for their own benefit.

No asset class has seen its share of capital allocations decline in the private fund world as much as the office sector.

Back in 2015, the ODCE index invested 40 percent of its capital into office, while active managers allocated only 17 percent of investment capital into that space (the FTSE Nareit index — effectively an S&P 500 for the REIT public industry — marked office investment at 10 percent ratio to total market share).

But from 2015 to 2025, private ODCE funds reduced their exposure to office by more than 50 percent (dropping from 40 percent share to 17 percent). At this same time, active managers reduced their exposure by dropping their office investment ratio more than 80 percent, according to Nareit.

“Private real estate has continued to keep allocations to office relatively high while decreasing allocations to retail, in sharp contrast to listed real estate which has seen large decreases in office and varied allocations to retail with the market,” wrote Funari.

Today, ODCE’s largest allocation is in the industrial sector, which holds a 35 percent share of investment capital, compared to active managers, which only invest 9 percent of capital in industrial, but 11 percent into retail and 69 percent into alternatives. These alternatives that active managers favor include hospitals, telecommunications towers, data centers, self storage, single family homes, and manufactured homes, among several others.

OSCE funds allocate only 10 percent of capital into alternatives, with self storage being the most favored asset class among the different alternative sectors.

Moreover, private funds have seemed to favor industrial and apartments over the last 10 years.

Between 2015 and 2025, ODCE’s exposure to industrial property investment nearly tripled from 13 percent to 35 percent, while multifamily saw its share in ODCE funds rise from 25 percent to 28 percent. Retail had the opposed trend: ODCE investment share into retail fell from nearly 20 percent in 2015 to 10 percent a decade later.

Compare this to active managers, whose retail investment shares rose from 8 percent in the frist quarter of 2021 to 11 percent by 2025.

“Even accounting for liquidity differences, private real estate appears to be following a different investment strategy from listed real estate active managers,” wrote Funari.

[TITLE]How US Tariffs Are Changing The Playbook For Canadian Advertisers:
[TEXT]
Since the Trump administration first threatened a 25% increase in import tariffs on Canadian goods in February, The Great White North’s sentiment toward its southern neighbor has been decidedly less neighborly.

Thanks to a combination of consumer-led boycotts and government-imposed counter-tariffs, products like Florida orange juices and Kentucky bourbons (as well as other US-made liquors) have all disappeared from Canadian shelves.

Tourism from Canada to the United States is similarly down. Although it’s estimated that two-thirds of Canadians live within 100 kilometers (that’s 62 miles, for those of us still stuck with the imperial system) of the border, car trips to the US have sharply declined for eight consecutive months and were down 34% in August 2025 compared to the same month last year.

And yes, even Canada’s media consumption habits are starting to change. Viewership is reportedly up 34% on Gem, CBC’s ad-supported streaming service, and especially on Canadian-produced programs like “Schitt’s Creek” and “Murdoch Mysteries.”

But how deeply has this phenomenon extended into the larger Canadian advertising market? It depends on who you ask.

Dollars do seem to be shifting, according to the Canadian (and mostly Toronto-based) sources that AdExchanger spoke with. Some brands are pulling back on ad spend, while others are updating their media mixes to invest more in local publishers.

So far, these shifts don’t seem all that different from how US advertisers have behaved in the wake of so much economic uncertainty. Part of that is because even though Canadian and US markets contrast in a lot of ways, both still use the same tech infrastructure to reach consumers.

On the creative side, it’s a different story. Advertisers have started leaning into national pride messaging as a positive way to reframe everyday Canadians’ frustrations – including Maple Leaf Foods’ “Look For The Leaf” takeover and Prime Minister Mark Carney’s hockey-inspired “Elbows Up” ads.

What’s the difference?

Before we really dig in, however, some education on how both markets differ might be in order.

There are, of course, the obvious factors that size and geographic location play. Canada’s population (37 million) is roughly one-tenth the size of the US (331 million) and much more spread out in terms of population density, making geotargeting a much trickier prospect up north.

Some of Canada’s postal zones are “so huge” that a brand could end up wasting all its impressions in an area without any nearby store locations, said Luke Moore, VP and managing director of media at Toronto-based agency Fuse Create.

On top of that, getting access to accurate consumer data in the first place can pose a challenge. Unlike the US, Canada has not one but two major federal privacy laws on its books: 1983’s Privacy Act, which regulates government data collection, and 2000’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which handles private sector organizations.

Which is not to say that using Canadian consumer data is impossible, just that it requires a different approach and often cannot be done with the same level of granularity as would be possible in the US. Samsung Ads Canada, for example, uses its own proprietary ACR data and partnerships with Canadian data providers (such as Environics Analytics) to better understand the households in their market, said Country Manager Dave Pauk.

Speaking of which, the overall media landscape in Canada is much more tightly regulated than that of the US, too. Canada spends over $1.7 billion a year in journalism and media subsidies, and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) mandates that Canadian publishers are required to air a certain percentage of Canadian-made content, sometimes called “cancon.” (And no, foreign broadcasters are not exempt; in 2024, the CRTC also ruled that non-Canadian streaming services must contribute a percentage of their Canadian revenue to government media funds, too.)

Can’t quit you

Due to of all these factors – size and data availability chief among them – a lot of brands with Canadian origins end up making heavy investments in the US market as a way to increase scale and achieve better ROI.
