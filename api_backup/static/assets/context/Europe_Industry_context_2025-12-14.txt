[TITLE]The Maker of the $20K Neo Robot Has a Deal for 10,000 of Its Humanoids:
[TEXT]
Robot maker 1X made a splash back in October when it opened preorders for its Neo humanoid robot for home use, not least because of its $20,000 price tag. Now it's making another splash with a deal for up to 10,000 of its humanoids to be deployed over the next five years.

Private equity firm EQT says it will facilitate getting thousands of 1X Neo humanoids into its portfolio companies to work with humans in areas such as manufacturing, facility operations and health care. The company confirmed in an email to CNET that the 10,000 robots will be Neo models using the same AI as the robots it's selling to the public.

[TITLE]Bombardier to Provide Six Multi-role Aircraft to Support the Royal Canadian Air Force:
[TEXT]
Government of Canada selects made-in-Canada jets to enhance its multi-mission air transport capability including aeromedical evacuations, disaster relief, humanitarian aid and national security operations

Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft are assembled in the Greater Toronto Area, and completed in Greater Montreal. This aircraft leverages Canada’s world-class aerospace supply chain

Decision to purchase Bombardier aircraft underscores Canada’s strategic and sovereign capabilities in aerospace and defence

MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bombardier is proud to announce the Government of Canada has purchased six Global 6500 aircraft to perform worldwide utility flights and support missions such as aeromedical evacuations, disaster relief, humanitarian aid and national security operations. Representatives from Bombardier and the federal government celebrated this agreement today at Bombardier’s Global Aircraft Assembly Centre in the Greater Toronto Area, where the Global 6500 aircraft is assembled. Interior completion work on these aircraft will be performed in Greater Montreal.

This order is valued for Bombardier at approximately $400 million U.S., based on the current list price for the Global 6500 aircraft and the cost of military modifications.

The Royal Canadian Air Force, which has operated Bombardier Challenger aircraft since 1983, will benefit from the increased range and capability of the Global 6500 aircraft. Delivery of the first aircraft is expected by summer 2027.

“The Global 6500 aircraft is a world-class, made-in-Canada product with the versatility to perform multiple missions, making it the go-to solution for governments around the world,” said Éric Martel, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bombardier. “Today, the more than 12,000 Canadians who work at Bombardier can take great pride in knowing that this aircraft will now serve their country.”

Friday’s event was attended by the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement. “The award of this contract to purchase the Global 6500 under the Defence Investment Agency is a turning point in how Canada equips its military,” Minister Fuhr said. “By streamlining processes and cutting red tape, the Defence Investment Agency is accelerating the delivery of the versatile capabilities the Royal Canadian Air Force needs. Canada has a world-class aerospace industry, and this investment will harness that strength to create good-paying jobs, drive innovation, and bolster our security.”

Also in attendance were the Honourable Rechie Valdez, Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Member of Parliament for Mississauga-Streetsville, as well as provincial officials and representatives from the Department of National Defence and the Royal Canadian Air Force.

The Bombardier Global 5500 and Global 6500 aircraft, as well as the Global 8000* aircraft, which recently entered service as the world’s fastest business jet, are manufactured at Bombardier’s state-of-the-art Global Aircraft Assembly Centre. This facility, inaugurated in 2024, represents an investment of over $670 million CAD from Bombardier, employs more than 2,000 highly skilled workers, and is a jewel of advanced, high-precision aircraft manufacturing.

Bombardier is proud to draw upon Canada’s world class aerospace supply chain. The Global 6500 aircraft benefits from the contribution of more than 60 Canadian suppliers. A PwC report commissioned by Bombardier calculated that the total economic footprint (direct, indirect, and induced impacts) supported in Canada from Bombardier’s Global 6500 manufacturing activities in 2022 was $518.3 million in GDP, 3,747 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs, and $309.1 million in labour income.

Bombardier has published an Environment Product Declaration for the Global 6500 aircraft, which is a detailed communication of the environmental performance and footprint of the aircraft from a full life-cycle perspective.** Thousands of parts of the aircraft have been analyzed for their environmental impact, offering transparency and benchmarks from which improvements can be made.

Bombardier business jets are recognized around the world for their performance and reliability, and are ideal for defense missions including Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C), border and maritime patrol, multi-role, head of state transport, medevac, urgent humanitarian assistance and more. The Global 6500 aircraft in particular is the go-to choice for governments around the world looking to modernize their airborne defense capabilities.

Bombardier is known for its flexible, collaborative approach, building long-term relationships with governments and militaries, and joining forces with the world’s most advanced mission system providers to provide proven, reliable and advanced defence solutions.

[TITLE]ECB to simplify bank capital rules but stick to buffer requirements:
[TEXT]

The European Central Bank (ECB) outlined plans to simplify bank regulation and capital rules on Thursday, but is sticking to its pledge not to ease overall capital reserve requirements.

The authority said the capital proposals are focused on having fewer – rather than lower – types of capital buffers lenders must hold to protect their balance sheets against shock losses.

Irish woman Sharon Donnery, a member of the ECB banking supervisory board, was a key member of the taskforce set up earlier this year to ease the burden of banking supervision following more than a decade of tighter rules in the wake of the global financial crisis, which resulted in taxpayer-funded bailouts of European banks.

In a statement, the ECB said its aim was to “simplify the framework” without endangering the “resilience of the European banking system”.

The ECB’s top decision-making body, its governing council, backed the recommendations. They will now be sent to the European Commission for consideration as part of a wider push by Brussels to streamline policies and laws to make the European Union more competitive.*

The taskforce concluded that the bloc’s current capital rules are overly complex and risk backfiring as investors may not understand them. European banks are at present subject to a number of individual capital buffers, four of which the ECB wants to merge into two.

“The variety of capital elements in place in the EU may decrease transparency and increase uncertainty as market participants face more challenges in assessing the capital framework,” the report said.

It suggested combining several individual capital surcharges that the ECB at present applies to banks based on their individual risk profile.

The report did not explicitly state whether the combined amount of capital that banks would be required to hold would stay the same, but it said lenders should “sustain current levels of resilience” to absorb losses in a crisis.

The ECB also proposed exempting more small lenders from the international Basel standards, which are designed for large, risky lenders with cross-border business.

At present, all banks with more than €5 billion in assets need to meet those rules, which the taskforce said created “undue complexity” and costs for lenders that were too small to have repercussions on financial stability.

The ECB suggested raising the threshold and adding more exemptions for smaller banks.

Still, the three domestic Irish lenders, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB will remain subject to standards set for larger banks.

The European Banking Federation welcomed the ECB’s report but said “concrete ‌and determined steps must now follow to enhance the global competitiveness of the EU’s financial sector”. – Additional reporting: Reuters, Financial Times

*Sentence corrected to read that the recommendations will now - rather than not - be sent to Brussels

Banks in the Asia-Pacific region, including those in India, have built stronger capital positions compared to their counterparts in the United States and Western Europe, Moody's highlighted in its latest survey report.The survey pointed out that a comparison of the largest banks in Asia-Pacific systems with peers in the US and Western Europe shows they generally have built strong capital positions under prudent regulatory supervision.Further, it noted that large Asia-Pacific banks' risk-weighted asset (RWA) densities reflect their underlying asset risks, consistent with their credit losses for the past 10 years. It also added that the banks' RWA densities vary across the Asia-Pacific.Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) represent a bank's assets adjusted for risk levels, meaning loans or investments considered riskier are assigned higher weights. A bank with higher RWA density indicates that a larger part of its assets carries higher risk.Explaining the capital strength, Moody's highlighted, "Large private sector banks in India have high CET1 capital adequacy and leverage ratios because their internal capital generation has outpaced their RWA growth in the past couple of years, and they can raise equity easily from capital markets when needed."CET1, or Common Equity Tier 1 capital, refers to a bank's core capital, primarily common shares and retained earnings, which serves as the first line of financial protection against losses. A higher CET1 ratio indicates a stronger ability to absorb shocks without affecting depositors.The report mentioned that as of the end of 2024, the average reported CET1 capital adequacy ratios of the large banks in Hong Kong, India, Korea in the sample stood at 18.0 per cent, 14.7 per cent, and 14.5 per cent, respectively, all above 13.5 per cent for the four largest banks in the US and 13.8 per cent for the top six banks in Western Europe.According to the survey, these banks can also raise equity easily from the capital markets when required. However, it stated that their government-owned peers remain weaker than private banks in both metrics.The report attributed the higher RWA densities in India, Vietnam and among certain Chinese banks to the use of the standardized approach, a regulatory method that assigns fixed risk weights rather than relying on banks' internal risk assessment models.It added that regulators in India have announced plans allowing banks to transition to the more advanced IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) approach by 2028, a move expected to lower RWA densities if successfully implemented.For India, the sample included State Bank of India ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank , together accounting for approximately 50 per cent of system assets.Overall, the report assessed a total of 35 banks across eight key Asia-Pacific banking systems, representing 75 per cent of total assets of all rated banks in these markets.

[TITLE]Grande Group Limited Announces Financial Results for the First Half of Fiscal Year 2026:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GRANDE GROUP LIMITED (“GRAN” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: GRAN), a Hong Kong-based financial services provider which principally engages in the provision of corporate finance advisory services and IPO sponsor services through its Hong Kong subsidiary, Grande Capital Limited, today announced its unaudited financial results for the six months ended September 30, 2025 (“First Half 2026”).

First Half of Fiscal Year 2026 Financial Results

For the Six Months Ended

September 30, Selected Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income Data 2025

USD 2024

USD Change

% Revenue 293,929 1,750,043 (83.2 ) Cost of revenue 336,543 499,092 (32.6 ) General and administrative expenses 1,158,751 716,183 61.8 Unrealized loss on equity security 370,666 — N/A Provision for income taxes — 97,248 (100.0 ) Net (loss) income (1,481,318 ) 442,832 (434.5 ) (Loss) income per share - basic and diluted (0.06 ) 0.04 (250.0 )

Revenues

Revenues decreased by 83.2% from $1,750,043 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 to $293,929 for the six months ended September 30, 2025. The decrease was primarily due to decrease in our initial public offering (“IPO”) sponsorship services, referral services, general advisory services, independent financial advisory services and compliance advisory services.

● Revenues from IPO sponsorship services was $52,083 in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $234,686 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to fewer milestone achievements in the First half 2026 for a continuing IPO engagement with the same client, as revenue from such services is recognized only upon the completion of specific listing-related milestones. ● Revenues from referral services was $nil in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $568,978 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the Company had no referral arrangement requiring the introduction of other professional parties in which we may obtain referral fees. Such referral fee is generally based on a percentage of the fee charged by our clients in the particular fund-raising exercises. ● Revenues from general advisory services, independent financial advisory services and compliance advisory services were $241,846 in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $892,597 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a lower number of advisory engagements and slower progress in ongoing projects, which resulted in fewer achievement of milestones and recognized as revenue during the First Half 2026.

Cost of revenue

Our cost of revenue decreased by $162,549, or 32.57%, from $499,092 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 to $336,543 for the six months ended September 30, 2025. This decrease was mainly attributable to decrease in staff costs and project related costs. The decrease in staff costs in First Half 2026 was due to a reduction in the number of staff, with a headcount of 18 as of September 30, 2025, compared to 20 as of September 30, 2024.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses were approximately 394.2% and 40.9% of total revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2025 and the six months ended September 30, 2024 respectively. General and administrative expenses are mainly management and office salaries and employee benefits, depreciation of office equipment and leasehold improvement, operating lease cost, transportation and entertainment and other office expenses. The general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.4 million or 61.8% from $0.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 to $1.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2025, mainly due to discretionary one-time bonuses payable to employees in administrative functions and higher traveling and entertainment expenses for client acquisition purposes.

Unrealized loss on equity security

During the six months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized an unrealized loss on equity security of $370,666 (2024: nil). This loss stems from its beneficial ownership in a publicly-traded company via an external investment arrangement, measured at fair value using quoted market prices.

Provision for income taxes

Our income tax expense changed from $97,248 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 to $nil for the six months ended September 30, 2025. Such change was attributable to the shift from net profit before provision for income taxes in the 2024 period to a net loss before provision for income taxes in the 2025 period, resulting in no current tax obligation for the interim period.

Net loss

Our net loss was $1,481,318 for the six months ended September 30, 2025, a marked shift from net income of $442,832 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Such change was the result of the combination of a substantial 83.20% decline in revenue, a $370,666 unrealized loss on equity securities, a 61.80% increase in general and administrative expenses, and a partial offset from a 32.57% reduction in cost of revenue.

Cash Flow

The table below sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:

For the Six Months

Ended September 30, 2025 2024 USD USD Net cash provided by operating activities 264,397 331,322 Net cash used in investing activities (550,000 ) — Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 9,696,399 (1,010,715 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 9,410,796 (679,393 )

Net cash provided by operating activities was $264,397 in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $331,322 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was mainly due to the swing from net income to net loss in the First Half 2026, partially offset by non-cash items including the $370,666 unrealized loss on equity security, depreciation, and operating lease right-of-use asset amortization. Changes in operating assets and liabilities also had a negative impact on operating activities for the First Half 2026. These impacts include favorable cash inflows attributable to movements in accounts receivable and contract assets, partially offset by cash outflows associated with accrued expenses, lease liabilities and income tax payable.

Net cash used in investing activities was $500,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to no cash outflow from investing activities in the 2024 comparable period. This change was entirely attributable to the Company’s $500,000 investment in equity security during the First Half 2026.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $9,696,399 for the six months ended September 30, 2025, a substantial reversal from net cash used in financing activities of $1,010,715 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. This dramatic shift was primarily driven by the $9,778,464 in net proceeds from the Company’s IPO and a $314,101 contribution from a non-controlling shareholder of a subsidiary during the First Half 2026, neither of which had a corresponding amount in 2024. These significant cash inflows were partially offset by $396,181 in payments of offering costs related to the IPO.

Recent Events

Initial Public Offering

On July 2, 2025, the Company closed its initial public offering of 1,875,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares), priced at $5.00 per share.

[TITLE]Mexico’s aerospace sector is growing. Will it be undercut in USMCA review?:
[TEXT]
A North America trade deal helped Mexico get into aeroplane manufacturing. Now that is under threat with Trump.

Monterrey, Mexico – In April, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the country’s aerospace industry could see sustained annual growth of as much as 15 percent over the next four years, and attributed the sector’s expansion to a robust local manufacturing workforce, increasing exports, and a strong presence of foreign companies.

But with the review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) coming up – the free-trade treaty between the three countries that helped Mexico’s aerospace sector to grow and flourish – the industry’s future is no longer certain.

Stakeholders warn that ensuring investment stability and strengthening labour standards are essential to protecting the sector’s North American supply chain.

Mexico is striving to become one of the top 10 countries in aerospace production value, a goal outlined in Plan Mexico, the country’s strategic initiative to enhance global competitiveness in key sectors.

As the sixth-largest supplier of aerospace parts to the US, the industry has benefited significantly from the USMCA, which fostered regional supply chain integration, said Monica Lugo, director of institutional relations at the consulting firm PRODENSA.

However, the integration is no guarantee of business continuing to grow as the country is at an “unprecedented moment” with US President Donald Trump and his wide-ranging tariff policies.

Lugo, a former USMCA negotiator, said that recent tariffs on materials like steel and aluminium — critical to the aerospace sector— have eroded trust in the US as a reliable partner. She predicts that if current conditions continue, the sector risks losing capital, investments and jobs.

“Having this great uncertainty – one day it’s on, the next it’s off, who knows tomorrow – and based on no specific criteria, but rather on the president’s mood, creates chaos and severely damages the country and the economy,” she said.

On December 4, Trump suggested the US might let the USMCA expire next year, or negotiate a new deal. This follows comments by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to US news outlet Politico that the administration is considering separate deals with Canada and Mexico.

A booming aerospace sector

The Mexican aerospace market is valued at $11.2bn, and is expected to more than double to $22.7bn by 2029, Sheinbaum said, citing data from the Mexican Aerospace Industry Federation (FEMIA). Home to global companies like Bombardier, Safran, Airbus, and Honeywell, Mexico has established itself as a key player in the global aerospace market and is now the world’s twelfth-largest exporter of aerospace components.

Marco Antonio Del Prete, secretary of sustainable development in Queretaro, attributes this success in part to heavy investment in education and training. In 2005, the Queretaro government promised Canada’s Bombardier that it would invest in education and set up the Aeronautical University, which now offers programmes ranging from technical diplomas to master’s degrees in aerospace manufacturing and engineering.

“Since Bombardier’s arrival, an educational and training system was created that allows us to develop talent in a very efficient way, let’s say, fast track,” Del Prete told Al Jazeera.

Bombardier has served as an anchor, propelling Queretaro’s rise as a high-skilled manufacturing hub for parts and components.

While the Bombardier plant in Queretaro originally focused on wiring harnesses, it has evolved to specialise in complex aerostructures, including the rear fuselage for the Global 7500, Bombardier’s ultra-long-range business jet, and key components for the Challenger 3500, the mid-sized business jet.

Marco Antonio Carrillo, a research professor at the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ), pointed out that the area’s wide educational offerings have cultivated a powerful workforce, which has gained significant attention from aeroplane makers, mainly from the US, Canada and France.

“This development [of Queretaro] has been, if you look at it in terms of time, truly explosive,” Carrillo said.

Mexico also aims to join France and the US as the third country capable of fully assembling an engine for Safran.

But the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Union, which represents more than 600,000 workers in Canada and the US, is worried that progress could lead to more advanced manufacturing and assembly work to eventually shift to Mexico, given the local investment in aeronautical universities and training.

“Right now they’re [Mexican workers] doing more entry-level type things, but our concern is that later on, larger pieces of the aerospace operation will go to Mexico,” Peter Greenberg, the IAM’s international affairs director, told Al Jazeera.

High-skilled, low-cost workforce

Of the three countries in the USMCA agreement, Mexico’s biggest attraction has been its low-cost manufacturing.

Edgar Buendia and Mario Duran Bustamante, economics professors at the Rosario Castellanos National University, cite Mexico’s low labour costs and geographical proximity to the US as the country’s key advantages. This is partly why the US has intensified pressure on the Mexican government, including during the initial USMCA negotiations in 2017, to raise wages to level the playing field and reduce unfair competition.

“Most US companies have incentives to move their production here in Mexico, given the [low] wages and the geographic location. So, to prevent that from happening, the United States is pressuring Mexico to raise labour standards, ensure freedom of association, and improve working conditions,” Buendia told Al Jazeera, things that will benefit Mexican workers even as employer-dominated labour groups worry that they may lose their advantage.

The IAM originally opposed the USMCA’s predecessor, NAFTA. Greenberg said that while they acknowledge USMCA will continue, US and Canadian workers “would probably be perfectly happy” if the agreement ended as the NAFTA deal had led to plants being shuttered and workers being laid off as jobs moved from the US and Canada to low-cost Mexico.

“There is a need for stronger incentives to keep work in the United States and Canada. We want to see the wages in Mexico go up so that it doesn’t become automatically a place where companies go to because they know they will have lower wages and workers who do not have any bargaining power or strong units,” Greenberg added.

Under Sheinbaum’s Morena party, Mexico has raised the minimum wage from 88 pesos ($4.82) in 2018 to 278.8 pesos ($15.30) in 2025, with the rate in municipalities bordering the US reaching 419.88 pesos ($23). On December 4, Sheinbaum announced a 13 percent rise in the minimum wage — and 5 percent for the border zone— set to begin in January 2026.

Despite these increases and the competitiveness of wages in the aerospace sector, researchers agree that a significant wage gap persists between Mexican workers and their US and Canadian counterparts.

“The wage gap is definitely abysmal,” said Javier Salinas, a scholar at the UAQ Labor Center, specialising in labour relations in the aerospace industry. “The [aerospace] industry average is between 402 [Mexican pesos] and 606, with the highest daily wage being 815. [But] 815, converted to US dollars, is less than $40 for a single workday.”

By contrast, Salinas estimates that a worker in the US earns an average of
