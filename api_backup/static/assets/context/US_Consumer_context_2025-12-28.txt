Khapli wheat, an ancient grain once on the brink of extinction, is staging a spectacular comeback, selling at up to five times the price of regular atta, as urban consumers turn to functional food to manage lifestyle diseases.Over the past two years, more than a dozen brands, including ITC , Urban Platter, Anveshan, GirOrganic, Satvyk, Conscious Food, Amala Earth and regional millers, have entered the heirloom flour segment.Compared to modern wheat, khapli — also known as emmer wheat — is richer in fibre and protein, and has a lower glycaemic index, helping a steady release of glucose into the bloodstream, critical for managing diabetes.“Customers are highly aware of their health and want to invest in good food to prevent diseases.

Inventory levels across India’s consumer goods sector have normalised, after nearly three months of disruption caused by the GST overhaul, and companies now expect a strong rebound in sales.Production is running at full capacity, said Dabur Zydus , Godrej, Parle Products and several other companies, as they build inventories in anticipation of a strong demand pickup starting next quarter, reversing the trend during the transition to new GST rates.At Emami, maker of the BoroPlus antiseptic cream and Zandu Balm, inventory position has fully stabilised, said vice chairman Mohan Goenka. “Stock levels have normalised, supply flows are smooth and there are no disruptions to availability. Overall, operations are back to business as usual,” he said.Taxes on many consumer goods, including daily essentials such as soaps, shampoos, toothpaste and food items, were cut under the revamped GST regime that came into effect September 22. While the GST 2.0 reforms were aimed at boosting consumption, it disrupted the sector temporarily due to the need for product repricing and other operational adjustments. For FMCG companies, trade partners like distributors and retailers slowed down orders during the transition, as they did not want to block working capital by ordering and getting credit for the price difference later, causing companies to slow down production.Inventory levels are now reaching back to normal with the price re-adjusting happening for the new packs, said Mayank Shah, vice-president at Parle Products, India’s top biscuits maker.“We expect the full benefit of GST rationalisation on demand and sales will be visible from the January-March quarter,” added Shah.Tarun Arora, chief executive of Zydus Wellness , the maker of Complan and Glucon-D drink mix, said things have normalised in terms of channel issues, old packaging and old pricing.There was initially reluctance among channel partners to accept packages with old prices, and then there was confusion due to mixed packages printed with old and revised prices, he said, adding: “These issues are mostly streamlined now.”In some cases, companies had to move out of popular price points such as ₹5, 10, 15 and 20 to odd ones like ₹4.70, 9.80, 14.20 and so on to accommodate the GST cut for the old stock, causing difficulties to kirana stores. But the current inventory is priced at popular levels with companies increasing pack weight to pass on the GST benefit to consumers.With inventory levels normalising, companies expect the benefits of the GST cut to reflect on their sales.“We expect the full benefit of GST rationalisation on demand and sales will be visible from the January-March quarter,” added Shah.

But the current inventory is priced at popular levels with companies increasing pack weight to pass on the GST benefit to consumers.With inventory levels normalising, companies expect the benefits of the GST cut to reflect on their sales. Dabur India will deliver better performance in the second half of this fiscal year than in the first, with it aspiring to achieve mid-to-high single-digit growth in the balance of the year, said Rehan Hasan, sales head at the maker of Dabur Chyawanprash and Real fruit juice.“The trade disruptions due to GST have settled now and we are already seeing an uptick in demand. Rural demand continues to grow ahead of urban India.That said, the demand growth in urban markets is being primarily driven by modern trade and ecommerce,” he said. “The entire industry is mostly bullish on the demand growth post GST 2.0. It’s a little early to say, but within a couple of months, by Jan-Feb, we should start seeing strong demand,” said Sudhir Sitapati, managing director at Godrej Consumer Products Companies have increased the pace of production and many of the manufacturing units are now running at full capacity, said industry executives.A case in point is the high demand edible oil major AWL Agri Business is reporting from the baking and snacking industry. “Oil consumption by the companies is back to normal and growing, be it biscuits or namkeen,” said Angshu Mallick, executive deputy chairman at AWL Agri Business. Even categories like air-conditioners, which reported weak sales this calendar year due to poor summer, have seen inventory levels reducing to almost normal levels, prompting companies to return to peak production from this month. GST on ACs has been reduced from 28% to 18%.“The industry had 90 days of inventory, which is almost double of the usual. It has come down, like in the case of Blue Star it's now 50 days,” said Blue Star managing director B Thiagarajan.

[TITLE]These 13 creator economy startups pulled in about $2 billion in funding this year:
[TEXT]

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The creator economy is riding an AI-fueled high.

In 2025, eight startups building artificial intelligence tools to automate the content creation process each announced at least $50 million in funding — a combined $1.2 billion — from venture capital and private equity investors.

Synthesia, a generative AI video startup based in London, confirmed its $180 million funding round in January, while ElevenLabs, a text-to-voice startup, closed a $180 million Series C round. Other AI startups, like Moonvalley, Krea, and Higgsfield, also announced sizable investments this year.

While AI is dominating investor interest, the topic still carries friction within the creator economy. Some of these AI startups, which offer features such as human-like avatars, run the risk of posing a threat to content creators themselves. Influencer marketing, still the primary financial engine of the creator economy, has yet to reach a consensus on how and when AI should be utilized.

Top creators aren't sitting by idly for AI to take over. YouTuber MrBeast and his team initially sought to raise $200 million earlier this year at a $5 billion valuation, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The MrBeast team declined to comment on the fundraise.

It's not just AI that's attracting giant checks from VCs.

Social commerce startups building live shopping and affiliate marketing platforms are also raking in funding. Whatnot, a platform where people sell on stream in categories like fashion and collectibles, such as Pokémon Cards or Labubus, raised a total of $490 million across two later-stage rounds this year. The social shopping platform was most recently valued at $11.5 billion.

Meanwhile, ShopMy, an affiliate marketing platform, continues to gain market share in the influencer marketing space. The startup raised a total of $147.5 million in funding this year.

US social commerce sales are expected to cross $100 billion next year, according to estimates from EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. The category is gaining steam in the US, fueled in part by the growth of TikTok Shop.

This year's fundraising blitz for creator AI and social commerce startups follows similar buzz for the categories in 2024 when investors threw money at startups like Captions, Flip, and OpusClip. Several startups in those business areas, including ElevenLabs and ShopMy, raised money two years in a row.

Business Insider analyzed 2025 fundraising data from PitchBook and other industry sources to highlight the biggest creator industry investment rounds from the year. We're highlighting 13 startups that raised $50 million or more in 2025; combined, their funding crossed $1.9 billion. We focused on companies whose products significantly impact the businesses and content creation processes of creators and their partners.

Here are 13 creator economy startups that raised some of the largest rounds in 2025, in alphabetical order:

Animaj is an animation company that distributes on YouTube and other kid-friendly platforms, and uses generative AI to speed up production time. It announced an $85 million funding round in June led by HarbourView Equity Partners and Bpifrance Large Venture, with participation from other investors, including JP Morgan and Marquee Ventures.

ElevenLabs is a text-to-voice AI startup that began the year with a $180 million Series C funding round. In September, it announced a $100 million employee tender offer at a valuation of $6.6 billion.

Fixated is a talent-management firm that raised $62.8 million in a two-part round this year, according to the company.

Higgsfield, a generative AI video startup, announced that it had raised a $50 million Series A round in September. The investment, led by GFT Ventures, will help the startup expand its enterprise offerings and accelerate its "global engineering and go-to-market momentum," per the company.

Krea, an AI creative tool kit for video and image editing, announced in April that it had raised $83 million to date, including its most recent Series B round from investor Bain Capital Ventures and a Series A with investment from Andreessen Horowitz.

Manychat, which automates SMS and social media DM marketing for brands, raised a $140 million growth capital round this year led by private equity firm Summit Partners. The funding will help the social commerce and marketing startup expand its global presence and further build its agentic AI tools.

Moonvalley is building AI video tools for Hollywood and raised an $84 million round led by General Catalyst, which included support from the industry, including talent agency CAA.

PixVerse, an AI video creation platform, announced in September that it raised a $60 million Series B round led by Alibaba with participation from Antler.

ShopMy, an affiliate marketing platform, announced two investment rounds this year. In January, ShopMy disclosed that it raised a $77.5 million Series B round led by Bessemer Venture Partners and Bain Capital Ventures. Later in October, the startup announced it raised an additional $70 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion, bringing the company's total raised in 2025 to $147.5 million.

Newsletter platform Substack raised a $100 million Series C round led by BOND and The Chernin Group. The platform was valued at $1.1 billion, minting the startup as a unicorn.

The generative AI music platform Suno announced in November a $250 million Series C round led by Menlo Ventures, with participation from Nvidia's NVentures and Lightspeed, among other investors.

Synthesia, a generative AI platform that can turn text into videos and create AI avatars and voiceovers, confirmed in January that it had raised a $180 million round led by NEA, with participation from World Innovation Lab and Atlassian Ventures, among other investors. The company declined to comment on an October Forbes report that it had raised an additional $200 million.

Customer Journey Mapping Software Market Overview

1. Market Definition and Scope

The customer journey mapping software market encompasses digital tools designed to visualize, analyze, and optimize customer interactions across multiple touchpoints throughout the buying lifecycle. These platforms help organizations understand customer behavior, preferences, emotions, and pain points by integrating data from online, offline, and omnichannel sources. The scope of the market includes cloud-based and on-premises solutions used by enterprises of all sizes to improve engagement, retention, and conversion rates. Customer journey mapping software is widely applied across industries such as retail, BFSI, healthcare, IT & telecom, travel, and e-commerce. As businesses increasingly prioritize customer-centric strategies, the market has evolved from simple journey visualization tools to advanced platforms embedded with analytics, AI, and automation capabilities, enabling real-time insights and predictive decision-making.

2. Evolution of Customer Experience Management

The market has grown alongside the evolution of customer experience (CX) management from reactive service models to proactive and personalized engagement strategies. Earlier approaches relied heavily on surveys and basic CRM systems, offering limited visibility into customer journeys. Modern customer journey mapping software provides end-to-end journey orchestration, combining behavioral data, sentiment analysis, and contextual insights. This evolution is driven by rising customer expectations for seamless, consistent experiences across digital and physical channels. Organizations now leverage journey mapping tools not only to identify friction points but also to redesign processes, align internal teams, and enhance service delivery. As CX becomes a key competitive differentiator, customer journey mapping software is increasingly viewed as a strategic investment rather than a supporting tool.

3. Technology Integration and Innovation

Technological advancements play a central role in shaping the customer journey mapping software market. Integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, and natural language processing has significantly enhanced software capabilities. These technologies enable real-time journey tracking, predictive modeling, and automated recommendations to improve customer interactions. Cloud computing has further expanded market reach by offering scalable, cost-effective, and easily deployable solutions. Additionally, integration with CRM, marketing automation, contact center, and customer data platforms has strengthened the value proposition of journey mapping tools. Continuous innovation is allowing vendors to offer deeper insights, faster analysis, and more actionable intelligence, supporting data-driven CX strategies across complex customer ecosystems.

4. Deployment Models and Accessibility

The market offers a range of deployment models, including cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid solutions. Cloud-based customer journey mapping software dominates adoption due to its flexibility, lower upfront costs, and ease of integration with existing digital infrastructure. Small and medium-sized enterprises increasingly favor SaaS-based models to access advanced CX capabilities without significant IT investments. Large enterprises, particularly in regulated industries, may still adopt on-premises or hybrid solutions to address data security and compliance requirements. Improved user interfaces, low-code platforms, and visualization dashboards have made these tools accessible to non-technical users, expanding adoption beyond IT teams to marketing, sales, and customer support functions.

5. Industry Adoption Trends

Adoption of customer journey mapping software spans multiple industries, each with distinct use cases. Retail and e-commerce companies use these tools to optimize omnichannel shopping experiences and reduce cart abandonment.
