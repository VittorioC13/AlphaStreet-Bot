ReNew Energy Global Plc, India's leading renewable energy company and a preferred decarbonisation partner, on Friday announced that it has secured USD 331 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the statement said.The project integrates 837 MWp of wind and solar capacity with a 415 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery energy storage system (BESS).

Designed to deliver 300 MW of peak power along with a dependable baseload supply, the project will significantly enhance grid reliability and accelerate India's transition to a low-carbon energy future.The USD 331-million debt from ADB comprises up to USD 291 million in local currency financing from ADB's ordinary capital resources and up to USD 40 million from the ADB-administered Leading Asia's Private Infrastructure Fund 2 (LEAP 2), with ADB arranging the remainder.

The signing of financing agreements was presided over by Bhargav Dasgupta, Vice President for Market Solutions at ADB, and Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO of ReNew."This project demonstrates that renewable energy can now be delivered competitively at the grid scale as per peak power demand requirements," Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO of ReNew, said.

It also builds on the strategic cooperation outlined under a Memorandum of Understanding signed at UNFCCC COP28 to accelerate clean energy deployment and grid transformation."This is the first peak power renewable energy project to be financed by ADB and is expected to generate about 1,641 gigawatt-hours of clean energy per year," Bhargav Dasgupta, Vice-President for Market Solutions at ADB, said.

Earlier in April, ReNew announced a USD 2.5 billion investment to develop a 2.8 GW hybrid renewable energy complex in Andhra Pradesh, one of India's largest at a single location.By integrating wind, solar, and battery storage, the project sets a blueprint for firm, dispatchable clean energy, delivering reliable power during peak demand and supporting India's low-carbon growth.

Nasdaq-listed ReNew has a clean energy portfolio of 18.2 GW (+1.1 GW BESS) on a gross basis as of August 13, 2025.In addition, the company has 6.4 GW of solar modules, 2.5 GW of solar cell manufacturing and is expanding the solar cell capacity by 4 GW.

[TITLE]HSBC Slashes Oil and Gas Financing:
[TEXT]
Financing and deals with oil and gas companies will have a materially lower share in the energy portfolio of HSBC as new energy opportunities arise, the banking giant’s chief sustainability officer, Julian Wentzel, told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday.

The UK-based banking group unveiled today its updated Net Zero Transition Plan, in which it eased the interim emissions targets for its oil and gas portfolio. The 2030 emission reduction target is now to reduce emissions in its business with the oil and gas sector by 14% to 30% from a 2019 baseline. The previous target was cutting absolute financed emissions by 34% by 2030.

HSBC reaffirmed its 2050 net-zero target for its financed portfolio, but noted that it is updating the interim targets as “Our customers are navigating complex and dynamic market conditions with the transition playing out at different speeds and from different starting points across sectors and geographies.”

“In some sectors and regions there has been significant progress; in others, the transition is proving harder and slower than anticipated,” HSBC said.

Wentzel told Bloomberg that financing for fossil fuels will likely increase in HSBC’s portfolio, but the finance will “decline materially” relative to HSBC’s total capital allocation to the energy sector.

HSBC is not considering further restrictions, according to Wentzel, who became the bank’s chief sustainability officer in February.

“We have to acknowledge that the removal of capital from the oil and gas sector doesn’t support the transition, because if they’re seeking to transition, we want to be party to and support that transition,” Wentzel told Bloomberg.

The world’s biggest banks raised their combined financing for fossil fuels by more than one-fifth last year, bucking a falling trend since 2021 amid a backlash against net-zero policies, especially in the United States.

After years of scrutiny and blacklisting from Republican states in the U.S. and lawsuits from Republican attorney generals, North American banks and asset managers began quitting net-zero alliances en masse following President Donald Trump’s election victory.

Some 20 kilometers out from the port of Tianjin, in the jade waters of the Bohai Sea, a vast metal structure rises above the surface. This hulking offshore platform, 11-1 CEPJ, is the beating heart of the Caofeidian oil and gas field — and a monument to China’s multibillion-dollar efforts to insulate itself from the whims of its rivals.China has long sought to reduce the risk that comes with being both the world’s top consumer and its largest importer of energy. But the urgency and scale of that ambition have increased dramatically in recent years and months, along with geopolitical tension and the ascent of a mercurial Donald Trump to helm a US administration unafraid to use trade as a weapon. Last month, Washington also blacklisted Russia’s top two oil producers, prompting Chinese refiners to cancel some cargoes.Since 2019, when the latest output expansion drive began in earnest, China’s majors have spent $468 billion on drilling and exploration — that’s up by almost a quarter from the previous six years, and enough to make PetroChina Co. the world’s biggest spender during that period, outpacing even heavyweights like Saudi Aramco. Production is already rebounding, and with Beijing likely to double down on self-reliance, there is no indication that pace of investment will slow in the coming years.“In the last few years, we have seen an energy crunch all around the world,” Huang Yingchao, vice president of natural gas at PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte, the energy giant’s trading arm, said at a conference last week. “Gas and LNG are like tap water and bottled water. Tap water is cheaper and is more reliable, and the logistics are easier. So we push for domestic production.”All of this is becoming a huge, unspoken headache for the world’s largest oil and gas producers. From Exxon Mobil Corp. to BP Plc, sprawling corporations have grown used to having China as the engine for the world’s fossil-fuel demand. Indeed, for much of the last decade, it accounted for more than 60% of global oil demand growth.Take Shell Plc, one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas suppliers. It is investing billions into new LNG supply on the expectation that global demand will expand 60% by 2040, driven largely by China. Its boss, Wael Sawan, told a conference in June that gas could make up 20% of China's energy mix, compared with single digits today."We believe China is a huge market,” Hassan Alyami, vice president of Aramco’s Ras Tanura refinery said at an industry gathering last month. “Demand is increasing. Maybe now it is stable, but in 2027 and beyond, demand is going to increase.”But the past may no longer be a good way of predicting the future. Domestic output is increasing just as demand growth slows, with the economy sputtering and cleaner cars beginning to rule the roads. This year has already seen competition from other fuels, and Sanford C. Bernstein analysts expect domestic gas production to begin outpacing demand growth by the end of this decade, a moment when China may also be taking more pipeline gas from Russia, further cooling appetite for imported LNG.Nevertheless, from January to October global companies have greenlit nearly 100 billion cubic meters of new LNG export capacity, already the second-most for any year on record. In the US alone, $100 billion could be invested in new LNG export infrastructure this decade, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd.Trump has said China will buy more US energy and even potentially invest in Alaska as part of a wider trade truce. But, as with other key areas, like agriculture, it will not be for lack of alternative options.“China is coming in with increased production. With oil demand falling or plateauing, that serves to neutralize — or to provide China with a buffer against — the Trump administration’s push for energy dominance,” said Erica Downs, senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “They’re in a completely different world and an even better position than during Trump 1.0.”China still consumes far more than it produces, and that is unlikely to change any time soon. But today it ranks No. 7 in crude production, ahead of many members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and in natural gas it is No. 4.That clout speaks to the evolution of China’s oil majors, all of which have expanded dramatically in size and sophistication this millennium. PetroChina, Cnooc Ltd and Sinopec , have become giants in terms of output, refining and oil trading, alongside rivals Chevron Corp and Shell Plc. PetroChina’s annual production has risen by nearly a quarter in the past decade to 1.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent.“The Chinese oil majors have surprised not just the market, but they’ve surprised themselves by exceeding production targets,” said Michal Meidan, director of China research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “It gives China a sense of control, especially as oil demand is declining.”Under the first Trump administration and during the first trade war, President Xi Jinping called for a renewed effort to boost domestic output. Since, oil production has risen 13% and gas has climbed by more than half. Both are on track to set all-time records this year — the equivalent of adding nearly an Indonesia worth of oil and an Algeria worth of gas to the balance of global supplies.Government officials haven’t made specific future targets public — at best, an indication could come early next year, when the 15th Five-Year Plan is approved by China’s annual parliament. But they’ve made it clear they want the drilling boom to continue. That new economic blueprint is expected to make upstream expansion a priority, according to a person familiar with the government’s thinking. The person asked not to be named as the goals have not been published.Beijing’s focus on hydrocarbon security arguably dates back to the late 1950s, to a period around China’s split with the Soviet Union — and with its engineers — that ingrained in officials the need to avoid leaning too heavily on others. The country’s very first oilfield, Daqing, was already a model of self-reliance, expanding rapidly as technology, engineers and construction equipment were funneled toward it.Those concerns resurfaced in earnest a decade ago, when OPEC launched a price war to halt the growth of US shale oil and combat a plunge in value. China was caught in the crossfire, saddled with costly, aging fields that the head of PetroChina in 2016 said had “no hope” of making a profit, even as prices recovered. Output tumbled 12% over the following three years.Under Xi, Beijing has set out to change that. In the midst of a trade war with the US, he underlined in 2018 the need to boost domestic oil and gas exploration and production — at any cost. He reinforced the message during a 2021 visit to the Lai 113 block at the Shengli oil field in the eastern province of Shandong.“Oil development is of great significance to our country,” Xi told a crowd of workers clad in bright red, flame-retardant jumpsuits. “As a major manufacturing nation, China must develop its real economy. The rice bowl of energy must be firmly held in our own hands.”Four years later, on a cool and wet September afternoon in Shengli, Zhang Chuanbao, a senior geologist for operator Sinopec, shows visitors everything the company has done to revive production at a field that was first discovered in 1961.He stops alongside two giant metal tanks filled with liquefied carbon dioxide captured from a nearby refinery. Pumps housed in sheds next to them are injecting that CO2 deep underground into the reservoirs. Sinopec is keen to underline the environmental benefits of storing 1 million tons of CO2 a year underground, but it’s also helping to squeeze out extra oil and gas, boosting the recovery rate by 15%.The carbon capture project is expected to lift oil output by 3 million tons total over the next 15 years, and Sinopec is seeking other ways to maintain the 24 million tons of annual production at the aging field, including tapping shale rock beneath it.All of these advances are possible thanks to vast sums spent in recent years. After Xi called for a renewed emphasis on domestic drilling, the following year China’s three oil majors adopted an action plan for oil and gas development through 2025.PetroChina, the top spender, boosted its capital expenditure by 16% in 2019 to $42 billion, while Cnooc and Sinopec both increased spending by more than a fifth that same year. By comparison, that year Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP taken together increased spending by just over 5%.Success was not a foregone conclusion. Six or seven years ago, China’s giants were announcing plans to boost production at a time of abundant global supplies. Analysts questioned whether they were prioritizing shareholder returns or national service.But the move proved prescient. Companies began to actually produce more barrels just as oil and gas prices surged, especially from 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Cnooc hit record profits that year; PetroChina did the same in 2024.“The companies got kind of lucky,” said Lin Chen, vice president of oil and gas research at Rystad Energy. “The oil price rose higher than their break-even costs, so the more they produced, the more money they earned.”Today, China is going beyond supporting aging fields to sustain fuel output. It’s putting funds into shale, and firms including Ningxia Baofeng Energy Group Co. have built massive refineries that convert coal into oil products, chemicals and natural gas — a process that is even more polluting than the traditional petroleum industry.The biggest success has been at sea. Cnooc has lifted its domestic output — all of it offshore — by 60% between the end of 2018 and 2024.And the emblem of this victory is the Bohai Sea in northeast China, which has supplanted onshore fields to become the largest oil-producing region in the country. Protected by peninsulas jutting out from Shandong on the west and Liaoning to the north, it is home to 60 fields and more than 200 platforms pumping up oil and gas from under the sea floor.One of those is the Caofeidian 11-1 CEPJ. Named after a nearby coastal town, the Caofeidian field is part of a network in Bohai that together produces more than 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day —

We signed a new carbon dioxide (CO2) removal deal with Mombak, a Brazil-based company that is restoring degraded land in the Amazon by planting native, biodiverse forests. We’re purchasing 200,000 tons of CO2 removal from Mombak — 4x the size of our first deal with them last year.

Mombak’s approach balances scientific rigor with industrial-scale operations to maximize climate benefit and ecosystem restoration. Our expanded support will help Mombak grow their impact, and we’ll also use Google DeepMind’s Perch AI to quantify the biodiversity benefits of reforestation.

Mombak is the first project selected by the Symbiosis Coalition, and it has been endorsed by independent experts for its credible approach to measuring CO2 removal. As with our other purchases, we’ll report transparently on the impact of this project — and where needed, plan to replace credits as their impact expires.

[TITLE]Short answer: Beef tendon and tripe are not “natural steroids.” They don’t directly raise testosterone. What they do offer: collagen (tendon) for connective‑tissue resilience and a modest hit of prote:
[TEXT]
The receipts (what tendon + tripe

actually

do)

Tripe (cooked, simmered): per 100 g it’s ~11.8 g protein, ~4.1 g fat, very low carb; a serving (~85 g) gives meaningful B‑12 (~26% DV), zinc (~13% DV), and selenium (~18% DV). It’s also relatively high in cholesterol (~133 mg per 85 g).

Beef tendon: predominantly collagen—amino‑acid profile is heavy on glycine, proline, hydroxyproline; great for connective tissue, but collagen is incomplete protein (no tryptophan) and low in leucine, so it’s weaker for muscle protein synthesis by itself.

Why athletes still use collagen: In small human trials, taking vitamin‑C–enriched gelatin/collagen (≈15 g) ~1 hour pre‑training boosted biomarkers of collagen synthesis—think tendons/ligaments—after jump‑rope bouts. That’s durability, not testosterone.

Body‑comp edge (specific populations): Several RCTs show collagen peptides + resistance training improved fat‑free mass and strength more than placebo in older or untrained men; mechanism is likely connective‑tissue remodeling and better training tolerance—not a testosterone surge.

Testosterone: what actually moves the needle (and where tendon/tripe fit)

Fix deficiencies (esp. zinc): Controlled studies show zinc restriction slashes testosterone, while supplementing zinc in deficient men brings levels back up. Tripe gives you a dietary zinc bump; if you’re already sufficient, don’t expect supra‑physiological gains. Don’t go ultra‑low‑fat: A 2021 meta‑analysis found low‑fat diets tended to lower testosterone versus higher‑fat diets (though later analyses are mixed). Point: eat enough fat; you don’t need to drown in it. Remember the raw material: Testosterone is literally synthesized from cholesterol inside Leydig cells (under LH signaling). Dietary cholesterol’s direct impact on T is murky, but you do need adequate energy and fats for normal steroidogenesis. Sleep like a champion: One week of 5 h/night cut daytime testosterone

[TITLE]Voter fury emerges over skyrocketing electricity bills as AI stokes demand — and fears of a stock market bubble:
[TEXT]
Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year’s midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who’s footing the bill to power Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Meanwhile, concerns are growing over an AI bubble in stock markets. Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management business, said at the Fortune Global Forum just weeks ago that some AI stocks have “a little too much concentration.”

[TITLE]Trump was already cutting low-income energy assistance – the shutdown is making things worse as cold weather arrives:
[TEXT]
As fall turns to winter and temperatures begin to drop, millions of people across the U.S. will struggle to pay their rising energy bills. The government shutdown is making matters even worse: Several states have pushed back the start of their winter energy assistance because their federally allocated funds have yet to show up.

A 2023 national survey found that nearly 1 in 4 Americans were unable to pay their full energy bill for at least one month, and nearly 1 in 4 reported that they kept their homes at unsafe temperatures to save money. By 2025, updated polling indicated nearly 3 in 4 Americans are worried
