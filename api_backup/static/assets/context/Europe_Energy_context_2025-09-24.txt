[TITLE]Judge Blocks Trump Order Halting Offshore Wind Construction:
[TEXT]
Danish offshore wind developer Ørsted has been cleared to restart work on its nearly complete Revolution Wind project after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s order to halt construction. The ruling represents a major victory for Ørsted and a blow to President Donald Trump’s efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry.

The U.S. Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a stop-work order on August 22, halting progress on Revolution Wind, a 704 MW wind farm located 15 miles off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The order came despite the project being fully permitted and already 80% complete. Revolution Wind, developed by Ørsted and its partner Skyborn Renewables, is designed to supply enough electricity to power more than 350,000 homes.

Ørsted immediately challenged the order in federal court, arguing that it was “arbitrary, capricious, unlawful and issued in bad faith.” According to Reuters, the halt had been costing the company $2 million per day, putting its $5 billion investment at risk. Rhode Island and Connecticut also filed suit, underscoring the political stakes in New England, where the project is central to state-level clean energy targets.

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth granted Ørsted’s request for a preliminary injunction. Lamberth, a senior judge appointed by Ronald Reagan, found that the Trump administration had offered “contradictory reasons” for halting the project and described the shifting explanations as “the height of arbitrary and capricious” conduct.

The judge emphasized that Revolution Wind had reasonably relied on government assurances and that the sudden reversal imperiled its ability to meet contractual deadlines. “There is no doubt in my mind of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs,” he wrote.

The ruling prevents Interior from enforcing the stop-work order while litigation continues, allowing construction to move forward.

The Trump administration has made no secret of its opposition to offshore wind, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently declaring there was “no future” for the industry under Trump because it was “too expensive and not reliable enough.” At the Gastech conference in Milan earlier this month, Burgum suggested that as many as five offshore projects currently under construction could face review.

However, the court’s decision signals that projects that are already fully permitted and under construction may have stronger legal standing. For Ørsted, the ruling comes at a critical juncture. The company said it would “resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority.” Its U.S.-listed shares rose nearly 9% following the decision.

Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont praised the ruling, calling it “extremely encouraging for workers and our energy future.” The Biden administration had previously sought to expand offshore wind capacity, and the outcome of the case could influence how quickly the U.S. builds momentum in a sector where Europe and Asia currently lead.

[TITLE]Trump Presses Europe to Cut Russian Energy and Target China with Tariffs:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump last week called on European countries to stop importing Russian oil and gas and to start imposing tariffs on China in order to end the war in Ukraine. He added that Washington is ready to impose major sanctions on Russia if NATO members -- the vast majority of which are European -- did both. On the continued buying of Russian oil and gas, Trump highlighted to the members of the security organisation that it greatly weakens their negotiating position and bargaining power over Russia. On the issue of imposing tariffs on China, he underlined that Beijing has a strong grip over Moscow and that it has become Russia's largest trading partner since the Ukraine war began, providing it with a critical financial lifeline in the process. Given that all these comments are correct, what is Europe going to do now?

That Trump addressed his comments to the security collective of ‘NATO members’, rather than to a geographical collective, tacitly reiterates to Europe the idea that the U.S.’s commitment to NATO might be under further threat if they do not implement his latest suggestions on Russia and China. When he did the same regarding his belief that NATO members should increase their annual defence spending from an average of 2% of their gross domestic product in 2024 to around 5%, this was quickly agreed to. Consequently, there is no reason to think European NATO members will not do the same on completely halting Russian oil and gas imports sooner rather than later. This is particularly true as it is something that many European countries already want to do and are moving toward implementing. Specifically, on 6 May, the European Union’s (E.U.) executive branch -- the European Commission (E.C.) – published its roadmap to phase out Russian energy imports completely by the end of 2027. One part of this will be done by improving the transparency, monitoring, and traceability of Russian gas across the E.U. markets, while new contracts with suppliers of Russian gas will be prevented, and spot contracts will be stopped by the end of this year. Another part will address Russian oil imports with an emphasis on employing the same techniques as for gas and a particular focus on Russia's ‘shadow fleet’ (vessels used by Russia to evade sanctions on oil). The final part will address the nuclear element of the threat from Moscow, restricting new supply contracts co-signed by the Euratom Supply Agency for uranium, enriched uranium and other nuclear materials deriving from Russia. The E.U. has already reduced its share of Russian gas imports from 45% to 19% due to the implementation of the REPowerEU Plan in May 2022. However, E.U. Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen underlined on 13 May that: “The E.U. is very clear. We do not wish for energy from Russia in the future. We don’t wish it now and we will not wish it after a peace [in Ukraine],” he said. “The Roadmap is a very clear signal that we don’t want to import so much as a single molecule [of Russian gas or oil] in the future,” he added.

Following Trump’s latest comments (made on 13 September in the Truth Social media service), several key members of the E.U. moved to support the idea within the E.C. of bringing this forward by at least a year, a very senior security source at the E.U. exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “It could be done earlier, even within the next twelve months, and there are serious talks going on now to that effect,” he said. U.S. energy secretary Chris Wright is even more bullish on the timeframe, stating last week that the E.U. could phase out Russian gas entirely within the next 6- to 12-months. “The only obstacle here [to achieving a phase out of Russian gas imports to Europe within the next 12 months] is the objection of Russia-friendly members Hungary and Slovakia, but this could be dealt with once there is consensus otherwise in the membership,” said the E.U. source. “Once the various mechanisms have been established to end our [the E.U.’s] Russian gas imports, it would be relatively straightforward to do the same for Russian oil imports too,” he underlined.

The principal alternative sources of supply for European gas needs were established in the months following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. These included increased liquefied natural gas supplies from Qatar, among other countries in the region, and from the U.S. All such supply channels remain open, and volumes can be increased over time, most notably from the U.S. Significant in this context was the E.U. pledge in July to buy US$750bn worth of U.S. energy, including gas and oil. Although some in the E.U. questioned whether such volumes could be imported from the U.S., Washington’s unequivocal view is: ‘Cut out all Russian oil and gas, and then we can discuss if the deal with us is too much then’, according to the E.U. source. “There is always going to be considerable flexibility in the deal in terms of the mix of national and private companies involved on both sides, pricing structures, and contract lengths, but in basic terms the U.S. sees no reason why the E.U. would say it cannot import the agreed volumes from the U.S. when it is continuing to import oil and gas from Russia – it looks nonsensical,” he added.

That said, there is less clarity across the E.U. when it comes to imposing tariffs on China, especially at the 50-100% level mentioned by Trump. To begin with, it is much more difficult legally for the E.C. to impose tariffs than it is to impose sanctions, the E.U. source told OilPrice.com last week. “Any agreement must be made among all members and must consider a raft of E.U. and WTO [World Trade Organisation] statutes and rules, as they [tariffs] are classed as a trade policy tool rather than as the foreign policy tool that sanctions are seen as,” he said. Trump, for his part, has always regarded tariffs and sanctions as two weapons in the same broad arsenal of punishments against targeted states, as also detailed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. Aside from the legal technicalities involved, there is also the economic fact that China is the largest importer of goods to Europe and third-largest market for European exports at a time when Europe is struggling to generate meaningful economic growth. That said, cognisant of the broader NATO security implications mentioned earlier in completely side-stepping the China issue, the E.U.’s 19th package of sanctions against Russia released on 19 September, stated that: “We propose further measures on Chinese actors supporting Russia’s military industry.” It added: “These new sanctions will also squeeze Russia’s access to technologies including AI [artificial intelligence] and geospatial data, as well as critical resources that feed weapons production [...] This includes those received from foreign suppliers including China [and India].” E.C. President Ursula von der Leyen also stated in the accompanying press conference to the Package announcement that: “We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries, including China.” At the same time, E.U. foreign policy head Kaja Kallas, posted on social media that: “We’re adding more chemicals, metal components, salts, and ores to our export bans and tighter export controls on entities from Russia as well as China [and India].”

In short, according to the E.U. source, Europe has acknowledged Trump’s recently stated concerns over China in some action but is waiting to see if he is serious about following through on these, given his vacillation in China policy during his first term and in his second one to date. However, on the issue of expediting the full ban on all imports of Russian oil and gas ahead of 2027, it is “full throttle ahead,” he concluded.

[TITLE]BP Cancels Rotterdam Biofuels Plant, Joining Shell in Heavy Capital Retreat:
[TEXT]
BP has cancelled plans for a major biofuels facility at its Rotterdam refinery, scoring another setback for Europe’s drive to scale advanced biofuels, as reported by Reuters. The energy giant confirmed on Monday that it will not proceed with the standalone plant and will instead focus on co-processing biofuels in existing refineries, which are cheaper, lower-risk options. A spokesperson said that the project no longer met BP’s capital return thresholds, which mirror those of its upstream oil and gas operations.

The Rotterdam project was part of a wider slate of facilities BP once said could deliver 50,000 barrels per day of biofuels by 2030. None reached a final investment decision. The company now produces around 10,000 bpd of biofuels through refinery co-processing and relies on its Brazilian joint venture with Bunge, which produces ethanol from sugarcane. Spain’s Castellon site is the only remaining large-scale project under review.

BP’s retreat comes just weeks after Shell scrapped its own biofuels facility in Rotterdam, a plant designed to produce 820,000 tonnes annually of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Shell executives said the project had become “insufficiently competitive” and booked impairment charges of up to $1 billion.

The back-to-back exits by Europe’s two largest oil companies highlight the pressures facing advanced biofuels despite strong EU policy support. High feedstock costs, policy uncertainty, and shareholder demands for higher returns have eroded enthusiasm for multibillion-dollar standalone projects. Instead, both firms are steering capital toward oil and gas, where profitability is more reliable.

Together, the cancellations remove what was expected to be more than a million tonnes of new European capacity, prompting questions about how the European Union will meet its binding targets for sustainable aviation fuel, which require airlines to use at least 6% SAF by 2030 and progressively more thereafter.

[TITLE]ADX wins courtroom battle to fire up Austrian gas discovery:
[TEXT]
ADX Energy is back in the game after winning a major legal battle that clears the path for the company to resume flow tests at its exciting Welchau-1 gas and condensate discovery in Upper Austria.

Testing of the well had been held up since January, while the State Administrative Court of Upper Austria ruled on the company’s drilling and exploration approval status after objections had been raised by four environmental non-government organisations.

A separate court decision also scrapped a law that had allowed companies to continue operating while such objections were under review, meaning ADX had no option other than to down tools and wait.

At the end of last week, the court ruled that ADX’s drilling and testing permits were granted in line with all environmental and regulatory requirements and that the company had carried out its operations safely and responsibly. ADX says the ruling was also based on the strong interest in Austria for finding new domestic natural gas reservoirs.

ADX drilled the Welchau-1 well in early 2024 and quickly lit up the headlines, hitting paydirt across a monster 450-metre hydrocarbon interval. Early tests hinted at a serious gas and condensate prize of anywhere between 12 and 217 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), with a healthy mean of 85MMBOE on the cards.

However, the story took a twist in September 2024 when ADX revealed it believed the find was actually high-grade, light oil with associated gas – a far more lucrative outcome than the liquids-rich gas first flagged.

ADX still commands a 75 per cent economic stake in Welchau and its broader ADX-AT-II licence after striking a deal in late 2023 with Austrian heavyweight MCF Energy, which bought into a 25 per cent stake by covering half the Welchau-1 drilling tab up to €5.1 million (A$9 million).

With its funding commitment now met, MCF has cemented its interest – though it’s still on the hook for any extra exploration and appraisal spend as the project gathers steam.

With the latest ruling, ADX now has the legal green light to kick off drilling and testing operations at the site from October through March - Austria’s designated winter drilling window.

The company sees plenty of gas upside left in the tank. Welchau-1 intersected four intervals showing oil and gas potential, but three of them remain untested. The next cab off the rank is fluid sampling from the Reifling formation, which was perforated before the suspension.

Perhaps even more tantalising is the option to push the drill bit deeper into the Welchau Deep prospect. The move would require new approvals but could open an entirely new exploration chapter below the current well depth.

The timing couldn’t be sharper, with Europe hungry for energy security and Austria keen to cut its reliance on high-carbon LNG imports or Russian gas.

This favourable decision by the court is important for further testing and exploration operations at Welchau. It is also a very positive indication of the ongoing support for gas exploration due to the strong public interest for securing clean domestic natural gas reserves in Austria.

The company says the courtroom win does more than get Welchau back on track. It hands ADX credibility with regulators, sets a clear framework for future drilling permits and boosts its chances of unlocking further value in one of the most prospective onshore gas frontiers in Central Europe.

The punters will likely be watching closely as the rigs fire back up. If testing confirms commercial flows and especially if Welchau Deep delivers, ADX could be sitting on a gas prize that powers Austria and energises its own share price.
