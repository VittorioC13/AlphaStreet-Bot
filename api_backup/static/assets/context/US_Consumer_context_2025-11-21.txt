[TITLE]O5 Group Buys Retail Building Across From Penn Station for $30M:
[TEXT]
O5 Group, a real estate investor and manager, has acquired a retail building across the street from Midtown’s Penn Station.

New York-based O5 Group, which rebranded from Oved Group in 2022 and specializes in apparel, real estate and finance, purchased the three-story building at 425 Seventh Avenue from United Pacific Development for $30 million, according to city records made public Wednesday.

Ralph Dweck, an attorney at Wachtel Missry, signed the deal for the buyer, which used the entity FO 425 Seventh Avenue, while Sze Chan signed for the seller, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. A spokesperson for O5 Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Chan could not be reached for comment.

United Pacific bought the property between West 33rd and West 34th streets — and across Seventh Avenue from Penn Station — in 2006 for $4.1 million, property records show. The low-rise building’s ground-floor retail space is currently home to Rose’s Pizza.

It’s unclear what O5 Group plans to do with its new property, but the company owns nearly 10 other retail properties throughout New York City in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, according to its website.

News of the deal also comes after a slew of big leasing news near Penn Station, an underground train and subway hub in New York City that is said to be the busiest transportation facility in the Western Hemisphere.

Earlier this month, fintech firm Robinhood signed a sublease for 125,392 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust’s Penn 2, which sits above the train hall, as Commercial Observer previously reported. At the same time, Dick’s Sporting Goods signed a lease for 125,284 square feet of office space at Penn 2, while fintech firm Current took more than 62,000 square feet at the property.

Quarterly dividend increased 10% to $0.242, the 5th consecutive year of double-digit increases

Additional Strategic Initiatives :

Completed 15-store acquisition in southeast U.S. region; adding an estimated $80 million in annual Retail sales (approximately $40 million net to enterprise)

Announced planned exit of non-core businesses (Kincaid and American Drew casegoods and Kincaid upholstery)

Announced proposed closure of UK manufacturing facility

Strategically realigned leadership and corporate staffing to focus on core businesses

To be substantially completed by the end of the fiscal year, these initiatives combined will reduce sales by approximately $30 million, net, and increase margins by 75-100 bps

MONROE, Mich., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in the retail and manufacture of residential furniture, today reported second quarter results for the period ended October 25, 2025. For the quarter, sales totaled $522 million, up slightly against the prior year comparable period, reflecting growth in Retail and Wholesale segments, offset by a decline in Joybird sales. Operating margin was 6.9% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and 7.1% on an adjusted(1) basis. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.70 on a GAAP basis and $0.71 on an adjusted(1) basis.

Second quarter total written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) grew 4% versus a year ago and written same-store sales (which exclude the impact of both newly opened stores and newly acquired stores) were down 2%. This represents a continued sequential improvement in written same-store sales trends over the last two quarters against a challenging consumer and macroeconomic environment.

Melinda D. Whittington, Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We were pleased to deliver modest sales growth, particularly in our Wholesale segment where we also again delivered margin expansion, continuing to create our own momentum in what remains a choppy landscape. We are investing in the business for the long term, as highlighted by the opening of 15 new company-owned stores in the last 12 months and the advancement of our distribution and home delivery transformation project. Furthermore, in the beginning of our third quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of a 15-store network in the southeast U.S. region. Our Century Vision strategy to grow our Retail store footprint and expand brand reach is working and positions us to disproportionately benefit when overall industry volumes rebound.”

Whittington added, “In addition to investing in our core, vertically integrated North American upholstery business, we are proactively taking steps to optimize our portfolio. We have announced plans to exit our non-core wholesale casegoods and upholstery businesses in the back half of the fiscal year, announced the proposed closure of our U.K. manufacturing facility, and strategically realigned our commercial leadership and corporate staffing to enhance operating efficiency. On top of this, leveraging our North American manufacturing base with ~90% of finished goods produced in the U.S., we are successfully navigating the current trade and tariff volatility. Our iconic brand, well positioned manufacturing base, strong balance sheet, and talented team provide the foundation for continued growth and margin expansion.”

Third Quarter Outlook :

Taylor Luebke, SVP and Chief Financial Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We expect fiscal third quarter sales to be in the range of $525-545 million (growth of 1-4% year-over-year) and adjusted operating margin(2) to be in the range of 5.0-6.5%, reflecting advancement of our Century Vision initiatives, friction costs related to portfolio and supply chain optimizations, and a measured view on the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.”

Sales: Written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) increased 4% compared to the year ago period driven by new and acquired stores Written same-store sales decreased 2%, a sequential improvement versus the last two quarters, as lower traffic and conversion were partially offset by higher average ticket and design sales Delivered sales increased slightly to $222 million

Wholesale Segment:

Sales: Sales increased 2% to $369 million versus last year, driven by growth in our core North America La-Z-Boy branded wholesale business

Operating Margin: GAAP operating margin was 7.9% versus 6.7% Adjusted (1) operating margin was 8.1% versus 6.8%, with improvement driven by 160 basis point benefit of lower warranty expense due to a change in our dealer warranty arrangements during the quarter, partially offset by incremental expenses related to our distribution and home delivery transformation and increased advertising expenses

Corporate & Other:

Joybird written sales increased 1%, improving sequentially from last two quarters, and driven by strength in retail store performance

Joybird delivered sales decreased 10% to $35 million primarily due to lower delivered volume

Corporate & Other operating loss increased versus the prior year, primarily due to expense deleverage on lower Joybird delivered sales

[TITLE]Trump cuts tariffs on goods like coffee, bananas and beef in bid to slash consumer prices:
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.

President Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.

The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.

Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.

The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.

The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.

Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).

The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.

Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.

[TITLE]Raising Cane's Founder Calls Out Venture Capital in Fast Food 'If Your Motivation is Money, Then You're Not Gonna Care':
[TEXT]
Venture capital firms investing in fast food restaurants have caused once-beloved chains to give up the things that made them famous, Raising Cane founder and co-CEO Todd Graves said recently.

"It's like death by a thousand cuts," Graves said on the YouTube talk show "Hustle Meals." "Ultimately, if your motivation is money then you're not gonna care. You're going to let those great quality things go down…that's what's happened to fast food."

Don't Miss:

Graves was responding to a comment from "Hustle Meals" host Josh Scherer about how fast food is typically seen as successful due to its replicability and consistency. "However, we've seen with so many chains as they expand, that consistency drops," Scherer said.

The investment firms that take controlling interest in fast food chains often value profits over customer service, Graves said. "That's when the CFOs jump in and say, ‘You know what? We don't need to make our sauce in house at every restaurant,'" he said. "We can make it in a commissary and we'll save ‘X.'"

He also said there's a "lack of founders that care" about their restaurants. "I care that everybody gets a good quality, craveable meal in a place that's food-safe, friendly, and we're getting them their food fast," he said.

Investment firms in fast food

Many fast food and fast-casual restaurant brands have been acquired by private equity and venture capital firms in recent years. Roark Capital has controlling interests in Subway, Dunkin', Arby's, and Buffalo Wild Wings.

Diner chain Denny's was taken private by TriArtisan Capital Advisors, Treville Capital Group, and Yadav Enterprises earlier this month.

“Private equity and venture capital firms are drawn to fast-food and fast-casual concepts because they combine reliable, recurring revenue with scalable unit-level economics," Brian Alas, managing director at investment bank Boxwood Partners, said in a statement to Benzinga. "These businesses operate on predictable margins, require relatively low capital to replicate, and benefit from consistent consumer demand even during economic downturns."

[TITLE]The fast-food industry is trying to lure in Gen Z diners. Is the meal deal helping?:
[TEXT]
Fast-food chains like Chipotle and McDonald’s are lowering their sales forecasts for next year and luring people in with value meals as they foresee a pullback in spending from low-income and younger diners.

[TITLE]The fast-food industry is trying to lure in Gen Z diners. Is the meal deal helping?:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

Fast food prices are climbing, and big chains like Chipotle say that they're losing young adults who are cutting back on their spending. With cheap meal deals on the table at McDonald's and Burger King, the battle for the future of fast food rests with Gen Z — but many of them are opting not to dine out.

As fast food gets more expensive, young adults are pulling back on their spending, forcing restaurant chains to compete for their dollars through meal deals and promotions.

“It’s really the price that has stopped me, and just the fact that it has become more of an inconvenience than it used to be,” said Fatima Abdul Razzaq, a second-year electrical engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University.

“You’re spending $15 at least if you want to get a proper meal. And that’s just not sustainable,” said Marwan Al Kharrat, a second-year computer engineering student at TMU. “It’s too expensive. Can’t afford it."

Three-quarters of Canadians surveyed said they were dining out less frequently thanks to the rising cost of living, with that figure increasing to 81 per cent of people aged 18 to 34, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted on behalf of Restaurants Canada in June.

That spells trouble for big chains trying to lock in the next generation of their core consumer base — and some are already seeing an impact on sales.

While Chipotle once boasted that more than half of its customers were young people, the Mexican fast-casual brand is now having a harder time getting Gen Z through the door.

“What we’ve noticed is a category slowdown for the 25-to-34-year-olds that are under the most financial pressure,” said Stephanie Perdue, vice-president of brand marketing at Chipotle in Newport Beach, Calif., in an interview with CBC News.

Chipotle, McDonald’s expect lower sales

During Chipotle’s third-quarter earnings call last month, its chief executive, Scott Boatwright, suggested that — at least in the U.S. — the slowdown could be attributed to higher unemployment rates, slower wage growth and more debt.

The company lowered its sales forecast for the third time this year, with the expectation that its customers (particularly those earning less than $100,000 US a year) will keep pulling back on dining out into the beginning of 2026.

Chipotle isn’t the only chain noticing a pullback from a key part of its consumer base. McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski recently told investors that the brand is also expecting fewer sales from low-income diners next year.

Fast food customers might be noticing a pricier burger and fries for a few reasons, said Robert Carter, a restaurant industry analyst and managing partner at The StratonHunter Group in Toronto.

“We are seeing higher labour costs, higher food costs, and therefore the average eater cheque when you go out is higher than it has been in years past,” he said.

The price of ground beef, for example, has skyrocketed — the cost of one kilogram soared past $15 in August, compared with five years earlier, when it was closer to $9, according to Statistics Canada.

Fast-food sales can act as a kind of economic bellwether, reflecting a consumer’s ability to spend money on purchases beyond the necessities. Even the Bank of Canada warned in its most recent Monetary Policy Report that fast-food prices are seeing strong growth.

“The whole tariff conversation and the economic turmoil associated with that is making people feel concerned about their spending," Cart er said, referring to the ongoing U.S. trade war. "The y'll often say the first cutback is the out-of-home going to a restaurant."

Are meal deals the answer?

While Chipotle’s Perdue said the company is sticking with its rewards program to lure wayward customers back, other brands are competing for cost-conscious customers by aggressively promoting specials — and for some, it’s working.

Taco Bell, which is owned by Yum Brands, is trying to target Gen Z with trendy drinks and sauces. Restaurant Brands International, which owns Tim Hortons and Burger King, said both brands had a stronger-than-expected third quarter.

While Timmy's — being a mostly Canadian-based chain — was less exposed to U.S.-related economic pressures, Burger King held onto steady traffic thanks to an aggressive push into meal deals — especially its “two for $5” and “three for $7” specials.

“We know that younger people, they're looking for value meals, they're looking for deals, they're looking for discounts where they can get them. So this is one strategy that a lot of restaurants are using to remain competitive,” said Milena Stanoeva, senior director of communications and public affairs at Restaurants Canada, a trade group for the foodservice industry.

When they do dine out, young people between the ages of 18 and 28 are generally placing more importance on promotions when picking a restaurant than older consumers do, according to the June 2025 survey from Angus Reid.

Another competitor: the grocery store

Chipotle, meanwhile, said its biggest competitor for young adults is the grocery store.

“We’re not losing them to the competition. We’re losing them to grocery and food at home,” Boatwright, its CEO, said on the company's recent earnings call.

Stanoeva said the same cohort also has a tendency to replace full meals with snacks — think of the "girl dinner" trend that swept through TikTok about a year and a half ago — which “could speak to cost concerns or maybe just how fast-paced their lives are."

Students who spoke to CBC News said with prices so high, they’ve been preparing more food at home and bringing it to school and work rather than ordering in or getting take out (though some research shows this younger cohort is still among the most likely to use food delivery apps).

“I shouldn’t be spending this much money on food. So sometimes I make something at home and eat it here,” said Zain Matadar, who was walking around the Toronto Metropolitan University campus with lunch in hand.

Third-year student Nathan Liu said eating out has become a “significant challenge,” so he’s taken up a new hobby: “I try to cook more now. I'm a very bad chef, but I still try."

For now, fast-food chains are fighting to get this particular group back into their restaurants.

“The fight is really going to be around this Gen Z and this [Gen] Alpha consumer in getting their share of spend over the next couple of years,” restaurant industry analyst Carter said.

[TITLE]EXCLUSIVE: Marquee Brands Buys Stance for a Leg Up:
[TEXT]
Marquee Brands is stepping up again — acquiring sock standout Stance, expanding its portfolio to 19 brands and opening up a new set of opportunities for its intellectual property machine.

“You have all these cultural touch points — collaborations with the NBA, with Disney, with Star Wars, with Marvel and Hollywood and entertainment icons,” said Heath Golden, chief executive officer of Marquee, in an interview with WWD.

[TITLE]Beyond Discounts: iGaming's New Deal:
[TEXT]
The frantic, coffee-fueled-refresh-hitting of Cyber Monday is starting to lose its magic. That “50% Off!” email, which once felt like a secret key to massive savings, now just feels… predictable. We’ve all felt the “deal fatigue.” We buy a discounted toaster or a pair of headphones, and the excitement is fleeting. But as the thrill of traditional e-commerce sales wanes, a new contender for the “best deal” crown has emerged: the iGaming industry. This sector isn’t just offering discounts; it’s fundamentally redefining what “value” means to a consumer.

The core difference lies in the value proposition. A Cyber Monday deal, at its heart, is a discount on an expense. You have to spend $200 to “save” $50. The iGaming industry completely flips this script. Its deals are built around multipliers. A typical offer isn’t “spend less”; it’s “get more.” An offer to “deposit $50 and play with $100” feels psychologically different. It’s not a rebate; it’s a value-add that doubles your entertainment potential from the very start.

This shift is evident across the digital entertainment landscape. Consumers who are savvy about value now compare a 20% discount on electronics to the kinds of welcome offers available on various platforms. For instance, in the iGaming space, promotions are a core part of the user experience, not just a seasonal event. Enthusiasts visiting a site like VulkanBet casino often find that the value lies in the added playtime and enhanced experience, which a simple e-commerce discount struggles to match. This model is built on engagement, not just transactions.

The Psychology: A Bonus vs. A Discount

The power of the iGaming model lies in its deep understanding of behavioral psychology. A discount is passive; a bonus is active. It taps into our desire for gamification and a sense of “beating the system.”

The Gamification of Loyalty

E-commerce loyalty programs are often slow and uninspired, offering tiny points that eventually lead to a minor discount. The iGaming industry, by contrast, has mastered gamification. Loyalty is rewarded instantly and in tiers. Players unlock new levels, “free spins,” or exclusive bonuses simply by participating. This creates a compelling loop that makes the user feel valued and rewarded for their time, not just their money. The “deal” is an ongoing, interactive experience rather than a single, boring transaction.

Personalization at Scale

Cyber Monday deals are a broadcast, a one-size-fits-all digital flyer. They might be based on your browsing history, but they often feel impersonal. iGaming platforms excel at personalization. The deals you are offered are often tied directly to your play style, your favorite games, or your loyalty status. A “VIP” player gets a different, more substantial bonus than a casual new user. This targeted approach makes the user feel recognized and understood, making the “deal” feel far more exclusive and valuable than a generic 20% off coupon code.

More Than Just a Transaction

When you break it down, the e-commerce model and the iGaming model are selling two completely different things. One is selling a product; the other is selling an experience.

The Entertainment Factor

When you buy a discounted laptop on Cyber Monday, the “fun” part (the deal) is over in a click. The real product (the laptop) is the goal. In iGaming, the “deal” is the product. A 100% deposit bonus or a set of free spins directly translates to more entertainment. The value isn’t a physical item; it’s extended playtime, more chances for a thrilling win, and a longer, more engaging experience. You are, in effect, buying “fun,” and the bonus is just “more fun” for your money.

Immediacy is King

Let’s not forget the most powerful psychological driver of all: instant gratification. You find a Cyber Monday deal, you click “buy,” and then… You wait. You track the shipping for three to five business days. The iGaming bonus is immediate. The moment you make your deposit, the bonus funds are credited to your account, ready for use. This instant, tangible reward provides a dopamine hit that the “your item has shipped” email simply cannot compete with.

What E-Commerce Can Learn

This doesn’t mean Cyber Monday is dead, but it does mean e-commerce platforms are no longer the undisputed kings of value. To compete, they need to think less like digital department stores and more like entertainment platforms.

They can start by shifting their focus from simple discounts to more engaging reward structures.

Focus on Gaining, Not Saving: Instead of just “50% off,” offer “Buy one, get one” or “Spend $50, get a $25 credit” on a future purchase. This reframes the value from losing less to gaining more.

Gamify the Shopping Experience: Implement meaningful loyalty tiers that offer tangible, instant rewards, not just points that expire. Create “missions” or “challenges” for shoppers to unlock exclusive deals.

Personalize Rewards: Use data to offer rewards that truly matter to the individual, making them feel like a valued VIP, not just another name on an email list.

A Shift in Value Perception

The battle for the consumer’s dollar is no longer just about the lowest price. It’s about the best experience and the greatest perceived value. While Cyber Monday will continue to be a day for stocking up on goods, the iGaming industry has proven that a well-designed, bonus-driven ecosystem can create far more excitement and loyalty. It has shifted the goalposts from “saving money” to “getting more,” and in a digital world, that’s a much more compelling game to play.

Which do you find more appealing: a 50% discount on a product, or a 100% bonus to enhance an experience? Share your thoughts below.
