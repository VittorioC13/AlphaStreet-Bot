[TITLE]Pine Labs to launch IPO on November 7; aims to raise ₹2,080 crore via fresh issue:
[TEXT]
Fintech firm Pine Labs is gearing up to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on November 7, aiming to raise ₹2,080 crore through fresh issue of shares.

The company's maiden public offering would conclude on November 11. The bidding for anchor investors will open for a day on November 6, according to the red herring prospectus (RHP).

Apart from fresh issue, there would be an Offer for Sale (OFS) of up to 8.23 crore equity shares.

Under the OFS, Peak XV Partners, London-based Actis, PayPal, Mastercard Asia/Pacific, Temasek through Macritchie Investments, Invesco, Madison India Capital, MW XO Digital Finance Fund Holdco, Lone Cascade LP, Sofina Ventures S.A.and Pine Labs co-founder Lokvir Kapoor will be divesting their shares in the fintech firm.

Proceeds from the fresh issue will be used by the company to repay debt, investment in IT assets, expenditure towards cloud infrastructure, technology development initiatives and procurement of digital checkout points.

The company will use funds for investment in its subsidiaries such as Qwikcilver Singapore, Pine Payment Solutions, Malaysia, and Pine Labs UAE for expanding the presence outside the country.

Earlier, the company was looking to mobilise ₹2,600 crore via fresh issue, with an additional OFS component of up to 14.78 crore shares by existing shareholders, as per the draft papers filed in June.

Noida-based Pine Labs is a technology company focused on digitizing commerce through digital payments and issuing solutions for merchants, consumer brands and enterprises, and financial institutions.

Its technology infrastructure supports digital transactions and payment processing in India as well as in a few international markets such as Malaysia, the UAE, Singapore, Australia, the US, and parts of Africa.

According to the Redseer Report, the company was the largest issuer of closed and semi-closed loop gift cards in India by transaction value in FY2025.

It was also identified as the leading digital affordability enabler at digital checkout points, among the top five in-store digital platforms, and a key processor for Bharat Connect transactions during the same year.

In FY25, the company processed payments worth ₹11.42 lakh crore in gross transaction value (GTV) across 5.68 billion transactions.

As of June 30, 2025, its platforms were used by over 9.88 lakh merchants, 716 consumer brands and enterprises, and 177 financial institutions.

The company's customer base spans a wide range of sectors including retail, e-commerce, lifestyle, consumer electronics, healthcare, travel, hospitality, and financial services, as well as public sector clients such as municipal bodies and traffic departments.

It has long-standing relationships with several large brands and institutions, including Croma and HDFC Bank, with some partnerships extending over a decade.

The company competes with the likes of Paytm, Razorpay, Infibeam, PayU Payments, PhonePe in the domestic market, and Adyen, Shopify and Block in the overseas markets.

Axis Capital, Morgan Stanley India Company, Citigroup Global Markets India, JP Morgan India, Jefferies India are the book running lead managers while KFin Technologies is the registrar for the IPO.

[TITLE]While AI spending is top of mind, online ads are driving a lot of Big Tech's growth:
[TEXT]

As tech giants increase their already breathtaking spending on artificial intelligence, their respective digital advertising businesses have also gained momentum. Quarterly earnings reports this week from Meta , Amazon , Alphabet and Microsoft all showed healthy revenue on the ads front. The rising online advertising sales have allayed concerns earlier this year that economic turbulence, amplified by President Donald Trump's trade policies, would negatively impact ad budgets. "I think the digital ad market is strong," said Jasmine Enberg, co-founder of Scalable, a creator economy media firm. "I think this economic instability and volatility is kind of priced in for a lot of people at this point; sort of seems to be the status quo." Meta topped its rivals for the quarter with the fastest ad-related sales growth. The company's total third-quarter revenue, of which 98% is derived from online ads, jumped 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion, the company's highest sales since the first quarter of 2024. Revenue in Amazon's online ad unit soared 24% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, representing a faster growth rate than the company's AWS cloud computing unit, which saw sales rise 20%.

CEO Andy Jassy highlighted on Amazon's earnings call that the company is continuing to expand its ad-specific demand-side platform to more third-party apps and sites. "You look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S.," Jassy said. "And you layer on top of that what we've recently done in providing our DSP customers the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM, it's powerful."

Alphabet's overall advertising sales for the third quarter came in at $74.18 billion, a 13% increase from $65.85 billion a year ago. Third-quarter online ad sales for YouTube rose 15% to $10.26 billion. Microsoft's search and news advertising unit brought in $3.7 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter, a 14% increase from the $3.2 billion it recorded the previous year. Even if there's been some pullback in ad budgets due to economic uncertainty, it's likely that companies shifted some of that spending from traditional businesses like newspapers to digital ad platforms, said Jeremy Goldman, senior director of content at Emarketer. "I think what could be happening is more of a no-brainer," Goldman said. "To put your money in social, and to put your money in retail media and to put your money in search ad spending." It wasn't just the megacaps that showed hefty online ad growth this week. Reddit on Thursday reported a 68% jump in third-quarter sales, soaring past analyst estimates. The company said global daily active uniques grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing estimates of 114 million. Snap and Pinterest are scheduled to report results next week. Going big on AI The tech giants all made clear that they don't see any broader economic concerns that would warrant a reduction in their AI spending, and instead lifted their guidance for capital expenditures, despite concerns of a bubble. Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft collectively expect capex spending above $380 billion this year, which is still a fraction of the $1 trillion worth of data center and cloud computing deals that OpenAI has recently announced with its partners like Nvidia, Oracle and Broadcom. But while investors cheered Amazon and Google, they were less thrilled with Microsoft, and especially Meta. The Facebook parent's stock tanked 11% on Thursday after the company said it would raise the low end of its capex guidance to between $70 billion and $72 billion from the prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion. Oppenheimer analysts downgraded Meta stock to the equivalent of a hold from buy, because they said it's less obvious how the social media company will benefit from its AI investments relative to its big tech rivals that also operate cloud computing services. "Significant investment in Superintelligence despite unknown revenue opportunity mirrors 2021/2022 Metaverse spending," the Oppenheimer analysts wrote, contrasting the company's big AI spending related to its Superintelligence Labs to its money-losing Reality Labs division, which makes virtual reality and augmented reality technologies.

Susan Li, Meta's finance chief, said Wednesday during a follow-up earnings call that it's important for the company to invest in AI-related data center and third-party cloud computing services or risk falling behind, echoing similar comments made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

"The highest priority for the company is investing our resources to position ourselves as a leader in AI," Li said. "That means that I think for the immediate period of time ahead of us, we could see some financial pressure during which our operating profit could be lumpy." Meta has continued to point to how its AI investments are improving its online advertising business, but it's having a more difficult time showing how that spending will benefit the company in the future, Enberg said. "I think part of that is that we've heard the story now quarter after quarter that it is able to integrate AI into its ad business and use that as a growth engine," Enberg said. "What comes next is harder to articulate, and far less tangible for investors and other people who follow the space." Still, Meta is experiencing some growth in new products like the Meta AI app that contains the Vibes AI-powered short video service, Goldman said. The company can also still expand more into subscriptions or even potentially offer enterprise AI services to sell to corporations, which is "an area that they haven't played at all," he said. For now, Meta's digital advertising unit remains its core business, and just like previous quarters, it's unclear how the economy will impact ad budgets. With the holiday season approaching, all eyes will be focused on whether the lingering economic concerns or tariff-related price hikes lead to consumers curbing their spending, which could impact corporate marketing campaigns. "The next test will be when we get to the Black Friday numbers," Goldman said. "Are those going to be below expectations?"

Trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) surged to new highs in October, signaling the continued shift of global crypto markets toward on-chain finance.

According to data from DeFiLlama, perpetual DEXs processed more than $1.36 trillion in trading volume last month, the highest level ever recorded. That figure surpassed August’s $759 billion peak, setting a new benchmark for on-chain trading activity.

Hyperliquid Leads as Onchain Perpetuals Gain Traction

The sharp rise in volume underscores growing investor confidence in on-chain platforms. Hyperliquid, a layer-1 blockchain that has dominated the perpetual DEX landscape, accounted for roughly $299 billion of October’s total.

[TITLE]See the High Tariff Rates on Toys, Video Games and 7 Other Popular Holiday Gifts:
[TEXT]
Between the upcoming holidays and President Trump’s tariffs, shoppers are rightly concerned
[Source link]: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/see-high-tariff-rates-toys-164406001.html


[TITLE]Trump tariffs could add $40 billion to holiday shoppers' and sellers' costs, LendingTree warns:
[TEXT]
A person walks down a street with shopping bags in New York City on Nov. 29, 2024.

American consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to LendingTree .

Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad "liberation day" tariffs.

Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement.

And consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves.

LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season.

The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion.

Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion.

That translates to around $132 per shopper.

Retailers are expected to eat the remaining $12 billion in extra costs from the tariffs.

"For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant," said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst.

"While it may not be earth-shattering, it can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt," Schulz said.

"That's a choice no one wants to have to make."

Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs.

Schultz agreed, calling it an "unfortunate reality" that many consumers will have to face.

"That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want," Schulz said.

"I doubt that we'll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they're what so many people want," he said. "However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice."

LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper.

Clothing or accessories have the next highest added cost, at $82 per shopper, the company said.

Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.

[TITLE]From fast food to beverage giants, brands see rising income inequality among customers:
[TEXT]
The most common refrain so far this corporate earnings season is that the U.S. economy is increasingly divided between wealthy consumers and everyone else.

While many Americans tighten their belts amid rising costs and a weakening job market, a fortunate few are still spending freely, insulated by a financial cushion of stock market gains and years of rising home values.

The split is having an outsize impact on consumer-facing companies, but those effects aren’t being felt evenly across brands.

McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said the “two-tier economy” was a major factor in the fast-food giant’s decision to revive its “Extra Value Meal” combos last month.

“Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits,” Kempczinski told CNBC in September. “We needed to step in.”

Coca-Cola’s chief operating officer, Henrique Braun, said the company continued to see “divergency in spending between the income groups” last quarter. “The pressure on middle- and low-end-income consumers is still there.”

The widening K

The U.S. economy has been turning more “K”-shaped for decades, with the high-earner cohort doing better and better while others fall further down the economic ladder.

[TITLE]Trump says his tariffs will help American businesses. So why are they suing?:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON − The sine wave on David Levi’s T-shirt illustrates the physics behind the STEM kits he creates to teach kids how to build electronic musical instruments from scratch.

But the oscillating line could also represent President Donald Trump’s tariffs that have bounced up and down, creating higher costs and uncertainty for small businessmen like Levi.

Levi, an electrical engineer who founded MicroKits in 2020, has had to raise prices, slow production and pause plans to launch a new product – Banan-a-Synth – that lets kids turn a bunch of bananas into a kind of keyboard.

And if the tariffs that Trump has imposed on nearly every imported good – including many of the electronic components Levi uses to build his kits in Charlottesville, Virginia, − are going to remain high for the foreseeable future, Levi said he might have to move production out of the country.

That could be needed both to allow Levi to sell his kits at a competitive price and to gain more predictability

[TITLE]These Small Business Owners Explain How Trump's Tariffs Are More of an 'Existential Crisis' Than COVID:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on $2.2 trillion worth of imported goods, claiming they protect domestic producers. Ironically, American small businesses are among those bearing the heaviest burden of these taxes. Now, these businesses are telling their stories. Recently, a group of over 700 small businesses joined forces by forming We Pay the Tariffs, a coalition that contends Trump's trade policies have caused irreparable harm.

Included in this group is Wild Rye, a women's outdoor apparel brand founded in 2016. Cassie Abel originally launched Wild Rye as an American-made brand, but domestic manufacturers' minimum order quantities and unit pricing made sourcing in the U.S. economically unviable. Chinese manufacturers had markedly lower minimum purchase requirements, prices, and higher quality, so Wild Rye ultimately went with them. By 2024, Wild Rye was one of the fastest-growing brands in the outdoor industry. Now, in the wake of Trump's tariffs, they've frozen all new hires.

The various tariff rates applied to China over the last six months have cost Abel and her company $300,000, or 10 percent of its annual revenue. That's just the seen cost of these tariffs; the unseen cost imposed by Trump's caprice, reflected in his ever-changing rates and implementation dates, is massive. Wild Rye "spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours countersourcing product; pausing production, restarting production, rushing production; running price analyses, cost analyses, [and] shipping analyses," Abel said during a media call on Wednesday.

Abel said Wild Rye "can't absorb 50 percent tariffs on [its] own," so they've raised prices by 10 percent to 15 percent on all their products and "cancelled all plans for new headcount next year." In a desperate attempt to keep her small business afloat, Abel prematurely sold equity and leveraged her own house. Every tariff hike increases the risk that Abel loses her home.

Aabesh De, founder of Flora, a plant care and diagnosis company, described a remarkably similar situation. De, like Abel, doggedly pursued the made-in-America route: "I was very proud to look at local suppliers based…in Nashville, Tennessee." Unfortunately, the minimum order quantity was 10,000, and the lowest price per unit at this quantity was approximately $55. At the time of writing, the company's Flora Pod, a wireless plant monitor, is on sale for $54.75. To sell the Flora Pod at this price and stay in business, De turned to China, which manufactured the first batch of 2,000 Pods for $22 per unit and a shipping fee of $8,000. When Trump announced his reciprocal tariffs in April, the cost of shipping jumped to roughly $34,000.

As a result of the "50 percent total tax on incoming purchase orders," Flora has had to reduce headcount by 25 percent, increase its prices by 10 to 15 percent (despite originally planning to decrease prices by these amounts), put off inventory purchases, research and development, and delay the rollout of new products. The Flora Pod V2 was supposed to launch this Christmas; now, consumers will have to wait until April or May. De describes Trump's tariffs as "a man-made existential crisis the likes of which we haven't seen since COVID."

Jess Nepstad, founder of Planetary Design, which makes coffee equipment designed for the outdoors, echoed De's sentiment, telling media members that there's no certainty in the American market anymore and Trump's fluctuating tariffs "have required more management than COVID." Planetary Design has had to reduce headcount by 10 percent and raise prices by 20 percent. The company has also been "overcharged by $200,000 on one container" at the port, with Customs and Border Protection saying "it'd take [the government] 300 days to get our money back."

"It's easier just to do business outside the United States—I didn't think I'd ever say that in my 40 years in business," he said.

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments about the hotly contested constitutionality of Trump's tariffs on Wednesday. It's unclear how the Court will rule, but one thing's for certain: Trump's tariffs are hurting American businesses.

[TITLE]Mint Explainer: Is Shadowfax’s client concentration the canary in the logistics coal mine?:
[TEXT]
Third-party logistics firm Shadowfax Technologies filed its updated draft initial public offering (IPO) papers on Saturday, laying out how it will allocate the ₹2,000 crore it plans to raise. Backed by Walmart-owned e-commerce company Flipkart, Shadowfax first filed its draft papers with the markets regulator through the confidential route in July to gauge investor interest and finetune its IPO plans.

The firm said it will use the IPO proceeds to expand its network infrastructure, finance lease payments of fulfillment and sorting centres, and for branding and marketing costs. It plans to use the remaining money for acquisitions and general corporate purposes.

Shadowfax also highlighted some key risks to the business, the most significant being client concentration.

Mint explains why this is a growing problem not just for Shadowfax but third-party logistics companies in general, and how it could affect the company’s public debut.

What's the problem?

Nearly half of the Bengaluru company’s ₹2,485-crore operating revenue in FY25 came from a single large client. Shadowfax’s top five clients, including Meesho and Flipkart, accounted for 74.6% of its operating income in FY25, generating ₹1,853 crore. Its top 10 clients accounted for 86% of revenue in that period.

Shadowfax is hardly alone in this. Ecom Express, which was acquired by listed company Delhivery in April, received 52% of its ₹2,653 crore revenue from a single business in FY24, up from 29% in the previous year.

Delhivery, too, faced a similar problem in the same period, albeit less severe. The revenue contribution of Delhivery’s top five customers in FY24 was 38.4%, down from 48.8% in FY23.

Why is concentration risk a problem for the industry?

Customer concentration poses a growing financial threat to logistics firms largely because supply remains unable to match the rapid growth of the country’s e-commerce market.

India’s e-commerce market was valued at $125 billion in 2024 and is expected to cross $345 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% over the next decade, according to a February 2025 report by property consultants Anarock.

Enablers of the e-commerce industry, which include logistics players and brands, are struggling to keep pace with the boom, especially in peak periods such as the last three months of the year. Mint reported in September how large logistics companies were bogged down by piling inventory in warehouses and delayed delivery timelines as the attrition crisis among gig workers worsened.

“In times like these, sellers opt for the most efficient logistics player and park all their business there," according to Satish Meena, analyst at market research firm Datum Intelligence.

Moreover, with only a handful of players managing the bulk of India’s e-commerce orders on both the demand and supply side, the imbalance is inevitable, according to Meena.

How do Shadowfax and others view this risk?

For companies such as Shadowfax, Delhivery, and Ecom Express, securing a large e-commerce or quick-commerce contract offers massive growth but creates an outsized risk. When a single client accounts for nearly half a company’s revenue, its financial stability is effectively tied to that client’s business decisions, not its own, Meena explained.

Shadowfax acknowledged the challenges in its draft IPO papers. “Should we experience the loss or reduction of business from any of these key clients, it could materially impact our revenue and profitability. Moreover, if these clients demand more favourable terms or encounter difficulties in meeting their obligations, our financial performance could be adversely affected."

“To mitigate these risks, we must continuously adapt our strategies and strengthen client relationships to ensure more balanced revenue streams."

What does this mean for Shadowfax’s IPO?

While it is a key risk, Shadowfax has worked to reduce its dependence on a few customers. Revenue share from its single largest client fell to 48% in FY25 from to 59% in FY24 and FY23. Similarly, the revenue share of its top five clients declined to 74.6% in FY25 from 83.4% in FY24 and nearly 85% in FY23.

Besides, Shadowfax has upside potential as it stands to gain consistent business from its investor companies. E-commerce market leader Flipkart led a $60-million Series D funding round in Shadowfax in December 2020. In FY25, Flipkart Internet Services, Instakart Services, Pincode Shopping Solutions (owned by PhonePe), and Walmart India together contributed nearly 12% of Shadowfax’s operating revenue.

[TITLE]IPO-bound Shadowfax posts 114% net profit surge in H1FY26:
[TEXT]
Logistics platform Shadowfax’s net profit surged 114% to Rs 21 crore in the first half of FY26 from Rs 9.8 crore reported a year before for the same period, according to the company’s updated draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) document.The company posted operational revenue of Rs 1,805 crore between April-June of this fiscal year, a 68% surge from Rs 1,072 crore for the same period last year.The IPO-bound company’s net profit surge comes on the back of strong revenue growth, even as the expenses for the period grew.Shadowfax filed an updated DRHP on Saturday with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for its initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise approximately Rs 2,000 crore via the offering, which includes a primary and secondary issue of Rs 1,000 crore each.
