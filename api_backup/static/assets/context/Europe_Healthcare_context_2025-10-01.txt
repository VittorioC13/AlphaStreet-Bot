-Webcast today, September 29, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time-

ATLANTA, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dogwood Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: DWTX) (“Dogwood” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing new medicines to treat pain and neuropathy, today announced that in an all-stock transaction, it has secured a royalty free, global license to develop Serpin Pharma’s intravenous (IV) formulation of SP16 to manage cancer related pain (CRP) including a broad range of chemotherapy induced neuropathy symptoms.

Serpin Pharma has discovered the active portion of A1AT responsible for both the anti-inflammatory (analgesic) activity as well as tissue repair, and this active portion is represented by SP16. SP16 is a first-in-class LRP1 agonist which has demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and neural repair activity that has the potential to treat chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). SP16 IV is the focus of a forthcoming Phase 1b CIPN study that is fully funded by the National Cancer Institute, reflecting the uniqueness of this approach, as well as the extraordinary unmet medical need associated with this debilitating cancer-related condition.

“The SP16 in-license aligns with our strategic objective of expanding our research pipeline in an area where Dogwood’s pain and neuropathy management research expertise can add value to both the asset increasing our equity value for shareholders,” said Greg Duncan, Dogwood Therapeutics Chief Executive Officer. “The National Cancer Institute’s funding of the SP16 IV Phase 1b program obviates the need to use our existing capital in the near-term to advance SP16 into clinical development.”

SP16 IV mimics the activity of alpha-1-antitrypsin’s (A1AT) anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions. In preclinical research, SP16 has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and analgesic benefits, as well as neural restorative and repair activity, both of which hold promise for addressing the multitude of symptoms and damage and functional complication of CIPN.

“After reviewing potential partners for this program, we believe Greg Duncan and the Dogwood team is best poised to take SP16 IV for cancer related pain through the clinic to address this major unmet need,” said Dr. Cohava Gelber, CEO of Serpin Pharma.

“SP16 IV may have intrinsic potential to deliver adjunctive improvement of non-pain symptoms if utilized with Halneuron®, the Company’s lead development candidate,” said Lawrence Steinman, MD, Professor of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Pediatrics, and Genetics at Stanford University and Scientific Advisory Board Member of Serpin Pharma.

Halneuron® is a Na V 1.7 specific sodium channel inhibitor that has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful pain reductions in general cancer pain, as well as chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain (CINP), respectively. Halneuron® is currently in Phase 2b development to treat CINP, a condition for which the medicine has been granted fast-track review designation by the FDA. Over eighty patients have been recruited to date in this landmark Phase 2b CINP study, with interim data from 90-100 patients projected in December 2025.

“Expanding a biotech company’s quality shots on goal is always valued, but doing so with two development candidates that stand on their own merit, with additional potential to be mechanistically synergistic, adds additional value to this exciting worldwide SP16 license,” said Mike Gendreau, M.D., Ph.D., Dogwood Therapeutics Chief Medical Officer. “We intend to explore the potential of SP16, both as a treatment for a multitude of CIPN symptoms, as well as its potential to help with repair and/or restoration of nerve function damaged by chemotherapy.”
