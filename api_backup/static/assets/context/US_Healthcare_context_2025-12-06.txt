Private equity investors have taken a liking for Kerala's healthcare sector, pumping in more than $700 million in just over two years to acquire hospitals, clinics and medical devices makers that experts say will act as anchor assets for their broader South India expansion.The state has recorded at least ten private equity-led deals in the sector since October 2023, with the list of investors comprising marquee names KKR and Blackstone, and local funds such as ICICI Venture and CX Partners. Kerala had seen negligible PE participation in the sector in the past, when states like Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka had recorded most of the M&A deals.A number of factors work in favour of Kerala when PE investors look for healthcare assets, say experts. While some of the top private hospitals are operated by non-profit bodies, there are also many well-established facilities run by doctors and families who are willing to divest a majority stake. Also, people in the state have shown a strong preference for private hospitals that offer modern amenities for treatment despite higher expenses, offering opportunities for growth and visibility on return on investment.The trend has more to do with health awareness among the state's population, said P Unneen, vice-chairman of KIMS Alshifa Hospital in Malappuram district.

[TITLE]Exclusive: Angle Health raises $134 million Series B to scale AI-driven healthcare benefits:
[TEXT]
In 2026, employer healthcare costs are expected to see their largest increase in 15 years.

This simple statistic carries a dizzying assortment of socio-economic and political ramifications: The cost of healthcare has perhaps never been a more agonizing flashpoint in the U.S., at a time when AI is the driving force behind tech and economic growth. And still, where small businesses and their employees fit into this equation is fragile at best.

Ty Wang, Angle Health CEO and cofounder, said that while there’s been “an explosion of new ways of receiving medical services” like telehealth, digital pharmacies, and chronic disease management programs—these benefits mostly accrue to employees of large tech companies or major white-collar firms.

“These services are still largely inaccessible to the vast majority of Americans,” he said.

In 2019, Wang cofounded Angle Health, an AI-driven healthcare benefits startup, with fellow Palantir alum Anirban Gangopadhyay. Now, Angle has raised a $134 million Series B, consisting of both equity and debt, and led by Portage, Fortune has exclusively learned. The company says it serves more than 2,600 small business employers in 44 states.

“We’ve been able to very effectively use AI in areas where a human should not be manually administering things that they otherwise would be,” said Gangopadhyay. “We quote thousands of groups a week. In any other company, you’re getting quoted these PDFs that are 12, 15, 20 pages long. And they’re parsing through these PDFs manually…We’ve fully automated and optimized that process where our underwriters and our sales people are only doing the pieces that we need a human to be doing.”

Small businesses face particular difficulties when providing healthcare, often operating with poor broker support, limited transparency, and no bargaining power.

“The SMB market is a large part of the population that is often forgotten,” said Wang. “There’s absolutely no transparency. There’s very little predictability, and the incumbents are able to gatekeep the data that’s available to them.”

Wang and Gangopadhyay told Fortune that Angle is devoted to transparency, cost stability, and detailed reporting in an effort to improve healthcare experiences and cost surprises. There’s an awareness that this is a systemic problem, albeit one that can be vastly improved (and over time, slowly rebuilt) by technology.

“We don’t believe that an insurance company is going to really solve healthcare,” said Gangopadhyay. “We think that the future of healthcare is a completely redesigned ecosystem that is using AI-first, tech-first products and workflows to really unlock the best care for members.”

[TITLE]UK and US agree zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
The UK has secured a 0 per cent tariff rate for all UK medicines exported to the US for at least three years, officials have said, in return for the UK spending more on new medicines.

Under the deal, the US agreed to exempt UK-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes, the officials said on Monday.

The Trump administration said in return UK drugs firms committed to invest more in the US and create more jobs.

The UK government said the 0 per cent rate on all of its pharmaceuticals exports was the lowest offered to any country. As part of the deal, it said the country's National Health Service will spend around 25 per cent more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades.

Officials said that means UK health authorities will now be able to approve medicines that deliver significant health improvements but might have previously been declined purely on cost-effectiveness grounds, including breakthrough cancer treatments or therapies for rare diseases.

"This vital deal will ensure UK patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives," said Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall.

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the deal was "an important step towards ensuring patients can access innovative medicines needed to improve wider NHS health outcomes".

"It should also put the UK in a stronger position to attract and retain global life science investment and advanced medicinal research," said ABPI chief executive Richard Torbett.

US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement "strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to US-UK pharmaceutical trade".

AstraZeneca is among pharmaceutical giants that have cancelled or paused their investments in the UK in recent months. US ambassador Warren Stephens recently warned said American businesses will cut future investments if "there are not changes made and fast".

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed on a framework for a trade pact that would slash US import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for US products, including beef and ethanol. (AP) DIV DIV

[TITLE]India can build a $1.2-trillion bioeconomy by 2047:
[TEXT]
India’s bioeconomy has expanded 16-fold over the past decade — from $10 billion in 2014 to over $165 billion in 2024. With the right policy architecture, it can exceed $1.2 trillion by 2047, becoming a major pillar of Viksit Bharat. But getting there requires more than scientific excellence. It demands bold capital-market reform and a modern, science-led regulatory system — two enablers that transformed China from an emerging player into a global biotech powerhouse.

India has the science and the talent. What we lack is the systemic scaffolding that allows innovation to scale.

Biotechnology is unlike any other sector. It is capital-intensive, deep-science driven, and characterised by long development cycles. Globally, biotech companies list on public markets while still in the research stage — giving them patient capital to survive the valley of death.

India, however, does not allow pre-revenue or research-stage biotech companies to list. As a result, innovators depend almost entirely on private capital, which is both scarce and risk-averse. This suppresses valuations, stunts pipelines, and pushes high-potential Indian start-ups to relocate abroad.

Over the past decade, China demonstrated how capital innovation fuels scientific innovation:

The STAR Market in Shanghai, launched in 2019, enabled pre-revenue deep-tech firms to list without profitability requirements. It has already mobilised over $130 billion.

Hong Kong’s Biotech Chapter (2018) allowed non-revenue biotechs to IPO. More than 70 companies have listed, raising over $25 billion.

China attracted $45 billion in life-sciences venture capital between 2018 and 2022 — nearly 10 times India’s inflows.

Its pharma R&D investment has crossed $20 billion, compared to India’s $3 billion or so.

This capital boom powered China’s rapid emergence as a global innovation hub, spawning more than 200 biotech companies with global pipelines.

Innovation & Biotech Board needed

A dedicated listing board on NSE and BSE — on the lines of NASDAQ, STAR, and Hong Kong — must allow: pre-revenue and research-stage biotech companies to list; IP-led companies to access patient capital; global investors to participate in India’s science story; and Indian start-ups to scale domestically instead of migrating abroad.

Such a reform would unlock domestic capital, attract global institutional investors, and become the financial engine of India’s bioeconomy.

Regulatory reform

Even if capital is available, innovation cannot flourish without regulatory speed and scientific clarity. Unfortunately, India’s drug-regulation architecture remains slow, fragmented, and heavily bureaucratic.

First-in-Human (FIH) trials often take months to clear. Each phase — I, II, III — requires a fresh review by Subject Expert Committees (SECs), whose ad hoc scheduling often becomes the bottleneck. CDSCO simply does not have the scientific bandwidth to evaluate emerging modalities such as mRNA, circular RNA, CRISPR, CAR-T, or AAV gene therapies.

China confronted the same issues a decade ago — and then reformed decisively: it transformed NMPA into a science-led regulator with stronger scientific capacity; introduced time-bound review pathways, reducing clinical trial approvals by 40-60 per cent; enabled parallel review of trial phases; joined ICH to align with global standards; fast-tracked advanced modalities, approving multiple CAR-T and gene-therapy products ahead of several Western markets.

Regulatory agility created predictability. Predictability created investor confidence. Together, they created a biotech boom.

India’s opportunity

India can leapfrog by restructuring the system through a two-pillar model:

Empower ICMR for scientific review of clinical trial protocols: ICMR’s deep research capability and ethics infrastructure make it the ideal scientific gatekeeper for evaluating new drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and advanced biologics — especially early-stage trials.

Position CDSCO as the licensing and oversight authority: CDSCO should focus on final approvals, GMP compliance, site inspections, and pharmacovigilance.

This separation of scientific assessment (ICMR) and administrative licensing (CDSCO) will slash approval timelines, improve scientific rigour, and restore investor confidence.

India’s innovation flywheel

Capital-market reform without regulatory reform will not produce innovation. Regulatory reform without capital access will not produce scale. But together, they create the flywheel that powers global biotech leadership.

With a dedicated Innovation & Biotech Board, a science-led dual-agency regulatory system, and strong institutional backing, India can: build thousands of deep-tech start-ups; lead globally in mRNA, RNAi, gene therapy, biosimilars, and biologics; become the preferred hub for clinical research and bio-manufacturing; generate millions of high-value jobs under the BioE³ framework; and realise a $1.2 trillion bioeconomy by 2047.

We have the science. We have the talent. We have the market. What we need now is the courage to reform.

Capital-market innovation and regulatory modernisation must be treated as national priorities. With bold action, India can move beyond being the pharmacy of the world and claim its rightful place as the lab of the world.

[TITLE]Breakthrough Therapies Advance as Rare Disease Burden Intensifies Across Aging Populations:
[TEXT]
AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioMedWire Editorial Coverage: Chronic illnesses and rare disorders among older Americans represent a rapidly intensifying challenge for the U.S. healthcare system, with the National Institutes of Health estimating that more than 30 million people nationwide are living with a rare disease. Most of these conditions have no FDA-approved therapies, leaving older adults particularly at risk as age-related changes can mask or delay accurate diagnosis. This growing strain on care has heightened the need for novel treatments that address significant unmet medical needs. Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) (Profile), a late-stage biopharmaceutical developer, is advancing several rare-disease therapies, including HyBryte[TM] (synthetic hypericin) for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), where it is currently running the final confirmatory trial necessary before seeking global marketing authorization. As the Trump administration pursues new health-policy measures focused on chronic and rare diseases, Soligenix’s programs are positioned at a pivotal crossroads of scientific innovation and national healthcare goals. The company is working alongside several prominent leaders in the pharmaceutical and life sciences sectors, including AMGEN Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN), Amicus Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: FOLD), Citius Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ: CTOR) and Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: TNXP).

CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, disproportionately affects older individuals.

FLASH2 represents the final major confirmatory step before Soligenix can pursue worldwide marketing approvals for HyBryte.

The initial FLASH trial delivered statistically significant results and set the stage for the FLASH2 confirmatory program.

A continuing investigator-initiated study at the University of Pennsylvania is offering additional insight into HyBryte’s real-world performance.

Beyond its established CTCL indication, Soligenix is pursuing several life-cycle opportunities to expand HyBryte’s reach and value.

Click here to view the custom infographic of the Soligenix Inc. editorial.

A Complex Diagnostic Puzzle Amid Shifting Federal Priorities

Rare diseases have historically been hard to diagnose, but older adults often encounter even greater hurdles. Many symptoms associated with rare conditions resemble common age-related issues, such as rashes, cognitive changes, chronic inflammation or persistent fatigue, creating ongoing risk for misdiagnosis. The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) reports that patients typically endure a five- to seven-year journey before clinicians reach an accurate diagnosis.

Such delays can worsen outcomes, postpone interventions and create emotional and financial strain, especially for seniors who may cycle through several specialists before receiving clarity. Symptoms linked to rare disorders can also be mistaken for normal aging. For instance, minor-appearing skin abnormalities can disguise early cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Neurological or systemic manifestations tied to rare autoimmune or genetic conditions may be misinterpreted as dementia, arthritis, or other routine geriatric concerns. This overlap complicates clinical evaluations and often necessitates advanced diagnostics or additional expert opinions to determine the correct diagnosis.

Meanwhile, federal policy is evolving to address widespread chronic disease pressures. The Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again initiative underscores early screening, chronic-care management and broadened access to innovative therapies. The program also cites goals related to affordability, better care coordination and faster approval pathways for next-generation treatments.

Soligenix is focused on several initiatives that fit within these national healthcare objectives. The company recently shifted U.S.-based manufacturing of HyBryte’s active pharmaceutical ingredient, strengthening domestic supply chains. Soligenix is also conducting FLASH2, the confirmatory phase 3 replication trial of HyBryte for CTCL. This study builds on the prior statistically significant FLASH trial, a successful comparative study, and multiple investigator-initiated projects, together forming a comprehensive dataset that informs FLASH2 expectations.

A Rising Challenge for an Aging Population

CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, disproportionately affects older individuals. The disease occurs when malignant T-cells migrate to the skin, creating patches, plaques or tumors that intensify or expand over time. CTCL is chronic, non-curable and frequently misdiagnosed early on because it mimics eczema, psoriasis and other common dermatologic conditions seen in older adults.

Epidemiological estimates indicate that more than 70,000 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients worldwide are affected by CTCL. The global CTCL treatment market is valued at over $250 million, with approximately $90 million attributed to the U.S. Despite this market, therapeutic choices remain scarce. No approved first-line option exists for early-stage CTCL (stage I–IIA), which represents nearly 90% of cases. Most patients depend on off-label medications, phototherapy or immune-modulating approaches, many of which involve significant risks or inconsistent long-term results.

Mycosis fungoides, the most prevalent CTCL subtype, accounts for the majority of cases. Although early-stage disease has a five-year survival rate of roughly 88%, it is a chronic cancer with unpredictable progression. Many existing therapies require lengthy timelines—often a year or more—before yielding statistically meaningful improvement.

HyBryte introduces a new mechanism specifically tailored for early-stage CTCL and is positioned to fill this critical treatment gap. If approved, it could become the first front-line option for early disease, using a photodynamic approach in which synthetic hypericin is activated by visible light. Its targeted mode of action, demonstrated efficacy, and potential safety benefits set it apart from ultraviolet phototherapy and systemic agents.

Driving Toward Global Regulatory Milestones

FLASH2 represents the final major confirmatory step before Soligenix can pursue worldwide marketing approvals for HyBryte. The European Medicines Agency has already accepted the trial design, which mirrors the original FLASH study and includes an extended 18-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period. This modification reflects regulator feedback as well as findings from comparative trials and academic studies supporting longer treatment durations.

The FLASH2 study is expected to enroll

A Biologics License Application (BLA) for accelerated approval of tividenofusp alfa is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date of April 5, 2026.

“We are delighted to partner with Denali and acquire a royalty on tividenofusp alfa, an innovative therapy that addresses a significant unmet need in the cognitive and physical manifestations of Hunter syndrome,” said Pablo Legorreta, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Royalty Pharma. “Denali’s technology platform delivers therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier and is a promising new approach to brain diseases. We are thrilled to establish a relationship with Denali and believe tividenofusp alfa is a potential practice-changing therapy that could transform the lives of patients with Hunter syndrome.”

“We are pleased to partner with Royalty Pharma, whose investment recognizes the value and potential of tividenofusp alfa for the Hunter community and supports our ability more broadly to realize the promise of the TransportVehicle platform,” said Ryan Watts, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Denali Therapeutics. “With these additional funds, we are well positioned to advance our development programs as we prepare for the launch of tividenofusp alfa, unlocking broad opportunities across serious diseases.”

Transaction Terms

The transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including Denali achieving U.S. FDA accelerated approval of tividenofusp alfa. At the closing, Royalty Pharma will make an initial payment of $200 million and Royalty Pharma will be obligated to make an additional payment of $75 million upon achieving European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of tividenofusp alfa by December 31, 2029. In exchange, Royalty Pharma will receive a 9.25% royalty on worldwide net sales of tividenofusp alfa from Denali. The royalty payments to Royalty Pharma will cease upon reaching a multiple of 3.0x, or 2.5x if achieved by the first quarter of 2039.

Advisors

Gibson Dunn acted as legal advisor to Denali. Goodwin Procter and Maiwald acted as legal advisors to Royalty Pharma.

[TITLE]Healthcare Business Collaboration Tools Market Analysis Report 2025 - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, & Forecast, 2020-2030:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Healthcare Business Collaboration Tools Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, & Forecast, 2020-2030" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Healthcare Business Collaboration Tools Market, valued at USD 21.12 Billion in 2024, is projected to experience a CAGR of 23.61% to reach USD 75.34 Billion by 2030.

Healthcare business collaboration tools are digital platforms and software designed to foster secure communication, workflow coordination, and information exchange among healthcare professionals, administrative teams, and patients. Market expansion is primarily driven by the escalating demand for remote healthcare services, the critical need for enhanced interdisciplinary team coordination in complex patient care, and stringent regulatory mandates requiring secure data sharing.

AI and Machine Learning Integration in Collaboration Workflows significantly impacts healthcare by embedding intelligent automation and analytics into operational and clinical processes. This integration enhances decision support, streamlines tasks, and provides predictive insights, enabling professionals to prioritize direct patient care.

According to Becker's Hospital Review in March 2024, Mayo Clinic's AI system generated initial responses to nonurgent patient messages, saving nurses approximately 30 seconds per message and potentially 1,500 hours monthly across the organization. This highlights AI's role in optimizing administrative burdens within collaborative environments. The College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME)'s 2024 Digital Health Most Wired National Trends Report confirms expanded AI and machine learning use for administrative tasks and decision support.

Key Market Drivers

The expansion of telemedicine and virtual care models profoundly influences the global healthcare business collaboration tools market by necessitating robust digital infrastructure for remote patient interactions and distributed team coordination. As healthcare delivery extends beyond traditional physical settings, the demand for platforms enabling secure, real-time communication among geographically dispersed clinicians and patients becomes critical. These tools facilitate virtual consultations, remote monitoring, and efficient sharing of patient data, ensuring care continuity and quality.

Key Market Challenges

A significant impediment to the growth of the Global Healthcare Business Collaboration Tools Market stems from persistent data privacy and security concerns, compounded by enduring interoperability challenges among disparate healthcare IT systems. The sensitive nature of patient health information necessitates rigorous safeguards, making organizations hesitant to adopt new platforms without absolute assurance of data integrity and confidentiality.

[TITLE]Exclusive: Angle Health raises $134 million Series B to scale AI-driven healthcare benefits:
[TEXT]
In 2026, employer healthcare costs are expected to see their largest increase in 15 years.

This simple statistic carries a dizzying assortment of socio-economic and political ramifications: The cost of healthcare has perhaps never been a more agonizing flashpoint in the U.S., at a time when AI is the driving force behind tech and economic growth. And still, where small businesses and their employees fit into this equation is fragile at best.

Ty Wang, Angle Health CEO and cofounder, said that while there’s been “an explosion of new ways of receiving medical services” like telehealth, digital pharmacies, and chronic disease management programs—these benefits mostly accrue to employees of large tech companies or major white-collar firms.

“These services are still largely inaccessible to the vast majority of Americans,” he said.

In 2019, Wang cofounded Angle Health, an AI-driven healthcare benefits startup, with fellow Palantir alum Anirban Gangopadhyay. Now, Angle has raised a $134 million Series B, consisting of both equity and debt, and led by Portage, Fortune has exclusively learned. The company says it serves more than 2,600 small business employers in 44 states.

“We’ve been able to very effectively use AI in areas where a human should not be manually administering things that they otherwise would be,” said Gangopadhyay. “We quote thousands of groups a week. In any other company, you’re getting quoted these PDFs that are 12, 15, 20 pages long. And they’re parsing through these PDFs manually…We’ve fully automated and optimized that process where our underwriters and our sales people are only doing the pieces that we need a human to be doing.”

Small businesses face particular difficulties when providing healthcare, often operating with poor broker support, limited transparency, and no bargaining power.

“The SMB market is a large part of the population that is often forgotten,” said Wang. “There’s absolutely no transparency. There’s very little predictability, and the incumbents are able to gatekeep the data that’s available to them.”

Wang and Gangopadhyay told Fortune that Angle is devoted to transparency, cost stability, and detailed reporting in an effort to improve healthcare experiences and cost surprises. There’s an awareness that this is a systemic problem, albeit one that can be vastly improved (and over time, slowly rebuilt) by technology.

“We don’t believe that an insurance company is going to really solve healthcare,” said Gangopadhyay. “We think that the future of healthcare is a completely redesigned ecosystem that is using AI-first, tech-first products and workflows to really unlock the best care for members.”
