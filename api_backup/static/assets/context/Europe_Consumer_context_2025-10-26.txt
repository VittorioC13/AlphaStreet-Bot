Walmart is betting big on its membership program. Nearly five years into its Walmart+ program, the retail giant has quietly built one of the most wide-ranging membership packages in the market — keeping the price flat at $98 a year (or $12.95/month) while stacking on benefits that extend well beyond grocery aisles.

The headline draw remains free delivery from local stores on orders over $35 , a service that has become a lifeline for shoppers looking to cut down on errands. In addition to fresh produce, members can get same-day drop-offs on everything from kitchen gadgets to vitamins and electronics, with no delivery fee attached. Walmart+ also touts free shipping on Walmart.com purchases, with no order minimums and two-day or next-day arrival on thousands of items.

But what sets the membership apart in today’s streaming-heavy, perk-laden economy is how far the benefits now reach outside of retail. As part of their membership, members can choose between Peacock Premium or Paramount+ Essential at no added cost. And at the pump, Walmart+ unlocks 10¢-per-gallon savings at Exxon, Mobil, Walmart and Murphy stations, along with member pricing at Sam’s Club. Even Burger King® is part of the mix, with exclusive savings built into the app for members on the go.

The growing roster of add-ons positions Walmart+ as more than a shopping tool; it’s a lifestyle subscription designed to compete with broad, all-in-one memberships as well as niche, sector-specific ones. By tying together grocery delivery, streaming, fuel savings and dining benefits, Walmart is betting that convenience across categories can deepen loyalty and drive frequency.

For consumers, the appeal lies in how the savings stack up. A choice of streaming subscriptions along with regular fuel purchases and free delivery easily justifies the $98 annual fee. As other platforms raise prices, Walmart’s pitch is that it hasn’t — instead, the company has quietly padded the offering without tacking on extra cost.

[TITLE]Rivian agrees to $250m settlement in 2022 IPO lawsuit:
[TEXT]

Rivian Automotive has reached a $250m agreement to settle a securities class action that was filed in 2022.

The litigation, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleged that Rivian’s initial public offering (IPO) disclosures and certain post‑IPO statements made during an earnings call and in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on 17 December 2021 were materially false or misleading.

The company announced its intention to go public in 2021.

Plaintiffs claimed the company failed to disclose material risks and facts, including that the bill of materials costs for the R1S and R1T models substantially exceeded the sales prices at which those vehicles were being offered, prompting Rivian to raise R1 retail prices.

Rivian has rejected the claims and stated that the settlement does not constitute an admission of fault or wrongdoing.

“The company denies the allegations in the suit and maintains that this agreement to settle is not an admission of fault or wrongdoing. However, settling will enable Rivian to focus its resources on the launch of its mass market R2 vehicle in the first half of 2026,” its statement read.

Under the proposed settlement, subject to court approval, Rivian will pay $250m to resolve claims brought on behalf of purchasers of the company’s class A common stock between 10 November 2021 and 10 March 2022.

The payment will be funded by $67m from directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and $183m from the company’s cash on hand.

If approved by the court, the settlement would resolve all claims against Rivian and the other named defendants in the action.

Rivian develops and manufactures electric vehicles (EV) and provides associated software and services.

The company builds its vehicles in the US and distributes them directly to consumer and commercial customers.

[TITLE]Study Finds Tariffs Cost Consumers More Than the Government Takes In:
[TEXT]
Tariffs on foreign imports have been a consistent theme of President Donald Trump's terms in office; he even says tariff is "the most beautiful word in the dictionary." But despite his consistent claims to the contrary, tariffs are taxes borne by American consumers, as a new study confirms.

A working paper out this month from the National Board of Economic Research (NBER)—conducted by researchers from Duke University, the University of Chicago, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors—seeks to understand what portion of tariffs American consumers actually bear through higher prices.

The authors note that after tariff increases in Trump's first term, "a wide range of studies" reached different conclusions on when and how tariffs "pass through" and increase the cost of an imported product. "This paper seeks to resolve this disconnect by tracing the tariff impact on prices of an imported product throughout its journey from the foreign producer—via the importer, wholesaler, and retailer—to the final consumer."

The study "examines the effects of tariffs along the supply chain using product-level data from a large U.S. wine importer in the context of the 2019-2021 U.S. tariffs on European wines." In October 2019, during his first presidential administration, Trump imposed 25-percent tariffs on a variety of European food products, including French wine.

The NBER report found these duties were a bad deal in multiple ways. For one thing, "in an example of tariff engineering, products switched their alcohol content to avoid the tariffs, and new products were introduced that were not subject to the tariffs," the authors found.

For products still subject to tariffs, the report adds that even when prices don't go up by the full amount of the tariff, "we find that it is possible that domestic consumers fully pay for these costs." This is because although "foreign producers partially absorb the tariff by lowering their prices" and "domestic importers only pass

[TITLE]E-Bike Founder’s Path to Purpose:
[TEXT]
By late 2023 Aaron Powell had become disillusioned with Bunch Bikes, the electric cargo bicycle company he founded in 2017. Costs were rising, cash was scarce, and the supply chain was chaotic.

He contemplated chucking it all, selling the business, and moving his family to Europe from his base in Texas.

Then he reconsidered. Bunch Bikes had many positives, including a sense of purpose and meaning from improving customers’ lives. So he stayed.

Aaron first appeared on the podcast two years ago. In this latest conversation, he addressed business uncertainty, resilience, family, and more. Our entire audio is embedded below. The transcript is condensed and edited for clarity.

Eric Bandholz: Who are you, and what do you do?

Aaron Powell: I’m the founder and CEO of Bunch Bikes, an electric family cargo bike company based in Texas. Think of it as the minivan of bikes. It carries pets, groceries, and up to six kids, all with electric assistance and a fun, smooth ride.

I first saw the concept in Copenhagen in 2012. Cargo bikes are hugely popular in Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands, where cycling is central to daily life.

Here in the U.S., far fewer people use bikes for everyday transport, but the potential market is enormous given the population. Awareness of cargo bikes remains low, even within the industry.

Running a bike company over the past few years has been intense with the pandemic and supply chain chaos. By late 2023, my wife and I were reevaluating our lives. We wondered if we’d be happier living elsewhere and began planning a move to the Netherlands. We spent months exploring cities, hiring an immigration lawyer, and figuring out logistics.

During the process, we realized that moving would mean leaving behind friends, family, and community. Our network here in Texas is meaningful. Starting over in a new country, always feeling culturally out of place, didn’t feel worth it.

We decided to stay and focus on making the most of our current life.

Bandholz: You alluded to the business challenges. Did you consider selling the company?

Powell: Yes. I nearly sold it when contemplating the move. We went through the steps of finding a buyer, completing due diligence, and planning the close. I was motivated by fear of uncertainty and market changes.

But the process made me see the positives. We were acquiring customers without running ads, referrals were strong, and our brand equity was driving sales. My team is rock solid — competent, trustworthy, and experienced. I can step away, and the business runs smoothly. That made me question why I’d sell something so well-established.

I’ve found that true value comes from building something meaningful that impacts others. Starting over from scratch doesn’t excite me. Appreciating what we have now has made me excited to tackle new challenges. Demand for our products remains strong. People still want bikes, so why not trust that there’s a path forward and focus on what we already built?

Bandholz: Was your team aware you were considering selling the business?

Powell: No, they weren’t. I didn’t want to spook anyone; employees naturally worry

[TITLE]The Simply Good Foods Company Reports Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results and Provides Fiscal Year 2026 Outlook:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Simply Good Foods Company (Nasdaq: SMPL) (“Simply Good Foods,” or the “Company”), a leader in the Nutritional Snacking category, today reported financial results for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025. The acquisition of Only What You Need, Inc. ("OWYN") was completed on June 13, 2024. Therefore, the Company's year-ago performance for the fourteen and fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, did not include results for the OWYN business for the full period. As we have now passed the anniversary date of the OWYN acquisition, the use of "organic" will refer to growth for brands the Company has owned for more than twelve months on a comparable basis. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2025, "organic" includes year-over-year growth for Simply Good Foods' business excluding the period of time prior to the closing of the OWYN acquisition, as well as the impacts of lapping the extra week in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2024.

Fourth Quarter Summary:(1)

Net sales of $369.0 million versus $375.7 million

Net loss of $12.4 million versus net income of $29.3 million

Loss per diluted share of $0.12 versus earnings per diluted share of $0.29

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (“EPS”) (2) of $0.46 versus $0.50

Adjusted EBITDA(3) $66.2 million versus $77.5 million

Fiscal Year 2026(4) Outlook:

Net sales expected to range between -2% and +2% year-over-year

Gross margins expected to decline between 100 and 150 basis points year-over-year

Adjusted EBITDA expected to range between -4% and +1% year-over-year

“Fiscal year 2025 finished with solid results, with net sales up 9% on a reported basis and 3% Adjusted EBITDA growth. Organic net sales grew 3%, driven by continued strong double-digit consumption for both Quest and OWYN. We largely completed the integration of OWYN, invested meaningfully in our brands and capabilities despite inflationary pressures, and leveraged our strong cash flow to improve our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders," said Geoff Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Simply Good Foods. "Our vision is to be the scaled leader in high protein, low sugar and low carb food and beverage products, where growth is being fueled by a generational shift in consumer eating habits that continues to mainstream. We will achieve this through our simple growth framework of world class innovation, expanding physical availability of our products across the store and online, and through breakthrough marketing to build awareness for our brands. We are building an organization that combines the agility and speed of an insurgent challenger with the advantages of scaled selling and supply chain capabilities, a necessary operating model in an increasingly dynamic marketplace."

"Our outlook for fiscal year 2026 balances our long-term ambition, continued growth expectations for Quest and OWYN and the benefits from productivity, pricing and investments in our brands, against the two important challenges of reduced distribution for Atkins and cost pressures from inflation and tariffs. Even as we face these headwinds, we are taking the right actions for our portfolio, for the category, and for our Company to enable sustainable growth and to create shareholder value for years to come.”

Fourth Quarter 2025 Results(1)

Net sales of $369.0 million decreased $6.6 million, or 1.8%, versus the year ago period driven by a 6.9% headwind from lapping the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Organic growth was a 3.5% benefit, while the OWYN Acquisition contributed $5.6 million, or 1.5%, to reported net sales growth.

Total Simply Good Foods fourth quarter retail takeaway(6) increased

[TITLE]Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA): A Bull Case Theory:
[TEXT]
We came across a bullish thesis on Ulta Beauty, Inc. on X.com by wallstengine. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ULTA. Ulta Beauty, Inc.'s share was trading at $546.75 as of September 30th. ULTA’s trailing and forward P/E were 21.19 and 23.09 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Barclays has upgraded Ulta Beauty (ULTA) from Equal Weight to Overweight, raising its price target to $589 from $518, reflecting growing confidence in the company’s strategic direction under CEO Kecia Steelman, who took the helm in January 2025. Since her appointment, Ulta has implemented a series of rapid and decisive changes that have driven a return to sustainable positive comparable sales and margin expansion, signaling operational improvement across the business. Sequential quarter-over-quarter channel checks indicate a normalization in promotional activity, further supporting a stabilizing earnings trajectory.

The company is also optimizing its retail footprint by slowing the growth of its own-brand stores and planning not to renew the ULTA x Target partnership in August 2026, focusing on higher-margin, strategically positioned locations. Compared with peers, Ulta benefits from relatively low tariff exposure, particularly for goods sourced from Southeast Asia, which reduces cost volatility. Barclays highlights that FY25 guidance is initially conservative, leaving room for potential “beat and raise” quarters throughout the year, which could further drive upside.

Additionally, the broader beauty market, which peaked in 2022, appears to be stabilizing, now growing at a mid-single-digit annual rate, providing a supportive macro backdrop for Ulta’s growth. Overall, the combination of operational improvements, strategic retail optimization, resilient margins, and a recovering beauty industry creates a compelling investment case, suggesting significant upside potential for shareholders while reducing downside risk.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA) by @wallstengine in May 2025, which highlighted accelerating comp momentum, improving consumer engagement, and conservative FY25 guidance creating upside potential. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 34% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as ULTA’s fundamentals continue to improve. Wallstengine shares a similar perspective but emphasizes CEO Steelman’s strategic retail optimization and margin expansion.

Ulta Beauty, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 56 hedge fund portfolios held ULTA at the end of the second quarter which was 42 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of ULTA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]AI and online shopping: how Shein, Temu and others get you hooked:
[TEXT]
In recent years, several websites selling ultra-low-cost goods have appeared on the French market. Shein, Temu and AliExpress, to name but a few, are shaking up the online retail landscape. According to a study conducted by BPCE Digital & Payments, the number of payment cards recording at least one monthly transaction on a discount site increased by 20% between the first quarters of 2022 and 2023.

This is hardly surprising given that Temu’s website has millions of French visitors every month, according to data from the Federation of E-commerce and Distance-Selling (FEVAD). In mid-July 2025, low-cost platforms accounted for 22% of parcels handled by the French postal service, compared with 5% five years ago. This increase is set to continue, with the sector expected to grow by a total of 6.5% in 2025.

Of course, the rampant inflation in France in recent years partly explains this craze. But this is not the only explanation for these developments. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is at the heart of the business model of these platforms, helps to build consumer loyalty.

Read more: The secret behind Temu’s rock-bottom prices

Behavioural profiling

In our latest articles on Shein and Temu, we analysed how these platforms operate behind the scenes. By analysing user behaviour data, the AI tools used by the platforms can identify the customers most likely to make a purchase and tailor the advertising messages they receive.

Predictive algorithms also analyse user behaviour to offer personalised recommendations. This approach aims to create a need before it even arises, by playing on feelings of scarcity and urgency. This is the famous Fomo, or “fear of missing out”.

These predictive algorithms have been around for many years, but their new capabilities, “augmented” by AI tools, are ushering in a new era, adapting even more finely and quickly to each Internet user. At the bottom of each page, there is a list of “items also viewed” by other users, which are similar to the product being searched for. This classic marketing technique is taken a step further: algorithms constantly submit new content to the customer to study their reaction. Every reaction (such as a click to add an item to a basket) is analysed in real time. The algorithm, supported by AI, then uses this data to encourage the user to buy other products that they did not initially come to look for.

Using play to sell

Gamification refers to the use of game mechanics for marketing purposes to capture customers’ attention.

On the Temu app, the interfaces are inspired by gambling games, which are known to be particularly addictive: wheels of fortune, countdowns highlighting limited-time offers, gifts and promotional codes to unlock, etc. These constant stimuli create a sense of urgency in the user, while disrupting the biochemical mechanism of the reward circuit. AI allows for greater precision and diversification of the “games” offered, to the detriment of buyers (and without their full awareness).

On Temu, mini-games integrated into the mobile app (such as Farmland and Fishland) promise free items and discount coupons. Points and voucher systems are used to encourage users to return to the site as often as possible, and personalised notifications are also sent at opportune moments, based on data collected

[TITLE]Is It Time to Buy LVMH Shares?:
[TEXT]
After returning to modest growth in the third quarter of 2025, LVMH remains under pressure from several structural and cyclical challenges that could weigh on its performance into 2026. While demand has stabilized in some key regions, the group continues to navigate weaker appetite for high-end products, volatile economic conditions, and rising operational costs.

This modest yet symbolic growth marks LVMH’s first positive quarter of 2025 and a potential inflection point for the luxury industry. The group’s diverse portfolio — spanning fashion, wines and spirits, perfumes, watches, and retail — continues to act as a barometer for global luxury trends. After a challenging start to the year marked by fading demand in China and uncertainty around U.S. tariffs, the third-quarter uptick suggests that the worst of the slowdown may be behind the sector, even if the path to sustained recovery remains gradual.

Elsewhere, demand in Europe and the United States remained “solid,” reflecting resilient local consumption despite a more cautious global backdrop. LVMH noted a “noticeable” improvement in overall trends across Asia excluding Japan, underscoring a broader regional stabilization after months of uneven demand.

The turnaround was largely driven by a gradual recovery in China, where sales turned positive again for the first time this year. According to Chief Financial Officer Cécile Cabanis, mainland Chinese consumers showed renewed appetite for high-end fashion and experiences, such as Louis Vuitton’s flagship ship-shaped boutique in Shanghai. While spending by travelling Chinese shoppers remained below last year’s levels, the domestic momentum helped offset earlier weakness and restored confidence in Asia’s contribution to growth.

After two consecutive quarters of contraction, LVMH finally returned to growth in the third quarter of 2025, posting a 1% increase in sales to €18.28 billion ($21.17 billion). The rebound comes after a 4% decline in the previous quarter and offers a much-needed sign of stabilization for the world’s largest luxury goods group — and, by extension, for a sector that has faced persistent headwinds since early 2024.

LVMH , the French luxury powerhouse behind Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Moët & Chandon, stands as a global benchmark for the high-end goods industry. As Europe’s second-largest company after semiconductor leader ASML, the group’s performance often sets the tone for the entire luxury sector. Following the release of its latest financial results, investors might be wondering: does LVMH’s recent rebound signal a new phase of growth? And what challenges could still weigh on its momentum? Here’s a closer look.

Story continues

1. The Aftermath of Price Increases

Luxury brands thrived during the pandemic by sharply raising prices, but that strategy is now showing its limits. Between 2020 and 2023, luxury brands increased prices by an average of 36% according to Bernstein—well above inflation—with Dior’s prices surging 51%, Louis Vuitton’s 32%, Bulgari’s 39%, and Tiffany’s 40%. These hikes, which once fueled record profits, are now dampening demand, particularly among aspirational buyers who were key to growth in recent years.

Yet lowering prices isn’t an option. Doing so would erode brand prestige and signal weakened desirability—something luxury houses carefully avoid after spending billions on image and exclusivity. For now, LVMH and its peers are likely to maintain current pricing, waiting for income growth and easing inflation to make their goods feel more affordable. Some may also introduce more accessible product lines to reignite demand without diluting brand value.

2. Tariffs and Trade Uncertainty

The reemergence of tariff tensions is adding new risks. Since August, European exports to the U.S.—which “accounts for around €80 billion of the €363 billion in global luxury goods revenue” according to the French Union of Fashion and Clothing Industries (UFIMH)—have faced a 15% import duty. For LVMH, the challenge lies in finding a balance between preserving margins and maintaining competitiveness. Passing the full tariff cost onto consumers could deter buyers, but absorbing it would compress profits.

As LVMH’s finance chief Cécile Cabanis noted, the impact varies by brand and category. The U.S. remains a crucial market, accounting for a significant share of global luxury sales and serving as a counterbalance to China’s slowdown. Wealthier American consumers, supported by strong stock market gains, continue to spend according to Bank of American, but higher tariffs threaten to test their resilience over the coming quarters.

3. Currency Headwinds

Exchange rate fluctuations have also become a drag on performance. LVMH reported that currency movements reduced revenue by 2% over the first nine months of 2025, and by as much as 5% in the third quarter alone. The appreciation of the euro against major currencies has particularly affected tourist spending—a key driver of luxury sales in Europe—and could continue to weigh on profitability if volatility persists.

4. Rising Gold and Silver Prices

Soaring precious metal prices are another pressure point for LVMH’s jewellery and watch divisions. Gold has more than doubled in two years, surpassing $4,000 an ounce, while silver has climbed above $50. This surge, mostly driven by investor demand for safe havens amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty, as well as higher expectations of rate cuts in the U.S., threatens to squeeze margins at brands like Tiffany and Bulgari, which are among LVMH’s top five profit contributors.

With watches and jewelry making up more than 12% of its revenue, the French group may eventually have to raise prices to offset higher input costs—risking further strain on demand in an already price-sensitive environment.

5. Sluggish Chinese Demand

China’s once-reliable luxury boom has slowed markedly. Weighed down by a property crisis, weak consumer confidence, and the lingering impact of trade tensions, China’s luxury market shrank by between 18 and 20% in 2024 according to Bain & Company, which expects 2025 to remain flat, with only a gradual recovery in the second half as stimulus measures take effect.

Mainland China, which represents roughly a third of LVMH’s global luxury sales, is therefore unlikely to deliver meaningful growth in the short term. Today, the country’s GDP growth figures are likely to show a deceleration to around 4.8% this year and could ease further to 4.3% in 2026 according to Reuters—well below pre-pandemic levels. Until confidence and household wealth recover, Chinese spending on luxury goods will likely remain muted.

6. The Rise of the Secondhand Luxury Market

Finally, the rapid growth of the resale market represents a long-term structural challenge. According to a BCG–Vestiaire Collective report, the secondhand luxury market is expanding three times faster than the primary market, growing 10% annually and projected to reach up to $360 billion by 2030.

While secondhand platforms introduce younger consumers to luxury brands, they also threaten to cannibalize new product sales and weaken the aura of exclusivity that underpins the sector. For LVMH, which has traditionally resisted engaging directly in resale, adapting to this shift will require a careful balance between preserving brand prestige and embracing evolving consumer habits.

What Should Investors Expect from LVMH’s Shares?

LVMH’s latest results have reignited optimism around both the company and the broader luxury sector. The group’s stock surged as much as 14% after reporting its first quarterly sales increase of 2025, marking its strongest single-day gain since 2001. Investors welcomed the rebound as a sign that demand may be stabilizing after a difficult year for global luxury brands. Despite being down around 4.7% since January—trading near €605 per share and still well below its 2023 record high above €900—LVMH is once again drawing attention as a long-term value story rather than a short-term trade.

Daily LVMH Chart – Source: ActivTrades

Analysts are increasingly confident that the worst of the sector’s downturn is behind it. Morgan Stanley recently upgraded its outlook for LVMH, pointing to a “burst of creativity” across the group’s fashion houses and a growing emphasis on more accessible product lines. Kepler Cheuvreux echoed this sentiment, noting that investor enthusiasm at recent Fashion Weeks reflected a strong response to the new collections—an encouraging shift after what many had described as a “creativity crisis” in 2024.

The industry is also adapting to changing consumer behavior. Many luxury brands, including those within the LVMH portfolio, are introducing more affordable items and refreshing their designs to reconnect with younger and more price-sensitive clients. These strategic moves could help balance slower demand in China and offset the effects of past price hikes.

Still, recovery is expected to unfold gradually. UBS forecasts 4% organic growth for the luxury sector in 2026, with meaningful acceleration likely in the second half of next year as new creative directions translate into fresh products on store shelves.

For long-term investors, LVMH remains one of the most resilient and diversified players in global luxury. Its unmatched brand portfolio, strong pricing power, and ability to adapt to shifting trends position it well to regain momentum over time. While short-term volatility may persist, the group’s renewed creative energy and strategic focus suggest that the foundations for its next growth cycle are already being laid.

[TITLE]Finovate Global Mexico: Plata Doubles Valuation; Revolut, SumUp Announce Expansion; and More!:
[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global examines recent fintech news from Mexico.

Earlier this month, ResearchAndMarkets.com published its Mexico Embedded Finance Databook Report for 2025. The 230-page report noted that the embedded finance market in Mexico is expected to reach more than $18 billion this year and top $22 billion by the end of 2030. Among the key takeaways from the report is the increasing traction of embedded credit products such as Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), and the growth of embedded payments in mobility, food delivery, and social commerce driven by growing smartphone use and government support for digital, real-time payments options. Embedded finance solutions such as lending are enabling non-fintech businesses in Mexico to leverage APIs and BaaS to expand their offerings, the report notes. This is helping bring more financial services to underserved communities in the country. It is also creating greater competition for companies in both the lending and payments spaces.

Mexican Fintech Plata Double Valuation on Latest $250 Million Fundraise

Mexican digital financial platform Plata has secured $250 million in new equity funding. The round, which includes both a primary equity raise and a secondary equity transaction, was led by Kora and featured participation from Moore Strategic Ventures, Audio Ventures, Spice Expeditions, Hedosophia, as well as several US and European family offices. The funding builds on an earlier investment by Televisa-Univision and boosts Plata’s valuation to $3.1 billion.

“The growth we have achieved in such a short time demonstrates a clear strategy and a shared conviction: build a strong institution from its foundations,” Plata CEO and Co-Founder Neri Tollardo said. “This transaction reflects investors’ confidence, the strength of our technological model, and the talent we have assembled. We set out to create a digital bank built on innovation, operational excellence, compliance, and efficiency—and today, we are seeing the results of that effort.”

Plata received its banking license in December 2024 and is waiting for authorization to begin banking operations. The company boasts its own technological and operational infrastructure, including a core banking system that enables a fully digital, branchless model with automated risk management and 24/7 personalized customer service. Over the past 30 months, Plata has topped the two million mark in terms of active credit customers, making it one of the fastest-growing digital financial platforms in Latin America. The company’s Plata Card gives users two months to pay without interest and up to 15% of cash back in real money.

“We believe Plata represents the new standard for digital banking in emerging markets,” Kora Co-Founder Nitin Saigal said. “In a very short time, the company has demonstrated impressive execution, combining technological innovation with a clear vision for financial inclusion. We are excited to continue strengthening our partnership and to support Plata in this new phase of growth.”

[TITLE]Study Finds Tariffs Cost Consumers More Than the Government Takes In:
[TEXT]
Tariffs on foreign imports have been a consistent theme of President Donald Trump's terms in office; he even says tariff is "the most beautiful word in the dictionary." But despite his consistent claims to the contrary, tariffs are taxes borne by American consumers, as a new study confirms.

A working paper out this month from the National Board of Economic Research (NBER)—conducted by researchers from Duke University, the University of Chicago, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors—seeks to understand what portion of tariffs American consumers actually bear through higher prices.

The authors note that after tariff increases in Trump's first term, "a wide range of studies" reached different conclusions on when and how tariffs "pass through" and increase the cost of an imported product. "This paper seeks to resolve this disconnect by tracing the tariff impact on prices of an imported product throughout its journey from the foreign producer—via the importer, wholesaler, and retailer—to the final consumer."

The study "examines the effects of tariffs along the supply chain using product-level data from a large U.S. wine importer in the context of the 2019-2021 U.S. tariffs on European wines." In October 2019, during his first presidential administration, Trump imposed 25-percent tariffs on a variety of European food products, including French wine.

The NBER report found these duties were a bad deal in multiple ways. For one thing, "in an example of tariff engineering, products switched their alcohol content to avoid the tariffs, and new products were introduced that were not subject to the tariffs," the authors found.

For products still subject to tariffs, the report adds that even when prices don't go up by the full amount of the tariff, "we find that it is possible that domestic consumers fully pay for these costs." This is because although "foreign producers partially absorb the tariff by lowering their prices" and "domestic importers only pass

[TITLE]Polypropylene Compounds Market Size to Cross USD 50.86 Bn by 2034:
[TEXT]
Ottawa, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global polypropylene compounds market size was valued at USD 23.89 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach around USD 50.86 billion by 2034, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.77% over the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. Asia Pacific dominated the polypropylene compounds market with a market share of 40% in 2024. A study published by Towards Chemical and Materials a sister firm of Precedence Research.

Download a Sample Report Here@ https://www.towardschemandmaterials.com/download-sample/5893

Polypropylene Compounds Overview

The polypropylene compounds market is evolving as industries intensify demand for lightweight, durable, and cost-effective materials that offer chemical resistance and thermal stability, with growth fuelled by expansion in automotive, packaging, construction, and electronics sectors in emerging economies, manufacturers are increasingly focusing on specialty compound formulations and process innovations to meet performance and sustainability needs, while regional dynamics favour strong uptake in Asia Pacific due to industrialization and investment in infrastructure, and innovation trends emphasize enhanced filler systems, property customization, and optimized processing routes to drive differentiation and value growth in the competitive landscape.

Polypropylene Compounds Market Report Highlights

By region, Asia Pacific dominated the market with a 40% industry share in 2024.

By propylene type, the homopolymer segment led the market with 65% industry share in 2024.

By application type, the automotive segment emerged as the top-performing segment in the market with 35% industry share in 2024.

By property type, the impact-resistant segment led the market with a 50% share in 2024.

By process technology, the injection molding segment emerged as the top-performing segment in the market with 45% industry share in 2024.

Properties of Polypropylene compounds

Polypropylene (PP) is the commodity thermoplastic with the lowest density. With lower density, parts are molded with lower weight. Other typical properties of Polypropylene is that it is tough and flexible, especially when copolymerized with ethylene. This allows polypropylene compounds to be used as an engineering thermoplastic, competing with materials such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Polypropylene is at room temperature resistant to fats and almost all organic solvents, apart from strong oxidants. Non-oxidizing acids and bases can be stored in containers made of PP. Polypropylene is recyclable and has the number “5” as its resin identification code.

Structure and Behavior of Polypropylene Compounds

Polypropylene compound shares similarities with polyethylene, particularly in solution behavior and electrical characteristics. However, the presence of methyl groups in polypropylene enhances its mechanical strength and thermal resistance, albeit at the expense of reduced chemical resistance. In isotactic polypropylene, the methyl groups are aligned on one side of the carbon backbone, resulting in higher crystallinity. This configuration makes it firmer and more resistant to creep compared to atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.

Introduction to Polypropylene (PP)

Polypropylene (PP) belongs to the polyolefin family and is among the three most widely used thermoplastics globally. PP compounds are utilized across many applications, such as:

Automotive industry

Industrial applications

Consumer goods

Furniture and household products

One notable advantage of PP is its low density, the lowest among commodity plastics.

Polypropylene Polymer Structures

Based on the spatial arrangement of methyl groups (CH₃) on the polymer chain, polypropylene is classified into:

Atactic PP : Irregular methyl group arrangement

: Irregular methyl group arrangement Isotactic PP : Methyl groups aligned on one side of the chain

: Methyl groups aligned on one side of the chain Syndiotactic PP: Alternating methyl group arrangement

[TITLE]Finovate Global Mexico: Plata Doubles Valuation; Revolut, SumUp Announce Expansion; and More!:
[TEXT]
This week’s edition of Finovate Global examines recent fintech news from Mexico.

Earlier this month, ResearchAndMarkets.com published its Mexico Embedded Finance Databook Report for 2025. The 230-page report noted that the embedded finance market in Mexico is expected to reach more than $18 billion this year and top $22 billion by the end of 2030. Among the key takeaways from the report is the increasing traction of embedded credit products such as Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), and the growth of embedded payments in mobility, food delivery, and social commerce driven by growing smartphone use and government support for digital, real-time payments options. Embedded finance solutions such as lending are enabling non-fintech businesses in Mexico to leverage APIs and BaaS to expand their offerings, the report notes. This is helping bring more financial services to underserved communities in the country. It is also creating greater competition for companies in both the lending and payments spaces.

Mexican Fintech Plata Double Valuation on Latest $250 Million Fundraise

Mexican digital financial platform Plata has secured $250 million in new equity funding. The round, which includes both a primary equity raise and a secondary equity transaction, was led by Kora and featured participation from Moore Strategic Ventures, Audio Ventures, Spice Expeditions, Hedosophia, as well as several US and European family offices. The funding builds on an earlier investment by Televisa-Univision and boosts Plata’s valuation to $3.1 billion.

“The growth we have achieved in such a short time demonstrates a clear strategy and a shared conviction: build a strong institution from its foundations,” Plata CEO and Co-Founder Neri Tollardo said. “This transaction reflects investors’ confidence, the strength of our technological model, and the talent we have assembled. We set out to create a digital bank built on innovation, operational excellence, compliance, and efficiency—and today, we are seeing the results of that effort.”

Plata received its banking license in December 2024 and is waiting for authorization to begin banking operations. The company boasts its own technological and operational infrastructure, including a core banking system that enables a fully digital, branchless model with automated risk management and 24/7 personalized customer service. Over the past 30 months, Plata has topped the two million mark in terms of active credit customers, making it one of the fastest-growing digital financial platforms in Latin America. The company’s Plata Card gives users two months to pay without interest and up to 15% of cash back in real money.

“We believe Plata represents the new standard for digital banking in emerging markets,” Kora Co-Founder Nitin Saigal said. “In a very short time, the company has demonstrated impressive execution, combining technological innovation with a clear vision for financial inclusion. We are excited to continue strengthening our partnership and to support Plata in this new phase of growth.”

[TITLE]AI and online shopping: how Shein, Temu and others get you hooked:
[TEXT]
In recent years, several websites selling ultra-low-cost goods have appeared on the French market. Shein, Temu and AliExpress, to name but a few, are shaking up the online retail landscape. According to a study conducted by BPCE Digital & Payments, the number of payment cards recording at least one monthly transaction on a discount site increased by 20% between the first quarters of 2022 and 2023.

This is hardly surprising given that Temu’s website has millions of French visitors every month, according to data from the Federation of E-commerce and Distance-Selling (FEVAD). In mid-July 2025, low-cost platforms accounted for 22% of parcels handled by the French postal service, compared with 5% five years ago. This increase is set to continue, with the sector expected to grow by a total of 6.5% in 2025.

Of course, the rampant inflation in France in recent years partly explains this craze. But this is not the only explanation for these developments. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is at the heart of the business model of these platforms, helps to build consumer loyalty.

Read more: The secret behind Temu’s rock-bottom prices

Behavioural profiling

In our latest articles on Shein and Temu, we analysed how these platforms operate behind the scenes. By analysing user behaviour data, the AI tools used by the platforms can identify the customers most likely to make a purchase and tailor the advertising messages they receive.

Predictive algorithms also analyse user behaviour to offer personalised recommendations. This approach aims to create a need before it even arises, by playing on feelings of scarcity and urgency. This is the famous Fomo, or “fear of missing out”.

These predictive algorithms have been around for many years, but their new capabilities, “augmented” by AI tools, are ushering in a new era, adapting even more finely and quickly to each Internet user. At the bottom of each page, there is a list of “items also viewed” by other users, which are similar to the product being searched for. This classic marketing technique is taken a step further: algorithms constantly submit new content to the customer to study their reaction. Every reaction (such as a click to add an item to a basket) is analysed in real time. The algorithm, supported by AI, then uses this data to encourage the user to buy other products that they did not initially come to look for.

Using play to sell

Gamification refers to the use of game mechanics for marketing purposes to capture customers’ attention.

On the Temu app, the interfaces are inspired by gambling games, which are known to be particularly addictive: wheels of fortune, countdowns highlighting limited-time offers, gifts and promotional codes to unlock, etc. These constant stimuli create a sense of urgency in the user, while disrupting the biochemical mechanism of the reward circuit. AI allows for greater precision and diversification of the “games” offered, to the detriment of buyers (and without their full awareness).

On Temu, mini-games integrated into the mobile app (such as Farmland and Fishland) promise free items and discount coupons. Points and voucher systems are used to encourage users to return to the site as often as possible, and personalised notifications are also sent at opportune moments, based on data collected

[TEXT]
You check prices online for a flight to Melbourne today. It’s $300. You leave your browser open. Two hours later, it’s $320. Half a day later, $280. Welcome to the world of algorithmic pricing, where technology tries to figure out what price you’re willing to pay.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quietly remaking how companies set prices. Not only do prices shift with demand (dynamic pricing), but firms are increasingly tailoring prices to individual customers (personalised pricing).

This change isn’t just technical – it raises big questions
