[TITLE]Enugu, EU deepen partnership to boost education, energy, infrastructure:
[TEXT]
The Enugu State Government and the European Union have renewed commitments to deepen cooperation across key sectors of the state’s economy, including education, energy, infrastructure, and youth development.

This followed a courtesy visit to Governor Peter Mbah at Government House, Enugu, by a high-powered EU delegation led by the EU Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr Gautier Mignot, according to a statement released by the governor’s media office on Saturday.

The team also included the Belgian Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Pieter Leenknegt; the Portuguese Ambassador, Mr Paulos Martins dos Santos; and several senior European diplomats.

Speaking during the meeting, Ambassador Mignot said the EU was eager to expand a partnership that aligns directly with the transformational policies of the Mbah administration.

“The purpose of our visit is to meet you, pay our respects, and discuss how to strengthen the partnership between the European Union and Enugu State. We are very interested in areas where our projects meet your administration’s expectations and long-term vision,” he said.

Mignot highlighted ongoing collaborations in the education and energy sectors, describing Enugu as one of the EU’s key beneficiary states.

“In the energy sector, the Solar for Health project is already under implementation. Under this programme, Enugu will receive technical assistance and funding for 20 solar microgrids to power 20 primary healthcare centres and 124 small and medium-sized enterprises,” he explained.

He also noted that the Small Hydro Power for Agro-industrial Sectors Project, implemented by UNIDO, and the Nigeria Energy Support Programme of GIZ were supporting electrification efforts, investment advisory services, and capacity building.

“Three interconnected minigrids of up to 1 MW capacity will also be funded to electrify at least 1,000 beneficiaries,” Mignot added.

On education, he announced that Enugu had been selected as one of the states to benefit from the Education and Youth Empowerment in Nigeria (EISS) programme implemented by UNESCO.

“The programme will train teachers in Smart Green Schools until June 2028. Building resilience and capacity among teachers is central to our goals,” the EU envoy said.

He also referenced the EU’s support for the Eastern Nigeria International Film Festival (ENIFF), describing it as a key platform for creative and cultural exchange.

“The 2025 edition in Enugu provided training for aspiring filmmakers and awarded grants for short film projects. We value this growing partnership with the creative industry,” Mignot noted.

Belgian Ambassador Pieter Leenknegt pointed to Belgium’s long-standing economic footprint in Enugu, particularly through Emenite Limited — a joint venture established in 1961.

“Emenite has over 300 employees from this region. It remains a shining example of Belgian–Nigerian cooperation. We want to continue strengthening this relationship,” he said.

Portuguese Ambassador Paulos Martins dos Santos emphasised Portugal’s wide-ranging interest in Nigeria’s energy, agricultural, and infrastructure sectors.

“The footprint of the European Union in this country is huge and multidimensional. Portugal looks forward to enhancing its contribution to this partnership, especially in areas that complement Enugu’s development plans,” he stressed.

In his remarks, Governor Mbah praised the EU for aligning its programmes with his administration’s development priorities.

“I see a strong synergy between our vision in Enugu and the EU’s programmes across Africa. Our investment of over 33 per cent of our total budget in education is deliberate. If we fail to equip our children today, we will pay ten times more in the future,” he said.

He also invited EU member states to explore emerging investment opportunities in Enugu’s aviation, natural gas, and energy sectors.

“We have launched Enugu Air, and the international wing of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport will soon become operational. We encourage you to speak to your home carriers to begin to consider direct flights to Enugu,” the governor announced.

On the state’s gas infrastructure ambitions, Mbah added: “We are working with the Federal Government to expand the gas pipeline infrastructure. This will unlock enormous economic opportunities in the gas subsector. Enugu is open for business, and we will do everything necessary to ensure investments succeed.”

The visit ended with both parties reaffirming their commitment to sustained collaboration aimed at accelerating development and improving livelihoods across Enugu State.

[TITLE]Crude-for-loans: NNPCL battles N8.07tn outstanding debt:
[TEXT]
The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited is burdened with crude-backed loan obligations estimated at N8.07tn, according to an analysis of its 2024 financial statements and capital-commitment disclosures.

The liabilities stretch across multiple forward-sale and project-financing arrangements that are expected to be serviced through substantial crude oil and gas deliveries. The commitments have become a major pillar of NNPCL’s funding structure following years of fiscal pressure, volatile crude production, and declining upstream investment.

Several of the facilities were used to refinance older debts, fund refinery rehabilitation, support cash flow, and meet government revenue obligations.

One of the major exposures is tied to the Eagle Export Funding arrangement. Although the 2024 financial statement notes that “at least 1.8 million barrels” must be delivered per cycle, earlier reporting by The PUNCH shows the facility consists of three separate loan tranches.

The first, a $935m loan obtained in 2020 and backed by 30,000 barrels per day, was fully repaid by September 2023. A second tranche of $635m was also cleared within the same period. The only outstanding portion is the Project Eagle Export Funding Subsequent 2 Debt, a $900m facility secured in 2023 and pledged against 21,000 barrels per day.

Repayment is scheduled to begin in June 2024, with final maturity expected in 2028. As of December 2024, the outstanding balance stood at N1.1tn, making Eagle one of the company’s significant forward-sale exposures.

“The Company had capital commitments of N1.1tn as at the year ended 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: N1.2tn). This relates to the forward sale agreement with Eagle Export Funding Limited for the delivery of Crude Oil.

“Under the contract, Eagle Export Funding Limited will make an upfront payment to NEPL for crude in a Forward Sale Agreement. The payment received is required to be settled with the delivery of crude oil volumes, i.e., NEPL sells crude to Eagle Export Funding Limited based on a delivery schedule.

“Based on the agreement, at least 1,800,000 barrels of Crude oil must be nominated and scheduled by NEPL (and delivered at the relevant delivery terminal to Eagle Export Limited in every delivery period commencing on 28 August 2020,” the company’s financial statement read.

Another major obligation arises from the incremental gas-supply financing arrangement with the Nigeria LNG Limited. Under the agreement, NLNG provided upfront funding of N772bn for gas supplies to be delivered over time.

By the close of 2024, gas worth N535bn had been drawn and N312bn recovered by NLNG, leaving N460bn yet to be supplied. A financing charge of N12bn also accrued in the period, bringing the total outstanding balance to N472bn.

The refinery rehabilitation programme accounts for some of the largest crude-secured debt commitments. Project Yield, the financing structure backing the Port Harcourt Refinery upgrade, had an outstanding drawdown of N1.4tn at the end of 2024.

The agreement requires NNPCL to deliver refined-product-equivalent volumes of 67,000 barrels per day, with repayment scheduled to begin in June 2025 after a two-and-a-half-year moratorium.

“This is a 7-year N1.5tn PxF loan obtained in October 2022 for general corporate purposes with the ultimate use being the execution of the EPC Contract between PHRC and Tecnimont for the rehabilitation of Port Harcourt Refinery.

“It is secured with a forward sale of refined product equivalent of 67kbpd of crude oil. As of 31 December 2024, the amount drawn is N1.4tn with principal repayment to commence in June 2025 after a moratorium period of 2 years and 6 months.

Therefore, loan commitment as of 31 December 2024 is N1.4tn,” the financial statement read.

Similarly, Project Leopard, another crude-backed forward-sale facility, carried an outstanding balance of N1.3tn. The five-year financing agreement commits the company to deliver 35,000 barrels of crude oil per day, with repayments expected to commence in mid-2025 following a six-month moratorium.

The most significant exposure is tied to Project Gazelle, a large crude-for-cash arrangement used to finance advance tax and royalty payments on Production Sharing Contract assets.

NNPCL had drawn N4.9tn out of the total N5.1tn facility by December 2024. Crude valued at N991bn had been delivered, leaving an outstanding N3.8tn. The agreement requires sustained deliveries of 90,000 barrels per day until the liability is fully extinguished.

When assessed together, the company’s major crude-for-loan facilities—Eagle Export Funding (21,000 bpd), Project Yield (67,000 bpd), Project Leopard (35,000 bpd), and Project Gazelle (90,000 bpd)—represent a combined commitment of 213,000 barrels per day, in addition to separate gas-delivery obligations under the NLNG arrangement.

The volume equates to a sizeable share of Nigeria’s daily crude output, underscoring the long-term implications of these arrangements for government revenue, export allocation, and operational flexibility.

The PUNCH excluded non-debt commitments such as equity stakes in refinery projects and callable capital, which do not qualify as loan obligations. Industry analysts warn that the weight of the obligations leaves NNPCL exposed to fluctuations in crude production and earnings.

The PUNCH earlier reported that Nigeria’s gross profit from crude oil and gas sales plunged by N824.66bn in 2024 despite a rebound in oil production, according to figures from the latest Budget Implementation Report for the fourth quarter of 2024 released by the Budget Office of the Federation.

Data from the report revealed that gross profit from crude and gas sales fell to N1.08tn during the year, from N1.90tn in 2023, representing a 43.32 per cent decline.

The 2024 performance was also 26.3 per cent below the government’s budgeted target of N1.46tn, underscoring the persistence of weak fiscal inflows from the petroleum sector despite policy reforms aimed at boosting revenue.

Nigeria’s crude output fluctuated between 1.4 and 1.6 million barrels per day, below the 1.78 million barrels per day target used in the 2024 budget.

Despite being the country’s traditional fiscal anchor, gross profit from crude oil and gas sales accounted for only

[TITLE]Bakare Claims Trump is Targeting Nigeria's Oil Wealth:
[TEXT]
The Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has claimed that the motive behind President Donald Trump’s recent designation of Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” and his allegations of Christian genocide is the US president’s interest in Nigeria’s oil wealth.

According to Bakare, who spoke during a State of the Nation Address at the Citadel Global Community Church on Sunday, the Trump administration considers Nigeria’s oil wealth, other mineral resources and critical sectors such as real estate as central to its agenda.

He added that Trump was also keen on Nigeria’s role in the value chain of emerging technologies, which he described as major pillars of the American leader’s foreign and economic policy.

The address marked Bakare’s first public reaction since Trump’s October 31 redesignation of Nigeria as a CPC and his subsequent “guns-a-blazing, fast, vicious and sweet attack on terrorists in Nigeria” comments, which triggered swift responses from the President Bola Tinubu administration.

Bakare recalled that shortly after Trump won the 2024 US election, he received a vision in which the American leader arrived in Sabo, Yaba, Lagos, aboard Air Force One, “dressed in Arabian thobe and ghutra” and declaring, “We are here now.”

He said the revelation signalled a “particular interest” Trump would take in Nigeria linked to Middle East politics, oil and gas, real estate, and the country’s expanding technology sector.

Bakare said, “It was clear to us that President Donald Trump was going to have a particular interest in Nigeria.

“Nigeria’s oil wealth and other mineral resources will be critical to the Trump presidency, as will our role in the value chain of emerging technologies.”

He added that the symbolic attire in the vision pointed to “religious implications” that could spark tensions if not properly managed.

“Trump’s Muslim attire was a clear indication that his interest in Nigeria could have serious religious implications, such that could cause religiously motivated social unrest,” he said.

Bakare labelled Trump’s leadership style transactional and urged the Federal Government to respond with a structured economic plan.

“President Donald Trump has proven to be a transactional leader whose threats are usually invitations to the negotiating table,” he said.

“The Nigerian government should present the United States with a mutually beneficial business proposal, one that will facilitate US business interests while guaranteeing Nigeria’s security, educational development, industrialisation and access to cutting-edge technologies.”

He urged the Federal Government to negotiate a strategic business deal with Washington rather than wait to be pressured, stressing that Nigeria must not miss the window of opportunity.

While he did not disclose details of his proposed plan, he insisted that Nigeria’s long-term development depended on striking agreements anchored on national interest.

President Tinubu, last week, appointed National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, to head Nigeria’s delegation on the US-Nigeria joint working group to deepen collaboration between the two countries on security.

The former Vice-Presidential candidate also warned that the country’s worsening insecurity had exposed deep structural wounds long ignored by successive governments.

He said the Middle Belt, North-West and South-East had become flashpoints of unresolved grievances, banditry, terror networks and communal mistrust.

“To deny that Christians have been targeted in many Middle Belt communities is to turn the truth on its head,” he said.

According to him, the continued killings across Benue, Plateau, Southern Kaduna and other Middle Belt states were a “shame on the Nigerian state.”

He criticised the National Assembly for remaining silent on the insecurity crisis until the US Congress debated the issue, accusing lawmakers of prioritising 2027 politicking and defections over national security.

In the same vein, he faulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for being reactive and failing to galvanise diplomatic goodwill to support Nigeria’s war against terror.

He said, “It is a shame on the Nigerian government that these communities would resort to calling on the American government to help because their own government has failed them woefully.

“It is a shame on our National Assembly that it took the United States Congress — not the representatives elected by Nigerians — to convene a hearing on the lived experiences of citizens suffering under insecurity, while those in Abuja were busy with politicking, posturing for political relevance, defecting from one political party to another in their desperate manoeuvres to secure their seats ahead of the 2027 elections.

“It is indeed a shame that Nigeria’s foreign affairs architecture failed all the while to mobilise Nigeria’s dwindling diplomatic goodwill to secure international support for the war on terror, only to respond with excuses when that goodwill reached its lowest ebb.”

Bakare added that tensions in the South-East, exacerbated by the detention and trial of separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu, showed that Nigeria had not healed from the 1967-1970 Civil War.

Bakare said President Bola Tinubu stood at a decisive junction where he must choose between political calculations ahead of 2027 and the tougher path of structural reforms.

Although he acknowledged the President’s efforts to recruit more security personnel and declare limited security emergencies, he insisted that only bold action could stabilise the country.

His proposed measures included a national apology, a Victims and Survivors Register, increased boots on the ground using veterans and paramilitary forces, technology-enabled surveillance, “tech-to-industry diplomacy” to attract American military AI systems and the establishment of state, zonal and community policing systems under federal coordination.

“This would entail the President owning the failure of government over the decades to protect the victims and survivors of banditry, terrorism and other forms of insecurity.

“It would entail opening a Victims and Survivors Register. Then, at the end of three months, in a solemn address to the nation, the President would tender an apology on behalf of the Nigerian state to victimised communities across the nation, calling each community by name, and, possibly, some of the families most gruesomely hit in the attacks.

“Such an acknowledgement would expectably be followed by compensation in the mid-term phase,” Bakare said.

He also urged Tinubu to set up a Presidential Commission for National Reconciliation, Reintegration and Restructuring, insisting that Nigeria’s real challenge was what he called “the Nigeria Question” — identity, dignity, equity, coexistence and governance.

According to him, solving these issues was the foundation for ending decades of instability.

“No nation can be built on denial,” Bakare said. “If we are to sit at the table of brotherhood, we must acknowledge the truth and confront it.”

He warned that Nigeria must move beyond piecemeal responses and embrace long-delayed structural reforms, arguing that the best of the North and South must unite to negotiate a new national settlement.

As part of long-term solutions, Bakare called for the empowerment of zonal, state and local policing systems to ensure faster response times, local accountability and community trust.

He also called for the recalibration of the national security architecture through a “technical non-political Directorate of National Intelligence,” which would free the National Security Adviser to focus on his role as the President’s political appointee.

He emphasised the need for “the establishment of a Zonal Security Council in each of the six geopolitical zones, chaired by governors from the respective zone on a rotating basis, incorporating state and local policing systems into the framework of each Zonal Council.”

He said, “The representation of the Zonal Security Councils in the National Security Council through their serving chairpersons at each point in time.

“The transformation of the federal police force into a national investigative body focused on intelligence gathering, complex investigations and inter-jurisdictional crimes, serving as Nigeria’s premier investigative body.”

In addition, he called for the replacement of the one-year National Youth Service Corps with a two-year scheme, “the first year of which would be deployed towards military training and deployment.”

Bakare further advocated a dual foreign policy architecture – the Trans-Saharan and Trans-Atlantic – with the former engaging the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula for the “progressive acculturation of northern Nigeria and the stabilisation of the Sahel,” and the latter driving cooperation with the West.

[TITLE]Oil climbs over $1 a barrel on OPEC action, Ukraine attack:
[TEXT]
HOUSTON, Dec 1 : Oil prices rose more than 1 per cent on Monday following drone attacks by Ukraine, the closure of Venezuelan airspace by the United States, and OPEC's decision to leave output levels unchanged in the first quarter of 2026.

Brent crude futures settled at $63.17 a barrel, up 79 cents, or 1.27 per cent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude finished at $59.32 a barrel, up 77 cents, or 1.32 per cent.

[TITLE]Texas Producer Battles California to Restart Offshore Oil Platforms:
[TEXT]
A Texas oil firm is fighting an uphill battle with the state of California to restart crude oil production and sales from three platforms in federal waters offshore Santa Barbara.

Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp, led by industry veteran James Flores, is embroiled in contentious legal battles with California’s agencies and attorney general over a project to restore and re-launch a pipeline from the offshore fields to the coast. Faced with California’s opposition and lawsuits, Sable is proposing an alternative plan to ship oil via shuttle tankers with operations in federal waters only, which would bypass California’s state agencies.

Despite the support of the Trump Administration for federal oil-producing projects, Sable is fielding a growing number of lawsuits from California, and analysts say the firm could run out of funds and default on a loan before clearing hurdles in the most inhospitable U.S. state for the oil industry.

Sable Offshore bought in 2021 three platforms from ExxonMobil in federal waters offshore Santa Barbara County by financing part of the deal with a $625-million loan from the U.S. supermajor.

The platforms were shut down in 2015 following an oil spill due to a corroded pipeline that released

A high-level expert committee set up by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has called for sweeping structural reforms to create a free, competitive natural gas market in India, arguing that market-driven pricing and open access are essential for the country's clean energy transition.In its report, Vision 2040 - Natural Gas Infrastructure in India, the panel led by former PNGRB chairperson D K Sarraf said a liberalised gas market would enhance transparency, spur investment, improve resource allocation and deepen liquidity.A competitive system, it said, would remove current market distortions and attract new players across exploration, pipelines, LNG terminals and city gas distribution.Natural gas, extracted from underground and offshore reservoirs, is used to generate power, produce fertiliser, turned into CNG to power vehicles, piped to household kitchens for cooking and serve as feedstock across several industries. Seen as a key transition fuel as India shifts from fossil fuels to renewables, its role in the energy mix is set to expand.The government aims to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030, up from the current 6.2 per cent.India's present pricing framework - an assortment of government-regulated gas, market-linked domestic production and LNG imports - creates inefficiencies, the committee noted. It flagged resale restrictions in regasified LNG (RLNG) contracts, lack of an Independent System Operator (ISO), limited open access to infrastructure, and the absence of contract-path transmission tariffs and location-based taxation as major hurdles.Although India is among the world's fastest-growing gas markets, it still lacks a liquid trading hub for price discovery. A robust market would bring the country closer to global hubs such as Henry Hub, NBP and TTF, enable flexible contracting and support better hedging mechanisms, the panel said.The panel suggested the creation of a neutral, not-for-profit ISO to manage pipeline capacity, system balancing, scheduling and settlements. The proposed ISO would ensure transparent, non-discriminatory access to the transmission network and curb monopolistic practices.It also proposed a unified online platform for real-time pipeline capacity booking under PNGRB oversight, along with a real-time bulletin board integrating SCADA data to publish capacity, flows, maintenance schedules and outages.To boost liquidity, the committee urged a ban on resale restrictions and destination clauses in RLNG contracts, allowing buyers to freely resell gas in response to market conditions - bringing India in line with mature markets in Europe and the US.For liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals, it recommended a transparent third-party access framework, including clear tariffs, rule-based operating procedures, 'use-it-or-lose-it' provisions and secondary capacity trading on authorised exchanges.The panel backed a shift from route-based to entry-exit gas transportation tariffs. This structure - common in advanced markets - would allow shippers to book entry and exit capacities independently, simplify flows across the grid and pave the way for a virtual national gas hub and an eventual Indian gas benchmark.To strengthen market liquidity, the report called for greater participation of large consumers such as fertiliser, power, CGD, refinery and petrochemical companies on gas exchanges. It also sought the removal of caps on high-pressure, high-temperature (HP-HT) gas trading, phased inclusion of administered price mechanism (APM) gas, and the launch of Gas Release Programmes mandating a portion of domestic or LNG supplies be sold through exchanges.The panel further recommended aligning gas and power markets by synchronising gas and power days and introducing a day-ahead gas market with four six-hour trading blocks to facilitate flexible bidding.Highlighting ongoing decarbonisation efforts, the committee proposed a Renewable Gas Certificate (RGC) mechanism for compressed biogas. A regulated, market-based trading system would allow obligated and voluntary entities to meet renewable gas blending targets through tradable certificates.

[TITLE]Ellomay Capital Reports Publication of Financial Statements of Dorad Energy Ltd. as of and for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025:
[TEXT]
TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and USA, today reported the publication in Israel of financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 of Dorad Energy Ltd. (“Dorad”), in which Ellomay currently indirectly holds approximately 16.9% through its indirect 50% ownership of Ellomay Luzon Energy Infrastructures Ltd. (“Ellomay Luzon Energy”).

On November 30, 2025, Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd. (the “Luzon Group”), an Israeli public company that currently holds the remaining 50% of Ellomay Luzon Energy, which, in turn, holds 33.75% of Dorad, published its quarterly report in Israel based on the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968. Based on applicable regulatory requirements, the quarterly report of the Luzon Group includes the financial statements of Dorad for the same period.

The financial statements of Dorad as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Ellomay will include its indirect share of these results (through its holdings in Ellomay Luzon Energy) in its financial results for this period. In an effort to provide Ellomay’s shareholders with access to Dorad’s financial results (which were published in Hebrew), Ellomay hereby provides a convenience translation of Dorad’s financial results.

Dorad Financial Highlights

Dorad’s revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 919.1 million.

Dorad’s operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 205.8 million.

Based on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad’s customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. The months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: summer – June-September; winter – December-February; and intermediate (spring and autumn) – March-May and October-November. There is a higher demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad’s revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs – TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons. Therefore, the results presented for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, which include the summer months of July-September, are not indicative of full year results. In addition, due to various reasons, including the effects of the increase in the Israeli CPI impacting interest payments by Dorad on its credit facility and regulatory changes, the results included herein may not be indicative of third quarter results in the future or comparable to third quarter results in the past.

A convenience translation of the financial results for Dorad as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and as of and for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is included at the end of this

[TITLE]Khaite and Yagi Tsusho Form Joint Venture for Japan:
[TEXT]
LAND OF THE RISING SUN: Khaite is headed to Japan. The New York designer brand has teamed with Yagi Tsusho Ltd. to form Khaite Japan Corp., a joint venture that marks the beginning of a long-term strategic partnership.

Yagi Tsusho will formally launch Khaite in the Japanese market for the fall season next year.

“Japan represents both a pivotal and natural progression for Khaite,” said Brigitte Kleine, chief executive officer of the company. “In Yagi Tsusho, we have found a partner whose heritage, expertise, and deep relationships within the Japanese market align seamlessly with our commitment to unique storytelling, craftsmanship and quality.”

Yagi Tsusho, who founded the Japanese company in 1946, called Khaite “one of the most promising fashion brands.”

Yagi Tsusho started off in Osaka and Tokyo, but has built a global presence with offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia. It also has a joint venture with Moncler and owns the European fashion brand Mackintosh. Through the joint venture, Yagi Tsusho will use its local operational expertise and relationships to introduce Khaite in key retail and digital channels in Japan.

Creative director Catherine Holstein founded Khaite in 2016 and quickly carved out a niche — gaining recognition with luxe shoppers, as well as awards and investment.

Holstein won the CFDA’s American Womenswear Designer of the Year award in both 2022 and 2023.

In 2023, Khaite sold a stake to New York growth equity firm Stripes, where Kleine — who helped take Tory Burch from one store to $1.2 billion in sales as president — is an operating partner.

A high-level expert committee set up by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has called for sweeping structural reforms to create a free, competitive natural gas market in India, arguing that market-driven pricing and open access are essential for the country's clean energy transition.In its report, Vision 2040 - Natural Gas Infrastructure in India, the panel led by former PNGRB chairperson D K Sarraf said a liberalised gas market would enhance transparency, spur investment, improve resource allocation and deepen liquidity.A competitive system, it said, would remove current market distortions and attract new players across exploration, pipelines, LNG terminals and city gas distribution.Natural gas, extracted from underground and offshore reservoirs, is used to generate power, produce fertiliser, turned into CNG to power vehicles, piped to household kitchens for cooking and serve as feedstock across several industries. Seen as a key transition fuel as India shifts from fossil fuels to renewables, its role in the energy mix is set to expand.The government aims to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030, up from the current 6.2 per cent.India's present pricing framework - an assortment of government-regulated gas, market-linked domestic production and LNG imports - creates inefficiencies, the committee noted. It flagged resale restrictions in regasified LNG (RLNG) contracts, lack of an Independent System Operator (ISO), limited open access to infrastructure, and the absence of contract-path transmission tariffs and location-based taxation as major hurdles.Although India is among the world's fastest-growing gas markets, it still lacks a liquid trading hub for price discovery. A robust market would bring the country closer to global hubs such as Henry Hub, NBP and TTF, enable flexible contracting and support better hedging mechanisms, the panel said.The panel suggested the creation of a neutral, not-for-profit ISO to manage pipeline capacity, system balancing, scheduling and settlements. The proposed ISO would ensure transparent, non-discriminatory access to the transmission network and curb monopolistic practices.It also proposed a unified online platform for real-time pipeline capacity booking under PNGRB oversight, along with a real-time bulletin board integrating SCADA data to publish capacity, flows, maintenance schedules and outages.To boost liquidity, the committee urged a ban on resale restrictions and destination clauses in RLNG contracts, allowing buyers to freely resell gas in response to market conditions - bringing India in line with mature markets in Europe and the US.For liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals, it recommended a transparent third-party access framework, including clear tariffs, rule-based operating procedures, 'use-it-or-lose-it' provisions and secondary capacity trading on authorised exchanges.The panel backed a shift from route-based to entry-exit gas transportation tariffs. This structure - common in advanced markets - would allow shippers to book entry and exit capacities independently, simplify flows across the grid and pave the way for a virtual national gas hub and an eventual Indian gas benchmark.To strengthen market liquidity, the report called for greater participation of large consumers such as fertiliser, power, CGD, refinery and petrochemical companies on gas exchanges. It also sought the removal of caps on high-pressure, high-temperature (HP-HT) gas trading, phased inclusion of administered price mechanism (APM) gas, and the launch of Gas Release Programmes mandating a portion of domestic or LNG supplies be sold through exchanges.The panel further recommended aligning gas and power markets by synchronising gas and power days and introducing a day-ahead gas market with four six-hour trading blocks to facilitate flexible bidding.Highlighting ongoing decarbonisation efforts, the committee proposed a Renewable Gas Certificate (RGC) mechanism for compressed biogas. A regulated, market-based trading system would allow obligated and voluntary entities to meet renewable gas blending targets through tradable certificates.

[TITLE]Geothermal Breakthrough in South Texas Signals New Era for ERCOT:
[TEXT]
In just 12 months, Sage Geosystems and San Miguel Electric Cooperative built the world’s first pressure geothermal system. It is now poised to deliver long-duration, dispatchable storage for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) as variable generation and data center demand surge.

In Christine, Texas—a town of barely 365 people an hour south of San Antonio—San Miguel Electric Cooperative Inc. (SMECI) is pulling off a transformation that will redefine rural generation. Borne out of efforts to bring reliable, affordable power to South Texas’s overlooked ranchlands and small towns, the member-owned cooperative built and commissioned a 391-MW mine-mouth lignite power plant at the Atascosa County site, tapping deposits from its own San Miguel Mine. For more than 40 years, that plant, the entity’s only unit, provided baseload power to 47 counties through a wholesale contract with member-customer South Texas Electric Cooperative (STEC), and functioning as a critical anchor in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s (ERCOT’s) South Load Zone.

While coal, fueled by locally mined lignite, has long been SMECI’s backbone, the cooperative has been working to ensure it can sustain its baseload responsibility while transitioning to cleaner resources, easing the early retirement of the lignite plant ahead of STEC’s 2037 contract expiry. “Unlike investor-owned utilities, we are operated by and for the people of South Texas in predominantly rural areas—regions that had historically been overlooked,” the cooperative notes on its website. “We have one simple goal: reliable power, not making a profit.”

That mission drove two landmark efforts last year: a first-of-its-kind geothermal partnership with Sage Geosystems to launch a Pressure Geothermal pilot and an application to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s New Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program—which in December secured over $1.4 billion in grants and low-interest loans—to replace the lignite unit with 400 MW of solar and 200 MW of battery storage by 2027.

The geothermal pilot, SMECI Well #1, is the first piece of that vision to materialize. Moving from funding approval to “ready to store” in just 12 months, Sage completed drilling, fracture stimulation, surface-facility installation, and commissioning by August 2025. Leveraging innovative design, existing oilfield expertise, and streamlined permitting, the 3-MW/4–6-hour system has transformed a pioneering underground energy storage concept into a fully built asset in record time. While the project is still awaiting grid interconnection—currently slated for December 2025—the pioneering project has showcased a new model for firm, dispatchable capacity in ERCOT’s evolving grid, and is well worthy of this POWERTop Plant award.

First-of-a-Kind Geothermal Energy Storage

For Sage, the project marks the first commercial-scale deployment of its proprietary Pressure Geothermal System (GGS), a technology the company has been developing since its founding in 2020 by a team with more than 150 years of combined oil and gas experience. The system builds on lessons from a 2023 demonstration well in Starr County, Texas, which delivered up to 17 hours of discharge with minimal water loss and a round-trip efficiency of 70–75%, proving the concept’s ability to provide long-duration, dispatchable capacity (Figure 1), Brianna Byrd, a Sage Geosystems’ operations engineer told POWER.

This graphic illustrates Sage Geosystems’ Pressure Geothermal System, which uses a deep engineered “lung” fracture—a subsurface reservoir created in low-permeability rock—to store and release energy using, in this case, a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2 ) power system. Courtesy: Sage Geosystems

“Sage’s proprietary energy storage technology functions much like pumped-storage hydropower (PSH), but upside down, with the ‘upper reservoir’ located deep underground rather than on top of a mountain,” Byrd explained. “We create a vertical fracture system in low-permeability rock that serves as an artificial reservoir.” To charge the system, water is pumped from a surface storage down the wellbore into the fracture, “inflating” the water under pressure like a balloon. And to discharge it, the pump is shut off, and the pressurized fracture system pushes water back up the wellbore. “At the surface, it drives a Pelton turbine and generator. A choke system modulates flow as pressure declines, ensuring steady power output until the predetermined volume of water is released from the well,” she said.

For pressure geothermal power generation, “the same principles apply, but the pressurized water is also heated by the surrounding hot rock,” Byrd added. “The heat is then converted to electricity using either a conventional Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) or Sage’s proprietary supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2 ) power system. The water used to extract heat from the Earth is kept separate from the CO 2 , which remains in a closed-loop system in the power plant.”

These innovations have yielded high efficiency and long-duration flexibility. “The round-trip efficiency (RTE) for Sage’s energy storage system is expected to be 70–75%, as we hold open the fractures with pressure, which reduces friction and energy losses,” Byrd said. “This efficiency will not degrade over time.” That performance is on par with pumped storage hydropower but without the geographic constraints. Lithium-ion batteries can achieve a higher RTE of 85–90%, she noted, but degrade over time with repeated cycling and exposure to high ambient temperatures.

Byrd also stressed that Sage’s energy storage technology is not intended to compete with lithium-ion batteries for short discharge durations. “However, for durations of more than five hours, when lithium-ion systems must be stacked and costs escalate, our levelized cost of storage (LCOS) is projected to be significantly lower,” she said. “Additionally, Sage’s solution eliminates fire hazards associated with batteries and avoids the raw material supply chain and recycling challenges tied to lithium-ion batteries, offering a lower lifecycle impact.”

In another benefit for drought-prone regions like Atascosa County, the design minimizes water loss—less than 2% in field testing—by keeping the fracture sealed and pressurized throughout operation. “The surface facility is designed to operate within a defined pressure window, between the fracture opening and the fracture extension pressure, to avoid uncontrolled fracture growth,” Byrd noted. “We continuously monitor pressure, flow rates, and volumes in real time. This data is integrated into an automated control system that adjusts pumping parameters to keep the system within safe operating limits.”

A Strategic Match in the Heart of ERCOT

Notably, the project is also entirely digitally automated to integrate seamlessly with ERCOT, a characteristic that is a growing imperative in the fast-moving market, which faces extreme weather, renewable swings, and a surging demand strain from data center and cryptocurrency mining. Sage plans to operate SMECI Well #1 as a merchant, buying and selling electricity into ERCOT’s South Load Zone. “It uses advanced control systems to manage charge and discharge cycles in real time, responding to grid signals and demand fluctuations,” said Byrd. “These smart grid and digital automation layers ensure efficient synchronization with the broader energy network, enabling fast response times, remote monitoring, and dynamic participation in grid dispatch.”

For Sage, delivering its first commercial pilot in Texas also meant capitalizing on a favorable policy and permitting environment. “Texas clarified through legislation in 2023 that landowners own the geothermal heat, providing certainty for operators,” she said. “In addition, the Texas Railroad Commission, responsible for permitting geothermal wells, brings over 100 years of expertise in oil and gas permitting and can permit geothermal wells in weeks rather than months or years.”

The company credits its project implementation speed—from partnership to “ready to store” in just 12 months—to a combination of proven oil and gas expertise, an intentionally streamlined design, and Texas’s uniquely favorable permitting environment. Pressure geothermal draws on the full spectrum of oil and gas expertise: geoscience for evaluating and characterizing subsurface rock formations; engineering and operations for design, execution, project management, and cost control; and service providers for drilling, completions, and fracturing from established oilfield companies, Byrd explained.

“Most of the Sage Geosystems team comes directly from the oil and gas industry. The founders alone bring over 120 years of combined experience. Leveraging these proven technologies, tools, and skillsets allows Sage to scale immediately without having to reinvent equipment or retrain a new workforce, which is critical for next-generation geothermal and energy storage,” Byrd said.

Following grid interconnection of the SMECI energy storage system in December 2025, Sage plans to focus on drilling wells and building its second energy storage facility with a major utility. Work is meanwhile ongoing on its first commercial power generation facility as part of Meta Phase I, a partnership announced in August 2024 to deliver up to 150 MW of new geothermal baseload power for the social media company’s expanding U.S. data centers. The project is slated to be online in 2027. “We continue to advance partnerships with big tech hyperscalers, utilities, and the U.S. Department of Defense,” said Byrd.

Ultimately, Sage sees three clear use cases for its technology—energy storage, power generation, and district heating. “In the near term, we are prioritizing energy storage and power generation,” she said. “Energy storage can be deployed quickly, as demonstrated at our SMECI facility, which was built in

[TITLE]Nigeria Bets Big on Renewables as Oil Troubles Deepen:
[TEXT]
For decades, Nigeria’s oil industry has faced a multitude of challenges. Despite having vast quantities of crude, the mismanagement of revenue, weak agreements with international oil companies, an underinvestment in infrastructure, and widespread oil theft have left many opposed to the ongoing production of crude. Now, Nigeria has high hopes for its renewable energy sector, as it looks to diversify its energy sources and boost energy security over the coming years.

Oil theft has long been a problem in Nigeria, affecting both the financial gain from oil projects and health and safety in the sector. A committee, established earlier this year, assessed some of the oil sector’s challenges in Nigeria, including oil theft, bunkering operations, illegal export networks, and alleged compromises within regulatory and security systems. The committee published a report on its findings, which suggested that the government could significantly mitigate the country’s oil losses.

Satellite and agency tracking revealed at least 589 oil leaks across Nigeria in 2024, most of which were due to theft and sabotage. The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative estimated that, over 12 years, Nigeria lost 619.7 million barrels of oil, with a total value of $46.2 billion. In addition, Nigeria lost approximately $1.84 billion worth of petroleum products from its refineries over nine years.

While the government seeks to make its oil industry safer and more efficient, and, importantly, more profitable, many Nigerians are calling for the government to abandon its oil ambitions in favour of clean energy sources. While the government continues to back fossil fuels, it also sees a future for Nigeria in green energy, having set a target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 during the COP26 climate summit.

Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP) led the way for the passing of the country’s Climate Change Act in 2021. The government then established the Energy Transition Office to oversee the implementation of the ETP, with a focus on six pillars – improved energy access, poverty reduction, modern energy access, job preservation, a sustainable transition, and legislation. The ETP aims to reduce emissions in several sectors, including power, transport, oil and gas, cooking, and industry. The ETP was revised and updated in 2024 to incorporate recent data and policy developments.

The government expects the ETP to support widespread job creation, with an estimated 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs by 2060. Nigeria views natural gas as a transition fuel and as key to its shift away from dirtier fossil fuels. However, to achieve its aims, the government will need to establish new green energy industries and attract investment for large-scale projects.

During the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum 2025, the government signed contracts with a value of $435 million to expand the country’s renewable energy capacity. The agreements are expected to support the creation of 1,500 direct jobs across the country. Several state governments made deals with local and international renewable energy companies to develop solar, hybrid, and recycling projects to support power generation. Vice President Kashim Shettima said that $23 billion in funding was required in the short term to provide reliable power to millions of Nigerians without access to power.

To attract higher levels of investment to the sector, the government has committed to incentivising local production, streamlining regulations, and encouraging public-private partnerships.

Nigeria has significantly expanded its solar power industry in recent years, aiming to benefit from its abundant sunlight. In October, Nigeria’s Energy Commission signed a strategic partnership with the Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi to develop a solar panel plant with up to 1 GW of production capacity. This followed a visit to the Longi headquarters earlier in the month during which Longi “expressed strong interest in investing in Nigeria and demonstrated readiness to advance concrete plans for the construction of the factory.”

This is the latest of several solar manufacturing sites announced by the government. In September, Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency (REA) partnered with the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria and the Dutch solar manufacturer Solarge BV to establish a special purpose vehicle for the construction and operation of a 1 GW solar panel manufacturing plant in Nigeria.

Meanwhile, in March, the REA signed a deal with Lagos-based renewables developer Oando Clean Energy to develop a 1.2 GW solar assembly plant. The government has also discussed the possibility of introducing a ban on solar panel imports to help encourage local production. Technology Minister Uche Nnaji stated, “We have lithium in abundance here in Nigeria, so Mr President is already taking action… We are adding value to our raw materials.”

As Nigeria’s oil industry continues to face a multitude of challenges, the government is starting to drive investment in the country’s renewable energy sector. In addition to the expansion of its renewable energy capacity, the government is also looking at how to add value to its raw materials and ramp up manufacturing activities to drive economic growth.

“Most of the Sage Geosystems team comes directly from the oil and gas industry. The founders alone bring over 120 years of combined experience. Leveraging these proven technologies, tools, and skillsets allows Sage to scale immediately without having to reinvent equipment or retrain a new workforce, which is critical for next-generation geothermal and energy storage,” Byrd said.

Following grid interconnection of the SMECI energy storage system in December 2025, Sage plans to focus on drilling wells and building its second energy storage facility with a major utility. Work is meanwhile ongoing on its first commercial power generation facility as part of Meta Phase I, a partnership announced in August 2024 to deliver up to 150 MW of new geothermal baseload power for the social media company’s expanding U.S. data centers. The project is slated to be online in 2027. “We continue to advance partnerships with big tech hyperscalers, utilities, and the U.S. Department of Defense,” said Byrd.

Ultimately, Sage sees three clear use cases for its technology—energy storage, power generation, and district heating. “In the near term, we are prioritizing energy storage and power generation,” she said. “Energy storage can be deployed quickly, as demonstrated at our SMECI facility, which was built in

[TITLE]America’s Fragile Grid Faces a Perfect Storm Ahead of Winter:
[TEXT]
The energy infrastructure in the United States has failed repeatedly in instances of severe weather, due to years of underinvestment and the failure of utilities to work together to strengthen larger networks. During winter storms and wildfires, a wide range of energy infrastructure has been known to fail due to the lack of preparedness by utilities and state governments. Going into the winter months, there are fears over more potential network failures across various parts of the U.S.

Texas, California, and several other states face annual power outages due to severe weather events, from winter storms to heatwaves. In February 2021, Storm Uri brought plunging temperatures to the state of Texas and left millions of people without electricity, heat, or running water, as much of the infrastructure froze. These outages turned off electricity in various parts of Texas, including parts of the natural gas network that are electrically operated, such as pumps and antifreeze injection systems. This led to the shutdown of several power plants.

During the storm, as demand increased for heating, Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 GW of rolling blackouts to prevent a total system collapse, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It was the “largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history,” with 4.5 million people losing power for several days, stated a FERC report.

The U.S. energy network is highly fragmented, with different state governments each managing parts of the grid, and a multitude of utilities responsible for different infrastructure. The fractured nature of the system makes it extremely hard to fix. For example, investment made in the transmission lines of one state may not be replicated by the neighbouring state, meaning that the network in part of a region may be more resilient than another.

In 2021, the Biden administration introduced the $2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at upgrading U.S. infrastructure. The plan earmarked $100 billion in financing to update and modernise the electric grid to make it more reliable and resilient. However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.

Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres. There has been a rapid rollout of data centres across the U.S. in recent years, as tech companies invest heavily in the infrastructure needed to power advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. This has driven up energy demand in several states, particularly in Texas. The concern now is that this will increase the risk of energy shortages, which could result in power cuts during freezing temperatures.

Requests for new data centres are on the rise in Texas, thanks to its growing renewable energy capacity and natural gas resources. In recent years, Houston has become known by many as the Silicon Valley of energy, for its strong reputation for energy production, growing cleantech sector, and welcoming business environment. This has helped attract significant investment to the state from tech companies looking to expand operations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in November that the 24/7 energy demand of data centres will make it increasingly difficult to maintain sufficient electricity supply during times of high demand, such as if the temperature drops to an extreme low.

During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW. While the state’s 92.6 GW electricity capacity would normally be enough to power this demand, the available power could decrease to roughly 69.7 GW during a severe weather event, meaning a deficit of over 15 GW.

In a recent analysis, NERC stated, “Strong load growth from new data centres and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” It went on to say that while Texas will experience elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the grid will remain stable during normal peak demand.

Over 120 GW of projects have requested to be connected to the Texas grid, marking a 170 percent increase since January requests. Approximately 73 percent of these projects are data centres, according to ERCOT. If all these data centres are built, it would equate to the average annual power consumption of almost 154 million homes. However, experts believe that it is unlikely for the massive project pipeline to be developed in its entirety, as there is simply not enough power to serve it.

Years of underinvestment in the U.S. grid, a lack of preparedness from utilities, and the rise in demand for data centres could lead to a power deficit if Texas, or another state, is hit by severe weather this winter. This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development. It also implies the need for stronger regulations to ensure that the electricity supply is sufficient and stable enough to meet demand before approving new projects.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing need for continuous and reliable power supply is a crucial driver of the global power rental market, as industries rely on uninterrupted energy to maintain productivity and prevent financial losses. Data centers, for example, require consistent power beyond what traditional grids can reliably provide. The International Energy Agency's March 2024 Electricity 2024 report indicates that global electricity consumption from data centers is expected to more than double, rising from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh by 2026.

Simultaneously, grid instability caused by aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and integration challenges with renewable energy sources drives demand for temporary power solutions. According to NERC's June 2024 State of Reliability report, wind resources experienced forced outage rates of 18.9% in 2023, up from 18.1% in 2022, contributing to grid unreliability. Strong industry performance reflects this demand: Aggreko reported annual sales of USD 2.85 billion for the year ending December 28, 2024, a 14% increase over 2023, as noted by International Rental News in April 2025.
