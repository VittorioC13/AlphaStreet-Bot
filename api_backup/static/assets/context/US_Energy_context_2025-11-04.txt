[TITLE]NextEra Energy partners with Google to restart Iowa nuclear plant:
[TEXT]
By Laila Kearney and Vallari Srivastava

(Reuters) -NextEra Energy and Google have reached an agreement to restart an Iowa nuclear power plant shut five years ago, the companies said on Monday, in another sign that data-center power demand is renewing interest in U.S. nuclear energy.

The technology industry's quest for massive amounts of electricity for artificial-intelligence processing has renewed interest in the country's nuclear reactors, which generate large amounts of around-the-clock power that is virtually carbon free.

Under NextEra's deal with Google, the Duane Arnold Energy Center near Cedar Rapids is scheduled to resume operations in early 2029. The restart is backed by a 25-year agreement for Google to buy electricity from the 615-megawatt plant.

Shares of NextEra Energy rose over 1% to $87.24 after the bell.

The agreement follows a similar announcement at the former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, which is owned by Constellation Energy, in Pennsylvania to fuel Microsoft data centers.

Google, Microsoft, Amazon and other so-called hyperscalers that operate massive cloud-computing infrastructure have also agreed in recent months to buy future energy produced by advanced nuclear technologies, including fusion and small modular reactors.

NextEra and Google also will explore the development of new nuclear technology, the companies said.

“Restarting Duane Arnold marks an important milestone for NextEra Energy,” said CEO John Ketchum. “Our partnership with Google not only brings nuclear energy back to Iowa — it also accelerates the development of next-generation nuclear technology.

The Duane Arnold Energy Center -- Iowa's lone nuclear plant -- closed in 2020 after operating for 45 years. While there are now three U.S. restart efforts under way, including a Michigan power plant that is not connected to a technology deal, no mothballed nuclear power plant has actually been restarted.

“This partnership serves as a model for the investments needed across the country to build energy capacity and deliver reliable, clean power, while protecting affordability and creating jobs that will drive the AI-driven economy,” said Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google.

One of the plant's minority owners, Central Iowa Power Cooperative, will purchase the remaining portion of the plant's output on the same terms as Google, NextEra said.

The utility added that it had also signed agreements to acquire the 30% interest in the Duane Arnold plant owned by that cooperative and Corn Belt Power Cooperative, bringing NextEra's ownership to 100%.

[TITLE]Trump tariffs to raise costs, delay oil and gas projects in 2026, report says:
[TEXT]
US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are set to raise operating costs, disrupt supply chains and weaken investment momentum for the oil and gas industry in 2026, a report published by Deloitte showed on Wednesday.

Why it’s important

The energy industry relies heavily on global supply chains and internationally sourced materials such as drilling rigs, valves, compressors and specialised steel are central to their operations.

US tariffs on these components and other key input materials, including steel, aluminum and copper, could increase material and service costs across the value chain by 4 per cent to 40 per cent, potentially compressing industry margins, the report said.

Context

The US has imposed tariffs on a wide range of imports, including 10 per cent to 25 per cent on crude feedstocks not covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and 50 per cent on steel, aluminum and copper.

The tariffs could reshape the oil and gas industry’s cost structure and add uncertainty around feedstock sourcing, Deloitte said in its report.

Key points

Inflation and financial uncertainty sparked by the tariffs could push final investment decisions (FIDs) and offshore greenfield projects worth more than $50 billion to 2026 or later.

As a result, operators may struggle to recover higher costs, which could eventually dampen investment activity in the sector, the report said.

As input costs climb and cascade through the value chain in the form of pricing adjustments, Deloitte expects oil and gas companies will renegotiate contracts with escalation and force majeure clauses to share risks and limit exposure to volatility.

What’s next

The ongoing disruptions could drive companies to prioritise supply chain resilience over lowest-cost sourcing and shift to domestic or non-tariffed suppliers and use foreign trade zones or tariff reclassification to manage duties, Deloitte said.

“This shift is significant given the United States’ reliance on imports, with nearly 40 per cent of oil country tubular goods demand in 2024 met through foreign sources.”

[TITLE]Vedanta well-positioned to gain from commodity cycle, deleveraging efforts: Analysts:
[TEXT]
Vedanta's second-quarter results met street expectations on robust operational performance, with analysts viewing the miner as well-positioned to benefit from the commodity rebound while advancing its deleveraging strategy.

Brokerages Nuvama, Citi, ICICI Securities and Investec maintained a strong bullish stance on metals and natural resources major Vedanta Ltd.

They cited factors such as Vedanta Resources' leverage being at comfortable levels, potential medium-term upside in aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME), volume growth, likely lower costs, and the likely completion of the demerger process as reasons for the bullish call.

Nuvama said Vedanta's focus on demerger and delivery is on the verge of paying off, supported by tailwinds from commodity prices. The brokerage expects this to contribute to higher third-quarter earnings.

"Q3 FY26 EBITDA is likely to jump 20 per cent QoQ led by higher prices, volume, and lower aluminium cost of production," Nuvama said.

It increased Vedanta's FY27 estimated EBITDA by 4 per cent to ₹63,450 crore, factoring in higher commodity prices.

Citi Research saw potential medium-term upside for aluminium on the LME as a positive factor.

"Our commodities team expects aluminium to average $3,500 in 2027. Aluminium has bullish fundamental exposure to structural energy-transition and AI trends and is leveraged to a cyclical growth rebound and US debasement concerns. During 2026, dovish Fed prospects, related lower US real interest rates, and a pickup in the US and global growth expectations are likely to be supportive," it said.

In its analysis, Citi factored in higher prices for zinc, aluminium, and silver in FY27, which will boost Vedanta's earnings.

"We incorporate FY27 zinc/aluminium/silver at $2,850/ $2,800/ $40 vs $2,700/ $2,600/ $38 earlier. We raise FY26/FY27/28 EBITDA by 6 per cent, 15 per cent and 16 per cent, largely on higher aluminium and zinc LME and power EBITDA (commissioning of new assets)," it said.

ICICI Securities said Vedanta is a prime beneficiary of the commodity cycle, with the company's aluminium division continuing to deliver strong earnings amid higher LME prices.

"Aluminium division is expected to drive the majority of earnings, aided by better volumes, lower costs, and potentially better LME (aluminium demand-supply likely to be favourable). Power segment and zinc shall play a supporting role," the brokerage said.

Stating that Vedanta is a pure commodity play, ICICI Securities noted that the mining major will likely be the biggest beneficiary of a rally in commodity prices.

"Aluminium, zinc, and silver contribute over 80 per cent of EBITDA, and the company has good growth plans for these segments, enabling the growth story to remain intact. Additionally, the aluminium segment would see backward integration into bauxite-alumina-coal, which would make Vedanta one of the lowest cost producers," it said.

UK-based Investec Bank PLC said that the management execution on debt refinancing at Vedanta Resources - the company's parent firm - is noteworthy, implying a tapering yield ask into FY27 or FY28.

Investec also noted that Vedanta's dividends in 1HFY26 stood at ₹23 per share, with the brokerage estimating an incremental dividend of ₹20 a share in H2 FY26.

Vedanta's profit after tax before exceptional items jumped 13 per cent year-on-year to ₹5,026 crore. The company clocked second quarter EBITDA of ₹11,612 crore, reflecting 12 per cent YoY growth with EBITDA margin expanded by 69 bps YoY to 34 per cent.

as itnear the, drawing global attention from scientists and space agencies.suggested that the interstellar object ’s blue color and unexplained acceleration could indicate artificial propulsion. NASA confirmed its non-gravitational acceleration but denied any alien connection.3I/ATLAS shows signs of alien engine and non-gravitational acceleration, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The Manhattan-sized interstellar object accelerated and appeared bluer than the Sun as it passed our local star. Loeb said the change in color and acceleration could suggest a propulsion system or artificial engine.NASA recorded non-gravitational acceleration in the object this week. The acceleration indicated a major outgassing event, which is expected from a comet. Such outgassing would cause loss of mass and produce a visible debris plume in the coming months.However, Loeb suggested that the same acceleration could also result from a technological source. In his Medium post, he wrote, “Alternatively, the non-gravitational acceleration might be the technological signature of an internal engine.”He added that the bright blue hue might be caused by a hot engine or artificial light source, but also noted that it could be natural.Earth’s telescopes could not directly observe 3I/ATLAS when it came within 172 million miles of the Sun, as Earth was on the opposite side. However, spacecraft orbiting the Sun ahead of Earth captured measurements showing rapid brightening.The US Naval Research Laboratory reported that the supposed comet appeared distinctly bluer than the Sun. Earlier observations had shown it as red, later turning green. Loeb said the new color pattern was surprising and indicated unusual properties.3I/ATLAS will make its closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2025, at around 167 million miles. This event will allow scientists to determine if it is a comet or an artificial craft. Loeb said that if no gas cloud is detected around 3I/ATLAS in December, it may indicate propulsion activity.Loeb criticized NASA for withholding images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera during its close pass near Mars in early October. Sources suggested that the images will not be released until the government reopens.NASA’s Acting Administrator Sean Duffy responded to public questions, saying that 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet to enter the solar system. He denied any claims of extraterrestrial technology or danger to Earth. “No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” Duffy wrote on X.Professor Avi Loeb, who has long studied extraterrestrial signatures, said 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Earth before Christmas. Between November 27, 2025, and January 27, 2026, it will be monitored by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).If no massive gas cloud forms, Loeb said the observed acceleration could be a sign of a propulsion system. He compared this to the earlier interstellar object 1I/‘Oumuamua, which also showed non-gravitational acceleration without visible gas or dust.Loeb explained that comet experts described ‘Oumuamua as a “dark comet,” meaning a comet without a visible tail. He argued that an object with a propulsion system could show similar behavior.He wrote that scientific truth depends on data, not popularity, and urged continued study of anomalies like 3I/ATLAS.Scientists recently observed that 3I/ATLAS brightened faster than expected as it neared the Sun. Researchers Karl Battams and Qicheng Zhang reported that its brightening rate exceeded that of most Oort Cloud comets. The cause remains unclear.Observations were made by several space-based missions, including SOHO, GOES-19, and NASA’s twin STEREO spacecraft. Ground-based telescopes will resume observations in mid- to late-November 2025, after it moves out of the Sun’s glare.Battams and Zhang suggested that the brightening could be due to its velocity or unique composition. If its chemical makeup differs from Oort Cloud comets, it might indicate that it originated in a planetary system with a different chemical history.The researchers noted that carbon dioxide sublimation appeared to dominate the comet’s activity even when it was three times farther from the Sun than Earth. This could mean cooling effects delayed water-ice sublimation and changed the thermal behavior.Scientists say that 3I/ATLAS remains one of the few known interstellar visitors, offering rare insight into the makeup of distant planetary systems. Its unusual brightness and acceleration continue to raise questions about whether its behavior is natural or artificial.It could reveal whether the interstellar object is a natural comet or an artificial craft, depending on whether it shows signs of propulsion or outgassing.The comet will be most observable between November 27, 2025, and January 27, 2026, with its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.

[TITLE]Data, Power and Emissions: How AI’s Growth May Slow Down the Green Transition:
[TEXT]
Yves here. For those minimally on top of AI power usage, the headline is a “Gee, ya think?” item. But this post documents a key point: not only is AI greatly increasing electricity demand, but that need is also being met enough by fossil fuels so as to reverse the decarbonization of electricity production.

By Alessandra Bonfiglioli, Rosario Crinò, Mattia Filomena and Gino Gancia. Originally published at VoxEU

AI and other data-intensive technologies may help optimise energy use, but the technologies themselves are power hungry. This column explores how the diffusion of AI affected emissions in the US between 2002 and 2022 and finds that local AI growth raises emissions by boosting economic activity and energy use. It also leads to power generation becoming more carbon-intensive as plants shift from renewable to non-renewable sources. The ‘green’ promise of AI will remain elusive as long as the electricity sector itself does not rapidly decarbonise.

Quantifying the carbon footprint of AI is an increasingly urgent task. Policymakers are debating whether the surge in electricity demand linked to AI will jeopardise decarbonisation goals. Data centres – the core infrastructure supporting AI models – are projected to account for 8% of US electricity demand by 2030, up from 3% in 2022 (Davenport et al. 2024). Concerns have been voiced that this power surge may delay the retirement of coal-fired plants. On the other hand, AI and digital industries are often promoted as a ‘green’ technology that may increase efficiency and lower emissions.

Studies of past waves of digitalisation (e.g. Lange et al. 2020) showed that while ICT can reduce some forms of waste, the overall effect was often an increase in energy use. More recently, cryptomining has been linked to an increase in local electricity prices (Benetton 2023), and there is an ongoing debate whether data-centre expansion will force grids to rely longer on fossil fuels (Electric Power Research Institute 2024, Knittel et al. 2025).

In a recent study (Bonfiglioli et al. 2025), we contribute to this debate by providing systematic evidence on how the diffusion of AI has affected emissions in the US over the last two decades. Our findings suggest that the ‘green’ promise of AI will remain elusive as long as the electricity sector itself is not rapidly decarbonised.

A Novel Dataset Linking AI, Data Centres, and Power Plants

To carry out the analysis, we assemble a novel dataset linking AI, emissions, and the location of data centres and power plants in 722 US commuting zones between 2002 and 2022. This period coincides with the rise of the digital economy, cloud computing, and early AI applications. To capture the carbon footprint of these phenomena, we define AI as algorithms applied to big data, and we measure its penetration using changes in employment in data-intensive occupations – software developers, data scientists, systems analysts, and related computer-science jobs – identified from the O*NET database (see Bonfiglioli, Crinò, Gancia, and Papadakis 2024, 2025).

We then map the geographical location of more than 2,000 data centres and link them to nearby power plants and their fuel mix. Finally, we measure emissions from the high-resolution Vulcan dataset (Gurney et al. 2009, 2025), which tracks CO2 from fossil-fuel combustion by sector and location, complemented by satellite-based data on other pollutants.

Figure 1 presents colour maps showing how employment in data-intensive occupations (panel a) and CO2 emissions (panel b) vary across US commuting zones, with darker colours representing higher levels of adoption or emissions over the sample period. Red triangles also indicate the location of data centres. The figure shows that areas with more workers in data-intensive occupations tend to have higher emissions and are more likely to host at least one data centre. Yet, this correlation cannot be interpreted as causal evidence, as both AI and emissions might be simultaneously driven by other shocks.

Figure 1 Data-intensive occupations, data centres, and CO2 emissions

Notes: Panel (a) displays the employment share of data-intensive occupations in each commuting zone in 2022. Panel (b) shows the total CO2 emissions in each commuting zone for the same year. Darker colours represent higher levels of adoption of data-intensive occupations or emissions over the sample period. Red triangles indicate the presence of a data centre site.

To address the fact that AI adoption could itself be influenced by local demand or productivity trends, we use a shift–share (Bartik) instrument. Specifically, we identify commuting zones exogenously more exposed to the arrival of AI as those zones historically specialised in industries that experienced faster growth in data-intensive occupations than the nation as a whole.

The Effect of AI on Emissions

Our analysis yields four key findings. First, AI slows down the green transition at the local level. Localities specialised in industries with faster growth of data-intensive employment saw a significantly slower fall in CO2 emissions (Figure 2). On average, emissions fell by 16% over the period 2002–2022. In contrast, in a hypothetical commuting zone that had experienced no AI penetration at all, CO2 emissions would have fallen 37% more than the average. While these figures should not be interpreted as counterfactual exercises, since nationwide effects are differenced out in our empirical strategy, they nonetheless suggest that local AI penetration increases emissions relative to less exposed areas.

Figure 2 AI penetration, CO2 emissions, and electricity generation

Notes: The figure presents estimated coefficients and 90% confidence intervals for the effects of AI penetration on various types of emissions and on the non-renewables share of net electricity generation. The estimation sample includes 722 commuting zones observed across four 5-year periods from 2002 to 2022.

Second, the growth in emissions is mostly due to a scale effect. Decomposing the drivers of emissions into scale, composition, and technique (à la Levinson 2009), we find that expansion of local economic activity is the main channel through which AI affects emissions. Areas specialised in industries with faster growth of data-intensive employment attracted more workers and firms, increasing total output and hence energy use (Figure 2). Shifts in industrial composition modestly reduced, rather than increased, emissions.

Third, electricity generation becomes more carbon intensive. Even after controlling for scale, per-capita emissions from power generation rose in areas with higher AI penetration (Figure 2). This happens because power plants located in more exposed areas switch electricity generation from renewable sources to non-renewable sources (Figure 2). It confirms concerns that the energy demand driven by AI applications and data centres is met primarily by fossil-fuel plants, which can guarantee the stable and continuous supply that high-performance computing requires.

Our fourth and final result is that the location of data centres matters. Since electricity cannot be stored at scale easily, the grid must balance supply and demand in real time. Given the high transmission-loss costs, power plants are influenced by nearby sources of demand, especially from data centres which require a stable, high-capacity electricity supply. Consistently, we find that proximity to data centres is associated with power plants generating higher CO2 emissions and relying more heavily on non-renewable energy sources (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Distance to data centres and power plant activities

Notes: The figure presents estimated coefficients and 90% confidence intervals for the effects of power plants’ average distance to data centres on different power plant activities. The estimation sample consists of 11,500 power plants observed four 5-year periods from 2002 to 2022.

Conclusions

These results put numbers on a concern often voiced by climate analysts: absent a faster transition of the power sector to low-carbon sources, the diffusion of AI can slow or even reverse recent gains in emissions reduction.

Notably, our study covers 2002–2022, a period that predates the explosion of generative AI. While the promised efficiency gains from these new technologies may eventually help decarbonise the economy, training and running today’s large language models is far more energy-intensive than the earlier AI applications captured in our data. Unless accompanied by massive investment in clean power, the next wave of AI may therefore have even larger short-run impacts on emissions.

Our research points to an uncomfortable truth: digital transformation and decarbonisation cannot be treated as separate agendas. The diffusion of AI epitomises a classic challenge of technological progress: innovations that promise long-term efficiency gains can, in the short run, raise environmental externalities by expanding demand for energy. The solution is not to slow AI, but to accelerate the clean-energy transition. This may require incentives for more energy-efficient hardware, locating data centres in regions with abundant clean-energy capacity, and strengthening transmission infrastructure. Without that alignment, the race for ever-more-powerful algorithms may inadvertently lock economies into a higher-emission path.

[TITLE]Penang charges forward with new renewable energy guidelines:
[TEXT]
GEORGE TOWN: New commercial and industrial buildings in Penang must now ensure that at least 75% of their roof area is covered with solar panels or meet renewable energy sourcing targets based on their Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) tariff category.

State infrastructure, transport and digital committee chairman Zairil Khir Johari said the new guideline requires buildings to source part of their energy from renewable sources — 25% for low voltage users, 5% for medium voltage, and 2% for high voltage consumers — as part of Penang’s effort to boost clean energy adoption.

He said large commercial buildings with air-conditioned areas exceeding 4,000sq m must also ensure that at least 2% of their total energy comes from renewable sources, in line with the Penang Energy Framework (PEF) — the state’s roadmap for achieving its 2030 renewable energy and energy efficiency targets.

“The PEF lays the foundation for a cleaner, smarter and more resilient energy system for Penang,” said Zairil in his keynote address at the Penang Green Summit 2025 held at the Penang Waterfront Convention Centre (PWCC) on Thursday (Oct 30).

He described the framework as a “living document” that continues to evolve through policies designed to raise awareness, inspire behavioural change, and promote efficient energy practices.

Zairil said Penang was also exploring floating solar systems on several dams, a study currently being undertaken by Penang Water Supply Corporation (PBAPP) to overcome land limitations and expand renewable generation capacity.

“Floating solar offers a viable and innovative way to harness clean energy,” he said.

He added that the upcoming Penang Silicon Island (PSI) project would feature renewable energy integration through its Green Tech Park, which will be fully powered by solar energy in its first phase via rooftop installations and off-site renewable energy procurement.

Zairil said the state’s initiatives complemented the Federal Government’s Solar ATAP programme, which offers more flexibility for solar installations, further enabling businesses and industries to invest in renewable solutions.

“The journey forward requires innovation, investment, and collaboration — the government alone cannot achieve this transition,” he said.

Earlier, Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, who officiated the summit, said the state remains committed to aligning its efforts with Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), which targets net-zero emissions by 2050.

“Over the years, this Summit has evolved from a discussion platform into a movement uniting policymakers, industry players, academia and communities in building a low-carbon, resilient and inclusive Penang,” he said.

Chow said the PEF, launched in November 2024, has already spurred several initiatives, including the integration of renewable and energy efficiency criteria by both Majlis Bandaraya Pulau Pinang (MBPP) and Majlis Bandaraya Seberang Perai (MBSP) in building approvals.

He added that Solar Voltech, a subsidiary of the Penang Development Corporation (PDC), has been appointed to spearhead renewable upgrades for public buildings, while the Penang Green Council (PGC) is developing an AI-assisted energy data platform for smarter, data-driven planning.

He also witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Penang government and Alliance Bank Malaysia Berhad to establish the Climate Mitigation Fund (CM Fund) — the country’s first state-level blended financing platform aimed at helping SMEs transition to sustainable production through preferential financing and ESG programmes.

New Delhi: Renewable Energy Minister Pralhad Joshi on Thursday urged the wind energy industry, including original equipment and component manufacturers, to raise local content in projects to 85% from the current 64%.Joshi said increasing domestic value addition was essential to strengthen India's clean energy supply chain amid evolving global dynamics and rising geopolitical challenges.The minister was addressing the seventh edition of Windergy India in Chennai. "Wind energy contributes nearly one-fifth of the 257 GW of installed [non-fossil fuel] capacity," Joshi said. "Wind is playing a crucial role in driving Aatmanirbharta and indigenisation, given its high local content."India can capture 10% of the global wind supply chain by 2030, and up to 20% by 2040, he added.India is among the five countries that manufacture most wind components domestically and has achieved nearly 54 GW of installed wind capacity. With policies ensuring compliance with the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) for wind, the government expects the next 46 GW of capacity addition to be largely driven by domestic manufacturing. In the ongoing financial year, wind capacity installations are projected to exceed 6 GW, the minister said.With nearly 64% local content and over 2,500 MSMEs contributing to the sector, India has built one of the most resilient and competitive wind manufacturing ecosystems in the world, said Girish Tanti, Chairman of the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association. -Our Bureau

[TITLE]British Businesses to Save over £400m a Year as Government Slashes Electricity Costs:
[TEXT]
Government slashes electricity costs to save British businesses over £400m a year from April 2026 through landmark support under the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy.

UK industry including steel, chemicals, cement, glass and paper employing around 400,000 people to benefit from 90% discount on their electricity network charges.

Unprecedented support brings UK industrial energy costs in line with European competitors to protect jobs and attract new investment, helping drive growth and deliver Plan for Change.

Around 500 of the UK’s most energy-intensive businesses are set to save up to £420 million per year on their electricity bills from next April, as the Government takes decisive action to slash industrial energy costs.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle has today (31 October) announced that government will power ahead with plans to increase the discount on electricity network charges for businesses in sectors like steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, which employ around 400,000 people in total across the UK, from 60 percent to 90 percent.

Some of these businesses currently pay the highest industrial electricity prices in the G7, making it harder to stay competitive on the international stage, which is why the Government has taken decisive action to deliver this relief and level the playing field for industry.

The landmark support, which is being delivered at no extra cost to taxpayers, fulfils a crucial promise in the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy launched in June, and follows a four-week consultation on the plans for the increased discount which ran between July and August this year.

The increased discount will also slash costs for a range of businesses across Scotland and Wales to help them support local jobs and deliver growth, including Tata Steel at Port Talbot and INEOS in Grangemouth, ensuring the benefits are felt right across the country.

It comes on top of the Government’s landmark British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme announced in the modern Industrial Strategy, which will slash energy costs by 25 percent for over 7,000 businesses from 2027 in sectors like aerospace, automotive and chemicals, supporting hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs in these industries.

The Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will be funded through reforms to the energy system. The Government is reducing costs within the system to free up funding without raising household bills or taxes.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

British industry deserves a level playing field – and this government is delivering it. We’ve heard businesses loud and clear, and this landmark support will help them stay competitive on the global stage so they can invest and grow here in the UK. This is our Modern Industrial Strategy in action: practical, targeted support that secures jobs, attracts investment and drives our economy forward, as part of our Plan for Change.

Encirc Glass Managing Director Sean Murphy said:

This will be a major boost for our industry and will help British glass manufacturers compete with cheaper imports from regions that do not bear the same level of cost and regulation. By cutting the costs of energy in this way, the government is helping our industry to support thousands of jobs across the country whilst we make the transition to renewable sources of power. We welcomed the opportunity to engage with the Minister on the pressing challenges facing our sector. Continued government support for vital industries like glass manufacturing is essential to safeguarding jobs and unlocking investment across all regions of the UK.

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce said:

Our research shows energy costs remain a major concern, forcing many businesses who are struggling to pay their bills to raise prices. Energy is a business essential not a luxury. The promise of cheaper bills for hundreds of energy-intensive firms through increasing the discount on electricity network charges is welcome.

Community Union Assistant General Secretary Alasdair McDiarmid said:

We welcome the government’s determination to reduce the industrial energy costs which are such a huge burden on energy-intensive industries like steel. Whilst there is still more to do, the decision to increase the level of compensation for network charging costs from 60% to 90% is a huge step in the right direction. This will help avert carbon leakage, and will go some way towards boosting the competitiveness of our steel producers in line with European counterparts. After long years of neglect, our members in the steel sector know that they now have a government which is on their side.

The increased discount under the Network Charging Compensation (NCC) Scheme will bring down electricity bills for businesses by slashing the prices they pay to access the UK’s electricity network.

This will help bring industrial energy prices in line with other major European economies to keep the UK competitive on the global stage, protect local jobs in the UK’s foundational industries, and attract new investment, delivering on the Government’s Plan for Change.

The Government is also driving forward plans to have a new Connections Accelerator Service in force by the end of 2025, which will streamline access to the UK’s electricity grid.

This will make it easier for major investment projects to speed up delivery, bringing new high-quality jobs and growth to local communities and boosting the UK’s investment attractiveness further.

[TITLE]Steve Bannon and Dave Walsh on AI and the Hypocrisy of Electricity Consumption of the Tech Elites – “When it Comes to Them. It Comes to the Next Money Grab, which is Artificial Intelligence” (VIDEO):
[TEXT]
War Room’s Steve Bannon and energy consultant Dave Walsh discussed the massive amount of energy that will be required to run AI data centers. Bannon also pointed out the hypocrisy of these tech oligarchs and their push for energy. He explained that they wanted to limit energy production and leftist agendas until they needed it to benefit them. He also called AI a power grab for these elites.

“Every TV ad of a Democrat in New Jersey is that we are gonna solve the affordability issue by taking care of your electric bill. I mean, they are so brazen. The people that got you here are so brazen that now they are going to take care of it,” Bannon commented.

“We initiated on this forum the conspiracy thought process

[TITLE]San Diego City Council approves reduced water rate hikes over next two years:
[TEXT]
Water rates for San Diegans will rise 14.7% next year and 14.5% the following year after the San Diego City Council today passed an amended water and wastewater rate hike.

A staff proposal before the council was to increase water rates by 63% through 2029 and wastewater rates by 31% in the same period. The much- reduced, two-year plan passed by a 5-4 majority Tuesday was proposed by Councilman Stephen Whitburn.

In a back-and-forth with Lisa Celaya, executive assistant director for the city, and Jordan More of the Office of the Independent Budget Analyst, Whitburn repeatedly tried to figure out the lowest possible rate increase to keep water flowing amid increased costs from the San Diego County Water Authority and asked the consequences of not meeting that number.

"I want to see the lowest possible number that protects our workers and protect our residents," he said.

Celaya and More were in agreement. If the council did not approve a rate hike, or passed one below what they claim was needed, the city would face an "immediate downward financial spiral," Celaya said.

"Approving rates lower than those proposed would almost entirely eliminate any margin of error," More said. "All levers are being pulled just to get through these two years."

A proposed 5% or 10% hike instead of the staff proposed rate or the one agreed upon Tuesday would trigger a default from bonding agencies, deplete much of the city's available funds, crater its credit rating and would necessitate the layoffs of around 500 people, or a quarter of the Public Utility Department's staff, Celaya said.

"5% has extreme consequences to us," she said. "Every percentage point matters."

Whitburn was terse in his reply.

"That's quite a choice."

The justification for the increase was largely based on increasing water costs. San Diego's rates remain below the county average.

"The main driver of the water rate increase is higher costs to purchase water from the San Diego County Water Authority, which are passed on to the city's customers," according to city documents. "Purchasing water from the SDCWA is the second largest individual expense for the entire city of San Diego."

Other reasons for the rate hike include increasing costs of maintenance, increasing energy rates, Pure Water Phase 1 operations and more.

The council members who voted to approve Whitburn's proposal applauded the reduced two-year plan. Councilwoman Jennifer Campbell said an ongoing deep dive into the SDCWA's budget could find some significant cuts over the duration of the two-year rate hike which may bring down costs in the future.

Councilman Raul Campillo noticed around 90% of the increased costs came directly from the SDCWA and agreed there must be cost-cutting from that agency, which represents most of the county's water districts.

Councilwoman Marni von Wilpert, who voted no on Whitburn's proposal, wanted to call the water authority's bluff.

"They aren't going to turn off the tap," she said. "I'm willing to take this to litigation."

Even Whitburn, while working to mitigate the costs, said the city would send a message to the SDCWA.

"There is a cap on what the city is willing to pay for water," he said.

Facing public backlash and a reluctance to raise yet another bill on city residents, the San Diego City Council voted 8-1 in late September to delay the decision on the proposal until Tuesday.

From the standpoint of city staff presenting the numbers, they have taken steps to mitigate the cost increase. The first run of the numbers was three times the $16 a month rate hike for the average single-family residential home proposed in September.

"The city is dedicated to minimizing rate increases for its customers by focusing on long-term financial planning, making strategic infrastructure investments, securing grants and low-interest financing, and maximizing the use of local water resources," city staff documents read. "However, despite these efforts, periodic rate adjustments are necessary to address critical challenges.

"These include replacing aging infrastructure, addressing rising costs for materials, chemicals, and energy used in the treatment and distribution of water and the collection, conveyance, and treatment of wastewater, and maintaining competitive compensation to attract and retain the skilled staff that keep our system safe and provide excellent customer service."

A report released by the city's Independent Budget Analyst found that the costs were a bitter pill to swallow, but necessary medicine all the same.

Studies prepared by the Public Utilities Department "demonstrate the need for increased revenues for both systems in order to maintain operations," the IBA report read. "In the current environment of declining water sales and wastewater flows which generate revenue for the systems, this inevitably means increasing rates.

"Without additional revenues to support the system, PUD will need to cut expenses, either through decreased operating costs or lower spending on the Capital Improvements Program. Both of these options come with significant risks and tradeoffs that the council should be aware of prior to making their final decision."

Council members Von Wilpert, Kent Lee, Vivian Moreno, Henry Foster III were the no votes.
