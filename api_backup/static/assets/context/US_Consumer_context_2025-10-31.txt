[TITLE]AIG to acquire the majority of renewal rights to Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio in $2 billion deal:
[TEXT]
Insurance giant AIG is set to acquire the renewal rights for the majority of Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio worth $2 billion in premiums, sources with intimate knowledge of the deal told Fortune.

The agreement with Everest, one of the world’s largest reinsurance and insurance solutions firms, is part of AIG CEO Peter Zaffino’s transformation effort at the century-old insurance company. It will also ease Everest’s loss reserve management issues after it underestimated claim costs in its U.S. casualty insurance business, leaving the firm in need of capital.

Insiders say that AIG expects to begin writing policies for existing North America Everest clients by the start of 2026. As for clients in the European Union, AIG is positioned to begin working on that portfolio during Q1 of 2026, depending on regulatory approvals.

AIG, a $44 billion insurance company, already serves more than 88 million commercial and personal customers worldwide​, operating in more than 200 countries and jurisdictions​. Everest also serves millions of policy holders, but is substantially smaller, valued at approximately $14.5 billion.

Meanwhile, Everest has hired multiple senior executives from AIG in recent years including the company’s former legal chief Anthony Vidovich, who was named executive vice president and general counsel of Everest on Oct. 16.

The Everest deal, insiders say, did not require AIG to seek out external capital or take on debt. And while AIG will obtain the portfolio and client relationships within the deal, all existing liabilities and prior exposures will remain with Everest. This specification will allow AIG to gain access to customers and future business without inheriting responsibility for claims and obligations from policies written before the transaction closed.

The move will significantly advance AIG’s portfolio growth in general insurance, a facet which, under Zaffino’s leadership, has demonstrated consistent growth. In 2024, the company wrote $23.9 billion in insurance premiums, up 6% year over year on a comparable basis. New business in 2024 reached $4.5 billion, a 9% increase. The company’s Q1 and Q2 earnings show potential further promise. New premiums written in Q1 were up 8% on a comparable basis, bringing in $4.5 billion, with Q2 premiums generating $6.9 billion.

Growth potential and avoidance of additional financial risk are particularly important to Zaffino’s vision and turnaround of AIG. The company has faced an uphill battle following its involvement in the 2008 global financial crisis. Leading up to 2008, AIG entered into enormous volumes of largely unhedged credit default swaps, insuring more than $440 billion in assets, including $57.8 billion backed by risky subprime mortgages.

When the subprime mortgage market collapsed, AIG faced huge losses and had to pay out on the credit default contracts. As investors and counterparties demanded collateral, the company’s liquidity evaporated, requiring a $182 billion government bailout, in exchange for an equity stake.

In the decade that followed, the insurer lost more than $30 billion in underwriting—a sign of excess capital, poor risk controls, and a lack of accountability for underwriting outcomes—and endured several CEO changes.

When Zaffino became CEO in 2021, AIG had undergone massive downsizing, asset sales, and management churn, but lingering operational inefficiencies and poor profitability, especially in underwriting, remained.

Since taking over, Zaffino has led an aggressive transformation strategy focused on disciplined underwriting, operational streamlining, and technological modernization. AIG has divested non-core units, reduced its risk exposure by over $1 trillion, and invested in AI capabilities. Those include partnerships with Anthropic and Palantir to build AI-driven risk assessment and operational tools aimed at improving underwriting precision and claims efficiency.

AIG’s financial performance has markedly improved, with analysts describing it as a “different company” compared to past years. In Q2 2025, the firm reported a $1.1 billion profit, reversing a $4 billion loss a year earlier which mainly reflected the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial, a life insurance and retirement solutions provider, and other portfolio changes. Adjusted after-tax income rose 56% year over year, and AIG’s earnings per share of $1.81 beat the forecast of $1.60, while revenue of $6.88 billion surpassed the expected $6.78 billion.

[TITLE]Alison Loehnis Joins JP Morgan’s Consumer and Retail Investment Banking Team:
[TEXT]
LONDON — Alison Loehnis has joined JP Morgan as a senior adviser in the consumer and retail investment banking team and will focus on luxury and lifestyle brands sector.

She was tapped by Jeannette Smits van Oyen, global head of consumer and retail investment banking at JP Morgan, and began work earlier this month. She is based in London.

Smits van Oyen said Loehnis’ “extensive leadership experience, global network and industry relationships will provide invaluable insight as we continue to strengthen our investment banking franchise across brand sub-verticals.”

She added that the bank has been advising “across a range of industry-defining transactions across sub-verticals over the past 24 months, including the take-private of Skechers; sale of Valentino to Kering, and sale of Rhode to E.l.f. While each transaction and each sub-vertical carries its own specific dynamic, the interconnectivity between them has become increasingly apparent.”

Smits van Oyen continued: “We look forward to working with Alison to enhance our sector expertise, deepen our network and relationships across the industry and accelerate idea generation for future opportunities.”

As reported, Loehnis left her role as president and ad interim chief executive officer of Yoox Net-a-porter group earlier this year. She spent 18 years at YNAP, which has since become part of Mytheresa’s publicly quoted parent company, LuxExperience.

LuxExperience picked up Yoox Net-a-porter for 555 million euros and a 100 million-euro credit facility from Compagnie Financière Richemont. In return, it handed Richemont a 33 percent stake in the wider luxury ecommerce company.

Loehnis’ tenure at YNAP was long — and eventful — with launches, mergers and corporate deals that went through — and fell through.

Loehnis, who cut her creative and commercial teeth at companies as diverse as Thomas Pink and The Walt Disney Co., joined Net-a-porter in 2007 as vice president of sales and marketing. She rose to the role of president in 2011.

During her long tenure she spearheaded some of the digital retail group’s biggest projects, heading the development of Mr Porter in 2011 and playing a key role in the launch of The Outnet, the group’s discount site.

She also introduced new categories, such as fine jewelry, expanded the group’s markets, and was celebrated as a leader in the digital luxury world.

As ad interim CEO she helmed YNAP as it prepared to be sold to Farfetch and Mohamed Alabbar. That deal was supposed to be completed by the end of 2023, but Richemont killed it after Farfetch was placed into administration, and later rescued by Coupang.

After the deal fell through, Loehnis stayed on until another buyer for YNAP could be found.

[TITLE]Halloween is a challenge for chocolatiers as high prices bite:
[TEXT]
By Ilena Peng, Bloomberg News

Halloween is shaping up to be a test for the chocolate industry, as high cocoa costs threaten to accelerate a consumer shift toward cheaper and trendier sweets such as sour gummies.

For candy makers, Halloween remains crucial — the holiday made up nearly 18% of annual U.S. candy sales last year, second only to Christmas. But chocolate makers have been passing along costlier input prices to consumers, and that’s leaving an opening for rivals — who have already seen a shift toward non-chocolate treats — to grab more market share.

It’s the latest example of demand destruction as the chocolate industry is grappling with high prices amid a precarious supply outlook. While cocoa futures in New York have slumped

[TITLE]EBay's holiday-quarter profit forecast disappoints, shares fall nearly 9%:
[TEXT]
E-commerce firm eBay forecast profit for the crucial holiday quarter below Wall Street estimates amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, sending its shares down 8.5 per cent after the bell on Wednesday.

Tariffs and changes to certain customs requirements in the U.S. have created significant uncertainty for small businesses, while concerns over escalating prices for imported goods have weighed on consumer confidence.

EBay has continued to see macroeconomic challenges across international markets, along with increased headwinds for cross-border trade into the U.S., CEO Jamie Iannone said on a post-earnings call.

The stock slide suggests that investors were not buying eBay's growth bandwidth behind the reported quarter's revenue and profit beat, said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.

EBay's third-quarter revenue came at $2.82 billion, while adjusted profit was $1.36 per share, both beating Wall Street estimates of $2.73 billion and $1.33 per share, respectively.

EBay saw a "deceleration in year-over-year volume growth starting in September in key markets importing into the U.S. after the removal of the de minimis exemption," CFO Peggy Alford said on the call.

The U.S. in late August ended de minimis tariff exemptions for parcel imports and began collecting normal duty rates on all package shipments valued under $800, regardless of the country of origin or mode of transportation, a change that was expected to impact online marketplaces such as eBay.

"As commodity prices for precious metals have appreciated in recent months we've observed a notable acceleration in demand for bullion and collectible coins on eBay which may be a less durable trend," Alford added.

This year, eBay will also see a full quarter of impact from the removal of the de minimis exemption. Sellers in Japan and Canada were amongst the most impacted.

EBay forecast adjusted earnings between $1.31 and $1.36 per share for the fourth quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $1.39 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It, however, sees revenue in the range of $2.83 billion to $2.89 billion for the quarter, above the estimate of $2.79 billion.

[TITLE]Visa Opens The Floodgates — Stablecoin Payments To Span 4 Blockchains:
[TEXT]
Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

Visa announced support for four new stablecoins across four blockchains, moving deeper into crypto payments. According to the credit card firm’s Q4 2025 earnings call, card spending tied to stablecoins has surged fourfold year-over-year. That kind of growth, company executives say, points to rising use of tokenized money on established payment rails.

Stablecoin Settlement Hits A $2.5 Billion Run Rate

Based on reports from the earnings call, Visa’s stablecoin settlement platform now handles conversions between two currencies and more than 25 fiat currencies, with monthly volumes running at an annualized $2.5 billion.

“We are adding support for four stablecoins running on four unique blockchains, representing two currencies that we can accept and convert to over 25 traditional fiat currencies,” Visa CEO Ryan McInerney told investors on the company’s Q4 and year-end earnings call, Tuesday.

Since 2020, the company reports total crypto and stablecoin flows have topped $140 billion. Of that, over $100 billion was linked to direct card purchases of digital assets, while

[TITLE]MercadoLibre stock dips after Q3 earnings miss despite 39% revenue surge:
[TEXT]
Investing.com -- MercadoLibre Inc (NASDAQ:MELI) shares edged 1.6% lower in after-hours trading Wednesday after the Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader reported third-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations, despite strong top-line growth. Earnings per share of $8.32 fell short of the consensus estimate of $9.37, while revenue rose 39% year-over-year to $7.41 billion, beating expectations of $7.19 billion.

The stronger-than-expected revenue was driven by robust commerce and financial services growth. Commerce generated year-over-year revenue growth of 33%, while the fintech segment surged 49%, reflecting broader adoption of digital payments in key markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina.

Total Payment Volume (TPV) reached $71.2 billion, up 41% from a year ago, bolstered by off-platform services from Mercado Pago and strong acquiring momentum. Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), the value of goods sold across its marketplace, climbed 28% to $16.5 billion, lifted by solid e-commerce demand and logistics improvements in core markets.

“Unique buyers in Brazil grew 29% YoY in Q3’25 – the fastest pace since Q1’21 and the largest quarterly addition of unique buyers ever, surpassing even the pandemic peak,” management said in its shareholder letter, highlighting the impact of free shipping incentives. “Offering more free shipping is a key pillar of our strategy to capture this long-term growth opportunity.”

The company reported an operating income of $724 million, with a margin of 9.8%, as ongoing investments into fulfillment, social commerce, and credit expansion weighed on profitability. Nevertheless, fiscal discipline and cost optimization helped maintain efficient operations, even as net income grew modestly to $421 million.

MercadoLibre continues to show gains across all its major regions, particularly in Mexico, where GMV and sold items both rose 42%. Its fintech arm, Mercado Pago, surpassed 72 million monthly active users and expanded its credit portfolio by 83% year-over-year to $11 billion, while maintaining stable asset quality and reducing default rates.

The company emphasized that digital banking penetration remains in early stages across Latin America. “We see ourselves as exceptionally well-positioned to accelerate financial inclusion and e-commerce penetration across Latin America, and are committed to investing to achieve this,” the management wrote, affirming its bullish outlook despite short-term margin compression.

Investor sentiment may remain cautious in the near term as the earnings miss overshadows otherwise strong operational performance. However, with major gains in user acquisition, logistics efficiency, and payments adoption, MercadoLibre continues to build a defensible moat across its multi-pronged platform.

[TITLE]Predictions 2026: Retail’s Flight To Profitability:
[TEXT]
The retail landscape is entering a period of profound transformation, where profitability will no longer be optional but instead essential for survival. The combination of persistent high interest rates and technological disruption will create a challenging environment across all retail sectors — from low-margin categories such as grocery to high-margin ones like apparel.

Retailers face a perfect storm: Higher wages, waning consumer confidence, and intensifying competition will force merchants to innovate to maintain customer loyalty and market share. Incremental improvements simply won’t cut it — success demands organizational readiness to invest in technology solutions, embrace experimentation, and learn from failures. From bankruptcy waves to AI-powered shopping assistants and stricter return policies, the retail industry stands at a crossroads where traditional business models face pressure to lower costs.

Here’s three of the trends we see in store for 2026:

1. A bankruptcy wave will hit specialty retailers. The vulnerability of specialty retail will reach a breaking point in 2026: We predict that three US chains will declare bankruptcy. High interest rates, persistent shifts toward online shopping, and aggressive competition from mass merchants and value retailers will push overleveraged companies into insolvency. Retailers carrying substantial debt loads face the greatest risk.

But even financially stable specialty chains like Dick’s Sporting Goods and Best Buy cannot rest easy — they must aggressively pursue omnichannel strategies, optimize their physical footprints, and create unique experiential offerings that online competitors cannot replicate. For struggling retailers, the priority must be debt reduction above all else. The message is clear: Specialty retail’s margin for error has vanished entirely.

2. AI chatbots will disrupt shopping. Artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape how consumers discover and purchase products: We expect one-quarter of shoppers to use specialty retail chatbots in 2026. As conversational commerce matures, AI assistants will become indispensable for product research, comparison shopping, and customer service across retail platforms.

Chatbot interactions are becoming increasingly prevalent. These tools promise significant cost savings through personalized recommendations and streamlined post-purchase communications around order tracking and returns. Smart retailers will invest in proprietary AI shopping assistants that guide customers throughout the entire journey, from initial discovery through post-transaction support, ensuring seamless integration with emerging conversational technologies. Announcements in recent months of Walmart introducing its own chatbot and partnering with ChatGPT are examples of what we expect to see more of in 2026.

3. Next year will mark the end of generous e-commerce returns. The tide is turning on liberal return policies, as we expect two major global retailers to implement stricter guidelines. Rising processing costs, supply chain pressures, and margin erosion have made generous return windows financially unsustainable. While Amazon and Walmart pioneered “keep the item” approaches for low-value returns, such policies have become vulnerable to exploitation. Retailers will increasingly deploy machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior, selectively offering favorable return terms only to their most profitable, high-margin shoppers. This strategic shift allows merchants to retain customers who generate genuine value — many of whom rely on generous return policies for online purchases — while discouraging unprofitable shopping behaviors. The era of universal no-questions-asked returns is ending as economic realities force difficult choices.

Retailers entering 2026 must adopt profitability as their primary imperative. From bankruptcy risks and AI adoption to return-policy overhauls and changing consumer habits around food and social commerce, the industry faces interconnected challenges requiring bold action. Success hinges on retailers’ technology investment, operational discipline, and willingness to abandon unsustainable practices that erode margins — while building differentiated experiences that drive loyalty.

Forrester clients can read our full report, Predictions 2026: Retail, to get more detail about each of these predictions, plus two more bonus predictions. Retailers and brands, set up a Forrester guidance session to discuss these predictions or plan your 2026 technology strategy.
