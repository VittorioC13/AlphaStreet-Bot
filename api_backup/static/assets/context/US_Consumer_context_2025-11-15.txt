[TITLE]Peachtree Supplies $35M Acquisition Loan for Chicago-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Core Acquisitions has nabbed a $35 million loan to acquire a grocery-anchored shopping center in suburban Chicago, Commercial Observer has learned.

Peachtree Group originated the acquisition loan for Core’s $44 million purchase of the Deerbrook Shopping Center in Deerfield, Ill., from global investment firm DWS.

Taylor Pike, senior vice president at Peachtree, said the property has strong retail fundamentals with a lease through 2035 with anchor tenant Jewel-Osco, the largest grocer in the Chicago metropolitan area. It has been at the site since 1968. The 428,000-square-foot property also includes Marshalls, Floor & Décor, Panera Bread, Starbucks and Sky Zone.

Pike said the northern area of the property has strong foot traffic from a number of national chains, while the southern portion has vacancy with potential for “value-add” redevelopment. He noted that another draw for the deal was Chicago-based Core Acquisitions’ strong institutional knowledge of the market.

“They all live here and drive past the center every single day, and we really like the fact that they’re going to be super hands-on,” said Pike of Core. “They’re going to know a bunch of people that go there, and we like that story and that kind of commitment because they’re going to be in there every single day, working it, trying to make it the best that it can be.”

Deerbook Shopping Center is located at 16 South Waukegan Road, 40 miles north of Downtown Chicago. Pike said the shopping center draws plenty of traffic, with access to Interstate 94 and Metra commuter rail. He also noted new multifamily projects are being developed near the shopping center that will potentially add more foot traffic.

Core Acquisitions did not immediately return a request for comment.

Indian investors are showing growing faith in Reliance Industries (RIL), the country’s most valuable company — even as foreign funds take a step back.In the September 2025 quarter, retail investors slightly increased their stake in Reliance to 7.08%, up from 6.92% in the June quarter, according to shareholding data. That means over 42 lakh small investors now collectively own around 94 crore shares of Reliance Industries.At the same time, mutual funds also boosted their exposure, raising their stake from 9.32% to 9.66%. The move indicates growing domestic conviction in Reliance’s prospects — even though the stock’s performance has been far from stellar lately.In sharp contrast, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) trimmed their holdings in the company, cutting their stake from 19.21% to 18.65%. The number of foreign investors fell as well — from 2,280 to 2,146 — suggesting that global funds may be taking a more cautious stance toward Indian equities or booking profits after a long rally.This shifting ownership pattern comes at an intriguing time.

[TITLE]There could be a buying opportunity in consumer packaged goods stocks, Jim Cramer says:
[TEXT]
CNBC's Jim Cramer told investors why he thinks it might be a good time to invest in packaged good stocks that have been lagged as of late, naming companies including Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark as undervalued winners in the sector.

"Right now, I'm concerned that we might be missing a bottom in a group of stocks that I haven't particularly cared for at all, especially in a long time," he said.

Wall Street has largely soured on the packaged goods group for a while, Cramer suggested, saying there has been too much inflation and not enough growth.

But inflation may be nearing a peak, Cramer said, which would drive consumer giants' costs down. The Trump administration's lenient attitude towards antitrust enforcement also makes it easier for companies to merge and dominate the industry, Cramer suggested.

Kimberly-Clark just announced it plans to buy Kenvue , Cramer noted, and he praised the latter's brands even as Trump officials promote unproven theories that question the safety of Tylenol, one of its popular drugs. He lauded Procter & Gamble as an inventive company that has the size and scale to make products cheaper. Clorox , which is one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 , also caught Cramer's eye, and he said he likes its namesake cleaner as well as brands like Burt's Bees, Hidden Valley and Brita. He added that investors willing to take on risk might want to buy General Mills — but only if they're betting on a takeover, as the popularity of weight loss drugs is putting food stocks under pressure.

Cramer also said investors can look beyond traditional consumer packaged goods stocks and into pharmaceuticals, saying he expects big mergers in that industry. He named Johnson & Johnson and Amgen as solid picks.

There's "too much opportunity to pass up," Cramer said, "given that these are currently among the most hated companies in the universe."

Founded as a print publication in 1989, The Food Channel transitioned online in 1993 and later joined the USA Today network in 2017 to expand its reach.

[TITLE]Redesdale invests in Talio Technologies to forecast emerging food trends through AI:
[TEXT]
Redesdale invests in early-stage companies in the food, drink and nutrition sector.

John Conroy’s Redesdale Fund has invested in a company that uses artificial intelligence to help food businesses identify emerging consumer trends.

Talio Technologies uses AI agents to gather and analyse data on menus, retail trends and social habits to help food companies make faster and better-informed decisions on new products and marketing.

Founded in Dublin by Oran O’Flynn and Ciaran O’Connor, Talio says it works with food and beverage groups to support trend forecasting, concept development and long-term innovation planning. It numbers Kerry Group and Valeo among its clients.

Talio says its AI allows customers to differentiate between short-term fads and more sustained shifts in taste.

“This is a very exciting opportunity for Redesdale as it brings us into the AI technology space in food and we are partnering with first-class entrepreneurs in Oran and Ciaran, who have shown tremendous drive and skill to bring this product to market,” said Redesdale partner Michael Cantwell.

It is the venture capital group’s first AI-related investment.

“Innovation in the food and beverage industry has never moved faster,” Talio said. “For enterprise teams, predicting what’s truly next – beyond the hype – can mean the difference between a blockbuster launch and a costly misfire.”

The Redesdale Fund focuses on investment in early-stage businesses in the food, drink and nutrition sectors. Talio is the fifth investment by the €27 million fund which is backed by Enterprise Ireland, US-based Lord Abbett, Musgrave, Coca-Cola, Monaghan Mushrooms and Tate & Lyle.

The fund is expected to ramp up its investment portfolio over the coming months.

The group’s investments to date include: Dundalk-based Soothing Solutions, which says its dissolvable honey-based jelly pop harnesses natural ingredients to provide relief for children with sore throats; Thanks Plants, which produces a range of plant-based products such as frankfurters, sausages and roasts for health-conscious consumers; Fiid, a maker of plant-based microwaveable meals for the convenience meal market; and Kwayga, a company that has developed technology to help supermarket buyers cut their sourcing times dramatically.

[TITLE]Govt withdraws BIS norms on polyester chain, polymers; user industry cites relief on costs for MSMEs:
[TEXT]
The Centre has withdrawn quality control orders (QCOs) on a wide range of polyester and petrochemical inputs, in a move that spells relief for user industries such as apparel and footwear, while raising competition from imports for local manufacturers of these key inputs.

QCOs issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) subject manufacturers and importers of specific goods to certain standards. While they ensure greater quality, they also raise costs, which cascade down to industries which use these raw materials.

The order from the department of chemicals and petrochemicals comes after a Niti Aayog committee led by former cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba recommended relaxing QCOs. These orders raise costs for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which import them in large quantities.

While the withdrawal will make raw materials accessible for makers of textiles and PVC products, it may impact manufacturers such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and the Aditya Birla Group companies Grasim and Thai Acrylic Fibre.

Also Read | Filatex bets on polyester recycling and renewables for next phase of growth

Queries sent to Indian Oil and the Aditya Birla Group remained unanswered till press time.

Reliance has always priced its products keeping the long-term growth of textile industry in mind, a company spokesperson said in an email. "This has been our philosophy from the from the day we started manufacturing products & polyester and integrated backwards. We welcome the decision of the government, and we will continue to stay competitive offering the best quality products to the downstream industry for domestic and value-added export market."

The withdrawal of QCOs fulfils an MSME industry wish, significantly benefiting textile makers, said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India. However, it also goes against the government's original plan to expand the ambit of QCOs to cover more products.

The raw materials now free of QCOs are used to make man-made fibres, plastics, packaging, footwear, consumer goods, appliances and automotive components. Several of them such as PTA, MEG, polypropylene, PVC and ABS are among India’s most critical chemical imports, sourced from China, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Thailand and Singapore. Products like polyester staple fibre, POY and FDY also rely on imports during periods of domestic shortage, particularly from China and Indonesia.

Welcome decision

Just last week, the Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association had written to the government, making a strong case for QCOs. While industries abroad benefitted from state subsidies, India's QCOs helped counter them, the association had said. On Thursday, the association did not respond to a query

[TITLE]Global retail rebound lifts outlook for Indian apparel exporters:
[TEXT]
Global retail demand is showing signs of recovery, signaling a potential turnaround for Indian garment exporters. Leading players such as Gokaldas Exports and Pearl Global Industries are reworking their strategies, diversifying markets, expanding production bases outside India, and positioning for trade advantages under proposed free trade agreements (FTAs).

The companies, in post-Q2 investor calls, indicated that order inflows from key markets such as the US and Europe have begun to stabilise, with new business emerging from regions like Japan and Australia. This, combined with the ongoing sourcing diversification by global retailers, is expected to set the stage for a steadier growth cycle for Indian exporters.

“In the longer term, sourcing diversification is a key theme for all customers. With likely tariff rationalisation, India will remain one of the top contenders among Asian peers,” said Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of Gokaldas Exports.

“The recently announced India-UK FTA offers a 12 per cent duty advantage over China and puts India on par with Bangladesh, creating strong export potential. A trade deal with the EU could open significant opportunities as well,” he added.

Gokaldas, which has been expanding its footprint in the UK and EU, is witnessing growing visibility from its Africa operations, leveraging the low-tariff regime and potential renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Currently, Africa contributes

[TITLE]Online Design Platforms Are Charting New Revenue Streams:
[TEXT]
MILAN — Design websites have been on an upward swing since the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an appetite for all things home. And while the personal luxury goods market is expected to show a drop in revenues this year, luxury home websites are expanding their reach to a broad spectrum of clients in search of curated solutions for residential and hospitality spaces.

That sort of edge starts with offline branded and luxury residential and hospitality projects, from the deserts of the United Arab Emirates to the streets of New York City. These bespoke commissions are providing a strong new revenue stream for e-commerce players on and offline.

A prime example of how this relationship is burgeoning is The Greenwich in New York City, with which Italian design platform Artemest took a deep dive into the luxury real estate world, unveiling its first model residence concept in a penthouse valued at $13.5 million in 2024. The project’s main partners said the idea behind inviting Italian brands and designers to imbue select spaces with their signature flair was part of a broader effort to build the residence as a strong brand. This sort of strategy is echoing worldwide. It also highlights a broader effort to create a narrative within new spaces and distinguish properties with hard-to-find, rare pieces.

Earlier in November, Artemest also unveiled a fully furnished penthouse in London, located at Embassy Gardens. Inside the property, every detail — from sculptural lighting to bespoke furniture — was sourced from Artemest.

Artemest’s chief executive officer Marco Credendino said emerging markets in the Middle East, where contract business is booming, are a major driver of sales. “The business has evolved from being focused purely on residential projects to a balanced mix that includes hospitality and food and beverage. Bespoke contract work is becoming a significant part of our business,” he said.

Overall, Artemest said it expects 35 percent year-on-year growth in 2025, reaching roughly $40 million in revenue. The first half of the year has already reflected that positive trajectory, he said. “This confirms that our model — blending Italian craftsmanship with a global digital and offline presence — continues to resonate strongly with clients around the world,” Credendino said.

A Leg-up

Online operations are also able to execute projects in a way interior design firms alone cannot. An added edge for an operation like Artemest is its roster of 1,000 artisans and designers at its fingertips to choose from. The firm also has an in-house team that guides clients through every step of the project, from creative concept to delivery, working with trusted partners to bridge the gap between consumer and producer.

“What makes the difference for us is the way we approach it — every project is treated as a one-of-a-kind collaboration, where the goal is to deliver something truly exceptional and tailored. Clients today are looking for warmth, character, and a sense of identity in their public spaces, and that’s exactly what Italian craftsmanship brings: authenticity, quality, and the unmistakable touch of Made in Italy,” he said.

Competition Is Growing

In December, London-based platform Invisible Collection revealed the completion of its first bespoke interior design project for The Surrey’s private residences in New York City. Like Artemest, Invisible Collection has a similar network edge and was able to provide one-of-a-kind interior design services, affording prospective buyers access to a bespoke curation of contemporary furniture from the platform’s roster of well-known talents.

Architectural designer Laura Gonzalez, architect and interior decorator Charles Zana and architect and furniture designer Thierry Lemaire are among those who fit in with the platform’s enriched contemporary French aesthetic.

On Tuesday, Invisible Collection unveiled its exclusive partnership with luxury and branded residential development operator Rhodium, a leading adviser and operator of ultra-luxury and branded residential developments. Going forward, the two companies will offer developers and homeowners an integrated service that combines operational expertise with made-to-order interior design by some of the world’s most respected designers and artisans.

“We launched Invisible Collection with design connoisseurs and collectors in mind, thinking of all the sophisticated residential projects that call for bespoke, made-to-order creations. I think we are succeeding, as our worldwide sales are largely driven by this clientele.” Invisible Collection cofounder Isabelle Dubern-Mallevays told WWD.

Game-changing Terrain

When Milan-based Dexelance, which owns upscale furniture and lighting firms Meridiani, Davide Groppi and Gervasoni, bought Mohd, a historic furniture business and early pioneer of the online luxury design business, showrooms in the U.S. saw this as a possible game changer for Dexelance, which only recently established showrooms in New York City and Boston.

[TITLE]United States Dishwasher Market Trends, Business Prospects and Company Analysis, 2025-2033 - U.S. Housing Boom Fuels Growth in Built-in Dishwasher Sales:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "United States Dishwasher Market Report by Products, Application, Distribution Channel, States and Company Analysis, 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The United States Dishwasher Industry is anticipated to grow tremendously, increasing from US$ 10.71 Billion in 2024 to US$ 13.05 Billion by 2033. This growth is expected to have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 2.22% from 2025 to 2033. The growth can be attributed to factors like growing consumer needs for energy-saving appliances, technological advances, and the popularity of smart home devices.

Growth Drivers in the United States Dishwasher Market

Increased Consumer Demand for Convenience and Time-Saving Devices

The increasing need for home appliances with convenience features is a strong growth driver for the U.S. dishwasher market. Urban living, dual-income families, and hectic lifestyles make households more dependent on dishwashers as they help save time and effort over manual washing. Contemporary dishwashers also come equipped with smart connectivity, various wash cycles, and energy savings, all of which are attractive to consumers who are tech-savvy. The increasing meshing of smart home systems further accelerates adoption, as consumers want appliances with voice assistant and IoT platform compatibility. This trend toward convenience and digital lives is driving dishwasher penetration in residential as well as commercial U.S. markets.

Rising Focus on Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

Government regulations and environmental consciousness are driving the U.S. adoption of energy-efficient dishwashers. Consumers are increasingly aware of electricity and water savings, opting for appliances bearing the ENERGY STAR logo and green-friendly features. New dishwashers consume less water than handwashing, which supports sustainability efforts. Companies are spending on new technologies such as soil sensors, low-noise technology, and water-recycling programs to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. State and federal programs encouraging eco-friendly appliance adoption through rebates and incentives are also increasing adoption. As sustainability is increasingly becoming a determining driver of purchases, environmentally efficient dishwashers are finding increasing popularity in the American market.

Growth of the Housing and Real Estate Sector

Residential building and remodeling activities in the U.S. are fuelling the sale of dishwashers, especially in cities and suburbs. Built-in dishwashers are increasingly being found in contemporary kitchens as part of standard appliances, enhancing market penetration. Increased consumer expenditure on kitchen renovation and home improvement, driven by lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, has further boosted demand. Contractors and builders are installing energy-efficient dishwashers in new homes, while householders are replacing existing ones with high-end, smart-enabled ones. As the real estate industry continues to grow, the U.S. dishwasher market is poised for consistent long-term growth.

Challenges in the United States Dishwasher Market

High Installation Charge and Repair Cost

One of the biggest roadblocks in the U.S. dishwasher market is the high price of appliances, particularly smart and energy-saving ones. Most households, especially those in rural or low-income areas, still view dishwashers as a luxury and not a necessity. Also, repair and maintenance charges, such as spares and servicing, contribute to consumer resistance. Although financing and promotional incentives soften initial costs, affordability remains a limiting factor to adoption in certain market segments. Unless producers launch lower-priced models without sacrificing quality, the high price barrier will be an enduring problem for dishwasher penetration in the U.S. marketplace.

Limited Penetration in Small Apartments and Homes

In spite of increasing adoption, dishwashers enjoy limited penetration in smaller apartments and urban homes where kitchen space is limited. Most urban older buildings do not have inbuilt layouts to allow for built-in dishwashers, and the public must settle for compact or portable versions. Even so, limited space and plumbing considerations lower the uptake rates. Rental and leasing landlords and tenants usually shy away from investing in such appliances because of installation issues. Portability and countertop dishwashers are yet to penetrate deeply because of limited product options and ignorance. Space-related limitations thus continue to be a major impediment to wider market growth.

United States Built-in Dishwasher Market

United States built-in dishwasher market is growing strongly, driven by increasing kitchen remodeling and new home construction. Built-in dishwashers are chosen for their unobtrusive blending with new kitchen styles, quietness, and high capacity. Builders incorporate them more and more as standard in new homes to promote adoption. High-end consumers prefer smart-enabled units with energy efficiency, Wi-Fi connectivity, and sophisticated cleaning cycles. Although installation constraints may discourage some consumers, good demand from middle- and upper-income families guarantees consistent expansion. Integrated dishwashers will continue to be the leading segment of the U.S. dishwasher market because of their functionality and appearance.

United States Residential Dishwasher Market

The U.S. residential dishwasher market is fueled by increasing household penetration, supported by increasing disposable income and hectic lifestyles. More households are looking for appliances that minimize hand work and give clean and hygienic results. Portable and smaller models are rising in popularity among city residents, while fixed models rule in suburban houses. Companies are also launching low-cost models with energy-saving mechanisms to appeal to a larger customer base. Changes in lifestyle post-pandemic, such as increased home cooking, have sped up adoption. As dishwashers become less of a luxury in many households and more of an essential, residential demand will keep driving overall U.S. market expansion.

United States Commercial Dishwasher Market

The U.S. commercial dishwasher market is experiencing steady growth due to demand from restaurants, hotels, cafeterias, and institutional kitchens. These venues need high-capacity units that can wash large volumes while ensuring hygiene and safety. Commercial dishwashers conserve time, save on labor, and increase operational effectiveness. Increased emphasis on sustainability is causing demand for energy- and water-efficient business models. The recovery of the foodservice sector following the COVID-19 pandemic has also boosted sales of dishwashers. As demand for automated and sanitation within commercial kitchens continues to grow, the commercial dishwasher market will continue to be a robust contributor to the U.S. market.

United States Offline Dishwasher Market

Offline sales channels continue to play a vital role in the U.S. dishwasher market, as many consumers prefer to purchase appliances from physical retail stores. Large retailers such as Home Depot, Lowe's, and Best Buy dominate this segment, offering product demonstrations, installation services, and financing options. Offline stores provide hands-on experience, which is crucial for big-ticket purchases like dishwashers. Though online channels are expanding, offline channels continue to enjoy high consumer confidence and play a key role in suburban and rural areas. Offline retailing through bundled discounts and customized consulting services is a major sales generator in the dishwasher market.

California Dishwasher Market

California is a prominent dishwasher market in the United States, fueled by its massive population base, urbanization, and eco-aware consumers. State regulations regarding water and energy help to promote adoption of ENERGY STAR-certified dishwashers, which are supportive of sustainability efforts. Higher-income residences and urban new-construction projects in Los Angeles and San Francisco are demanding premium, smart-enabled built-in models. Growing water-savings awareness, due to California's drought history, also fosters adoption of dishwashers as opposed to manual washing. With a robust combination of environmental policy, innovation, and consumer demand, California is among the most dynamic state-level dishwasher markets in the country.

New York Dishwasher Market

New York's dishwasher market is driven by its high population density, high disposable incomes, and mixed-housing stock. Although suburbs experience high adoption of built-in dishwashers, small and portable versions are well-liked in New York City apartments owing to limited spaces. Online retailers and e-commerce websites are taking advantage of this trend by providing space-efficient models. Urban lifestyles and a need for convenience also influence dishwasher sales among New York families. In addition, commercial use by the city's huge hospitality and restaurant industries is a major factor in growth. Urban and suburban markets are changing, but New York remains a major dishwasher hub.

New Jersey Dishwasher Market

New Jersey's dishwasher market is growing steadily, fueled by its suburban household base and location near large metropolitan centers like New York City and Philadelphia. Suburban householders prefer built-in dishwashers, with portable versions for apartment dwellers. The relatively high disposable income in the state fosters demand for mid- and premium-priced models with high-end features. Offline demand is fueled by retail chains and specialty appliance stores, with e-commerce gaining momentum for small and inexpensive dishwashers. Increasing importance on convenience, water conservation, and energy efficiency makes New Jersey a solid performer in the overall U.S. dishwasher market growth.
