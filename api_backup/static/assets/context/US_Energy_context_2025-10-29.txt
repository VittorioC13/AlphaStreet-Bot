Indian renewables firm OMC Power , backed by Japan's Mitsui & Co and Chubu Electric Power , said on Monday that automaker Honda Motor has acquired a stake in the company to jointly develop clean energy storage batteries.OMC Power did not disclose the size of the stake or financial details. The deal marks Honda's entry into India's distributed clean energy industry.OMC Power Chief Executive Rohit Chandra said Chubu holds slightly over 30% in the company, while Mitsui owns more than 26%. Together with Honda, the three Japanese companies hold about 70% of the firm.The Indian company is also looking to raise about 25 billion to 30 billion rupees ($284.4 million-$341.3 million) in debt over the next three years and is in talks with State Bank of India and several international lenders, Chandra said.The money raised from both Honda and through debt will go towards the company's plan to build 1 gigawatt of distributed clean energy in the next three years, Chandra said. Distributed energy systems supply power to specific sites or areas on a smaller scale and can function either connected to or isolated from the wider grid.OMC Power operates more than 500 renewable energy plants across northern and central India and supplies electricity to telecom companies, healthcare providers, small- and medium-sized businesses and rural houses via mini-grids and battery storage.As part of the deal, OMC Power will repurpose Honda's detachable and portable batteries, originally used in electric two- and three-wheeler vehicles for storage-based clean energy.The project will commence in January 2026 and will extend the lifecycle of used EV batteries by repurposing them to provide power to small and medium businesses and rural homes, the company said.

[TITLE]Hennessy Embraces the Power Behind the AI Revolution with ONE Nuclear Energy – Exec Edge Research Update:
[TEXT]
ONE Nuclear’s Develop-Own-Operate model and growth strategy combines speed to market, technological expertise, and deep execution partnerships to de-risk project development and accelerate revenue generation.

Multi-Technology SMR approach: By engaging with multiple SMR vendors, ONE Nuclear can tailor its solutions to customer and site-specific needs. Early deployments target generation costs of $80-$120/MWh for first-of-a-kind reactors, with improved economics as manufacturing scales.

Partnership with Rolls-Royce Solutions America, Inc. provides a critical bridge to near-term revenue and accelerates the path to commercial scale. By securing access to advanced modular natural-gas power systems from Rolls-Royce, the company can bring online gigawatt-scale generation capacity years before its nuclear facilities are commissioned. This phased approach enables early cash flow, strengthens project economics, and reduces execution risk, positioning ONE Nuclear to self-fund portions of its SMR build-out while meeting immediate demand from data-center and industrial customers.

Comprehensive site development pipeline: The company has identified over 75 candidate sites, representing up to 15 GW of potential capacity. Its first two development projects – in East Texas and West Oklahoma – together encompass ~3 GW of planned capacity by 2034, including 2 GW of near-term gas generation expected by 2028 .

Strategic partnerships: ONE Nuclear’s platform is anchored by collaborations with Rolls-Royce Solutions America (gas generators), a global integrated energy group (offtake optimization and trading), Black & Veatch and Futureworx (EPC and program management), and an intended joint venture with Quadrant Nuclear Industries (training and operations services). These partnerships provide immediate access to technology, engineering expertise, and market reach.

Experienced team: The leadership team, led by Co-Founder and CEO Richard Taylor, a 40-year energy veteran, brings cross-disciplinary experience in nuclear engineering, infrastructure finance, and large-scale project execution.

The money raised from both Honda and through debt will go towards the company's plan to build 1 gigawatt of distributed clean energy in the next three years, Chandra said.

Distributed energy systems supply power to specific sites or areas on a smaller scale and can function either connected to or isolated from the wider grid.

OMC Power operates more than 500 renewable energy plants across northern and central India and supplies electricity to telecom companies, healthcare providers, small- and medium-sized businesses and rural houses via mini-grids and battery storage.

As part of the deal, OMC Power will repurpose Honda's detachable and portable batteries, originally used in electric two- and three-wheeler vehicles for storage-based clean energy.

The project will commence in January 2026 and will extend the lifecycle of used EV batteries by repurposing them to provide power to small and medium businesses and rural homes, the company said.

[TITLE]Oil steadies as US-China trade deal hope, Russian sanctions counter demand concerns:
[TEXT]
By Arathy Somasekhar

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices held steady on Monday as hopes of a trade deal framework between the U.S. and China and renewed U.S. sanctions on Russia offset broader concerns

[TITLE]Oil slips on scepticism over US-China trade deal impact, Iraq exports rise:
[TEXT]
By Seher Dareen

LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices edged lower on Monday, falling over 1% earlier in the session as they were pressured by scepticism that a U.S. and Chinese trade deal framework would immediately boost oil demand and after Iraq's oil minister confirmed an oilfield fire had not affected the OPEC member's oil exports.

Brent crude futures were down 24 cents, or nearly 0.4%, to $65.70 a barrel at 1113 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were also down 24 cents or 0.4%, to $61.26.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday U.S. and Chinese officials had hashed out a "substantial framework" for a trade deal that could avoid 100% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China's rare-earth export controls in trade discussions this week.

This boosted global stocks on Monday, while safe-haven gold and bonds retreated, along with oil. [MKTS/GLOB]

DEMAND CONCERNS WEIGH ON OIL

"Oil market participants are much more sceptical of trade deals than their equity counterparts. A bright negotiating atmosphere does not immediately mean demand," said PVM Oil Associates analyst John Evans.

Concerns over lacklustre demand have weighed on the market, with Brent falling to its lowest since May earlier this month, but renewed sanctions on Russia from the U.S. along with stronger-than-expected U.S. demand have helped buoy prices.

"The hope for bulls is that U.S. consumption continues to recover, otherwise it seems the drift lower seen so far today is likely to intensify," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Bank.

Meanwhile Iraq, the OPEC group's biggest overproducer, was in negotiations over the size of its quota within its available capacity of 5.5 million barrels per day, oil minister Hayan Abdel-Ghani said at an oil conference on Monday.

OPEC and its allies have changed course this year by reversing previous production cuts to regain market share, helping in part to keep a lid on oil prices.

The fire at Iraq's Zubair oilfield on Sunday did not impact exports from the country, the country's oil minister added.

Last week, Brent and WTI rose 8.9% and 7.7%, respectively, on U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia.

"There are likely some continued challenges for Russian oil to enter the market, but it depends on how sanctions will be enforced," said Rystad analyst Janiv Shah.

[TITLE]Oil prices rise after US and China reach trade-deal framework:
[TEXT]
By Sam Li and Lewis Jackson

(Reuters) -Oil prices rose in early trade on Monday after U.S. and Chinese economic officials sketched out a trade-deal framework, easing fears that tariffs and export curbs between the world's top two oil consumers could dent global economic growth.

Brent crude futures rose 46 cents, or 0.7%, to $66.40 a barrel by 0027 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 46 cents, or 0.75%, to $61.96, after rising 8.9% and 7.7%, respectively, in the previous week on U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia.

Haitong Securities said in a note that market expectations have improved following new sanctions on Russia and the easing of U.S.-China tensions, countering concerns about crude oversupply that had driven prices down earlier in October.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday top Chinese and U.S. economic officials hashed out a "very substantial framework" for a trade deal in Kuala Lumpur, which would allow President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to discuss trade cooperation later this week.

Bessent said the framework would avoid 100% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China's rare-earth export controls.

Trump also said on Sunday he was optimistic about reaching an agreement with Beijing and expected to hold meetings in China and the United States.

“I think we’re going to have a deal with China," Trump said. "We’re going to meet them later in China and we’re going to meet them in the U.S., either Washington or Mar-a-Lago."

The positive trade-deal framework helps offset concerns that Russia could offset new U.S. sanctions, targeting Rosneft and Lukoil, by offering deeper discounts and using shadow fleets to lure buyers, said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG.

“However, if sanctions on Russian energy are less effective than expected, oversupply pressures could return to the market,” said Yang An, an analyst at Haitong Securities.

[TITLE]mBank and PGGM enter into PLN 3.8 billion credit risk sharing transaction backed by financing to the renewable energy sector:
[TEXT]
WARSAW, Poland, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mBank and PGGM have entered into a credit risk sharing transaction referencing a PLN 3.8 billion portfolio of corporate loans in Poland. Approximately 75% of the portfolio is backed by financing of wind-farms and photovoltaic installations. The remainder of the portfolio references project finance lending in the areas of health care, telecommunications, and other industries of strategic importance to the lender.

This is the first large-scale project finance significant risk transfer transaction (SRT) from the CEE region, primarily backed by a portfolio of renewables. It is also the third transaction in three years between mBank and PGGM.

The transaction represents an important milestone for mBank and is executed shortly following the announcement of mBank’s new strategy for 2026-2030 titled “Full Speed Ahead!”. The transaction will help the bank advance its sustainability agenda. In the strategy, the bank aims to allocate 15% of its corporate credit portfolio to sustainable finance by 2030, contributing to the energy transition of the Polish economy.

For PGGM and its end investor PFZW, the transaction offers a unique opportunity to support the energy transition in Central and Eastern Europe. It reflects PGGM’s and PFZW’s long-standing commitment to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals in the context of PFZW’s 3D investment approach, while strengthening the strategic relationship with mBank.

The transaction has been structured in accordance with the European Union’s regulatory framework for significant risk transfer (SRT), ensuring compliance with capital relief requirements.

Luca Paonessa, Lead Portfolio Manager, Credit Risk Sharing at PGGM: “This is the third transaction we execute with mBank, and the first with a strong focus on sustainability and energy transition. We are particularly proud of this project, as it reinforces two of our investment principles: the focus on partnerships with like-minded banks, and the belief that banks can play a critical role in the energy transition. Ultimately, this shows that credit risk sharing is an effective tool for mobilizing private capital for sustainable development. It therefore fits perfectly in PGGM’s 3D investment approach where we aim for an optimal balance between risk, return and sustainability for PFZW’s pension assets.”

Karol Prażmo, Managing Director - Treasury & Investor Relations at mBank: “We are proud to be once again writing SRT market history together with PGGM—this time through the first large-scale project finance SRT from the CEE region, backed by a portfolio of renewable energy projects. The transaction strengthens our capital base, builds on our position as a leading bank in the renewables sector, increases our capacity for new business, and more broadly supports Poland’s energy transition. It reflects the shared strategic focus of both mBank and PGGM on sustainability and ESG. I would like to thank the entire PGGM and mBank team for successfully closing this landmark transaction.”

[TITLE]US electric utilities entering investment ‘super-cycle,’ says Morningstar DBRS:
[TEXT]
U.S. electric utilities are entering a five-year capital expenditure “super-cycle” as they build out transmission and generation networks to meet new demand from data centers, Morningstar DBRS said in a Monday research note.

“Investment in electricity infrastructure is projected to be $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030, double the amount invested in the prior 10 years,” the firm said. And based on data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp., Morningstar said many regions can expect load growth to increase from previously estimated 6.1% to around 11.6% over the next decade.

“The challenges posed by the rapid buildout of data centers are overlaid on existing concerns for most utilities, including decarbonization and guaranteeing the reliability of grid infrastructure while increasing the contribution of renewable power,” Morningstar said. “The projected surge in demand provides opportunities for utilities that must be counterbalanced with structural changes and regulatory support for utilities and rate payers.”

"We anticipate that regulated utilities with supportive regulatory commissions, solid credit ratings, and access to capital markets will deploy the needed capex to take advantage of the data center boom," Bukola Folashakin, Morningstar assistant vice president of corporate ratings, said in a statement. "We expect this capex investment in turn to make such utility locations attractive for more data center construction, potentially creating a cycle of increased revenue for as long as data centers remain economically viable."

Some states — Morningstar named California, Texas, and Louisiana — will see elevated risks of resource inadequacy next year that “in extreme conditions, could trigger electricity shortfalls,” according to the note.

Morningstar’s analysis mirror’s recent capital expenditure estimates from the Edison Electric Institute, which expects U.S electricity generation to grow “for the foreseeable future.” The group, which represents investor-owned utilities, said generation rose 3% in 2024 and generation investments as a share of the industry’s total capital expenditures have risen for four straight years.

The rapid rise in electricity demand, following decades of stagnation, will challenge utilities in a few ways, according to Morningstar.

Uncertainty around needed data center capacity “makes it challenging for utilities to accurately forecast future power demand and the required investment,” according to the report. And those data centers bring demand surges that are driving “higher tolls for other customer segments,” which “will be exacerbated as more data centers become operational.”

Meeting the demand requires massive utility investment but “traditional funding sources are inadequate to meet future investment needs,” Morningstar said. “Utilities are increasingly looking to private capital to fill funding gaps,” while increased ratepayer-funded investments lead to regulatory lag.
