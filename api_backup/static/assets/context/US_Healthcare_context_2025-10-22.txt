AI Brings Automation to Scientific Discovery

Lila Sciences raised $115 million in an extension of its Series A, backed by Nvidia Capital. The Boston-based company is developing “AI Science Factories,” automated laboratories that use robotics, sensors, and generative models to design and run experiments continuously. Instead of relying on publicly available data, Lila’s systems produce their own experimental results. They feed them back into machine-learning models that improve. The funding will support expansion of its lab network and entry into sectors such as materials science, clean-energy catalysts and biotechnology. By automating experimentation, Lila helps in solving one of the slowest and most expensive steps in scientific discovery. Its system continuously designs and tests new hypotheses. This increases research throughput and reduces the cost of trial-and-error for industries that rely on lab results to develop new materials or medicines.

CoMind, a London-based medical technology startup, secured $102.5 million led by Plural VC. Founded by James Dacombe in 2018, CoMind is developing a non-invasive brain monitoring device. It uses low-powered infrared lasers and AI-based signal processing to measure cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure. This data is traditionally captured through probes inserted into the skull. The system has completed trials at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London and in Barcelona. It is enrolling U.S. patients for a pivotal study as part of its FDA approval process. CoMind anticipates hospital deployment in 2027. Its value lies in combining optical sensing with AI interpretation. This gives clinicians real-time visibility into brain health at the bedside. For hospitals, this could mean faster diagnostics, fewer surgical complications, and better outcomes for patients with head injuries or stroke.

From Roads to Fields

Wayve is in talks with Microsoft and SoftBank for up to $2 billion in new funding, potentially valuing the London-based autonomous driving firm near $8 billion. The company develops autonomous driving systems that learn from real-world video data rather than relying on high-definition maps. In contrast to some competitors who use extensive mapping and rule-based navigation, Wayve’s model generalizes across vehicle types and environments by learning from human driving behavior. According to a PYMNTS article citing Uber’s CEO, driverless vehicles could scale in the next 15 to 20 years. This would happen when systems can learn from real conditions rather than fixed instructions. The possible funding would help expand training data sets and simulation tools. These are key steps toward building self-driving systems capable of adjusting in unpredictable settings.

Ecorobotix raised $150 million in Series D funding. The Swiss agricultural robotics firm uses AI-driven vision systems to detect individual weeds and spray them with millimeter precision. This reduces herbicide use by up to 95%. Total funding is now near $150 million. The company is expanding into North America and developing new models for crop-specific recognition. Global data from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show total pesticide use in agriculture at 3.73 million tons of active ingredients in 2023. This highlights the scale of the opportunity for precision systems that reduce chemical inputs. Ecorobotix’s platform shows how AI, sensors and field robotics can be embedded into equipment. This delivers environmental and economic gains.

Enterprise Finance AI

In enterprise automation, Campfire recently raised $65 million in a Series B funding round co-led by Accel and Ribbit Capital, bringing its total to more than $100 million. The U.S.-based company builds an AI-native enterprise resource planning (ERP) system designed to streamline corporate finance tasks, including reconciliations, month-end closings, and forecasting. With this new funding, Campfire aims to expand globally and accelerate AI development, addressing finance teams’ increasing demand for modern solutions that go beyond legacy ERP systems.

Reducto raised $75 million in Series B funding from Andreessen Horowitz to expand its document intelligence software. The company converts unstructured files such as contracts, PDFs, and invoices into structured datasets that enterprise AI tools can use directly. Reducto is helping financial services and healthcare firms feed reliable data into internal language model systems.

[TITLE]Neuphoria Therapeutics Provides Update on AFFIRM-1 Phase 3 Trial Evaluating BNC210 for the Acute Treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder:
[TEXT]
AFFIRM-1 trial did not meet primary endpoint or secondary endpoints

Company to conduct strategic review of portfolio and business operations

BURLINGTON, Mass., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neuphoria Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: NEUP) (“Neuphoria” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing impactful treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders, today announced that the AFFIRM-1 Phase 3 trial of BNC210 for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD) did not meet its primary endpoint of change from baseline to the average of the performance phase of the public speaking challenge in Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) scores. In addition, analyses of secondary endpoints did not demonstrate statistically significant differences. The safety and tolerability profile of BNC210 continued to be favorable and was consistent with previously reported studies.

“We are grateful to the AFFIRM-1 trial participants and their families, as well as the investigators and our staff, who contributed to our SAD program over the years,” said Spyros Papapetropoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Neuphoria. “We plan to immediately take action to conserve our cash position by holding further investment in our programs and evaluating all options for Neuphoria’s path forward through a strategic review, with the goal of maximizing value for shareholders.”

Business Update and Outlook

Based on the results from the AFFIRM-1 trial, Neuphoria will discontinue further development of its SAD program. Given previous positive data with chronic daily dosing, Neuphoria also plans to evaluate next steps for further development of BNC210 in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The company plans to conduct a full strategic review of its operations and portfolio and to provide an update by year-end.

The Company has an ongoing partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck). MK-1167, one of two positive allosteric modulator (PAM) candidates being advanced in the strategic partnership with Merck, is currently being evaluated in a Merck-led Phase 2 trial in Alzheimer’s disease. Merck is responsible for all costs of this program, and through the partnership, Neuphoria is eligible to receive up to $450 million in additional milestone payments for certain development and commercial milestones plus royalties on net sales of any licensed medicines.

As of June 30, 2025, Neuphoria’s cash and cash equivalents were $14.2 million. The Company expects its current cash position to be sufficient to fund operations through the second fiscal quarter of 2027.
