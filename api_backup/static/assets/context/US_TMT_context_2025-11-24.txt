[TITLE]GoTu Technology Secures $45 Million Growth Investment to Modernize Dental Staffing:
[TEXT]
MIAMI, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GoTu Technology, the nation's leading dental talent marketplace, today announced a $45 million growth investment led by Long Ridge Equity Partners ("Long Ridge"), with participation from institutional investors advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The capital will support GoTu's nationwide expansion, accelerate development of its marketplace platform, and fuel the launch of new, innovative services that meet the evolving needs of dental practices across the country.

The dental industry faces an acute shortage of hygienists and assistants, making flexible staffing solutions critical to maintaining access to care. Since launching in 2019, GoTu has become the largest technology-enabled platform in the dental staffing market. Its on-demand marketplace connects hygienists, assistants, and associate dentists with dental practices to fill temporary shifts in real time – improving flexibility, reliability, and efficiency for both professionals and practices.

“In the fragmented landscape of dental workforce solutions, GoTu stands out for its nationwide reach, its enterprise-grade platform, and its high satisfaction among both dental offices and professionals,” said Kevin Bhatt, Long Ridge Managing Partner. “We are excited to support the GoTu team as they scale their market-leading platform through geographic expansion, product innovation, and strategic partnerships.”

Since its founding, GoTu has filled more than 500,000 dental shifts across 44 states and Washington D.C. The platform gives dental practices seamless access to verified professionals through a technology-driven experience, while giving clinicians the flexibility and control to work on their own terms.

“With dental offices nationwide struggling to recruit and retain qualified staff, this investment allows us to scale our impact,” said Edward Thomas, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of GoTu. “We’re proud of how far we’ve come, but this is only the beginning. Partnering with Long Ridge enables us to expand access to our platform, invest further in product innovation, and continue building the go-to resource for the dental industry.”

GoTu's growth has earned national recognition, from consecutive Inc. 5000 honors (2024 and 2025) to inclusion in Deloitte's Technology Fast 500 and Becker's Dental Fastest-Growing Companies.

Cary Gahm, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of GoTu, added, “This new milestone validates the vision we’ve pursued since day one: creating flexible, empowering opportunities for dental professionals while providing practices with the talent they need to thrive. Long Ridge shares our belief that the future of staffing lies at the intersection of technology and human connection – and together we're creating the workforce infrastructure that will redefine how dentistry works.”

[TITLE]Office of Strategic Capital Agrees to Joint $700M Conditional Loan Commitment with Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies:
[TEXT]
November 21, 2025

Release

Office of Strategic Capital Agrees to Joint $700M Conditional Loan Commitment with Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies

The Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) announces a joint $700 million conditional loan commitment with Vulcan Elements ("Vulcan") and ReElement Technologies ("ReElement") to increase domestic Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) magnet production and significantly bolster U.S. critical minerals supply chains.

The OSC commitment includes two separate loans, one to Vulcan for $620 million and one to ReElement for $80 million. These loans will directly support the production of advanced rare earth element separation, metallization, and magnet manufacturing capabilities in the United States. With the increased manufacturing and processing capabilities enabled by OSC's loans, Vulcan and ReElement anticipate collectively producing up to 10,000 metric tons of NdFeB magnet material in the next several years, thereby significantly reducing the U.S. NdFeB magnet supply chain gap.

"These OSC conditional commitments build on the swift and decisive actions taken by the Trump Administration to secure a domestic supply chain for the magnets used in chip manufacturing, drones, electric vehicles, fighter jets, industrial motors, nuclear submarines, and satellites," said the Honorable Emil Michael, Under Secretary of War for Research and Engineering. "Following the Department of War's agreement earlier this year with MP Materials, these conditional loan commitments with Vulcan and ReElement present a forward-leaning approach to further strengthen America's magnet production."

The funding for OSC's conditional loans comes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in July 2025. The Act provides up to $100 billion in total OSC lending authority specifically for critical minerals production and related industries and projects. The Department of War will also receive warrants from Vulcan and ReElement as part of the joint commitment. Additionally, the Department of Commerce's Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Program Office signed a preliminary non-binding letter of intent to provide $50 million in proposed federal incentives under the CHIPS and Science Act for the purchase of equipment in parallel with OSC's financing. The CHIPS incentives will provide further investment stability to strengthen domestic critical minerals production. The Department of Commerce will also receive $50 million of equity in Vulcan Elements.

The conditional loan commitments between OSC and the respective companies specify additional steps both companies must take to proceed toward financial close on the loan, to include fulfilling financial, legal, technical, and other due diligence requirements. No OSC funds are disbursed until all parties have completed or met the conditions for disbursement as specified in the loan commitment. The time between conditional commitment and financial close varies by project to ensure full due diligence and ultimately protect the American taxpayer.

"These commitments demonstrate that OSC's federal financing tools can successfully scale private capital investment in sectors vital to our economic and national security," said Mr. Ryan Lindner, Chief Investment Officer, OSC. "I am immensely grateful to Under Secretary Michael, Deputy Secretary Feinberg, and Secretary Hegseth for their support in executing these commitments, which are part of the Trump Administration's whole-of-government effort to secure domestic critical minerals production, revitalize the U.S. industrial base, and ultimately achieve peace through strength."

[TITLE]The DoD is getting in on the critical mineral game:
[TEXT]
The US Department of Defense is asserting its desire to be an integral part of the American rare earths and critical minerals supply chain with a deal to establish a domestic pipeline of gallium and scandium production.

The DoD on Thursday announced it had awarded Texas-based ElementUSA $29.9 million to go toward developing a demonstration facility in Louisiana to separate and purify gallium and scandium from industrial waste created by alumina production.

Gallium and scandium are used in defense applications including missile defense platforms, sensors, fighter aircraft, and hypersonic weapons, according to ElementUSA. Gallium, itself not considered a rare earth element but still a critical mineral, is commonly found in integrated circuits, semiconductors, and transistors. Scandium, a designated rare earth metal, is most often used to make aluminum alloys that are stronger and lighter weight than pure aluminum, and as a research chemical.

As is the case with most rare earth metals and critical minerals, China is the leading producer of both gallium and scandium, and has moved to restrict exports both prior to and in response to the Trump administration's tariff war.

Scandium and gallium are refined in North America to a limited extent, but nowhere near enough to meet the defense industry's needs. The DoD has sought to buy scandium from Canadian mining outfit Rio Tinto, the only producer of refined scandium on the continent, and few US firms have been working to produce gallium despite the US having ready natural supplies of the mineral.

ElementUSA appears to still be working on its own refinement method of extracting gallium and scandium from alumina processing waste, as both the DoD's and the company's announcement refer to the Louisiana demonstration facility in the future tense. ElementUSA, likewise, describes itself elsewhere as still being in the research, development, and scaling phases. No timeline was provided in either statement as to when ElementUSA's gallium and scandium production might begin.

"This award enables ElementUSA to scale innovative technologies that extract gallium and scandium, among other critical minerals and rare earths, from secondary domestic resources," ElementUSA chief investment officer Dan Byrne said.

It's refreshing to know that, once ElementUSA gets its production scheme in order, it won't require additional mining for resources to begin facilitating a domestic supply, and will even be consuming waste material to do so. Nonetheless, mineral refinement isn't typically a clean process, and it's not clear how much gallium and scandium ElementUSA expects to be able to produce once it's up and running at scale.

We reached out to the DoD and ElementUSA with questions, but didn't hear back from either. ®

With markets entering a phase of heightened volatility and asset classes behaving unpredictably, Vivek Sharma , Senior Fund Manager – Equity at PGIM India Asset Management, believes the time is ripe for disciplined multi-asset investing In this interview, Sharma explains how the PGIM India Multi-Asset Allocation Fund, the NFO of which is open till November 25, seeks to balance upside participation with downside protection — and why quality and growth remain his enduring mantra for equity exposure.Edited excerpts from a chat:A true-to-label multi-asset fund needs to have a) multiple asset classes, b) which are uncorrelated or have low correlation and c) with reasonable representation of each of them. If we combine these traits, a multi-asset fund may provide downside protection in the shorter term, and in the medium and longer term one should get the inherent combined return potential of each asset class. PGIM Multi Asset Fund aims to do this by having, on an average 50% directional equity, 25% fixed income and up to 25% precious metals (both gold and silver). While fixed income is expected to provide stability, precious metals are expected to offset the volatility of equities (and vice versa) due to their low/uncorrelated relationship. Hence, in the long term you may participate in the upside while limiting the negative in drawdown years to some extent.multi-asset approach. How dynamic will the allocation be between equity, debt, and commodities like gold and silver, given current volatility levels?We have an equity allocation range of minimum of 30% and maximum of 70%. This can be a combination of directional equities and arbitrage allocation. Debt allocation is minimum 10% and maximum 35% while precious metals will be between 10-25%. Within the asset class ranges, we will be mindful of pricing, growth, and valuations (wherever applicable). While internal algorithms guide us long only equity allocation, gold/silver allocation etc. which we will take into account, however, we will be mindful of macros and micros as well. We don’t intend to keep it absolutely static, and we will make changes (but not very frequently) based on valuations, global scenarios, our view as well as various indicators available to us. In asset allocation, we don’t necessarily time the market but follow a disciplined approach to invest in various asset classes.equity market outlook in 2025? Are valuations still supportive for long-term wealth creation, or are we moving toward moderation?We saw a runaway rally in markets post Covid between FY20-24. This led to certain excesses and creation of micro bubbles in some pockets of the market. We believe for the next block of FY24-FY28, returns will be moderate in comparison to the previous block as we may have borrowed returns from the future. However, we have already seen a time correction for 4-5 quarters and hence we are at a good stage as of now. Going forward, we believe we are likely to see polarised performance from markets, wherein fast-growing companies with respect for capital should be return leaders while narrative based or low growth segments of the markets are likely to be laggards. Further, we are likely to have a volatile external environment, and the domestic economy is likely to provide support especially on the back of various policy initiatives such as Income tax cut, GST cut and possible benefits from interest rate cuts.The role of precious metals in any portfolio is two-pronged. 1) To provide negative/low correlation to equities and to provide downside protection and 2) To gain from the inherent inflation in the prices of these commodities. Their utility is to provide low or negative correlation to equities. However, gold and silver play that differentially. While both are precious metals, gold is considered more as a hedge to equities, inflation and is the asset of choice during global uncertainties and alternative to US$ investments. Silver on the other hand is more of an industrially demanded commodity, having demand drivers in place on account of its application in fast growing areas such as electric vehicles, renewable energy and semiconductors.It’s difficult to take a sharp call on commodities. We have to remember that commodities do not have traditional income statements, EPS cashflows etc. Hence, they do not follow a valuation methodology. It is demand/supply and global trading that determines their pricing (and in some sense value). While we will look at various indicators such as gold silver ratio and demand and supply numbers for the commodities, idea is not to absolutely time it and maintain a balance towards allocation of gold and silver.Growth and quality are the bedrock of our investing framework. This philosophy has withstood the test of time with respect to long term investing. It is fundamental and intuitive. With respect to stock selection, our focus will be to have lower volatility and hence focus will be on the large and midcap categories with minor allocation to small caps. Within sectors, focus will be on growing companies and at this point of time we would be more inward looking rather than investing more in companies which are globally/outward oriented. With a larger domestic focus: Consumer discretionary, financials, domestic healthcare and telecom would be preferred sectors while lesser focus will be on IT, base commodities, utilities and energy.While multi-asset funds have outperformed equity in the last 1 year or so, that is not the business-as-usual scenario. In the long-term, pure equity funds may outperform a multi asset category however with a higher volatility/standard deviation. The idea of multi asset funds is not maximising absolute returns but having better risk-adjusted returns. So with a multi asset fund you get close to equity like returns but with a much lower risk profile. That is the utility of a multi-asset fund.

[TITLE]Malaysia's Palm Oil Estates Are Turning Into Data Centers:
[TEXT]
An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg:The $8.9 billion palm oil producer, SD Guthrie, is the world's largest palm oil planter by acreage, with more than 340,000 hectares in Malaysia. "SD Guthrie is pivoting to solar farms and industrial parks, betting that tech giants hungry for server space will prefer sites with ready access to renewable energy," reports Bloomberg. "The company has reserved 10,000 hectares for such projects over the next decade, starting with clearing old rubber estates and low-yielding palm plots in areas near data center and semiconductor investment hubs.""The company's calculation is based on this: one megawatt of solar requires about 1.5 hectares. Helmy said SD Guthrie wants one gigawatt in operation within three years, enough to power up to 10 hyperscale data centers used for AI computing. The new business is expected to make up about a third of its profits by the end of the decade."

[TITLE]FCC rolls back cybersecurity rules for telcos, despite state-hacking risks:
[TEXT]
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has rolled back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures following the massive hack from the Chinese threat group known as Salt Typhoon.

The ruling came in January 2025 and took effect immediately under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), in response to Salt Typhoon's breaching multiple carriers to spy on private communications.

Along with Section 105 of the CALEA, the declaratory ruling included a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for telecom companies to:

Create and implement cybersecurity risk-management plans

Submit annual FCC certifications proving they were doing so

Treat general network cybersecurity as a legal obligation

Following lobbying from telecommunication firms - according to a letter from Senator Maria Cantwell, that found the new framework too cumbersome and taxing for their operations, the FCC has now deemed the prior rule inflexible, retracting it.

“The Federal Communications Commission today took action to correct course and rescind an unlawful and ineffective prior Declaratory Ruling misconstruing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA),” reads the FCC announcement.

“The Order also withdraws an NPRM that accompanied that Declaratory Ruling, which was based in part on the Declaratory Ruling’s flawed legal analysis and proposed ineffective cybersecurity requirements.”

The FCC, which is now under new leadership, noted that communications service providers have taken important steps to strengthen their cybersecurity posture following the Salt Typhoon incidents, and have agreed to continue along this path in a coordinated manner, reducing risks to national security.

Disclosed in October 2024, the Salt Typhoon attacks were linked to a Chinese espionage campaign that impacted several companies, including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen Technologies [1], T-Mobile [2], Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications [3], and Windstream [4].

The hackers accessed core systems that U.S. federal government used for court-authorized network wiretapping requests, and potentially intercepted extremely sensitive information, up to the level of government officials.

FCC's plan met with criticism

Given that the risk for similar hacker operations remains unchanged, the FCC’s latest decision was met with criticism.

Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, the only one voting against the current decision, expressed frustration about the reliance on telecom providers for self-evaluating their cybersecurity stance and the effectiveness of the protective measures.

“Its [FCCs] proposed rollback is not a cybersecurity strategy,” stated Gomez. “It is a hope and a dream that will leave Americans less protected than they were the day the Salt Typhoon breach was discovered.”

“Salt Typhoon was not a one-off event but part of a broader campaign by state-sponsored actors to infiltrate telecommunications networks over long periods of time,” Gomez warned in her statement.

“Federal officials have stated publicly that similar reconnaissance and exploitation attempts are ongoing today, and that telecommunications networks remain high-value targets for foreign adversaries,” the official said.

Senators Maria Cantwell and Gary Peters have also sent letters to the FCC before the vote to urge the agency to maintain the cybersecurity safeguards.

BleepingComputer has emailed the FCC for a statement and will update the article when we get a reply.

[TITLE]Deal restores Cornell's federal grants, reviving research on infant artificial heart:
[TEXT]
Deal restores Cornell's federal grants, reviving research on infant artificial heart

After a deal with the White House, researchers at Cornell will receive their federal grants. For one scientist, that means resuming work on an implantable artificial heart for babies and toddlers.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We have an update this morning on the story of a researcher at Cornell University who is developing an artificial heart for babies and toddlers.

JAMES ANTAKI: It's about the size of a AA battery, and it's so close to being used to save lives and children.

INSKEEP: James Antaki was among the researchers who had their federal grants canceled by the Trump administration as it tried to impose its power on universities.

ANTAKI: We feel like collateral damage.

INSKEEP: And then, Cornell became the third elite college to make a deal with the administration over claims of antisemitism and accusations that diversity programs are racial discrimination. NPR's Elissa Nadworny brings us up to date.

ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: I spoke to James Antaki a few days after he got the email officially restarting decades of work on the PediaFlow - an implantable artificial heart.

ANTAKI: I think the overwhelming reaction was this relief and maybe disbelief.

NADWORNY: Antaki's grant was among about $250 million in federal grants restored after Cornell made a deal with the White House, formally accepting the administration's interpretation of civil rights laws. Part of the deal requires the Ivy League school to pay the government $30 million and also invest $30 million in agriculture over the next three years. Now the rebuilding has to begin, which Antaki says is daunting.

ANTAKI: Every time I feel sorry for myself, I have to catch myself and say, This is not about me. It's so much bigger than me.

NADWORNY: About 1 in 100 babies in the U.S. are born with congenital heart defects. Antaki's device would help young kids with the most serious conditions, like Caleb, the 4-year-old boy and his mom, Nora Strickland, that we met in our original story. I called them to share the news.

Dr. Antaki's grant was unfrozen.

NORA STRICKLAND: Oh, my God. Are you serious? Wow. I just got goosebumps.

NADWORNY: This renews her hope for families like hers. Caleb is on an artificial heart called a VAD, awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Caleb's VAD hangs outside his skinny little body, and it has to be plugged into the wall, meaning he and his family can't go home.

How is Caleb doing in general?

STRICKLAND: He's good. He's doing really well. Doesn't let the VAD keep him from being him.

NADWORNY: She sends me a video of Caleb building a volcano with Magna Tiles.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CALEB STRICKLAND: We're going to have another mini volcano. Record the eruption.

STRICKLAND: Alright.

(SOUNDBITE OF MAGNA TILES COLLAPSING)

STRICKLAND: Whoa.

NADWORNY: He knocks the creation over. Later, Nora tells Caleb the news of Antaki's grant.

STRICKLAND: How does that make you feel that you changed the course of medical history?

CALEB: Good.

STRICKLAND: Yeah?

CALEB: So did I change, like, the wall or something?

STRICKLAND: You did, Bubby (ph). Because one day, kids aren't going to have to stay in the hospital when they have a VAD. One day, they're going to have a VAD that they can go home on.

CALEB: Now can we play video games?

STRICKLAND: (Laughter) Yeah. I'm just really proud of you.

NADWORNY: Back in Ithaca, New York, Dr. Antaki has a long road ahead. He has to rehire a team, line up a manufacturer for the prototype, and then prepare to test the pump in animals.
