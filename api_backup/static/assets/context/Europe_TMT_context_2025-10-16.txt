[TITLE]Fintradix Partners with Top Fintech Institutions in Japan to Advance AI-Driven Finance:
[TEXT]
Tokyo, Japan, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fintradix today announced a landmark partnership with several of Japan’s most prominent fintech institutions, reinforcing its leadership position in AI-driven financial innovation and data intelligence. This collaboration represents a strategic step in Fintradix’s broader mission to accelerate the global adoption of AI-powered trading and to strengthen its long-term presence in Asia’s most technologically advanced financial markets.

For years, Fintradix has been at the forefront of digital finance transformation, leveraging advanced artificial intelligence and algorithmic learning models to empower traders and institutions worldwide. Now, with Japan’s rapidly growing fintech ecosystem and highly regulated environment, Fintradix is poised to integrate its global expertise with local market knowledge—creating a powerful alliance that will reshape how Japanese investors engage with financial data and trading automation.

Driving Innovation Through Collaboration

This new partnership brings together Fintradix’s cutting-edge AI systems with the research capabilities and institutional experience of Japan’s top financial technology firms. The alliance will focus on three key areas:

AI and Data Research – Collaborative teams from Fintradix and Japanese fintech labs will develop adaptive models capable of identifying micro market trends, forecasting price movements, and executing trades in milliseconds—all within Japan’s strict financial compliance framework. Technology Integration – The initiative aims to integrate Fintradix’s proprietary AI solutions into trading systems used by Japanese brokers, asset management firms, and retail platforms, helping investors gain real-time insight, improved liquidity access, and enhanced transparency. Education and Market Literacy – Recognizing Japan’s appetite for responsible innovation, Fintradix will launch educational programs, seminars, and investor learning hubs focused on understanding the role of AI in portfolio management and ethical data use in finance.

According to company executives, this partnership is more than a business expansion—it’s a commitment to technological collaboration that benefits investors, institutions, and the broader Japanese financial ecosystem.

“Japan has always been a leader in technological excellence,” said a spokesperson from Fintradix. “By aligning with Japan’s top fintech institutions, we are creating a unified platform where innovation meets regulation. Our goal is to ensure that AI serves investors in a transparent, compliant, and effective way.”

A Vision for AI-Powered Finance in Japan

Fintradix’s expansion into Japan is built upon a long-term vision of data-driven finance. The company’s global AI infrastructure—originally developed to serve multi-asset traders in Europe and North America—has been re-engineered to accommodate the specific needs of the Japanese market.

The integration will allow local investors to benefit from Fintradix’s advanced analytics capabilities, including its predictive trading engine, automated risk-balancing system, and real-time asset monitoring tools. These systems use vast datasets to identify profitable opportunities across forex, crypto, commodities, and equities, while adhering to Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) regulations.

“The Japanese investor is highly analytical and values precision, stability, and reliability,” the spokesperson added. “Our systems have been tailored to deliver exactly that—AI tools that combine speed with transparency, helping users make smarter decisions and reduce exposure to risk.”

The company also revealed plans to open a Fintradix Innovation Hub in Tokyo, which will serve as the central hub for AI development, data processing, and institutional partnerships across Asia. This hub will facilitate cross-border data exchange between Japan and other Fintradix research centers in Frankfurt and Singapore.

Strengthening Japan’s Position in Global Fintech

This partnership not only benefits Fintradix and its clients but also enhances Japan’s role as a global leader in fintech innovation. By combining Japanese precision with Fintradix’s AI intelligence, the initiative seeks to create a sustainable model for future-ready finance.

A joint statement from the Japanese fintech partners emphasized the importance of the collaboration:

“Working alongside Fintradix gives us the ability to merge our financial expertise with advanced AI-driven systems,” said one of the institutional partners. “It’s an opportunity to redefine how financial data is analyzed and how investors interact with digital assets in Japan.”

With AI technology rapidly transforming how global markets operate, Fintradix is ensuring that Japan remains at the forefront of this transformation. The company’s systems will not only enhance institutional efficiency but also democratize access to intelligent trading tools for retail investors—bridging the gap between technology and opportunity.

Commitment to Ethical AI and Compliance

One of the defining aspects of the partnership is Fintradix’s continued emphasis on compliance and responsible AI use. All collaborative projects will adhere strictly to Japan’s data protection and financial regulations, ensuring that algorithms remain transparent, auditable, and aligned with investor protection standards.

Fintradix has already appointed a team of compliance officers in Japan to oversee the implementation of its AI solutions. These measures reinforce the company’s global philosophy—AI must always serve the investor’s interest, not replace it.

“We see AI as an enhancer of human expertise, not a substitute,” stated the spokesperson. “Our systems are designed to empower analysts, advisors, and traders to make data-informed decisions with full accountability.”

[TITLE]BlackRock's CEO Says Crypto Will Grow 'Rapidly' — Here's How:
[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) reported strong third-quarter results on Tuesday, with CEO Larry Fink saying the cryptocurrency market will grow "rapidly" as the firm builds proprietary tokenization technology to move traditional assets on-chain.

Strong Quarter With Record ETF Inflows

BlackRock reported diluted EPS of $8.43, or $11.55 on an adjusted basis, with assets under management climbing to $13.5 trillion, up 17% year-over-year.

Net inflows reached $205 billion, supported by record demand for iShares ETFs, private market products, and digital asset exposure.

Revenue increased 25% to $6.5 billion, while GAAP earnings declined 23% due to acquisition-related costs.

The company cited broad-based growth across ETF, active management, and alternatives platforms, along with rising technology service income from its Aladdin platform and the integration of Preqin and Global Infrastructure Partners.

Fink Highlights Digital Asset Expansion

In his remarks, CEO Larry Fink emphasized the company's growing focus on blockchain and tokenization.

“I do believe we have some exciting announcements in the coming years on how we could play a larger role on this whole idea of the tokenization and digitization of our assets,” Fink said.

He called for faster U.S. regulatory clarity to support innovation in digital assets and outlined BlackRock's plan to build in-house systems for tokenizing traditional securities.

That would bring traditional financial assets — such as equities, bonds, and alternatives — directly onto blockchain networks.

The initiative aims to enhance transparency, liquidity, and efficiency while reducing settlement costs.

"We are investing ahead of client needs," Fink said, describing tokenization as an operational priority rather than a distant concept.

For the $13.4 trillion manager, internal development could position BlackRock at the center of global asset migration to blockchain-based systems.

Strategic Impact on Wall Street

Fink's comments mark a broader endorsement of blockchain technology as part of mainstream finance.

His statement that the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and cryptocurrency market will expand rapidly signals a shift from cautious optimism to active institutional engagement.

The move to develop tokenization infrastructure could reshape how capital markets operate.

Industry analysts expect the technology to shorten settlement cycles, cut operational costs, and increase accessibility to previously restricted investment classes.

[TITLE]'Bitcoin Mayor' Eric Adams Establishes NYC Digital Assets and Blockchain Office:
[TEXT]
In brief New York City Mayor Eric Adams signed an executive order to establish the Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology.

Moises Rendon, who has served in the NYC Office of Innovation and Technology since 2024, will lead the new office.

Adams will leave office in January, after ending his reelection campaign in late September.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams established the Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology on Tuesday, adding to his pro-crypto record as he rounds out his term in office.

The crypto-centric office will operate within the office of the mayor and be led by a director appointed by Mayor Adams, who will ultimately report to the city’s chief technology officer.

“Our first-in-the-nation Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain will help make us the global capital of digital assets,” Adams posted on X. “This new mayoral office is going to help us stay ahead of the curve, grow our economy, and attract world-class talent.”

Our first-in-the-nation Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain will help make us the GLOBAL capital of digital assets. This new mayoral office is going to help us stay ahead of the curve, grow our economy, AND attract world-class talent:https://t.co/Vdw2UFufqx — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) October 14, 2025

Effective immediately via the signing of mayoral executive order #57, the office is designed to support the growth of digital assets and blockchain within New York City while encouraging investment in the city by the crypto industry.

“While we’ve been planning to launch this office for months, we wanted to make sure we got this right and interviewed extensively to fill the role of executive director prior to this announcement,” press secretary Kayla Mamelak Altus told Decrypt.

“Once we found a candidate who could execute our vision for this office, we went through our review process and made the announcement at the appropriate time,” she added.

﻿

To lead the office, Mayor Adams selected former digital assets and blockchain policy advisor, Moises Rendon. Rendon has been serving in the New York City Office of Innovation and Technology since 2024.

Under his leadership, the office will first create a commission of digital asset leaders to help guide the office's work.

“Mayor Adams’ creation of this new office proves that the future is now for digital assets and blockchain in New York City,” Rendon said in a statement. “I am honored to lead the nation’s first municipal office dedicated to successfully and responsibly deploying these technologies."

The Digital Assets Office creation follows Adams’ launch of a digital assets advisory in May, similarly designed to bring investment and talent from crypto companies to New York City as the mayor sought to make the city the “Crypto Capital of the World.”

At the time, he indicated that the city was exploring using blockchain technology for birth and death records, among other things.

Adams famously accepted his first few paychecks for his mayoral duties in Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2022, earning him the moniker of “Bitcoin Mayor” in the process. Since then, both assets have risen substantially in price, leading to Adams poking skeptics with quips like, "Who’s laughing now?"

In May, Adams called for the end to New York’s BitLicense, a regulatory license famed for its strict compliance regulations.

Mayor Adams will leave office on January 1 as he is no longer seeking reelection, having dropped out of the race in late September.

Predictors on Myriad currently give Zohran Mamdani around an 88% chance of winning the November election and assuming the office in January. That matches the odds of Polymarket’s NYC Mayoral Election market, which gives Andrew Cuomo the next-best chance of winning at around 10%.

[TITLE]US, China roll out port fees, threatening more trade turmoil:
[TEXT]
Analysts have warned the tit-for-tat trade fees risk ‘distorting global freight flows’ for goods ranging from petrol to toys.

The United States and China have started charging additional port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil, making the high seas a key front in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

A return to an all-out trade war appeared imminent last week, after China announced a major expansion of its rare earths export controls, and US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to triple digits.

But after the weekend, both sides sought to reassure traders and investors, highlighting cooperation between their negotiating teams and the possibility they could find a way forward.

China said it had started to collect the special charges on US-owned, operated, built or flagged vessels, but it clarified that Chinese-built ships would be exempted from the levies.

In details published by state broadcaster CCTV, China spelled out specific provisions on exemptions, which also include empty ships entering Chinese shipyards for repair.

Similar to the US plan, the new China-imposed fees would be collected at the first port of entry on a single voyage or for the first five voyages within a year.

“This tit-for-tat symmetry locks both economies into a spiral of maritime taxation that risks distorting global freight flows,” Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers said in a research note.

Early this year, the Trump administration announced plans to levy the fees on China-linked ships to loosen the country’s grip on the global maritime industry and bolster US shipbuilding.

An investigation during the administration of former US President Joe Biden concluded that China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the global maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors, clearing the way for those penalties.

China hit back last week, saying it would impose its own port fees on US-linked vessels from the same day the US fees took effect.

“We are in the hectic stage of the disruption, where everyone is quietly trying to improvise workarounds, with varying degrees of success,” said independent dry bulk shipping analyst Ed Finley-Richardson. He said he has heard reports of US shipowners with non-Chinese vessels trying to sell their cargoes to other countries while en route, so the vessels can divert.

The Reuters news agency was not immediately able to confirm this.

Tit-for-tat moves

Analysts expect China-owned container carrier COSCO to be the most affected by the US fees, shouldering nearly half of that segment’s expected $3.2bn cost from the fees in 2026.

Major container lines, including Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and CMA CGM, slashed their exposure by switching China-linked ships out of their US shipping lanes. Trade officials there reduced fees from initially proposed levels, and exempted a broad swath of vessels after heavy pushback from the agriculture, energy and US shipping industries.

The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday said, “If the US chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end; if it chooses dialogue, China’s door remains open.”

In a related move, Beijing also imposed sanctions on Tuesday against five US-linked subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, which it said had “assisted and supported” a US probe into Chinese trade practices.

Hanwha, one of the world’s largest shipbuilders, owns Philly Shipyard in the US and has won contracts to repair and overhaul US Navy ships. Its entities will also build a US-flagged LNG carrier.

Hanwha said it is aware of the announcement and is closely monitoring the potential business impact. Hanwha Ocean’s shares sank by nearly 6 percent.

China also launched an investigation into how the US probe affected its shipping and shipbuilding industries.

A Shanghai-based trade consultant said the new fees may not cause significant upheaval.

“What are we going to do? Stop shipping? Trade is already pretty disrupted with the US, but companies are finding a way,” the consultant told Reuters, requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with the media.

The US announced last Friday a carve-out for long-term charterers of China-operated vessels carrying US ethane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), deferring the port fees for them through December 10.

Meanwhile, ship-tracking company Vortexa identified 45 LPG-carrying VLGCs — an acronym for very large gas carriers, a type of vessel — that would be subject to China’s port fee. That amounts to 11 percent of the total fleet.

Clarksons Research said in a report that China’s new port fees could affect oil tankers accounting for 15 percent of global capacity.

Meanwhile, Omar Nokta, an analyst at the financial firm Jefferies, estimated that 13 percent of crude tankers and 11 percent of container ships in the global fleet would be affected.

Trade war embroils environmental policy

In a reprisal against China curbing exports of critical minerals, Trump on Friday threatened to slap additional 100 percent tariffs on goods from China and put new export controls on “any and all critical software” by November 1.

Administration officials, hours later, warned that countries voting this week in favour of a plan by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from ocean shipping could face sanctions, port bans, or punitive vessel charges.

China has publicly supported the IMO plan.

“The weaponisation of both trade and environmental policy signals that shipping has moved from being a neutral conduit of global commerce to a direct instrument of statecraft,” Athens-based Xclusiv said.

Company spun off from Phillips Semiconductors two decades ago

The Dutch government took effective control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia in what it said was a “highly exceptional” move over worries that corporate governance shortcomings pose a potential risk to European economic security.

The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it had invoked the rarely used Goods Availability Act to intervene in the business of Nexperia, which makes semiconductors used in the automotive and consumer technology industries.

Nexperia is based in the Dutch city of Nijmegen but is owned by China’s Wingtech Technology.
