[TITLE]Jim Cramer Says Food Stocks Like Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) Could Benefit From A Merger:
[TEXT]
We recently published 13 Stocks That Jim Cramer Discussed. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.

Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) might have been able to withstand the losses that the broader food sector had faced had it not been for a disastrous 13% share price drop in August. The shares fell after the firm’s third quarter earnings report, which saw its third quarter adjusted EPS and midpoint fourth quarter EPS guide of $0.35 and $0.39 miss analyst estimates of $0.41 and $0.49. After the earnings report, Cramer explained that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was suffering as the disruption in the US beef industry had stripped the firm of its pricing power. This time, he discussed the firm in the context of the broader woes of the food sector as he wondered whether a merger might be a way out for Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) and help it to lower costs:

“But the answer is, you take out costs, but I think you have to begin the great merger of this sector. You have to begin the great merger of this sector. You have to start putting together big deals, take out big costs. . . .They have to just become, this should be like a big three. It’s over. You can’t grow. . .and maybe under this administration you could put together a Hormel, Pepsi, I don’t know what.”

While we acknowledge the potential of HRL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

[TITLE]SECURITIES CLASS ACTION NOTICE: Girard Sharp Law Firm Encourages Current and Former 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) Shareholders Who Received Neogen Corporation (NASDAQ:NEOG) Shares in Connection With Neogen Co:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Girard Sharp LLP, a national investment, securities, and consumer class action law firm, has filed a securities class action against Neogen Corporation (“Neogen”). According to the complaint, the class includes “all current and former 3M shareholders who received NEOG common stock in exchange for Garden SpinCo shares pursuant to the Merger Exchange (the “Class”)”.

Neogen is a Michigan corporation that, with its subsidiaries, “manufacture and market a diverse line of products and services dedicated to food and animal safety.” The Company’s Food Safety segment consists primarily of “diagnostic test products and complementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns.” The Company’s Animal Safety segment is engaged in the “development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, diagnostic products, rodenticides, cleaners, disinfectants, insecticides and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal safety market.”

The offering materials for the Merger (“Offering Materials”) stated that the combined Company expected to “have improved EBITDA margins and stronger free cash flow relative to Neogen on a standalone basis, allowing Neogen to deleverage following the [Merger]” and “generate run-rate revenue and cost synergies of $30 million within three years following the closing of the [Merger] due to efficiencies in product innovation, sales, marketing, distribution and production.”

On January 10, 2025, Neogen announced its preliminary 2Q25 financial results and reported a net loss of $456.3 million due to a non-cash goodwill impairment related to the 3M Food Safety Division acquisition. Moreover, Neogen reported that, as of November 30, 2024, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. On April 9, 2025, Neogen announced its 3Q25 financial results, reporting a net loss of $11 million and a drop in revenue of 3.4% to $221 million. The Company also reported that its capital expenditures were expected to be approximately $100 million as a result of “lowered Adjusted EBITDA” and a “pull-forward of integration capex into fiscal 2025.” It also reported the Company’s CEO, John Adent, would be stepping down.

Since September 1, 2022, the date upon which Neogen issued shares to former or current 3M investors, Neogen’s share price has declined by 75%. Girard Sharp’s investigation focuses on whether the Offering Materials may have included misrepresentations and omissions regarding Neogen’s and 3M’s financial conditions and the Merger.

[TITLE]VF Corp. to sell Dickies for $600M:
[TEXT]
Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Dive Brief:

VF Corp. has an agreement to sell its Dickies workwear brand to Bluestar Alliance for $600 million in cash, the apparel conglomerate announced on Monday.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the company said.

Dickies has struggled, though declines there moderated during the most recent quarter.

Dive Insight:

As its turnaround drags on, VF Corp. has been steadily unloading its less well-performing brands, and Dickies is the latest to drop.

The company held on to Dickies when it sold off nine workwear brands over four years ago, part of an effort to trim its brand portfolio that started with its 2018 spinoff of classic denim brands Wrangler and Lee. At the same time, in 2020, VF acquired cult label Supreme for an eye-popping $2.1 billion, but pulled the plug last year and sold it for much less. S&P Global Ratings analysts early in 2024 had predicted that the company would have to sell off more of its assets in order to trim its debt.

That makes Monday’s announcement predictable, according to a research note from Needham analysts led by Tom Nikic, who estimated that “the company is not losing much EBITDA, but is taking a healthy chunk out of the debt balance, improving the debt leverage by

[TITLE]Oxford Industries (OXM) Traded Lower Due to Tariff Challenges and Soft Consumer Spending:
[TEXT]
ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its “ClearBridge Small Cap Strategy” second-quarter 2025 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The small-cap stocks experienced volatility in the second quarter. The Russell 2000 Index rebounded 10% of its November 2024 record highs just 55 days after the "Liberation Day" decline. It was driven by growth, momentum, high-beta, and low-quality stocks. Even though small-cap stocks rose, they failed to outpace the larger-cap peers due to perceived sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks. The Russell 2000 returned 8.5% for the quarter compared to the 11.1% of the Russell 1000 Index. The strategy underperformed the benchmark in this backdrop. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2025.

In its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, ClearBridge Small Cap Strategy highlighted stocks such as Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM). Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM) is a leading apparel company. The one-month return of Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM) was 0.59%, and its shares lost 45.85% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 12, 2025, Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM) stock closed at $47.13 per share, with a market capitalization of $700.69 million.

ClearBridge Small Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:

"Stock selection within consumer discretionary sector reversed after a strong first-quarter performance, as several idiosyncratic headwinds weighed on holdings Murphy USA and Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM). Oxford Industries, an apparel company that includes brands such as Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, also stumbled due to increased tariff costs and softening consumer spending. However, while near-term tariff pressures and lower guidance have weighed on the stock, management’s focus on accelerating its supply chain away from China (with an expected full exit by 2026) and its focus on brand innovation and core customer engagement leave us optimistic
