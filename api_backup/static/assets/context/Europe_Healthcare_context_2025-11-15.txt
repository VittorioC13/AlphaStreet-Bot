[TEXT]
Q3 2025 net product revenue increased 223% year-over-year to $438 thousand

Gross profit/(loss) decreased from $24 thousand to $(100) thousand

WASHINGTON, Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: SXTP; SXTPW) (the “Company”), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing new medicines for vector-borne disease, reported today its financial results for the third fiscal quarter of the 2025 year, ended September 30, 2025.

Financial Highlights for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2025:

ARAKODA® pharmacy deliveries increased by 14% from 1,319 boxes (Q3 2024) to 1,505 boxes (Q3 2025).

The Company posted a gross loss of approximately $100 thousand in the third quarter of 2025, compared to an approximate gross profit of $24 thousand in the third quarter of 2024, due to a one-time inventory write-off associated with newly produced validation lots which will no longer be accepted by supply chain partners after the end of Q1 2026 due to limited remaining shelf-life.

– Potential NDA submission for schizophrenia indication targeted for Q2 2026 –

– European patent granted covering use of brilaroxazine for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis adds to existing patent protection in key global markets –

CUPERTINO, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reviva Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: RVPH) (“Reviva” or the “Company”), a late-stage pharmaceutical company developing therapies that seek to address unmet medical needs in the areas of central nervous system (CNS), inflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 and summarized recent business highlights.

“With the comprehensive clinical and non-clinical data package in hand, we believe brilaroxazine is strongly positioned to meet New Drug Application (NDA) filing requirements and advance toward potential registration for schizophrenia,” said Laxminarayan Bhat, Ph.D., Founder, President, and CEO of Reviva. “The consistent body of evidence for brilaroxazine, from early clinical studies through long-term extension studies, continues to demonstrate broad-spectrum, durable efficacy, a favorable safety profile, and strong long-term adherence with once-daily dosing. We are preparing for a pre-NDA meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the fourth quarter of the year and continue to target a potential NDA submission in the second quarter of 2026. We believe brilaroxazine’s differentiated clinical profile has the potential to redefine treatment expectations in schizophrenia and significantly improve patient outcomes worldwide.”

Clinical Program and Business Highlights

European Patent (EP3749324) granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) covering use of brilaroxazine for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), adding to Reviva’s existing patent protection in key markets around the world including the United States, China and Japan. Brilaroxazine previously received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of IPF in July 2024.

Announced a positive full dataset and successful completion of the Company’s Phase 3 RECOVER open-label extension (OLE) 1-year study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of brilaroxazine in patients with schizophrenia (N=446) in June 2025 and additional analyses in October 2025. A summary of the OLE results is provided here:

Once daily brilaroxazine (pooled 15, 30, and 50 mg, N=159) in patient population completed one year treatment, led to robust broad-spectrum efficacy that was sustained over 1-year including PANSS total score (–18.1), positive symptoms (–5.0), negative symptoms (–4.4), negative symptoms Marder factor (-4.4), general psychopathology (-8.7), personal & social performance (11.3) and CGI-S (-0.8, a ≥1 point improvement in 78% of patients) No clinically meaningful changes in movement disorder scales used for evaluating motor side effects such as akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Benign weight gain (~1.5 kg) compared to baseline over 52 weeks (1 year treatment). The weight gain is not dose-dependent and possibly related to lifestyle or diet Favorable and consistent improvement in lipid profile, and blood sugar levels were comparable to baseline over 52 weeks (1 year) across all 3 dose groups Not associated with hormonal imbalance and sexual side effects. Elevated prolactin levels reported at the beginning of the study were significantly reduced to normal or near normal in all three dose groups. Improvement in thyroid hormone levels and sexual function reported No incidence of clinically significant cardiac or gastrointestinal side effects. No incidence of drug induced liver injury (DILI) Generally well tolerated with a discontinuation rate of 35% after 1-year for pooled doses of brilaroxazine

Continuing efforts have aimed at expansion of strong diversified patent portfolio comprising composition of matter and lifecycle management strategies for innovative formulations and method of treatment for different major indications.

Completed public equity offering raising gross proceeds of $9.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.

Presented a poster presentation on negative symptom data for brilaroxazine from the Phase 3 RECOVER double-blind trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, and from the long-term open-label extension trial in clinically stable schizophrenia patients at the Central Nervous System (CNS) Summit in Boston, MA, November 2-5, 2025

[TITLE]“LEQEMBI®” (lecanemab) IV Maintenance Dosing for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease Approved in the United Kingdom:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that humanized anti- soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody “LEQEMBI®” (generic name: lecanemab) has been approved for once every four weeks intravenous (IV) maintenance dosing by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom.

In August 2024, LEQEMBI was approved for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in adult patients that are apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4)* heterozygotes or non-carriers in the United Kingdom. With this latest approval for IV maintenance dosing, after 18 months of a dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg once every two weeks patients may be transitioned to the maintenance dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg once every four weeks, or the regimen of 10 mg/kg once every two weeks may be continued.

AD is a progressive, relentless disease characterized by formation of protein deposits known as plaques made of amyloid-beta aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles made of tau protein in the brains of people living with AD. It is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process that begins before amyloid plaque accumulation and continues after plaque removal.1,2 The data show that amyloid-beta protofibrils and tau tangles play roles in the neurodegeneration process,2,3 and only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both amyloid plaque and protofibrils**, which can impact tau downstream. Due to the reaccumulation of AD biomarkers and return to placebo rate of decline after therapy is stopped,3-5 continuing maintenance treatment after the initial 18-month therapy is essential to slow the progression of AD and extend the therapeutic benefits, helping patients maintain who they are for longer.

In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 982,000 people are living with dementia,6 and AD is the cause in 60-70% of people with dementia.7 These numbers are expected to rise, as the population ages.6,7

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

* Apolipoprotein E is a protein involved in the metabolism of lipid in humans. It is implicated in AD. People with only one (heterozygous) or no copy (non-carriers) of the ApoE ε4 gene are less likely to experience ARIA than people with two ApoE ε4 copies (homozygous).8

** Protofibrils are thought to be the most toxic Aβ species that contribute to brain damage in AD and play a major role in the cognitive decline of this progressive and devastating disease. Protofibrils can cause neuronal and synaptic damage in the brain, which can subsequently adversely affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms.3 The mechanism by which this occurs has been reported not only by increasing the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques, but also by directly damaging signaling between neurons and other cells. It is believed that reducing protofibrils may reduce neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, potentially slowing the progression of AD.4

[TITLE]Equillium Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Provides Operational Update:
[TEXT]
Closed financing of up to $50 million; initial tranche of $30 million provides runway through 2027

Hosted key opinion leader event highlighting the important role of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) in intestinal inflammation, the unmet medical need in ulcerative colitis, and the potential clinical utility of EQ504, a novel oral AhR modulator

EQ504 Phase 1 clinical study initiation planned for mid-2026

LA JOLLA, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equillium, Inc. (Nasdaq: EQ), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging a deep understanding of immunobiology to develop novel therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025. The Company has filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

“Our recent financing has enabled us to accelerate the development of our novel AhR modulator, EQ504, which we believe has potential to be a first-in-class, oral and colon-targeted therapeutic for ulcerative colitis (UC),” said Bruce Steel, chief executive officer at Equillium. “We are advancing rapidly through our preclinical work and expect to be ready to initiate the Phase 1 clinical study in mid-2026 with the potential to achieve proof-of-concept with the addition of UC patient cohorts following the SAD/MAD portion of the study.”

Recent Corporate & Clinical Highlights:

On August 11th 2025, the Company announced it entered into a private placement with leading healthcare investors providing up to $50 million in gross proceeds. The private placement was comprised of an initial upfront financing of approximately $30 million in gross proceeds, with the potential for up to an additional $20 million in gross proceeds at the initiation of clinical studies with EQ504 and the occurrence of the other milestones set forth in the purchase agreement for the private placement. The initial tranche of the financing is expected to fund Company operations through 2027. The financing was led by new investors ADAR1 Capital Management and Janus Henderson Investors, and included participation from additional new investors Adage Capital Partners LP, Coastlands Capital, and Woodline Partners LP.

On November 5th 2025, the Company hosted a virtual KOL investor event featuring Dr. Francisco Quintana (Harvard Medical School, Broad Institute) and Dr. Brian Feagan (Western University, Alimentiv). The session focused on the growing importance of AhR modulation as a next-generation therapeutic strategy for immune-mediated diseases and reviewed the potential of EQ504 in UC. Key highlights include:

AhR modulation is i) a differentiated and multi-modal approach to decreasing tissue inflammation while promoting tissue repair; and ii) clinically validated in skin and GI diseases, through VTAMA® and the botanical indigo naturalis, respectively.

EQ504 i) is a potent and selective AhR modulator that may be administered orally and is formulated to target the colon, representing a next-generation therapeutic to treat UC locally; and ii) has broad therapeutic potential in UC as a potential standalone oral therapy, or in combination with other therapeutic approaches.

A replay of the KOL event is available here.

Anticipated Upcoming Milestones:

EQ504 Phase 1 study is expected to initiate in mid-2026.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Revenue for the third quarter of 2025 was $0, compared with $12.2 million for the same period in 2024. Revenue in 2024 consisted entirely of itolizumab development funding and amortization of the upfront payment from Ono Pharmaceutical related to the Asset Purchase Agreement that was terminated in October 2024.

Research and development (R&D) expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were $1.3 million, compared with $9.6 million for the same period in 2024. The significant decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by lower clinical development expenses, lower CMC activities, and lower consulting expenses primarily related to the wind down of our EQUATOR study as well as lower employee compensation and benefits due to lower headcount caused by the wind down of our clinical studies.

General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were $3.3 million, unchanged from $3.3 million for the same period in 2024.

Net loss for the third quarter of 2025 was $4.2 million, or $(0.06) per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss of $7,000, or $(0.00) per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2024. The increase in net loss for the period was primarily due to lower revenue partially offset by lower operating expenses.

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $33.1 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $22.6 million as of December 31, 2024. Equillium believes that its cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 are capable of funding its currently planned operations through 2027, based on certain assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate.
