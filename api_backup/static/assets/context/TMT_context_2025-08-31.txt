[TITLE]Thoma Bravo to buy Verint in $2 billion deal as software acquisitions ramp up:
[TEXT]
Thoma Bravo will acquire Verint Systems in a $2 billion deal, including debt, the customer engagement platform said on Monday, marking the latest software buyout as private equity firms increasingly bet on AI to navigate an uncertain economy.

Software companies have emerged as prime acquisition targets as adoption of artificial intelligence and recurring revenue prove to be resilient markers in an economy pressured by tariffs and volatile customer spending.

Under the agreement, Verint shareholders will receive $20.50 per share in cash. The offer represents a premium of 4.2 per cent to the stock's closing price on June 30, before the talks were first reported, and implies an equity deal value of $1.23 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Shares of Verint — which provides an AI-powered platform to help enterprises organize, manage and improve customer interactions across various channels and digital operations — were down 1.2 per cent at $20.23.

The stock has lost 25 per cent of its value so far this year, pressured by strong competition and declining revenue in the past two quarters.

Still, some analysts expect Verint's focus on AI bots to result in higher demand as enterprise customers invest in automation and efficiency.

"We believe this was a strategic move for both entities as these organizations are closely aligned in terms of customer experience automation that leverages data and AI, with Thoma Bravo already heavily invested in this market," Wedbush analysts said in a note.

Thoma Bravo, which had about $184 billion in assets under management as of March 31, is among the largest software-focused investors globally. The private equity firm has acquired or invested in more than 530 software and technology companies.

Earlier this month, it had signed a $12 billion deal to acquire human resources software provider Dayforce.

The latest deal is expected to close before the end of Verint's current fiscal year.

At the company's annual general meeting (AGM), chairman Mukesh Ambani announced the launch of Reliance Intelligence, a new subsidiary that will anchor the conglomerate's AI ambitions.Reliance Intelligence will focus on four key goals:Ambani said the firm would construct gigawatt-scale, AI-ready data centres, powered by green energy, designed to support training and inference at scale.Reliance has already roped in key partners . It will work with Meta to deliver open-source AI models to Indian businesses. “It is a key step forward towards ensuring that everyone has access to AI, and eventually, superintelligence,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video message during the AGM.In addition, Reliance has teamed up with Google Cloud to launch a dedicated “cloud region” in Jamnagar, further strengthening its data infrastructure backbone.Ambani also unveiled Jio's new high-performance personal computers , designed to turn any TV or screen into a full-featured, AI-ready desktop. The move aims to take computing deeper into Indian homes, following the success of the JioPhone.Another key reveal was Riya, a voice-enabled, AI-powered search assistant integrated into JioStar, Reliance's entertainment platform.Ambani confirmed that Reliance Jio has crossed 500 million customers. The company is now targeting an IPO in the first half of 2026. Reports suggest the listing could raise as much as Rs 52,000 crore, potentially making it India's largest-ever public offering.India's race for self-reliance in semiconductors is heating up, and CG Power wants to be right in the middle of it. Semiconductors are the new steel , essential for the country's medium-term economic and technological security”, said Vellayan Subbiah, chairman of CG Power and Industrial Solutions, drawing a parallel with steel's role in India's early industrialisation under JRD Tata.The company, part of the Murugappa Group, has taken its first step into the semiconductor space by establishing a new outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) facility. Its goal is to reduce India's dependence on chip imports and plug a vital gap in the manufacturing value chain.Subbiah pointed to India's abundant engineering talent, but said the country still relies on imports for critical technologies. CG Power, he added, wants to bridge the gap.He stressed that true value lies in owning the chip's intellectual property (IP), especially in the fabless model, where companies focus on chip design and outsource production.On Thursday, CG Power launched a mini-OSAT unit capable of handling up to 500,000 daily units. A larger plant is underway and is expected to scale up to 14 million units daily by 2027.Microsoft is no longer just OpenAI's biggest backer. It's now a rival.The company's new in-house artificial intelligence models signal a fresh push into frontier AI, directly competing with Meta's LLaMA, Google's Gemini, and even OpenAI's own GPT-4 and GPT-5.Microsoft's AI team (MAI) has rolled out two new models:These models already power Microsoft's Copilot features, such as Copilot Daily and Copilot Labs. They're also designed to run across Microsoft products, including Windows, Office, and Teams, to improve user performance and experience.US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chairman Andrew Ferguson has accused Google's Gmail of filtering emails based on political biases. In a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Ferguson alleged that Gmail blocked emails from Republican senders but not from Democrats.Google denied the charge, saying Gmail's spam filters apply equally to all political parties and that filtering is not ideological.Ola Electric's stock has staged a surprise comeback. After months of drifting downward, the EV maker's shares have jumped over 10% this week , closing at Rs 54.02 on Friday, up from Rs 47 the previous week. That's despite a challenging year on the bourses, with the company's value down 37% year-to-date.Still, Ola is recovering from a weak April-June quarter, during which sales halved and the net loss widened by 23%. Market share also remains under pressure . Ather Energy has overtaken Ola to take second place, while TVS Motor leads the pack as of end-August.India is IBM's second-largest community of learners globally , behind only the US, Scott Crowder, vice president of IBM quantum adoption, told ET. The company is also aiming to promote skill development through government initiatives, he added."One of our beliefs is that a lot of economic development is going to come out of the application research algorithm development, like creating startups," he said, highlighting that this is the area where India lags."If you look at who else is making lots of money on AI (apart from those like Nvidia, which builds AI hardware), it's the people who are inventing the algorithms- doing the application research that's leading to companies."Crowder said India's approach to quantum computing has been measured, but more can be done regarding infrastructure. "On the hardware side, significant investment is essential. On the software side, there's scope to innovate intelligently without massive outlays," he said.

[TEXT]
TAIPEI, Taiwan, Aug. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corporation Limited (Nasdaq: APWC) (the “Company”), today announced that it has filed a Registration Statement on Form F-1 (the “Registration Statement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for a proposed rights offering to holders of its common shares.

The purpose of the rights offering is to raise equity capital in a cost-effective manner that gives all Company shareholders the opportunity to participate on a pro rata basis. If the rights offering is fully subscribed, the Company expects to receive gross proceeds of approximately $34.2 million. The net proceeds from the rights offering will be used primarily for investment in funding new production facilities aimed at taking advantage of the global supply chain re-alignment.

In the rights offering, the Company will distribute, at no charge to its shareholders, non-transferable subscription rights to purchase additional common shares of the Company. The subscription rights will be issued to holders of common shares on the to be determined record date, at a ratio of one subscription right per common share. Each subscription right entitles the holder to purchase one common share at the subscription price of $1.66 per common share, and we refer to this right as the basic subscription right. The basic subscription right entitles the holder to purchase whole shares only, and there is no right to purchase fractional shares.

The rights offering will include an over-subscription right, which will permit each rights holder, that exercises its subscription rights in full, the option to purchase additional common shares that remain unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights offering. The over-subscription right is subject to the availability and allocation of shares among holders exercising their over-subscription right, as further described in the rights offering documents.

The Company’s controlling shareholder, Pacific Electric Wire & Cable Co., Ltd. (“PEWC”), has informed the Company that it intends to participate in the rights offering by means of a cash investment of at least approximately $27.7 million. However, there is no guarantee or commitment that PEWC will ultimately decide to exercise any of its subscription rights.

Until the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, the rights offering will not commence and the securities covered therein may not be sold, and offers to buy may not be accepted. The record date, which will be announced when established, the subscription period and expiration date of the rights offering will be included in the Company’s final prospectus that provides detailed information

[TITLE]Another artificial intelligence deal collapses — as Colorado lawmakers’ budget fixes near finish line:
[TEXT]
Colorado’s first-in-the-nation regulations on artificial intelligence may have to wait longer if the legislature approves a proposal advanced by the state Senate on Monday.

In a dramatic shift from Sunday night, when a deal on revamped regulations appeared within reach, Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez gutted the bill. The measure, proposed during a mostly budget-focused special session, had been aimed at regulating AI and increasing transparency around its use to make decisions affecting Coloradans.

Instead, the bill as amended would simply delay, by several months, the implementation of a law passed 2024 that is supposed to go into effect next February.

Under Rodriguez’s proposal, which still needs to pass the state House, those regulations would take effect at the end of June — giving the tech industry, lawmakers, and public-interest and consumer-protection groups another chance during the next regular session to nail down how to regulate the growing, affluent industry. The regular session convenes in mid-January.

“Overnight, the tech industry decided that they were so unhappy with the compromise that had been achieved by consumer-protection organizations, educators, labor and business that they would rather return to the (existing rules),” said Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and driving figure on AI regulations in the state.

The legislature met for its latest special session chiefly to address a $783 million budget deficit brought on by tax cuts and spending changes made by the federal government in July. But the AI regulations, which drew the ire of an industry that argues they are unworkable, was also specifically designated for new consideration in Gov. Jared Polis’ recall of the legislature this month.

Most budget-related bills finished

By the end of the fifth day of the session on Monday, the Democratic majority had sent to Polis the bulk of the bills they hoped would bite into the deficit. The single biggest revenue-raising measure, however, still needed at least two more votes.

The bills that have passed the legislature are:

House Bill 1001, which makes permanent a limit on certain business income deductions for people making more than $500,000 per year.

House Bill 1002, which cracks down on the use of foreign tax havens and adds several countries to that label.

House Bill 1003, which ends a tax incentive for insurance companies that keep offices in the state.

House Bill 1005, which ends a state subsidy to businesses for collecting sales taxes.

In total, those measures are expected to raise about $150 million. The fifth measure, House Bill 1004, would allow certain entities to sell tax credits that can be reclaimed at a discount in future tax years. Lawmakers expect that to bring in another $100 million, for a total of just over $250 million.

"Right now, we need to ensure that the families and the small businesses that truly need our help are getting it," said Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Jefferson County Democrat.

The revenue-raisers amount to nearly a third of the total $783 million budget gap. Polis' staff is preparing to address as much as a third of the gap through spending cuts. His office is expected to reveal its planned reductions later this week, after the revenue part has been adopted.

The rest of the hole will be filled from the legislature's piggy bank. That'll happen last: Whatever's not raised or cut will be pulled from the state's reserves. The governor's office has suggested roughly $320 million, which would reduce the current reserve level -- about 15% of the general fund budget -- by 2 percentage points.

That would mean his office was planning to propose about $200 million in spending reductions.

Liability at issue on AI

On the AI front, Rodriguez’s bill was sent Monday over to the House, where members have already debated a competing AI measure -- one that had also been watered down to simply delaying the 2024 regulations, in that case until October 2026. The House planned to take up Rodriguez's bill in committee and potentially for an initial floor vote Monday night, which would make a final vote possible Tuesday.

How to assign liability for bias apparent in the use of AI to make decisions -- between entities that use AI for things like screening job and rental applications and the entities that developed the AI tools -- was a key part of Rodriguez's measure before its gutting.

But that has been a key sticking point between the dueling bills.

“A delay is the prudent thing to do,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat and sponsor of the House bill, said. “We need to figure out a way where school districts, hospitals and other deployers aren’t left holding the bag for these regulations. We need to ensure that all stakeholders involved in this legislation are held equally accountable when bad things happen.”
