[TEXT]
Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the UK’s largest retail investment platforms, has warned that bitcoin should not be treated as a core part of investment portfolios — even as it prepares to offer crypto products to clients for the first time.

In a statement published on its website, the Bristol-based firm said bitcoin, despite its long-term price gains, “is not an asset class” and lacks the intrinsic characteristics that would justify including it in a portfolio for growth or income.

The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.26 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.22%, as recorded on October 12.

[TITLE]Experts issue warning that beloved pantry staples may soon get pricier: 'There's real danger':
[TEXT]
Scotland's food and drink industry faces a growing, expensive threat that experts are calling "climateflation."

What's happening?

Simon McKeating, program manager at the Scotland Food and Drink Partnership, described in an article for The Scotsman how rising global temperatures and unstable weather are driving up grocery bills while putting some of Scotland's most iconic, heritage products — from scotch and seafood to summer strawberries — at risk.

Farmers are struggling with increasingly unpredictable conditions. Erratic rainfall, stronger storms, and warmer seas are disrupting agriculture and fisheries across Scotland.

[TITLE]World economy faces triple risk of tariffs, AI bubble and soaring debt:
[TEXT]
The world economy has so far withstood the biggest barrage of U.S. tariffs since the 1930s as American consumers continued to spend, companies absorbed higher costs and an artificial intelligence boom fueled a new breed of animal spirits.

But President Donald Trump’s latest threat to impose massive tariffs on Chinese products has stoked renewed fears of another shock for the global economy, compounding warnings of surging government debt and a bubble in technology stocks.

Those concerns will dominate this week’s gathering of finance ministers and central bankers, who are descending on Washington for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank’s annual meetings. The U.S.’ $20 billion lifeline to help shore up Argentina’s peso and proposals to deploy frozen Russian assets for Ukraine will also be high on the agenda of meetings on the sidelines.

[TITLE]US tariffs severely hit India's textile exporters; industry seeks moratorium, raw material reforms: CITI survey:
[TEXT]
India's textile and apparel exporters are facing severe disruptions following the United States' imposition of a 50 per cent additional tariff, according to a nationwide survey conducted by the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI). The survey revealed that the US, which accounts for India's 28 per cent of total textile and apparel shipments, has become significantly less accessible due to the steep tariff structure, eroding India's export competitiveness.

Nearly one-third of the respondents reported a turnover decline of more than 50 per cent following the tariff increase. The major contributing factors included requests for price discounts from US buyers (30 per cent), order cancellations or postponements (25 per cent), and a reduction in order volumes (20 per cent). Around 85 per cent of the firms reported inventory build-up due to declining orders, while two-thirds were compelled to offer discounts, mostly around 25 per cent, to retain business in the US market.

Liquidity pressures have intensified sharply, with 82 per cent of respondents citing extended credit cycles, and more than half reporting an increase of three to six months. Around 40 per cent noted that their working capital requirements had risen by over 30 per cent, reflecting severe cash flow challenges across the value chain. More than half of the respondents urged the government to announce a moratorium on repayment of existing loans, while 42 per cent recommended collateral-free loans to ease the financial burden.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

If you think your burger, burrito, or cold brew already costs too much, brace yourself — restaurant groups say they would have to raise prices by 30% just to stay profitable amid rising costs.

In a new survey from the restaurant management software company Toast, nearly half of restaurant operators said they plan to increase menu prices if inflation, tariffs, and labor costs continue to climb.

The National Restaurant Association estimates that to maintain a modest 5% profit margin, the average restaurant would need to raise prices by 30.3% — a move many owners fear would scare customers away.

That's bad news for diners, who're already facing increased costs for favorites including burgers, burritos, and coffee. Toast's menu price monitor, released in August, found orders of wings and pints of beer were the only tracked items that beat the nation's current 2.9% rate of inflation, increasing 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively.

Business Insider reported in September that grocery prices have sharply increased in recent months, reaching their highest level since August 2022, and inflation now exceeds the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

The price hikes are tied to President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff strategy, which a Yale economist told Business Insider in April is expected to cost the average consumer

[TITLE]Lezzat Launches Amazon Europe Expansion Services as US Amazon Sellers Seek Global Growth:
[TEXT]
Reading, UK, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lezzat, one of UK’s oldest Amazon full-service agencies, has announced the launch of its 2026 Amazon Europe Expansion services, a comprehensive program designed to help mature US Amazon sellers establish a strong presence across Europe’s rapidly expanding Amazon marketplaces. The program is strategically timed to align with Amazon’s continued investment in logistics, infrastructure, and marketplace development across the continent, including new rollouts in Ireland and expanded same-day delivery coverage across major European cities.

The new initiative provides a structured pathway for US Amazon sellers seeking to diversify their sales beyond the saturated US market. Europe’s e-commerce sector offers multiple developed yet underpenetrated markets with strong consumer trust and consistent online shopping demand. By addressing critical challenges such as VAT compliance, marketplace localization, and logistics coordination, Lezzat enables sellers to scale internationally with clarity and minimize the risks typically associated with cross-border selling.

“Less than one percent of US Amazon sellers are currently active in Europe, despite the region including Germany – Amazon’s second-largest global marketplace that’s constantly expanding,” said Alexandros Karagiannis, Director at Lezzat. “Our program bridges that gap by removing the barriers that often make international expansion seem unattainable. For ambitious brands, this is an extraordinary opportunity to capture growth in markets where competition remains thin.”

A Timely Expansion Opportunity

Lezzat’s 2026 Amazon Europe Expansion service provides sellers with the expertise, infrastructure, and on-the-ground support needed to navigate the full-scope of cross-border e-commerce. It covers every aspect of international Amazon growth, offering end-to-end support that allows sellers to focus on scaling their brand while the agency manages compliance and operational demands.

Key features of the 2026 Expansion Service include:

VAT Registration and Compliance: Managed through trusted partner networks to ensure full regulatory alignment.

Managed through trusted partner networks to ensure full regulatory alignment. Marketplace Onboarding: Support for Germany, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, and additional European regions as Amazon’s network expands.

Coordinated cross-border logistics, stock allocation, and cross-border fulfillment strategies to prevent delays and optimize cost efficiency. Review and Reputation Management: Continuous monitoring and response strategies to help sellers build trust and long-term credibility with European customers.

“Our goal is to make international growth attainable and sustainable,” added Karagiannis. “Many sellers underestimate how fragmented the European landscape can be. By centralizing all the moving parts – compliance, operations, and marketing – we’re helping them focus on what really matters: scaling their brand.”

Supporting Sellers from Strategy to Execution

Lezzat’s team brings together experienced Amazon sellers, strategists, and multilingual marketing professionals who understand the operational realities of scaling internationally. They work closely with clients to manage the complexities of cross-border e-commerce freeing them from operational bottlenecks and ensuring consistency in branding, compliance, and customer engagement across regions.

“Early expansion into Amazon Europe positions sellers for long-term competitive advantage,” added Karagiannis. “With Amazon continuing to grow its footprint, the sellers who act early will not only diversify and protect their businesses but will also secure positions of strength in markets that continue to grow year after year.”

The 2026 Amazon Europe expansion service is now available. US Amazon sellers seeking to enter the market or optimize their European operations, can learn more or request a complimentary audit assessing market readiness, please visit http://www.lezzat.co.uk/.

[TITLE]BNTO Launches AI Styling Agent and Secures $15 Million in Series A Funding:
[TEXT]
Having secured $15 million in series A funding earlier this year, BNTO, an AI-powered platform for renting, buying new, or secondhand, has debuted an AI styling agent.

The financing was led by Notable Capital, with participation from Basis Set Ventures, NEA and AI Fund. The 30-person start-up is based in New York and Los Angeles and plans to expand its warehouse footprint.

BNTO allows subscribers to select six styles to curate their own BNTO box starting at $98 each month. Inspired by the compartmentalized bento box for an individual meal, BNTO’s subscription bag is a cube-shaped, reusable, waterproof cloth bag. The aim is to avoid fast-fashion waste, conserve closet space, and reduce laundry, according to the company. With a monthly subscription, users have multiple outfit possibilities, and they can choose to purchase their favorite pieces for as much as 75 percent off.

Seventy-nine percent of Gen Z shoppers wait for products to go on sale, and only 21 percent regularly pay full price, according to a recent PwC survey. BNTO’s new AI styling agent, “Maya,” offers subscribers the option to purchase their favorite styles at dynamically priced discounts. Knowing many shoppers enjoy thrifting, and hauls (which can lead to returns), the platform is meant to offer affordability, and sustainability. From BNTO’s founder and chief executive officer Sixuan Li Pasinetti’s point of view, “The entire fashion tech stack has been built around selling, but today, there’s a massive mismatch between rigid supply and flexible demand.”

This year shoppers are expected to return $890 million worth of merchandise, accounting for 16.9 percent of retailers’ annual sales, according to a report compiled by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns, a UPS subsidiary.

Pasinetti disputed the prospect of the much talked about AI bubble, suggesting that it is “more of a boom.” She said, “The technology is still in its infancy, and while it carries both wonder and limitations, the industry is still learning how to apply it. Right now, in some cases, it’s like a hammer looking for its nails. At the end of the day, what matters is whether you’re using it to solve a real problem — and whether your business model allows you to generate proprietary data and insights in the process.”

Noting how accustomed consumers are renting, reselling and shopping, Pasinetti said the systems behind them, in terms of inventory, experience and data — are still siloed. Suggesting that legacy retailers are “effectively running de facto rental programs,” due to the return rates, she said, “We believe that by building a flexible supply system, the industry can unlock tens of billions in lost value, due to vicious discount cycles and returns.

Instead of using AI to recommend to consumers what to buy, BNTO advises whether a user should rent, buy new, or shop secondhand, and at what price point. It uses ALMA.AI, BNTO’s proprietary end-to-end fashion operating system. ALMA spans product lifecycle management, product information management, e-commerce infrastructure, and the warehouse management system. The personalized recommendations are based on a user’s mode of consumption whether that be renting or buying, as well as the location and weather, price elasticity and live inventory. The idea is that the system will present the most relevant products, at the right price, and through the most suitable access model.

Notable Capital’s managing partner Hans Tung said, “The potential of AI in retail isn’t just better product recommendation. BNTO is building two potentially transformative AI systems: the first is a consumer-facing AI that personalizes both what people wear and how they access it, meeting consumers where they are. The second is a supply chain AI that manages the operational complexity of rental, retail and resale at scale — a new consumer model called ‘omni-consumption.'”

[TITLE]Amazon to hire 250,000 workers during holiday season for third straight year:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) -Amazon said it plans to hire 250,000 workers for the holiday season across its fulfillment and transportation networks in the U.S., the same number as the last two years, as the e-commerce behemoth prepares for a surge in orders.

The announcement on Monday, however, comes amid concerns that U.S. shoppers will be cautious about spending in this holiday season as they brace from the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

Data firm Adobe Analytics last week projected U.S. holiday online sales to grow at a slower pace this year, but e-commerce are still expected to outshine overall sales growth.

Trump's latest tariffs on Chinese imports will have limited impact on holiday sales as most of the inventory is already in the country.

Amazon will hire full-time and part-time employees at $23 per hour with benefits, while seasonal workers will earn an average wage of over $19 per hour, it said.

The company had last month said it is investing more than $1 billion to raise pay and lower healthcare costs for U.S. fulfillment and transportation employees.

Retailers have issued mixed outlooks ahead of the holiday season, with Target and Best Buy maintaining their annual forecasts, and Walmart and Macy's raising theirs.
