[TITLE]Harrow Announces Closing of Acquisition of Melt Pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Harrow (Nasdaq: HROW), a leading provider of ophthalmic disease management solutions in North America, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Melt), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering non-opioid, non-IV therapies for sedation for medical procedures in the hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings. Melt’s product candidates, MELT-210, MELT-300, and MELT-400, are based on the proprietary Zydis® ODT (oral dissolving tablet) drug delivery platform. The closing of the Melt acquisition marks a strategic expansion of Harrow’s portfolio and reinforces its commitment to delivering innovative therapies that improve patient outcomes.

With global patent coverage and potential applications in ophthalmology, gastroenterology, dental care, and a wide range of outpatient procedures where sedation or anxiety management is needed, from diagnostic imaging to endoscopy procedures to pre-anesthesia, Melt’s drug candidates, including MELT-300, position Harrow to enter the multi-billion-dollar annual U.S. and global procedural sedation and anxiety market.

MELT-300 represents a transformative opportunity, building on more than a decade of real-world experience with MKO Melt® — a compounded sublingual sedation product sold by Harrow’s ImprimisRx subsidiary and currently administered by over 800 U.S. ophthalmic institutions, primarily for cataract surgery. As a potential FDA-approved successor, MELT-300 is a patented, sublingually delivered formulation of a fixed dose of midazolam (3mg) and ketamine (50mg) designed to provide rapid, predictable sedation without the need for intravenous administration. The MELT-300 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical programs previously demonstrated statistical superiority to midazolam alone. The innovative approach to sedation MELT-300 offers has the potential to transform patient experiences across a wide range of office-based and outpatient procedures, addressing the healthcare system’s growing demand to reduce exposure to opioids, including fentanyl.

“The development of MELT-300 marks a defining milestone for Harrow — our first product taken from ideation to the brink of commercialization. I still remember the first call we received

[TITLE]Salarius Pharmaceuticals Cites Errors on S&P CapIQ Platform Following Merger with Decoy Therapeutics, Affirms Its Shares Continue to Trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market Under the Symbol “SLRX”:
[TEXT]
HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SLRX) (Salarius or the Company) cites an error on the S&P CapIQ platform and reiterates that its common stock continues to trade uninterrupted on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the stock ticker “SLRX.”

S&P CapIQ inaccurately characterized the Salarius Pharmaceuticals and Decoy Therapeutics merger and inaccurately stated that the Company had been delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company is working to have this inaccurate information corrected. Similar inaccuracies that appeared on Yahoo Finance were corrected earlier this week.

On November 13, 2025, Salarius completed an underwritten public offering raising gross proceeds of $8 million and consummated the previously announced merger with Decoy Therapeutics (Decoy). As of the date of this release, the combined company had pro forma cash of approximately $14 million and approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock outstanding. The company is focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

[TITLE]Healthcare ETFs to Buy as Big Pharma Rapidly Integrates AI:
[TEXT]
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer confined to the tech sector; it is being aggressively integrated across all industries, from defense to food processing, with healthcare being no exception. Over the past couple of years, AI integration in the U.S. healthcare industry has increased manifold. According to an IDC report commissioned by Microsoft and released in March 2024, 79% of healthcare organizations were already utilizing AI technology.

This rapid integration has been evident through strategic partnerships between major pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly LLY, Johnson & Johnson JNJ and AbbVie ABBV, and AI-centric tech giants like Palantir PLTR and Nvidia NVDA.

By accelerating drug discovery, streamlining clinical trials, and automating administrative tasks, these AI collaborations are expected to cut billions in costs, enhance operational efficiency and enable faster breakthroughs. This, in turn, is likely to bolster the underlying healthcare stocks and, by extension, strengthen the performance of healthcare exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide exposure to them.

Now, before suggesting healthcare ETFs that you may consider adding to your portfolio to benefit from AI-driven growth in the sector, let’s take a closer look at these partnerships to understand how AI is transforming the healthcare industry.

Notable Pharma-Tech Collaborations

Big Pharma's accelerated AI adoption is best illustrated by its strategic collaborations with AI-centric tech stocks:

• In October 2025, it was announced that Eli Lilly is partnering with NVIDIA to build an "AI Factory," leveraging the NVIDIA Blackwell DGX SuperPOD to power the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to drug discovery. This is aimed at compressing decades of research into instantly accessible intelligence, dramatically accelerating the time from target identification to clinical candidate.

• JNJ has been working with NVIDIA for more than a year to scale AI for use in surgery. This collaboration is aimed at delivering real-time analysis and AI-powered insights within the operating room, using advanced computing platforms to enhance surgical decision-making and training.

In October 2025, the company revealed that it is using an AI-driven simulation to train clinical teams on the MONARCH robotic platform for urology. To achieve this, JNJ is leveraging NVIDIA’s Isaac and Omniverse platforms to create high-fidelity digital twins of the system and patient anatomy, enabling teams to practice robot setup and simulate kidney stone procedures in a virtual operating room. The company is also using NVIDIA Cosmos for generating accurate, physics-based synthetic data, enhancing learning and procedure planning prior to surgery.

The Demographic Reality: Aging Population Drives Wellness Device Demand

The United States faces a significant demographic shift as approximately 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day—a trend expected to continue through 2030 according to demographic research from AARP and policy analysts. This aging population brings heightened focus on maintaining mobility, independence, and quality of life despite common age-related changes affecting physical function.

Knee discomfort represents one of the most frequently reported mobility challenges affecting older adults. Federal health data indicates that approximately 14 million Americans experience symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, with prevalence increasing notably in adults over 50. Beyond diagnosed conditions, millions more experience occasional knee stiffness, swelling, or discomfort that can limit daily activities like climbing stairs, walking, gardening, and recreational pursuits.

This demographic reality has created growing consumer demand for accessible wellness solutions addressing knee comfort without invasive interventions. Many aging adults actively explore alternatives to surgical procedures—which carry inherent risks and lengthy recovery periods—and pharmaceutical approaches, which may involve side effects or long-term management concerns.

Understanding Circulation Support for Knee Comfort in Aging Adults

Wellness research and physical therapy literature have long recognized that adequate blood flow to joints forms one component of overall joint health. When circulation to knee joints decreases—whether due to aging-related vascular changes, sedentary lifestyles, or reduced physical activity—knee tissues may receive less oxygen and nutrients while metabolic waste products accumulate more slowly.

Physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists describe this as one factor among many potentially contributing to age-related knee stiffness and discomfort. The aging process naturally affects vascular function, while modern sedentary lifestyles can compound the issue by reducing the natural muscle pump mechanism that assists circulation in lower extremities.

Key circulation-related concerns that may affect knee comfort include reduced blood flow potentially limiting nutrient delivery, fluid accumulation sometimes causing knee puffiness, decreased oxygen supply to joint tissues, poor lymphatic drainage occasionally resulting in leg heaviness, and sedentary lifestyle patterns where decreased activity may mean reduced circulation, which can contribute to discomfort that further discourages movement.

Important Medical Context: This information is provided for educational purposes regarding circulation and joint health based on general physical therapy principles. Individuals experiencing persistent knee pain, significant swelling, or other concerning symptoms should consult qualified healthcare providers for proper diagnosis and treatment. Home wellness devices for circulation support are designed for general comfort and support purposes, not for diagnosis, treatment, cure, or prevention of medical conditions. Always discuss wellness device use with your healthcare provider, especially if you have diagnosed medical conditions affecting your knees or circulatory system.

The Market Response: Home Wellness Devices Adapt Clinical Principles

The home wellness device market has responded to demographic needs with innovations adapting clinical therapeutic principles into consumer-accessible formats. Manufacturers have developed devices incorporating modalities commonly used in physical therapy settings—heat, compression, and massage—previously available primarily through professional clinical visits.

RejuvaCare LLC's RejuvaKnee device exemplifies this market direction. The company reports growing consumer interest in the device's "Triple Method" approach, which combines three modalities working together to support circulation around knee joints.

How Multi-Modal Circulation Support Works

The Triple Method technology represents an integrated approach combining heat, compression, and massage based on established physical therapy principles.

Heat therapy utilizes adjustable warmth designed to promote vasodilation—the natural expansion of blood vessels that increases blood flow to treated areas. This physiological mechanism represents a well-established principle in physical therapy and sports medicine for supporting circulation. The thermal component is designed to warm muscles and soft tissue around the knee to support flexibility and address stiffness.

Compression therapy provides adjustable pressure designed to support healthy fluid movement. The compression component aims to address fluid retention that can cause knee puffiness while supporting natural lymphatic drainage. Unlike static compression garments providing constant pressure, adjustable compression allows users to customize intensity based on individual comfort levels.

Therapeutic massage delivers rhythmic movements designed to stimulate blood flow through gentle mechanical tissue manipulation. The massage component is intended to support range of motion and encourage natural fluid movement around the knee joint. Multiple intensity settings allow users to personalize the experience based on individual comfort and goals.

The principle underlying multi-modal approaches in physical therapy recognizes that combining modalities may produce complementary effects. Heat dilates vessels, massage encourages fluid movement, and compression supports drainage. This integrated approach offers a broad method of circulation support based on established physical therapy principles documented in rehabilitation literature.

Clinical Foundations: These therapeutic mechanisms draw on established principles in physical therapy and rehabilitation science. However, individual experiences vary significantly based on numerous factors including vascular health status, age, overall health conditions, and consistent usage patterns. This device is a general wellness product, not a medical device, and has not been evaluated by FDA for treatment of medical conditions.

Consumer Trends: Why Aging Adults Choose Home-Based Wellness

Market research reveals several key factors driving consumer interest in home-based circulation support devices for knee comfort.

Cost and Accessibility Considerations

Professional physical therapy sessions typically cost between $100-300 per session, with insurance often limiting coverage to 6-12 visits annually according to fee surveys from physical therapy practices. In contrast, one-time device purchases provide ongoing usage after initial investment, making home-based wellness economically attractive for long-term circulation support goals.

Home-based devices eliminate scheduling constraints, travel requirements, and appointment availability limitations associated with professional services. Users can implement sessions at times convenient for their schedules, in the privacy and comfort of home environments, without transportation or mobility challenges affecting access.

Preference for Drug-Free Approaches
