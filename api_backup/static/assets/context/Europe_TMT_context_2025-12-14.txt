[TITLE]PIMinto PIM Platform Overview: Features & Pricing Guide 2026:
[TEXT]
Handling product data across numerous sales channels presents a crucial challenge for today’s ecommerce companies. Spreadsheets fail when catalogs expand. Traditional systems struggle with multichannel requirements. Manual data management wastes countless hours while mistakes occur, resulting in lost revenue and reputation damage.

PIMinto PIM solves these issues through a specialized product information management platform created for actual business needs, not theoretical scenarios. While enterprise solutions demand substantial budgets and dedicated IT departments, PIMinto provides robust PIM functionality with true accessibility and clear pricing.

This comprehensive guide examines PIMinto’s unique advantages, operational mechanics, and reasons why expanding businesses select it over costly competitors.

What Is PIMinto PIM?

PIMinto represents a cloud-based product information management system that consolidates, enhances, and distributes product content throughout every sales channel. Developed by Systems Online LLC – an organization with 25+ years of enterprise software expertise – PIMinto originated from addressing actual client challenges instead of hypothetical scenarios.

This system functions as the definitive source for product data, removing information silos that create bottlenecks, mistakes, and fragmented customer interactions. While conventional PIM platforms target large-scale manufacturers, PIMinto was specifically engineered for organizations handling sophisticated ecommerce workflows without extensive IT infrastructure.

PIMinto manages the complete spectrum from fundamental product specifications to advanced variant control, digital asset organization, AI-driven content creation, and automatic distribution across multiple platforms. The system accommodates organizations of every scale – from emerging companies with hundreds of SKUs to established enterprises overseeing millions of items.

PIMinto’s distinctive characteristic lies in its pragmatic methodology. Where rivals emphasize enterprise sophistication, PIMinto emphasizes ease of use while maintaining powerful capabilities. The system provides enterprise-level functionality – unlimited data feeds, brand portals, digital asset management, AI assistants – as included features rather than premium upgrades.

PIMinto maintains 99.9% uptime dependability supported by decades of expertise serving B2B customers handling over $1 billion in yearly ecommerce revenue. The system manages an average of 300,000+ API requests daily, proving its ability to support intensive real-world operations.

How Does PIMinto Work?

PIMinto functions through an accessible interface that converts complicated product data administration into efficient workflows.

Data Onboarding and Centralization

Product content enters PIMinto via various methods. Load information from spreadsheets, older systems, supplier databases, or current ecommerce solutions. The platform accommodates common file types including CSV, XLSX, XML, and JSON, ensuring simple migration.

PIMinto’s adaptable data framework conforms to your product organization instead of constraining items into inflexible structures. Establish unique attributes, build product collections, define item connections, and arrange catalogs following your inherent classification system.

Product Enrichment and Collaboration

Groups work together enriching content through collaborative access and permission-based roles. Marketing departments contribute descriptions. Merchandisers configure pricing and classification. Photographers load and arrange visuals. All participants function within a single unified system.

The system features robust mass editing tools that expedite enrichment. Modify attributes throughout product collections, implement modifications to variants at once, or adjust particular segments through sophisticated filtering.

PIMinto’s AI-driven tools substantially accelerate content development. Create product descriptions from fundamental attributes, convert content across numerous languages, or enhance current descriptions for particular platforms – all leveraging integrated OpenAI technology.

Digital Asset Management

Product visuals, videos, 360-degree presentations, and files connect seamlessly with product entries via PIMinto’s integrated digital asset administration. Load high-quality originals once, and the platform creates refined versions for various platforms automatically.

Structure assets through tags, classifications, and descriptive data. Connect media straight to products, variants, or specifications. Version tracking preserves asset chronology while avoiding uncertainty regarding current documents.

Multichannel Distribution

The newly upgraded Shopify connection now delivers bidirectional synchronization – information transfers effortlessly from PIMinto to Shopify storefronts and returns from Shopify to PIMinto. This reciprocal synchronization maintains order details and product modifications in complete alignment. Apart from Shopify, PIMinto accommodates BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce, and specialized platforms via adjustable feeds. Establish platform-particular parameters to personalize how product content displays on various channels while preserving fundamental data uniformity.

Brand Portals and API Access

Integrated brand portal capabilities revolutionize how organizations distribute product content with collaborators, merchants, and resellers. Generate searchable collections with filtering, lookup features, and retrieval choices. Personalize every portal with your identity – emblems, palette, specialized CSS.

PIMinto’s Data Streams innovation allows programmers to link straight to the PIM as an information resource with unlimited API access. The comprehensive REST API delivers systematic authority over complete PIM operations, enabling advanced connections and mechanized procedures.

Key Benefits of Using PIMinto

Dramatically Reduced Time-to-Market

[TITLE]Connect Everyone Coalition enlists groups to modernize space development policy:
[TEXT]
Twenty organizations, working under the aegis of The Connect Everyone Coalition, have called on nine federal agencies to modernize and reduce bureaucracy in policy related to the commercial space industry.

While parts of the space development policy letter called for general changes and updates, the focus is on low-earth orbit (LEO) technology. The letter cited four current areas of redundancy and inefficiency: fragmented multi-agency approvals, redundant environmental reviews, redundant range safety determinations, and lack of transparency regarding scheduling and delays.

“New space-based innovations like low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have the potential to finally give every American access to reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband and the 21st-century opportunities that it unlocks,” CEC executive director Richard Cullen said in a

[TITLE]SEC chair moves to boost IPO momentum: ‘Make it cool to be a public company’:
[TEXT]
Good morning. At the AICPA conference earlier this week in Washington, D.C., U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins told an audience of accountants, auditors, and financial preparers that it’s time to make going public more accessible.

Atkins noted that over the past 30 years, there has been a significant net decline in the total number of publicly traded companies, due in part to mergers and bankruptcies outpacing IPOs. His goal, he said, is to “make it cool to be a public company” again—something he believes has “taken a hit over time.”

Atkins outlined three obstacles he believes are holding issuers back. The first is what he described as expensive, overly long disclosures that impose an unnecessary burden on issuers. The second is the threat of securities litigation. Atkins reiterated his support for allowing companies—where state law permits—to adopt bylaws mandating arbitration and applying “loser pays” fee-shifting provisions, and said the SEC staff will no longer block an IPO solely because such measures are included. “If the state allows it, then that will be fine with us,” he said.

His third concern centers on what he characterized as “politicized shareholder activists” who can influence corporate governance battles. Atkins expects any related policy proposals to take most of next year to move through the regulatory process.

IPO momentum returns in 2025

After a significant downturn, the IPO market has been gaining momentum. In my conversation with Lynn Martin, president of the New York Stock Exchange, during the recent Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, she said: “The IPO market is really, really strong. We’ve had a great year so far across all sectors.”

According to S&P Global research, the first half of 2025 was the strongest start for U.S. IPO issuance since 2021, with 102 IPOs versus 78 in the same period of 2024. Deal activity accelerated through the period, with 59 IPOs raising

[TITLE]Telcos set for steady sales, earnings growth in 2026 – Moody’s:
[TEXT]
The corporate finance group of major credit rating agency Moody’s reckons the global telecom operator sector is set for stable revenue and core earnings growth in 2026, although expectations for the different geographic regions vary quite markedly, with Latin America set for the strongest growth.

During the ratings agency’s recent Global Telecommunications Market Update 2026, Carlos Winzer, associate managing director of the corporate finance group, said average organic revenue growth for the global telco sector is projected at 2.3% and organic earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) growth at 2.9% for the largest operators globally.

“This stability is supported by price increases, which continue to gain traction, the phasing out of the legacy copper networks, which are being substituted with fibre, and the integration of GenAI [generative AI] to drive efficiency. Industry consolidation is expected to further strengthen the sector’s foundations,” Winzer said.

In terms of the different regions, North America is expected to see the lowest revenue growth of 1.3%, while Latin America (LatAm) will see the highest at 3.7%. LatAm also leads with the highest expected EBITDA growth of 5.2%, while Asia Pacific (APAC) brings up the rear with 2.2% (see map, above).

Although macroeconomic conditions are challenging and risks remain, Winzer said telecom service providers “continue to evolve their business models in a period of transformation marked by rising data consumption and expanding broadband access”.

M&A on the cards in Europe

Telcos in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are expected to see revenue and EBITDA growth of 3.6% and 4% respectively owing to growing data demand, higher broadband penetration and streamlining at an operational level, said Winzer.

At the same time, he noted that major European telcos “are positioned for a wave of mergers and acquisitions in 2026, with consolidation talks intensifying across several markets”, such as in France, Italy and Spain.

“All these developments suggest that 2026 could be a pivotal year for European telecom M&A as operators seek scale and efficiency in an increasingly competitive market,” said Winzer.

Telcos in Europe also continue to hold significant amounts of debt, and will “need to navigate a challenging funding environment, balancing investment demands with prudent financial management to ensure continued access to liquidity and support for future growth”, he added.

Turning to North America, Emile El-Nems, VP and senior credit officer at Moody’s, said the outlook for the US is stable because of underlying dynamics, such as a more supportive regulatory environment, limited pricing power, “operating leverage” owing to acquisitions, and modest subscriber growth.

“We are expecting seven to eight million subscribers [net adds] in wireless… and

[TITLE]ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI chatbot:
[TEXT]
ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

In 2025, OpenAI has battled the perception that it was ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek, all while the company has tried to shore up its relationship with Washington, pursued ambitious data center projects, and laid the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Most recently though, headlines around OpenAI have focused on its competition gaining ground, with CEO Sam Altman’s “code red” internal memo shifting company focus toward its flagship chatbot.

And going further into the archives for context, this year came after a packed 2024, from OpenAI’s partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

[TITLE]Donald Trump Tries To Override State AI Regulations via Executive Order:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump announced his executive order, "ensuring a national policy framework for artificial intelligence," on Thursday. While the order self-admittedly does not create a national regulatory framework for the burgeoning technology, the reactions of both AI pessimists and AI optimists suggest that it is a meaningful step toward stymieing state regulation.

Before Thanksgiving, Trump took to Truth Social to call on congressional republicans to put a federal AI standard in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Trump's plea did not fall on deaf ears, but was ultimately of no avail. While restrictions on advanced AI chip sales did not make it into the House version of the NDAA—a boon for American GPU manufacturers Nvidia, AMD, and for the growth of the American semiconductor industry—neither did a federal AI regulatory framework.

Trump's Thursday executive order says that "a carefully crafted national framework can ensure that the United States wins the AI race," but such a framework does not yet exist. The executive order implicitly acknowledges that the president cannot impose such a framework single-handedly, but emphasizes that the current state-by-state patchwork "imping[es] on interstate commerce."

As the regulation of interstate commerce is the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, the order seeks "to check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation," but notably not those that relate to child safety protections, data center infrastructure, or state government AI procurement and use. To this end, the order includes everything presaged in the unreleased executive order, "eliminating state law obstruction of national AI policy," which was leaked in November.

First, it conditions federal broadband funding and other discretionary grant programs on the nonenactment and nonenforcement of state AI regulations deemed onerous by the administration. Second, it establishes the AI Litigation Task Force within the Justice Department to evaluate and challenge such regulations. Third, it directs the Federal Communications Commission "to determine whether to adopt a Federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models that preempts conflicting State laws." And finally, it directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a statement explaining how state laws that "require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models are preempted" by the FTC Act's prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting interstate commerce.

The Center for Democracy and Technology, a progressive technology policy nonprofit, argues that the order is a "set of largely toothless directives," given that the president "cannot constitutionally preempt state laws." Neil Chilson, head of AI policy for the Abundance Institute, has a different view. He says the order "is rhetorically less polarizing and legally more watertight" than the leaked executive order. Only time will tell whether the executive order has Trump's desired effect.

[TITLE]Stocks drop as AI exuberance worries linger; US yields jump:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec 12 : Major stock indexes fell on Friday, with technology-related shares dropping again as investors were wary of artificial intelligence bets, while the dollar edged higher and U.S. Treasury yields jumped.

Yields gained as investors weighed commentary from Federal Reserve officials who voted against the U.S. central bank's interest rate cut this week said on Friday they are worried that inflation remains too high to warrant lower borrowing costs. Rising yields also weighed on stocks.

Technology fell 2.9 per cent, the most of the major S&P 500 sectors as tech-related fears lingered. Cloud computing company Oracle earlier this week flagged massive spending and weak forecasts. A warning
