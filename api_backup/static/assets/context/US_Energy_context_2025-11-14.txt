[TITLE]EIL inks MoU with NMDC Energy to explore onshore oil & gas projects in Saudi Arabia:
[TEXT]
State-run Engineers India (EIL) said on Monday that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NMDC Energy to strengthen cooperation in the execution of onshore projects in Saudi Arabia, covering Oil and Gas Processing, Refineries, Petrochemicals, Pipelines, Storage Terminals, and Energy Transition.

The MoU was signed on the sidelines of ADIPEC 2025, world’s largest oil and gas event, which was held in Abu Dhabi last week.

“The partnership with NMDC reflects EIL’s commitment to engineering excellence, innovation, and building strategic collaborations that support sustainable growth across the region. The partnership aims to combine EIL’s extensive engineering expertise with NMDC Energy’s strong execution capabilities with focus on innovation, sustainability and operational excellence,” EIL said.

NMDC Energy, part of the NMDC Group of the UAE, offers engineering, procurement and construction solutions to clients in the integrated oil and gas, petrochemical, and energy transition sectors.

Sources said that both companies want to collaborate for joint tendering and executing onshore projects. The collaboration is related to delivery of onshore engineering procurement and construction (EPC) projects in the Arab nation across the full spectrum of oil & gas segments, leveraging the fabrication facilities owned by NMDC in Ras Al Khair and the design center established by EIL in Al Khobar.

In its FY25 annual report, EIL said that it is expanding footprints in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, tapping into refinery upgrades, fertiliser plant projects and oil and gas infrastructure development.

“EIL in its endeavour to seek projects in the Middle East, has managed to secure assignments from the ADNOC Group companies for Technical Support Services (TSS) contracts, General Service Agreement with BAPCO, Bahrain,” it added.

The PSU bagged the Engineering Services for Jetty-less Green Ammonia Transfer System for a Green Ammonia Project (Offshore portion) in Oman, from M/s ACME, Oman. EIL is envisaging projects in the Green Hydrogen/ Ammonia segment from clients overseas, it said in the annual report.

[TITLE]Radiant Ridge Energy Ltd. Partners with Nordcon Canada Inc. to Power 3MW Modular Hydrocooled Data Centers with On-Site Natural Gas:
[TEXT]
Calgary, Alberta, Nov. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radiant Ridge Energy Ltd. (“RRE”), a leading energy infrastructure developer, today announced a strategic partnership with Nordcon Canada Inc. (“Nordcon”), a natural gas producer, to deploy 3MW of modular hydrocooled data center capacity powered by Nordcon's on-site natural gas production.

This collaboration represents a significant milestone in integrating energy production with high-performance computing infrastructure. The partnership combines Nordcon's natural gas production capabilities with RRE's expertise in data center operations and power infrastructure to deliver an innovative, vertically integrated solution for power-intensive applications.

Transforming Stranded Gas into Computing Power

Under the agreement, RRE will deploy and operate modular hydrocooled data centers at Nordcon's natural gas production sites, utilizing Nordcon's gas supply to generate on-site power. This approach transforms locally-produced natural gas into valuable computing capacity, creating new revenue streams from energy resources.

"This partnership exemplifies the innovative solutions possible when energy production meets digital infrastructure," said Bruce Xu, Managing Director of RRE. "By locating our modular data centers at Nordcon's production sites, we gain access to reliable, cost-effective natural gas while helping Nordcon monetize their gas production in new ways. This is the kind of vertical integration that creates value for both parties and demonstrates our commitment to efficient, practical power solutions."

Strategic Advantages of the Partnership

The collaboration offers several key benefits:

Direct Fuel Access : Co-location at production sites eliminates transportation costs and ensures uninterrupted gas supply for power generation

: Co-location at production sites eliminates transportation costs and ensures uninterrupted gas supply for power generation Resource Monetization : Transforms Nordcon's natural gas production into computing infrastructure revenue, diversifying their business model

: Transforms Nordcon's natural gas production into computing infrastructure revenue, diversifying their business model Operational Efficiency : On-site generation minimizes transmission losses and infrastructure overhead

: On-site generation minimizes transmission losses and infrastructure overhead Scalable Model: The modular data center approach enables rapid deployment and replication at additional Nordcon production sites

"RRE's expertise in managing complex energy infrastructure and data center operations makes them the ideal partner for this innovative approach," said Garry Mihaichuk, President at Nordcon Canada Inc. "Rather than simply selling gas into commodity markets, we're participating in the value chain all the way through to computing services. This partnership opens up entirely new revenue opportunities for our production assets."

Foundation for Future Growth

This 3MW deployment represents the first phase of what both companies envision as a long-term strategic relationship. As Nordcon expands its production operations and RRE scales its data center portfolio, the partnership model can be replicated across multiple sites throughout Western Canada.

[TITLE]SSE to invest £33bn in upgrading Scotland's electricity grid:
[TEXT]
SSE to invest £33bn in upgrading Scotland's electricity grid

1 day ago Share Save Douglas Fraser Business and economy editor, Scotland Share Save

SSEN SSE's plans include erecting tall pylons and and building large sub-stations

The company that controls the electricity grid in the north of Scotland has announced plans to invest £33bn over five years. SSE has set out plans to spend two-thirds of that to upgrade wiring and increase high-voltage grid capacity to get power from the north to customers in the south. However, the Perth-based company faces strong criticism of some its plans, for the impact they will have on the Highlands and rural Aberdeenshire. The plans include erecting tall pylons and and building large sub-stations.

SSE Martin Pibworth, SSE's chief executive, says he is confident Scotland has sufficient skills to support the plans

The other third of the new investment plan is partly for lower-voltage wiring in the two areas where the company has the distribution franchise and monopoly - the north of Scotland and central southern England, where it took over Southern Electric 27 years ago. That will take £5bn of the investment plan up to 2030, some of it to improve the capacity of homes to run air heat converters and car charging through household meters. The company is putting a reduced share of its investment effort into offshore wind power, though it remains a major developer in the North Sea.

World's largest wind farms

SSE is constructing the Dogger Bank wind farm, which will be the world's largest, and it has permission to build the Berwick Bank array, off the south-east coast of Scotland, which will then become the world's largest when it is completed. Martin Pibworth, the company's new chief executive, is confident that the plan is "focussed, disciplined and comprehensively funded". That funding process began with the successful placing, on Tuesday morning, of £2bn-worth of new SSE shares, taken up by existing investors. Unusually for a utility, its share price rose nearly 16% at its peak, before ending the day 11% up. Other funding will come through the company's income from its current assets, and from debt.

SSE Renewables SSE is also behind the The Dogger Bank scheme off the East Yorkshire coast

Mr Pibworth, who took over from Alistair Phillips-Davies as chief executive of SSE three months ago, is also confident that there will be sufficient skills to carry out the work. The networks transmission division is expanding its staff five-fold to 2,500 by shifting people within SSE, while recruiting apprentices, graduates and seeking out those in the offshore oil and gas industry. More widely, SSE directly employs 7,000 people in Scotland, and more than 10,000 indirectly, while that extends to a total of nearly 49,000 across the UK. However, the company faces criticism about the scale of the 11 major transmission projects it has under way - similar to the difficulties in winning community support for grid connections in England and Wales, where National Grid plc runs the network, and in the south of Scotland, where the monopoly provider of high-voltage cabling is Scottish Power.

Impact on the landscape

Community councils from across the Highlands have come together to raise their concerns. The Highland Council recently published a strongly-worded critique of one of the most contentious power lines, stretching 107 miles from the north of Caithness through eastern Sutherland and Easter Ross to the central Highland village of Beauly. That is now the meeting point for four major lines, and will require an additional, very large sub-station. Although the local and planning authority is responsible for land along the entire route of the line, the project goes to the Scottish government for planning approval. Mr Pibworth told BBC Scotland News: "We've carried out the widest, broadest consultation ever held in the north of Scotland. "We've held 250-plus meetings with communities, to make sure they understand the plan. "The rewiring of Scotland needs to be done. We need to get renewables (energy) flowing through to demand centres. "We need to make sure we have an energy system which is reliable, that is not exposed to international markets and geopolitics through gas price volatility, that is secure and clean, and that is resourced with good jobs in our local communities. "Those plans are being pulled together now," the chief executive said. "We are listening to councils and communities, and trying to work with them, to make sure we can adopt where it's possible to do so. "But these networks have to be built, for the good of the economy and for green jobs and for the good of prosperity as we electrify our economy."

[TITLE]Crude Prices Tumble as OPEC Projects a Global Crude Surplus:
[TEXT]
December WTI crude oil (CLZ25) today is down -2.14 (-3.51%), and December RBOB gasoline (RBZ25) is down -0.0400 (-1.99%).

Crude oil and gasoline prices are falling sharply today, with crude matching a 3-week low. Signs of global supply glut are weighing on crude prices after OPEC said a global crude surplus arrived sooner than expected. Dollar strength today is also negative for energy prices.

Crude prices tumbled today after OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output. OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus last month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit.

As a bearish factor, Saudi Arabia last Thursday lowered the price of its main crude grade to Asia for delivery next month to the lowest level in 11 months.

Crude has support amid expectations that the US government will reopen later this week, which would support economic growth and energy demand. On Monday, the Senate voted 60-40 to pass a temporary continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government, and the House will vote on the measure later today, when it is expected to pass. If approved, the bill goes to President Trump, who said he will sign it into law.

Strength in crude demand from China, the world's second-largest crude consumer, is supportive of prices, after a report last Friday showed that China's Jan-Oct crude imports rose +3.1% y/y to 471 MMT.

Oil prices have received support on recent reports that the US military may be on the verge of launching military strikes on Venezuela, which is the world's 12th largest oil producer.

OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members will raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus. The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026. OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore. OPEC's October crude production rose by +50,000 bpd to 29.07 million bpd, the highest in 2.5 years.

Reduced crude exports from Russia are supportive of oil prices. Ukraine has targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past three months, exacerbating a fuel crunch in Russia and limiting Russia's crude export capabilities. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries and oil export terminals curbed Russia's total seaborne fuel shipments to 1.88 million bpd in the first ten days of October, the lowest average in over 3.25 years, and have knocked out 13% to 20% of Russia's refining capacity by the end of October, curbing production by as much as 1.1 million bpd. New US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have also curbed Russian oil exports.

Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days rose +11% w/w to 95.18 million bbls in the week ended November 7.

Last Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of October 31 were -5.3% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -4.3% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -8.8% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending October 31 rose +0.1% w/w to a record high of 13.651 million bpd.

Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending November 7 remained unchanged at 414, modestly above the 4-year low of 410 rigs set on August 1. Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.

[TITLE]Chevron’s Five-Year Plan Prioritizes Superior Shareholder Returns:
[TEXT]
Chevron plans to grow its free cash flow into the next decade as it focuses on higher profits and returns to shareholders instead of growing oil and production, the U.S. supermajor’s five-year plan to 2030 showed on Wednesday.

Chevron will raise output, but its primary focus will be on boosting free cash flow and earnings per share via deeper cost cuts, synergies from the Hess acquisition, and reduced capital expenditure (capex).

“Chevron expects to maintain capital and cost discipline while investing to extend cash flow growth into the next decade,” the second-biggest U.S. oil and gas firm said today.

The supermajor expects to grow oil and gas production by 2% to 3% annually through 2030 and improve return on capital employed by over 3% by 2030 at $70 per barrel Brent.

In the near term, Chevron expects to boost synergies from the Hess acquisition to $1.5 billion and structural cost reductions to $3 billion-$4 billion by the end of 2026.

The company also expects to keep its capex and dividend breakeven below $50 per barrel Brent through 2030.

“We believe Chevron is uniquely positioned to grow earnings and free cash flow into the next decade,” chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said.

“Never in my career have I seen a higher confidence outlook, further into the future and with lower execution risk; Chevron is stronger, more resilient, and better positioned than ever.”

CFO Eimear Bonner commented that “Chevron’s sustained cash generation underpins superior shareholder returns.”

In an interview with the Financial Times, Bonner said “We’re focused on growing free cash flow, not volume. That’s the difference.”

Chevron’s new five-year strategic plan is much more value-focused and “it’s not a volume story for us, it’s a value story,” Bonner told FT.

The supermajor also targets to deliver its first AI data center power project in West Texas, targeting first power in 2027.

Chevron’s approach to new energies is pragmatic, with a focus on its core strengths.

“We are excited about our new power business, where we have an early-mover advantage and look forward to providing the power required to support U.S. leadership in Artificial Intelligence,” Jeff Gustavson, president of Chevron New Energies, said in a statement.

[TITLE]The Great Rotation Approaches:
[TEXT]
The Great Rotation Approaches

Regular readers know we are preparing for a major market shift over the next few years.

A move out of expensive sectors like big tech and AI, and into hard assets. A rotation out of hype, and into reality.

This thesis is centered on the idea that the world has reached a tipping point with debt. Governments worldwide are up to their necks in it.

Central banks and political leaders have only a few options to deal with this debt. None are good.

They could attempt to pay off the debt. Raise taxes, cut spending, and let market forces do the dirty work. Many companies would fail in a short time period. Unemployment would skyrocket. It’d be a painful financial reset.

Alternatively, they can keep kicking the can down the road. And this is the only realistic option.

Further can-kicking will require massive money-printing operations. The Fed will be forced to gorge itself on U.S. debt.

Quantitative easing (QE) will be used to paper over gaping budgetary holes. And eventually, governments will be forced to go to extremes. They will have to keep interest rates artificially low even as inflation is uncomfortably high.

This is a recipe for a commodity super-cycle.

Gold and Silver First

During commodity bull markets, gold and silver typically lead the way. And that’s what we’ve seen so far.

We just experienced our first significant sell-off in precious metals of the cycle, and the bull looks like it’s ready to resume its upward climb. We could consoldiate for a while around these levels, and I’d be totally fine with that. But over the next few years, we’re headed much higher.

Historically, natural resource bull markets tend to last a decade or so. And they tend to coincide with the end of major bull markets, and the money printing that almost always happens during these times.

We saw this from 2000-2011, and 1970-1980. This coming one could last even longer, because the scale of today’s debt problems are so much larger than either of those previous periods.

For investors, now is the time to start diversifying into natural resources. See the chart below, which shows the S&P 500 weightings of tech vs energy and materials:

Source: Tavi Costa

The takeaway from this chart is simple. Investors are extremely overweight tech, and underweight natural resources.

The Dollar Had a Good Run

All of this is happening at the same time as the world’s monetary regime is undergoing a sea change.

The U.S. dollar has had an incredible run over the past 75+ years. We came out of WW2 as the only developed country without widespread destruction, and world leadership was essentially ours for the taking.

But over time we’ve abused this position of power. We’ve exported the bulk of our manufacturing sector, ran up our debt to extreme levels, and complely over-financialized our economy.

Now the world is shifting back towards gold as a reserve asset. Trust in the dollar was forever lowered in 2022 when we seized Russian central bank assets in the wake of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

There’s no going back from that. Central banks all over the world are buying up gold and limiting their exposure to dollars and treasuries.

For Americans, this transition might be painful in the short-mid term. But in the long run, a much cheaper dollar will be a blessing. It will allow us to rebuild our manufacturing and resource sectors.

Building a Resource Rotation Portfolio

For the past year, I’ve been focused on building up a strong allocation to gold and silver miners. That’s worked out very well so far, and I hope to hold these positions for at least another 5 years. A few names we like are Newmont (NEM), Pan American Silver (PAAS), and Barrick (B).

But the resource sector is more than just precious metals.

[TITLE]Earnings live: Applied Materials stock falls, Disney tumbles, Cisco rises:
[TEXT]
The greater part of third quarter earnings results are in the rearview mirror, though investors this week are looking to reports from The Walt Disney Company (DIS) and Alibaba (BABA).

So far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start. As of Nov. 7, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts are expecting a 13.1% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year.

Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30.

Source: FactSet

Last week, investors heard from tech and AI players such as Palantir (PLTR), AMD (AMD), Supermicro (SMCI), and Constellation Energy (CEG), as well as from Uber (UBER), Spotify (SPOT), Snap (SNAP), and Airbnb (ABNB).

This week, quarterly results arrive from The Walt Disney Company, Applied Materials (AMAT), CoreWeave (CRWV), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Rocket Lab (RKLB), Oklo (OKLO), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Alibaba (BABA), among others.

[TITLE]British utility SSE seeks to raise $2.7 billion for grid investments, shares soar:
[TEXT]
The chief executive of British power firm SSE says a rapid build-out of renewable projects can help the U.K. to secure its energy security and bring costs down for consumers.

British utility SSE unveiled a 33 billion pound five-year investment plan on Wednesday, including a 2 billion pound ($2.68 billion) equity fundraising, as it seeks to upgrade the UK's regulated electricity networks and bolster its renewables business.

SSE's shares rose more than 11% to a record high. Analysts were positive

The seizure of public utilities for the sake of profit may lead to a disaster for consumers — and the planet.

Ratepayers across the U.S. are facing rising electric bills — a trend that could be turbocharged by Wall Street’s growing effort to capture the electric utilities we all depend on.

A critical turning point in this development occurred in October when Minnesota state regulators greenlit the acquisition of Allete by asset management behemoth BlackRock — set to become Allete’s majority stakeholder — and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Allete owns Minnesota Power, the main electric utility in northern Minnesota. The approval came against significant community opposition and, as Truthout previously reported, an administrative law judge’s report that strongly recommended against the deal.

With the acquisition, BlackRock will turn Allete from a publicly traded company into a private one. Moreover, BlackRock is now gunning for utility giant AES, which has utilities in Ohio and Indiana along with other extensive U.S. and international operations, while another private equity titan, Blackstone, is seeking approval to acquire TXNM Energy, with hundreds of thousands of customers in New Mexico and Texas. Private equity’s escalating run on utilities is largely driven by the boom in data centers — massive consumers of electricity — and the guaranteed rates of return that utilities offer.

Critics of the buyouts say this is a deeply alarming trend, as firms like BlackRock and Blackstone will likely impose a private equity model — opaque, extractive, laser-focused on profit — over basic services. Even well-intentioned state regulators, opponents contend, will be no match for these massively-resourced companies as they look to bulldoze through any obstacles toward enriching their wealthy investors.

Alissa Jean Schafer, climate director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said the Allete deal’s approval was “precedent-setting” for private equity’s growing incursion into utilities.

“The approval of this deal sends a signal that our critical infrastructure is now up for sale to the highest bidder,” said Schafer.

Victory for BlackRock

When BlackRock’s infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), announced a $6.2 billion deal in May 2024 to acquire Allete and take the company private, many local organizers, community members, and ratepayers in Northern Minnesota staunchly opposed the deal, which needed approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC).

Their fears that a private equity takeover of their electric utility could weaken transparency and raise rates seemed vindicated in July when, after months of comments from all sides, an administrative law judge unequivocally recommended the Minnesota PUC reject the deal. The report stated in stark terms that BlackRock would “do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

“That’s when the influence wielding and the political machinations really ramped up,” Maggie Schuppert, an organizer with CURE, a rural community advocacy group intervening against the acquisition, told Truthout.

Minnesota’s Department of Commerce, an important and influential party that participated in the review process of the acquisition, soon reversed its initial opposition to the deal after some concessions from Allete. Records obtained by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project indicate that Pete Wyckoff, the commerce department’s deputy commissioner of energy resources, had cozy communications with Allete as a deal was being worked out.

Reporting from The Lever showed that a former Minnesota PUC commissioner now working on behalf of BlackRock appears to have coordinated with building trades unions to back the deal, which a representative of the union denied, despite evidence showing the former commissioner’s digital footprint on filings from the union in favor of the takeover. Meanwhile, some “clean energy” groups came out in favor of the acquisition after developing relationships with private stakeholders and BlackRock attorneys. In one instance, a “clean energy” nonprofit held a benefit with Allete as a “VIP sponsor.”

At the PUC’s first meeting on the acquisition, Schuppert said it became clear that commissioners were intent on approving the deal, even as PUC staff warned

[TITLE]What Climate Change Will Do to America by Mid-Century:
[TEXT]
Earlier this year, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, a graveyard was spared by the fire that sent thousands of Los Angeles residents fleeing into the coal-black night. Here, in Mountain View Cemetery, lie the bones of Octavia Butler, the famed science-fiction writer who spent her life in Pasadena and Altadena, both of which had burned. Trinkets offered by fans often decorate Butler’s unassuming grave. A footstone is inscribed with a quotation from her Parable of the Sower : ALL THAT YOU TOUCH, YOU CHANGE. ALL THAT YOU CHANGE, CHANGES YOU.

In that dystopian novel, published in 1993 and set in the mid-2020s, the United States still exists but has been warped by global warming, and its authoritarian government has ceded most of the administration of day-to-day matters to corrupt companies. In Butler’s neo-feudal vision, states and cities erect strict borders to deter migrants, the gap between rich and poor has widened, and massive wildfires in Southern California drive the state’s decline.

It has become commonplace to label Butler a prophet. She didn’t get everything right
