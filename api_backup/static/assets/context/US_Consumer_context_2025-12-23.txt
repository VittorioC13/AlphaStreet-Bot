Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) surged on December 18 after announcing a $6 billion all-stock merger with fusion energy company TAE Technologies. But retail investors aren’t buying the hype. Reddit sentiment collapsed from 78 to just 22 out of 100 immediately following the announcement, with the main discussion thread on r/stocks drawing 972 upvotes and 164 skeptical comments.

24/7 Wall St.

The disconnect is striking. While the stock posted strong single-day performance, retail traders are treating the news with deep cynicism rather than celebration.

Reddit Calls It an “Old School Penny Stock”

The tone on Reddit tells the real story. User cheddarben, whose post received overwhelming support from the community, captured the prevailing sentiment:

In the post, cheddarben wrote: “Old school penny stock with bizarro news. I am sure it will be a wild ride.” The characterization of Trump Media as operating like a penny stock resonated widely with commenters expressing similar skepticism.

Top-voted comments echoed this skepticism. Reddit user Unlucky-Clock5230 commented: “This is the most obvious pump and dump I’ve ever seen. The fundamentals are absolutely terrible.” Reddit user techgeek72 added: “TAE has been ‘five years away’ from fusion for the last 27 years. This merger is a joke.” Reddit user InvestmentGrift questioned: “How is a social media company with declining revenue suddenly worth billions by merging with a fusion company that’s never produced commercial energy?”

Retail investors have legitimate concerns:

Trump Media trades at a staggering 797x price-to-sales ratio with just $3.68 million in trailing revenue

The company posted negative EBITDA of $175.8 million and a net loss of $54.8 million last quarter

Revenue declined 3.8% year-over-year, moving in the wrong direction

Technical indicators support the skepticism, with the stock showing high volatility and overbought conditions following the announcement.

Truth Social Meets Fusion Energy

Despite recent gains, Trump Media remains down significantly year-to-date. The stock hit a 52-week low of $10.18 just days ago and trades well below its $43.46 peak. TAE Technologies, founded in 1998, has raised $1.3 billion pursuing commercial fusion energy but has yet to demonstrate a working power plant. The merged company plans to break ground on a 50-megawatt facility in 2026, with co-CEOs Devin Nunes and Michl Binderbauer leading the venture. For investors watching peers, the broader market offers a stark contrast. The S&P 500 is up 15% year-to-date, highlighting the challenging performance of Trump Media stock.

[TITLE]Blum Holdings, Inc. Announces Closing of Acquisition of High-Volume Bay Area Cannabis Retail Dispensary:
[TEXT]
DOWNEY, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blum Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: BLMH) (the “Company,” “Blüm,” “Blüm Holdings,” “we” or “us”), a California-based publicly traded holding company, today announced the successful closing of its acquisition of a high-volume Bay Area cannabis retail dispensary through the purchase of all outstanding equity of the operating entity.

The acquired dispensary is a well-established, fully licensed retail operator located in a major Northern California market and has generated approximately $12.0 million in annual revenue with a long operating history and strong local customer base. The transaction further expands Blüm’s Northern California footprint.

“This acquisition reflects our continued focus on disciplined, opportunistic growth,” said Sabas Carrillo, Chief Executive Officer of Blüm Holdings. “We are acquiring durable retail assets with real revenue, real customers, and meaningful operating history, positioning the Company to benefit from both improved execution at the asset level and broader structural tailwinds impacting the U.S. cannabis industry.”

The transaction was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement and included a combination of cash and equity consideration. The Company noted that all required closing conditions have been satisfied.

Carrillo added, “As the regulatory backdrop continues to evolve at the federal level, including ongoing discussions around potential reclassification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act, we believe scaled, compliant retail operators are well positioned to benefit from broader market development.”

[TITLE]Kraft Heinz taps ex-Kellogg chief as CEO to steer split:
[TEXT]
Kraft Heinz has named former Kellogg chief Steve Cahillane its new CEO, tasking the industry veteran with leading the packaged food giant through a planned split into two standalone companies after years of sluggish growth.

The company decided to break up in September into two units, one focused on condiments like Heinz ketchup and the other on grocery food brands like Oscar Mayer, after years of declining sales and as consumers have increasingly turned away from heavily processed foods.

Legacy food companies are also being challenged by upstart competitors often selling products at lower prices.

Cahillane, 60, joins a growing list of global consumer goods companies to make top-level changes this year. He begins his role on January 1, succeeding Carlos Abrams-Rivera, who will serve as an advisor until March 6.

In an interview with Reuters, he endorsed the company's split and said he had the right to improve upon those plans. "I'm looking forward to executing it, I think it's absolutely the right thing to do."

Cahillane is expected to serve as CEO of the sauces and spreads unit after the split, which aims to reduce operational complexity and improve focus on each business as high inflation and economic uncertainty hobble demand.

Some analysts have said the split may be a precursor to selling the condiments business - which is being referred to as the "taste elevation" unit - to another company.

Abrams-Rivera, who became CEO in 2024, was pegged to head the grocery unit after the split, which is expected to be completed by the second half of 2026. But Kraft Heinz said the board would initiate a CEO search for the business.

[TITLE]Apollo Funds to Acquire Prosol Group, a Leading French Fresh Food Retailer:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced that Apollo-managed funds (the “Apollo Funds”) have agreed to acquire a majority stake in Prosol Group (“Prosol” or the “Company”), the multi-specialist in fresh food businesses and food retail in France, from Ardian. Prosol’s existing shareholders and management team will reinvest alongside the Apollo Funds.

Founded in 1992, Prosol has differentiated itself by building a proprietary, vertically integrated supply chain, sourcing fresh, quality products resulting in a highly loyal and fast-growing customer base. Prosol operates nearly 450 stores across France under two main banners: Grand Frais, where it provides the fruits, vegetables, dairy and fish; and Fresh., a fully owned chain of stores that sell fruits, vegetables, dairy, fish, and meat. By working with over 2,300 partners to source premium produce and focusing on best-in-class in-store experiences, Prosol’s retail concept has developed a leading position among customers, with Grand Frais achieving high consumer sentiment in France. Prosol’s portfolio of retail brands also includes La Boulangerie du Marché, mon-marché.fr, BioFrais, and Banco Fresco in Italy.

Alex van Hoek, Lead Partner for European Private Equity at Apollo, said, “Prosol is a clear category leader in fresh food retail, with a powerful customer proposition and outstanding sourcing model. Under the leadership of Jean-Paul, the Company has demonstrated consistent organic growth over time, providing shoppers with exceptional quality products, breadth of assortment and strong value for money. As Prosol looks to expand its estate both in France and internationally, Apollo will draw on our extensive retail expertise to support the management team’s growth plans while maintaining the distinctive identity beloved by customers.”

Jean-Paul Mochet, Chief Executive Officer at Prosol, said, “This investment marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Prosol and is testament to not only the strength of our business, but also the deep relationships we have formed with our suppliers and customers. With the support and expertise of such a strong partner in Apollo, we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term growth ambitions and bring our distinctive retail concept to more customers across Europe.”

Apollo’s private equity business has a long and successful track record of transforming businesses spanning more than 35 years, including significant experience in the retail and consumer sector. Apollo has been actively investing in France for more than two decades and today has

[TITLE]Amazon Could Invest $10 Billion in OpenAI. Should You Invest in AMZN Stock First?:
[TEXT]
In a tech world where artificial intelligence (AI) has become the ultimate growth frontier, Amazon (AMZN) might be making one of its most audacious strategic moves yet. News is swirling that the e-commerce and cloud giant is in early talks to invest around $10 billion in OpenAI , the maker of ChatGPT and one of the industry’s most influential AI innovators. This deal could value OpenAI at over $500 billion and further cement AI’s role in reshaping global markets. Also, there is an agreement for OpenAI to use Amazon’s custom AI chips.

Meanwhile, Amazon has already invested at least $8 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic and appears eager to deepen its exposure to generative AI.

The talks underscore the growing importance of AI infrastructure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has developed its own AI chips for years, including Inferentia and the latest Trainium, aimed at meeting surging compute demand. On the other hand, OpenAI has made over $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments recently, partnering with chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO), and signing its first AWS contract last month for $38 billion in cloud capacity.

This move could redefine Amazon’s competitive posture in the cloud wars, supercharge demand for its custom AI infrastructure, and reshape expectations for future earnings.

[TITLE]Backlash to boom: Why brands are betting big on generative AI ads:
[TEXT]
Mumbai: In early December, fast-food chain McDonald’s released a Christmas Special advertisement, just like many brands do during this time of the year. While most brands seek to evoke warm, festive cheer among their target customers, the Big Mac maker made an unconventional choice.

McDonald’s Netherlands released a fully artificial intelligence (AI)-made advertisement titled “It’s the Most Terrible Time of the Year," a play on the classic Christmas carol. The commercial uses quick cuts to show people struggling with holiday chores—putting up a Christmas tree, baking festive goodies and rushing to finish their shopping.

With the help of AI, the McDonald’s ad shows darkly comic mishaps, from a furious Santa stuck in traffic to a woman carrying gifts trapped in tram doors, and burnt Christmas cookies that grimace and sing.

In the end, McDonald’s urges viewers to skip the stress of a traditional Christmas and find comfort at the nearest outlet.

However, the ad was severely panned, not only for apparently mocking the spirit of Christmas, but also for its use of AI, which many felt made it tacky, joyless and steeped in an “uncanny valley" feel.

Other brands including Coca-Cola and Toys“R"Us have also taken down their made-with-AI ads recently following similar backlash.

Yet, experiments with making ads and even full-length entertainment content using generative AI (GenAI) are here to stay. In India, homegrown brands are already experimenting with GenAI ads while GenAI startups attract early stage funding, Mint had previously reported. Now, even mainstream brands and agencies are embracing generative AI, not just for small social-media tasks, but for full-scale marketing campaigns as well.

But what can GenAI really do to elevate advertising? And will big brands embracing it really help advertisers, and more importantly, their target customers?

Future-proof

“A year ago, I saw the opportunity and said to myself, ‘Boss, this business is going to boom.’ Unions, employees, anybody likes it or doesn’t like it, this is the future," veteran adman Sandeep Goyal told Mint in an interview. Earlier this year, his ad agency Rediffusion launched Artificial Intelligence Labs, pitched to be a creative studio dedicated to creative services using GenAI.

In the last 12 months, this lab has produced more than 250 video advertisements, 30-40 of which have also run on television. For now, the lab is at a ₹10-12 crore run rate, and Goyal expects to scale this up to a whopping ₹100 crore in annual turnover in one year as he expands his GenAI client list and raises money to create a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform.

“Right now we have used 40-45 different [AI] softwares," Goyal said. “Every part of the film has work done by a different piece of software. But our creative operating systems—which are LLMs (large language models) from different softwares—are all coming together to learn on my creative worlds. This becomes a community of knowledge. On top of this ‘creative OS,’ one year from now, I will launch a SaaS platform. I will license it out to clients who can use it for basic tasks such as creatives for ‘Happy Diwali.’ These will be 10 times better than what any agency will make."

Other homegrown organizations are also working on creating similar service platforms. For instance, talent management and content firm Collective Artists Network is working on a ‘repository’ of GenAI visuals that are tailored to Indian sensibilities and visuals, founder and group chief exectuive officer Vijay Subramaniam told Mint in an earlier interview. Singapore-based Clairva AI, founded by former Balaji executive Sunil Nair, has also been working on refining how ‘Indianized’ photos and videos look when generated with AI, Nair had told Mint in an earlier interview. Clairva’s clients include e-commerce platform Tata Cliq.

Besides, large ad agency networks have also invested in rolling out AI tools, although those tend to deal with back-end marketing work rather than generative AI for creative services; UK-based Big Four network WPP’s Open is one such example.

“It takes a long time to explain the machine to understand what is brown skin, black eyes and black hair," Goyal said, recounting the challenges of working with AI tools trained on western models. “It is easy for the machine to understand what pasta is. But what is poha? Or a mekhela sari? That is difficult for a machine to understand."

Brands experiment

Challenges notwithstanding, brands are floating generative AI creatives even in mainstream campaigns. In fact, some are instituting in-house creative roles dedicated to experimenting with AI. One such brand is the Bengaluru-based insurance-tech firm Acko. Nine months ago, the company posted a vacancy for an AI Creative Lead.

“AI today is not just a production tool for us—it’s becoming a thinking partner," Acko’s chief marketing officer Ashish Mishra told Mint. “Across the team, AI helps generate video and visual concepts, but more importantly, it sharpens our creative decision-making. For many briefs, we use AI to generate multiple creative routes early in the process. This allows us to explore a wider solution space, identify stronger directions faster, and get internal alignment without going through multiple rounds of subjective debate."

View Full Image McDonald’s Netherlands released a fully artificial intelligence (AI)-made advertisement titled “It’s the Most Terrible Time of the Year,” a play on the classic Christmas carol.

Acko has been experimenting with short GenAI ads to explain and showcase the company’s various insurance offerings using tools such as Nano Banana, Veo and Eleven Labs.

But bigger brands are testing the waters, too. Goyal’s AI creative services venture, for instance, created ads for Nerolac Paints featuring long lines of (GenAI) penguins and polar bears. Not only are such ads made in a fraction of the time otherwise taken to shoot a film, they also cost 8-10x less than using computer-generated imagery (CGI) or other older technologies for special effects. Besides, even CGI will find it hard to produce a good-looking polar bear relaxing inside the home of a Nerolac Paints’ customer. Other brands in his generative AI roster include Dabur and Tata Consumer.

While generative AI’s biggest attraction is lower cost and turnaround times, the bigger creative advantage may be a brand’s (or agency’s) ability to generate visuals that are otherwise impossible to do in real life, or too expensive with other, older technologies. Does this mean an ad is more likely to grab customers’ fleeting attention if they know it is made with AI?

“I don’t think it makes a difference, and in fact telling a viewer that an ad is generated with AI creates a bias," Goyal said. “The viewer will start looking for faults in the ad or detract him from watching it. We don’t make a fuss about our clients’ ads being made with AI."

For now, brands say the best use case of AI is not novelty, but how efficiently it can become a “thinking partner" for marketing teams.

“The biggest advantage is speed and autonomy," Acko’s Mishra said. “When AI capability sits within the team, experimentation becomes frictionless. The team can test, learn and refine ideas in real time. It also dramatically reduces the cost of exploration. We can prototype ten ideas for the cost of one traditional agency output, which fundamentally changes how bold we can be."
