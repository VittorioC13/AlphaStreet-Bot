[TITLE]Blum Holdings, Inc. Announces Closing of Acquisition of High-Volume Bay Area Cannabis Retail Dispensary:
[TEXT]
DOWNEY, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blum Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: BLMH) (the “Company,” “Blüm,” “Blüm Holdings,” “we” or “us”), a California-based publicly traded holding company, today announced the successful closing of its acquisition of a high-volume Bay Area cannabis retail dispensary through the purchase of all outstanding equity of the operating entity.

The acquired dispensary is a well-established, fully licensed retail operator located in a major Northern California market and has generated approximately $12.0 million in annual revenue with a long operating history and strong local customer base. The transaction further expands Blüm’s Northern California footprint.

“This acquisition reflects our continued focus on disciplined, opportunistic growth,” said Sabas Carrillo, Chief Executive Officer of Blüm Holdings. “We are acquiring durable retail assets with real revenue, real customers, and meaningful operating history, positioning the Company to benefit from both improved execution at the asset level and broader structural tailwinds impacting the U.S. cannabis industry.”

The transaction was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement and included a combination of cash and equity consideration. The Company noted that all required closing conditions have been satisfied.

Carrillo added, “As the regulatory backdrop continues to evolve at the federal level, including ongoing discussions around potential reclassification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act, we believe scaled, compliant retail operators are well positioned to benefit from broader market development.”

[TITLE]Bain Capital Real Estate, 11North Partners Close $1.6B Raise for Retail Real Estate – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners, a real estate investment firm, have secured $1.6 billion in new capital commitments for a joint venture operating platform that specializes in acquiring grocery-anchored, open-air retail centers.

The two investment firms formed the platform in April 2024 with the intention of creating a portfolio of open-air retail centers across different markets that are all supported by the shared tailwinds of population growth and income growth. The platform purchases both single assets and large portfolios of retail centers using investor capital.

The $1.6 billion capital raise is largely funded by two unnamed institutional investors, who Brian Harper, founder and managing partner of 11North, described in prepared remarks as “two of the largest and most respected investors in the world.”

“Our shared vision with Bain Capital was to build a platform that could thoughtfully invest across both core-plus and value-add opportunities,” said Harper. “This first capital raise delivers on that vision and positions us to scale with discipline.”

Altogether, by sourcing additional capital from a Bain Capital Real Estate Fund III, the open-air retail center platform managed by the joint venture has more than $2 billion of investable equity to play with going into 2026.

“[This retail platform] reflects how we invest across Bain Capital Real Estate — thematically, with advantage, and with discipline in partnership with aligned operators who bring deep domain expertise,” said Ryan Cotton, head of Bain Capital Real Estate.

Deals the joint partnership has executed in recent months include a $395 million acquisition of 10 assets across Florida and South Carolina in August 2025 and the purchase of three retail centers in Oklahoma City — Nichols Hills Plaza, The Triangle at Classen Curve and Classen Curve — for $212 million in June 2025.

Martha Kelley, managing director at Bain Capital Real Estate, said in a statement that the two firms are mutually attracted to “durable sector trends” in open-air retail, notable strong sales metrics, new consumer shopping patterns, and the rise of online omnichannel shopping, which includes buying online and picking up at a store.

“These dynamics create a supportive environment for necessity-based centers in strong, accessible locations,” said Kelley. “With the right partnership in place, we believe we are well positioned to continue assembling a best-in-class portfolio that delivers lasting value for our investors.”

CORRECTIONS: This article was updated to reflect that this was a capital raise for the firms’ retail-focused operating platform and not a distinct fund. Also, Bain Capital Real Estate Fund III is a current fund and not yet closed.

New Delhi | Mumbai: India’s consumer goods and auto majors are stepping up fresh investments in manufacturing over the next two years, betting on sustained demand growth as the impact of the goods and services tax (GST) reforms begins to show and commodity prices remain under control.FMCG firms such as Nestle Reliance Consumer Products, JHS Svendgaard , DFM Foods and Haldiram’s are set to invest at least Rs 5,000 crore in new manufacturing capacity, betting on a robust demand pick-up next year, industry insiders said.Automakers Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai Motor, Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have also lined up combined capital expenditure of Rs 1.77 lakh crore through 2029–30, with most of them announcing the investments before the GST revision.“Nestle India sees 2026 as ‘a year of volume growth, with higher capacity expansion and a new greenfield plant, GST benefits and commodities stabilising,’” its chairman and managing director Manish Tiwary said.The India unit of the Swiss packaged foods maker is in the process of setting up its tenth factory in Odisha for Rs 900 crore, and is looking to accelerate investments in both greenfield and brownfield plants.India is now Nestle’s largest market globally for Maggi instant noodles and second-largest for KitKat chocolates.New Delhi had announced slashing of GST rates across daily-use goods and discretionary products such as cars, televisions and air conditioners, effective September 22, to spur consumption. While GST on butter, cheese, confectionery and salty snacks has been cut to 5% from 12%, that on chocolates, biscuits, corn flakes, coffee, ice cream, bottled water, hair oil, shampoo, soaps, shaving cream and toothpaste has been slashed to 5% from 18%.Listed oral care maker JHS Svendgaard, which manufactures for HUL and Walmart as well as its own oral care brands Aquawhite and Dr. Gold, is investing Rs 25 crore on a new plant in Kala Amb, Himachal Pradesh.“This is a demand-driven and customer-focused investment; we are aligning our capabilities with global demand,” Nikhil Nanda, founder and managing director of JHS Svendgaard, said.The plant, expected to be fully operational by 2027, will create 600 new jobs, he said.Executives expressed optimism for demand pick-up across categories, and the investment push in manufacturing signals India Inc is betting on sustained consumption growth rather than short-term spikes.Private equity firm Advent International-backed DFM Foods, which makes Crax packaged snacks and competes directly with PepsiCo and ITC , has lined up an investment of over Rs 100 crore over the next 12 months.“We are investing significantly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and adding capacity, on the back of continued demand increase and expected buoyancy over the next couple of years, with GST benefits,” said Vipul Prakash, chief executive officer of DFM Foods.He said capacity is expected to go up by about 60% within the next 12 months and will lead to a footprint of 13 self-owned and co-packing plants, up from eight currently.The carmakers cited above will deploy capex in launching petrol, diesel, CNG, hybrid and EV models, ramping up capacities for domestic and export markets, and in undertaking research and development projects, company executives said. They did not give a break-up of the capex lined up for each year.Except Korean firm Hyundai, all the other automakers had announced their capex before the GST rate revision. Eight out of every ten cars sold in India belong to these manufacturers.Starting mid-2024, consumer demand in cities slowed down as surging costs of food and fuel impacted offtake and competition from regional and digital-first brands intensified.

[TITLE]U.S. says inflation slowed last month but data may be distorted and Americans aren’t feeling it:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON (AP) — At a time when Americans are frustrated and angry over the high cost of living, the government released a report Thursday showing that inflation had cooled unexpectedly in November.

But economists quickly warned that that last month’s numbers were suspect because they’d been delayed and likely distorted by the 43-day federal shutdown. And most Americans have not felt any let up in the high prices they are paying for food, insurance, utilities and other basic necessities.

The Labor Department reported Thursday that its consumer price index rose 2.7% in November from a year earlier. Yet, year-over-year inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Americans, dismayed by high prices, handed big victories to Democrats in local and state elections last month.

The inflation report was delayed eight days by the shutdown, which also prevented the Labor Department from compiling overall numbers for consumer prices and core inflation in October and disrupted the usual data-collecting process. Thursday’s report gave investors, businesses and policymakers their first look at CPI since the September numbers were released on Oct. 24.

Consumer prices had risen 3% in September from a year earlier, and forecasters had expected the November CPI to match that year-over-year increase.

“It’s likely a bit distorted,’’ said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm KPMG. “The good news is that it’s cooling. We’ll take a win when we can get it.’’

Still, Swonk added: “The data is truncated, and we just don’t know how much of it to trust.’’ By disrupting the economy – especially government contracting – the shutdown may have contributed to a cooling in prices, she said.

Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, warned that the November numbers were “noisy … The canceling of the October report makes month-on-month comparisons impossible, for example, while the truncated information-gathering process given the shutdown could have caused systematic biases in the data.”

Many economists don’t expect to get a reliable read on inflation until next month when the Labor Department releases CPI numbers for December.

Energy prices, driven up by sharply higher fuel oil prices, rose 4.2% in November. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose 2.6%, compared with a 3% year-over-year gain in September and the lowest since March 2021.

U.S. inflation remains stubbornly high, partly because of President Donald Trump’s decision to impose double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country on earth along with targeted tariffs on specific products like steel, aluminum and autos.

The president’s tariffs have so far proved less inflationary than economists feared. But they do put upward pressure on prices and complicate matters at the Fed, which is trying to decide whether to keep cutting its benchmark interest rate to support a sputtering job market or whether to hold off until inflationary pressures ease. The central bank last week decided to reduce the rate for the third time this year, but Fed officials signaled that they expect just one cut in 2026.

“The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,” said Haigh at Goldman Sachs.

Trump delivered a politically charged speech Wednesday that aired live during prime time on network television, seeking to pin the blame for economic challenges on Democrats.

The speech was a rehash of his recent messaging that has so far been unable to calm public anxiety

[TITLE]Inflation Cools Overall But Consumers Stay Value-Driven:
[TEXT]
Wage growth recently outpaced inflation, offering short-term relief that has yet to translate into sustained financial security.

Inflation is easing overall, but consumers are still paying more for food, beverages and everyday retail goods.

After weeks of a government shutdown, economic data continue to roll in, and the latest inflation figures sketch a picture that is far from definitive.

In a nutshell, and per Bureau of Labor Statistics data from Thursday (Dec. 18), price growth is cooling overall but leaving consumers still contending with higher costs for everyday essentials.

For households, the read-across is nuanced. Slowing inflation does not feel like falling prices, and for many consumers, budgets remain under pressure, as PYMNTS Intelligence has found. That disconnect is shaping spending decisions, payment choices and brand loyalty.

Headline Inflation Shows Signs of Cooling

The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7% year over year in November, signaling that inflation has continued to decelerate from earlier highs, as seen in the accompanying chart.

Measures that strip out more volatile components also showed moderation, pointing to broader cooling rather than isolated declines. Still, for consumers, inflation remains a lived experience measured less by percentages and more by grocery receipts and retail prices.

Food and Beverages Keep Budgets Tight

Food and beverage prices rose 2.6% over the past 12 months, continuing to weigh on household budgets. Food at home increased 1.9%, with meats, poultry, fish and eggs up 4.7%, even as egg prices fell sharply, underscoring uneven relief within the same category.

Dairy prices declined 1.6% and fruit and vegetable prices were nearly flat, but those modest offsets did little to change the overall perception that grocery shopping remains more expensive.

Food away from home rose 3.7%, reinforcing why dining out remains a discretionary choice many households are limiting, as recent earnings reports from the likes of McDonald’s and others have shown.

Retail Prices Reinforce Cautious Spending

Retail categories tell a similar story. Furniture and bedding prices rose 3% year over year, while motor vehicle parts and equipment increased 2.6%, keeping replacement and maintenance costs elevated. Appliances and apparel posted marginal increases of 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, while sporting goods declined slightly, extending a long stretch without annual price increases.

Value-Driven Consumers Redefine Spending Behavior

This pricing landscape helps explain why consumers remain firmly value-driven. Spending decisions are becoming more deliberate. Consumers are prioritizing essentials, scrutinizing price differences across channels and increasingly choosing where and how to pay based on perceived value.

The persistence of value-driven behavior is reinforced by savings data from the PYMNTS Intelligence Paycheck-to-Paycheck reports. Savings rates remain thin, leaving many households without meaningful buffers even as inflation cools. For these consumers, slower price growth does not translate into financial comfort, at least for the moment.

Our recent surveys indicate that that among struggling households more than 1 in 3 consumers (34%) who live paycheck to paycheck but struggle to pay their bills report spending more than usual in the past six months, which in turn has impacted savings.

As reported here, the cost of food has been a key stressor cited by 56% of consumers queried by PYMNTS Intelligence. “Additionally, 55% say the same of inflation, and 23% say rising costs are their greatest source of financial stress,” per that report.

Taken together, the latest inflation data suggest momentum in the right direction, but consumer behavior tells a more restrained story.

[TITLE]Declining Children’s Shoe Prices Help to Cool Rising Footwear Costs in November:
[TEXT]
Shoe prices dipped slightly in November as overall inflation was slightly lower than expectations, according to the latest data from the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA).

After recently rising the fastest in months, retail paused their streak of gains in November, sliding a modest 0.1 percent year-over-year, the FDRA noted.

Prices for children’s footwear were the catalyst behind lower in this latest month, falling 3.4 percent from 12 months earlier, the steepest drop since February 2021. In fact, excluding children’s footwear prices, total retail footwear prices would have risen for the fifth straight month in November, FDRA added.

Gary Raines, chief economist at FDRA, told FN that the latest modest dip in footwear prices is “likely to be fleeting” given that average landed costs and average duties per pair on footwear imports continue to climb, with both rising year-over-year for at least the last seven months.

Nate Herman, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA), added that the industry “worked to blunt the worst” tariff-driven price impacts through strong holiday promotions and by drawing down inventory that was strategically shipped during summer tariff pauses, and before “Liberation Day” at the beginning of the year.

“While these steps helped soften some of the impact on holiday shoppers, they will not be sustainable continuing into 2026,” Herman said. “Footwear is particularly vulnerable to tariff-driven price increases. It is also one of the categories replicated by counterfeiters who will skirt the tariffs altogether. AAFA is actively advocating for measures to protect brands and consumers in these segments, particularly as a more price-sensitive environment in 2026 could increase the risk of unsafe counterfeit products entering the market.”

Last month’s increase in retail footwear prices also comes at the same time the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that overall consumer prices rose less than expected in November. (Some observers speculated that the government shutdown impacted data, since it was measured later in November during Black Friday sales.)

According to the delayed release of the bureau’s latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, retail inflation rose 2.7 percent in November from a year earlier.

The report also saw prices increase 0.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis over the two months ending in November. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the core CPI rose 0.2 percent in November and increased 2.6 percent over the same time last year.

The bureau did not collect survey data for October 2025 due to a lapse in appropriations as a result of the 43-day government shutdown.

NEW YORK, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced that Apollo-managed funds (the “Apollo Funds”) have agreed to acquire a majority stake in Prosol Group (“Prosol” or the “Company”), the multi-specialist in fresh food businesses and food retail in France, from Ardian.

[TITLE]Capital One Lounge DFW: Grab n Go Now On Request, Hot Food Weaker — Maintenance Cited:
[TEXT]
Has the food at the Capital One lounge at DFW decline a lot? I’ve noticed on several visits that the food isn’t as good as it was when they first opened. And across lounges I’ve seen strategies to cut back on grab ‘n go as well.

There doesn’t seem to be as much as there used to be. At the outset they had these large bags – which just served to encourage guests to fill the bags. Their most recent lounge, JFK, has staff getting guests the food items – this discourages anyone that experiences shame from asking for scores of items. My most recent visit to DFW had less than ever before. The hot items were also pretty mid.

Irregular operations meant that I had nearly a 2.5 hour connection at the Dallas A gates.

My Austin to Dallas flight was delayed, and I was going to misconnect.

So I first got backed up both on a later Austin – Dallas flight and a later connecting flight. And then I confirmed the later connection.

All that was available was a non-extra legroom middle seat in economy and I took it. Fortunately the guy next to me at the aisle got an upgrade after boarding, and nobody was brought on to replace him even though the flight was full. So I shifted over to the window and had an empty middle. That made for a perfectly fine flight, even though it’s still a tight space for working on my laptop.

In the air I checked the wait time for the Capital One lounge and it surprisingly said just ‘5-10 minutes’. So I didn’t join the wait list then. Instead, I waited until I landed and joined through the app as I walked off the aircraft – for both the American Express lounge and for the Capital One lounge (and figured if both took a long time I’d use my Royal Jordanian status for American’s Flagship lounge). I headed over to the D concourse.

Capital One came back in one minute . I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case.

. I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case. American Express took 27 minutes. I didn’t remove myself from the list because they don’t give you a wait time estimate, and I wanted to compare how long it would take (plus I considered that I might want to switch for variety’s sake0.

When I checked in at Capital One, the woman at the desk seemed a bit bored, and was terse in checking me in. In the past, large tables were reserved for larger parties, but that didn’t seem to be the case today and staff weren’t proactively seating people as I’d seen in the past.

The only open spot in the lounge was a larger table that hadn’t been cleared. I took it, but I felt badly, because I was solo and it could have accommodated a party of four. I needed to use the bathroom but there was an 8-person deep line for that, so I waited and managed to return once the line had dwindled.

What was striking, though, was the food service on this visit.

The grab ‘n go section was closed.

Grab ‘n go items replaced at least half the hot food.

Pastries were simpler.

The ice machine by the self-serve soda was gone.

A sppkesperson shared,

We are working to resolve a small temporary maintenance issue at our grab-and-go station. During this time, some of those offerings have been temporarily relocated to the hot food service area however the entire grab and go menu is available upon request. This is not our standard operating procedure, and we anticipate the station will be operational soon.

I was there for a pass by the ‘rituals cart’ which in this case was jasmine tea and a macaron cookie. It seems like the cookie might have been a bit more nicely presented than in a shrink-wrapped package? And maybe some options for teas? Still, having some personal service rather than just buffet is a really nice experience.

National airport’s ‘Landing’ which is really a complimentary sit-down restaurant remains my favorite in the Capital One portfolio. JFK is the best lounge – based on size, experiences and offerings. DFW was first, and is now four years old. Recent visits haven’t been as good as earlier ones, and like Denver it is frequently very very busy. I want to see it getting a little love.

[TITLE]Will Money Talk? Elliott Takes $1 Billion Stake in Lululemon, Pushes for Ralph Lauren Exec to Be Next CEO:
[TEXT]
Lululemon Athletica founder Chip Wilson has been agitating for change, and the outspoken critic now has activist investor Elliott Investment Management weighing in on a potential chief executive officer candidate.

The activist is in a position to make moves, and with a stake reportedly valued at more than $1 billion, Elliott’s input might have more sway with the Lululemon board than that of Wilson. And with Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald planning to step down on Jan. 31, the timing seems perfect for the activist to exert some pressure for the slumping yoga-inspired athletic brand.

The Wall Street Journal first reported that Elliott has been working with Jane Nielsen as a potential CEO candidate. Nielsen is a seasoned executive with a good reputation among the Wall Street crowd. A former chief financial officer at Tapestry Inc., she left in 2016 to join Ralph Lauren Corp. as its CFO and chief operating officer. Nielsen left the company this past April. That was

[TITLE]Elliott Management amasses $1B stake in Lululemon as battle for new CEO heats up:
[TEXT]
Activist investor Elliott Management amassed a $1 billion stake in Lululemon Athletica as the battle for a new CEO of the yoga retailer heats up, according to a report.

A week after Lululemon’s chief executive Calvin McDonald announced that he’s stepping down in January, at least two major investors in the Vancouver-based company are angling to install new leadership at the struggling athleisure company.

4 After seven years as CEO of Lululemon Calvin McDonald is stepping down in January. REUTERS

West Palm Beach, Fla.-based Elliott Management is working closely with former Ralph Lauren executive Jane Nielsen, who the hedge fund sees as a leading candidate to reverse Lululemon’s decline, sources told The Post.

The hedge fund has been working with Nielsen for months and its investment was not tied to McDonald’s resignation announcement last week, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.

Meanwhile, Lululemon’s founder and former CEO and one of its largest shareholders, Chip Wilson, said last week that he wants new, independent directors to lead the CEO search.

“The board has failed to properly hold management accountable to deliver product innovation and instead has led with complacency,” Wilson said in a statement last week.

Lululemon’s sharess rose by more than 10% after McDonald announced his resignation.

On Thursday they were up 8% on news of the Elliott stake.

Nielsen was Ralph Lauren’s chief financial officer from 2016 to 2019 when she became the chief operating officer and stepped down earlier this year.

Elliott Management did not immediately comment on its stake in Lululemon.

“Lululemon is one of the most powerful brands in retail, defined by exceptional products, deeply engaged communities and significant global potential,” Nielsen said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. “I would welcome the chance to discuss this opportunity with the Lululemon board.”

Lululemon’s fortunes have tumbled this year as newer competitors grab marketshare and management made a series of missteps, including introducing brightly colored fashions that have not sold well and landed on clearance racks.

Wilson has said the company lost its “cool” factor. Known for rarely discounting, the company has had to move more merchandise than ever before to clearance racks.

After seven years at the helm, McDonald will remain with the company as an advisor until March.

The company’s chief financial officer, Meghan Frank, who will serve as interim co-CEO, said on an earnings call last week, “We’ve let product lifecycles run too long within some of our key franchises and we have not inspired our high-value guests to purchase as we had in the past.”

Lululemon’s total sales in the most recent quarter ended Nov. 2 rose by 7% to $2.6 billion – fueled by growth in China and elsewhere abroad – but its sales in North America were down 2%.

Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in Lululemon Athletica and is bringing a potential CEO candidate to the table, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.

Lululemon's stock rose 6% in early trading Thursday.

Last week, Lululemon announced CEO Calvin McDonald would step down effective Jan. 31, following a year-long performance slump for Lululemon.

Elliott has been working with former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as a potential candidate, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity

[TITLE]TikTok U.S. Sale to Oracle-Led Group Set to Close in January:
[TEXT]
TikTok has agreed to sell its U.S. operations to an investment group that includes Oracle, Silver Lake, and UAE-based company MGX, reports Axios. The "TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC" that includes the three companies will own 45 percent of TikTok, while ByteDance will keep close to 20 percent. Existing investors will continue to hold the remaining shares.

The U.S. group will handle U.S. data protection and content moderation, while also maintaining algorithm security. It has been tasked with retraining the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to "ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation." Oracle will be in charge of auditing and validating compliance with National Security Terms.

The agreement states that the USDS Joint Venture will "operate as an independent entity" that has authority over U.S. data protection, while TikTok's global U.S. entities will manage global product interoperability along with e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.

With the sale, TikTok will be able to continue operating in the United States while complying with the 2024 Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. The act required TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to a non-Chinese company or be banned from operating in the United States.

TikTok was briefly banned in January, but Donald Trump signed an executive order granting an extension that brought it back. The ban has been extended multiple times since then to provide additional time for a deal to be established. The agreement is set to go into effect on January 22.

[TITLE]Lembrih Marketplace enters e-commerce with a mission to empower Black and African vendors:

Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.

As the global e-commerce market continues to expand, a growing number of consumers are seeking platforms that align with their values. Ethical shopping, conscious consumerism, and support for Black-owned businesses are no longer niche interests. They are shaping how people choose where to spend their money.

Lembrih Marketplace is positioning itself at the intersection of those shifts.

Founded by Ghanaian entrepreneur Latifa Seini, Lembrih Marketplace is a mission-first e-commerce platform designed to support Black and African vendors who have historically struggled to gain visibility on mainstream marketplaces.

Seini’s inspiration came from firsthand experience. Before launching Lembrih, she ran Flaunt Ankara, an African print business that connected her with customers across borders. While demand existed, growth was constrained by high seller fees, limited discoverability, and platforms that were not designed with culturally rich brands in mind.

Those challenges are not unique. Many small-batch creators and artisans face similar barriers when attempting to scale their businesses globally.

Lembrih addresses these issues with a vendor-first pricing model. Sellers receive 30 days commission-free, followed by a choice between a $10 monthly subscription plus 10 percent commission or a 15 percent commission with no subscription. According to Seini, the goal is to lower the financial barrier to entry while allowing vendors to retain more of their earnings.

Beyond pricing, Lembrih integrates social impact into every transaction. The platform donates $1 from each purchase to charitable causes, reinforcing its commitment to community uplift and ethical commerce.

The name “Lembrih,” meaning “black” in the Gonja language of Ghana, reflects the platform’s cultural foundation and its focus on amplifying underrepresented voices in e-commerce.

Seini’s professional background also informs the platform’s development. Working in IT training and enablement, she has led leadership programs and initiatives focused on the future of AI and workforce development. That experience shapes Lembrih’s scalable infrastructure and long-term vision.

The marketplace is currently in its Kickstarter pre-launch phase, with the campaign aimed at funding final development, onboarding vendors, and expanding brand awareness ahead of its official launch.

Supporters include conscious consumers, creatives, and advocates for Black-owned business platforms who are seeking alternatives to traditional e-commerce models.

As consumer behavior continues to evolve, Lembrih Marketplace represents a growing movement toward commerce that prioritizes fairness, culture, and impact alongside profitability.

[TITLE]To see where Macy’s is going, head to Chicago:
[TEXT]

A breakthrough at Macy’s – in the midst of its second turnaround project in five years – is evident at its Chicago flagship for the first time in well over a decade, Evercore ISI analysts led by Michael Binetti said in a Wednesday client note.

“Our team has hosted tours in the State Street store for 15 years and, in our opinion, the changes the company is making today are driving more positive progress than any point we can remember over those 15 years,” Binetti said.

Improvements in merchandise and customer service were apparent, according to the report, which detailed a visit by analysts and investors accompanied by Macy’s Inc. Head of Investor Relations Pam Quintiliano.

In merchandising, that included the assortment as well as signage. The store contained “a balanced combination of core brands the retailer is known for, trending brands, younger brands, and even some higher-end brands that may not have fit in the stores of the past,” Binetti said. Visual upgrades “go well beyond new flooring and lighting” and brands like Ralph Lauren have participated in elevating their presentations.

Small changes are making a difference, too, with analysts spotting hangers “spaced at least two inches apart (giving the store a more polished feel).” They also noted that associates are better-trained.

“This is a very detailed merchandising strategy and a noticeable update from the way stores have been over-merchandised and non-premium feeling over the last decade,” Binetti said.

These are probably welcome changes to the many Chicagoans who remain resentful of Macy’s takeover — and makeover — of Marshall Field’s, which built the flagship in the late 19th century. Meanwhile, the surrounding area, known as the Loop, is also making headway in its own recovery, after a low point during and after the pandemic. Office space is filling back up, restaurants and stores are opening and foot traffic is on the rise, according to a Q3 report from the Chicago Loop Alliance.

Macy’s customers, in this city and elsewhere, are also set to benefit this holiday season from a distribution center in North Carolina that opened during the third quarter, according to the Evercore analysts. Macy’s has a later e-commerce deadline this year than many of its competitors, in part thanks to the new facility, they said.

Macy’s State Street location is a bellwether for the department store’s trajectory, according to Evercore. Not least, the merchandising has advanced to the point where brands, which a few years ago were exiting Macy’s, are again interested in a partnership. Nike is just one example.

“In other words, there’s a flywheel effect taking place where Macy’s initiatives are compounding traffic and bringing in better brands — which can build on itself if nurtured properly,” Binetti said.
