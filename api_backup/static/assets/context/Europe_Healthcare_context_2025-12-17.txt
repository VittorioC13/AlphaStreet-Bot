The Neuren Pharmaceuticals Ltd (ASX: NEU) share price is making headlines today after announcing US FDA approval for DAYBUE STIX, a new powder formulation of trofinetide for Rett syndrome. This milestone gives patients and caregivers more flexibility, and Neuren earns royalties from partner Acadia's net sales.

What did Neuren Pharmaceuticals report?

US FDA approved DAYBUE STIX (trofinetide) powder formulation for oral solution

DAYBUE and DAYBUE STIX are the only FDA-approved Rett syndrome treatments

Neuren receives royalties on all net sales of trofinetide

Acadia holds exclusive worldwide commercialisation licence for trofinetide

DAYBUE STIX expected to launch in the US from Q1 2026

What else do investors need to know?

The new DAYBUE STIX gives Rett syndrome patients a dye- and preservative-free powder, which can be mixed with drinks to improve taste and dosing flexibility. A bioequivalence study confirmed DAYBUE STIX matches the original oral solution in safety and efficacy, so doctors and patients can expect the same outcomes.

Neuren also holds potential for additional income through future commercial and development milestone payments, as outlined in its November 2025 investor presentation. Meanwhile, its second drug candidate, NNZ-2591, has shown positive results in Phase 2 trials for other neurological disorders.

What did Neuren Pharmaceuticals management say?

Neuren CEO Jon Pilcher said:

The Neuren team is excited about the approval of this new treatment option for Rett syndrome families and the continued investment and innovation for trofinetide by our global partner, Acadia. Caregivers can mix DAYBUE STIX with a variety of water-based liquids providing flexibility to modify the taste and volume of their loved-one's dose. We look forward to seeing the impact as DAYBUE STIX becomes more broadly available during 2026.

What's next for Neuren Pharmaceuticals?

Acadia plans to launch DAYBUE STIX in the US on a limited basis in the first quarter of 2026, expanding access from early in the second quarter. The powder formulation stands to boost convenience and potentially broaden uptake among Rett syndrome patients.

Looking ahead, Neuren continues to progress NNZ-2591 for several childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, all of which benefit from US and EU orphan drug designation. Milestone payments and royalties from DAYBUE offer Neuren ongoing revenue opportunities.

Neuren Pharmaceuticals share price snapshot

Over the past 12 months, Neuren Pharmaceuticals shares have climbed 43%, outperforming the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) which has risen 5% over the same period.

[TITLE]Biotech Bill Bundled in Pentagon Spending Plan May Worsen Pharma’s Patent Cliff Dilemma:
[TEXT]
Much like pharmaceutical packaging, the most important part of this story is in the fine print.

Last week, the US House overwhelmingly voted in favor of Congress’s mammoth annual defense policy bill, which would authorize $900 billion in military funding. Inside the omnibus package was the Biosecure Act, a piece of legislation targeting Chinese biotechs that could have unintended consequences.

Plugging the Gap

The next few years of projected revenues in the pharma space have more holes in them than industry CEOs’ favorite golf courses. Intelligence provider Evaluate forecasts $314 billion in sales will be impacted in the next five years by patent cliffs, industry jargon for when drugmakers lose exclusivity on their products. Take, for example, Merck’s Keytruda, the world’s best-selling cancer drug that made $29 billion last year, with a patent expiration in 2028. At the same time, years of investment in China, a non-factor in cutting-edge biotech a decade ago, have made the country a leading innovator. At 20%, China has the second-largest share of global drugs in development, according to Globaldata research, behind only the US at 40%.

As a result, Chinese partnerships have become an increasingly popular way for US and European pharma firms to replenish pipelines in advance of patent cliffs. In a survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) last year, 79% of biopharma companies reported at least one partnership or supplier relationship with a Chinese firm. Licensing agreements to bring Chinese therapies abroad are especially popular, with Pfizer, Novartis and AstraZeneca inking multibillion-dollar deals in a frenzied 2025. Naturally, this has been great for Chinese biotech stocks: The Hang Seng Biotech Index is up 69% this year, more than double the 32% rally on the main Hang Seng Index.

But the Biosecure Act, which is expected to pass in the Senate as part of the defense bill this week, could cloud the matter by allowing Washington to rule out deals with “companies of concern”:

The Biosecure Act failed last year when lawmakers and industry opposed the singling out of five Chinese companies — BGI Genomics, MGI Tech, WuXi Biologics, WuXi App Tec and Complete Genomics — because of the industry disruption that their exclusion would cause. WuXi App Tec, in particular, is a key provider of ingredients for cancer treatments.

The revised version of the bill leaves the selection of “companies of concern” to the discretion of the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget (BGI, a genetic testing company, is already on the list). Drugmakers working with “companies of concern” will also get five years to adjust their supply chains, although companies told BIO’s survey last year they’d likely need eight.

Buy Option: Pharma companies are also resorting to acquisitions ahead of patent cliffs: Johnson & Johnson spent $14.6 billion this year for neurological treatment maker Intra-Cellular Therapies, Merck spent $10 billion on respiratory treatment developer Verona, and Sanofi bought oncology specialist Blueprint Medicines for $9.5 billion.

[TITLE]Trinity Biotech Expands Global Rollout of High-Capacity Column System for FDA-Cleared HbA1c Testing Solution After Securing Regulatory Clearances:
[TEXT]
Company advances its mission to deliver next-generation diabetes management solutions and expand global market penetration

Next-generation column technology enhances efficiency, expands recurring revenue potential, and strengthens Trinity Biotech’s competitive position in the $2B+ HbA1c market

DUBLIN, Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trinity Biotech plc (Nasdaq: TRIB), a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on human diagnostics and diabetes management solutions, including wearable biosensors, today announced that it has secured regulatory clearances in multiple countries, enabling the expanded rollout of its next-generation high-capacity HbA1c column system for the Premier Hb9210 analyzer which is now available in more than 10 countries, including the United States. The upgraded system significantly increases testing throughput, improves operational efficiency, and supports greater recurring revenue opportunities and margin expansion as the company strengthens its leadership position in the growing global HbA1c market.

The global laboratory HbA1c market is estimated to be currently worth over $2 billion annually and is expected to grow to exceed $3.5 billion by 2030. This expected rise in the HbA1c market is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes1.

Designed for Trinity Biotech’s Premier Hb9210 analyzer, the company’s dedicated laboratory HbA1c solution, the upgraded column system delivers up to four times the testing capacity compared to the existing column system and minimizes instrument downtime through improved stability and reduced maintenance requirements. These operational gains create a more efficient workflow for clinical laboratories and support broader adoption of the platform.

Key Highlights:

Reduced downtime and improved operational efficiency, enabling higher throughput.

Increased column stability, minimizing maintenance interruptions and reducing operator workload.

The latest software update delivers additional automation of routine tasks enabling greater productivity and cost savings.

Trinity Biotech’s Premier Hb9210 solution continues to be recognized as a gold standard in HbA1c testing, with published peer-reviewed scientific comparative studies continuing to confirm the strong clinical performance of the company’s HbA1c analyzer system2. In addition, a recent article published by the Association for Diagnostics and Laboratory Medicine states “Still, BAC (Trinity Biotech) remains the method with the highest specificity for HbA1c currently on the market.”3

“Launching this advanced system in key markets, including the U.S., positions Trinity Biotech to capture further growth opportunities in the global diabetes care segment,” said John Gillard, CEO and President of Trinity Biotech. “The combination of higher capacity, reduced downtime, and automation creates a compelling value proposition for laboratories, and we expect strong adoption in key markets to drive long-term shareholder value.”

Trinity Biotech continues to work closely with customers and regulatory authorities to expand availability into additional countries, reinforcing its commitment to global market penetration and innovation in diabetes care.

[TITLE]Zenas BioPharma’s Partner, InnoCare Pharma, Announces Achievement of Primary Endpoint in Phase 2b Study of Orelabrutinib, a BTK Inhibitor, for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus:
[TEXT]
- Orelabrutinib is the first BTK inhibitor to demonstrate significant clinical activity in a Phase 2 clinical trial for SLE -

- Zenas acquired the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize orelabrutinib in the field of Multiple Sclerosis globally, and non-oncology fields in all territories outside Greater China and Southeast Asia, in October 2025 license agreement with InnoCare –

WALTHAM, Mass., Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zenas BioPharma, Inc. (“Zenas,” “Zenas BioPharma” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ZBIO), a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company committed to being a leader in the development and commercialization of transformative therapies for patients living with autoimmune diseases, today announced that its partner, InnoCare Pharma (HKEX: 09969; SSE: 688428), announced the achievement of the primary endpoint in a Phase 2b study of orelabrutinib, a potentially best-in-class, highly selective CNS-penetrant, oral, small molecule BTK inhibitor, in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). InnoCare also received approval from China’s Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) to conduct a Phase 3 registrational clinical trial as InnoCare develops orelabrutinib for the treatment of SLE in China.

In the Phase 2b study of orelabrutinib, a total of 187 patients were enrolled and randomized (1:1:1) into three groups: orelabrutinib 75 mg once-daily (QD), orelabrutinib 50 mg QD and placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was the SLE Response Index-4 (SRI-4) response rate at week 48. At week 48, the orelabrutinib 75 mg QD group achieved a statistically significant improvement in SRI-4 response rate compared with placebo (57.1% vs. 34.4%, p < 0.05), meeting the primary endpoint. Additionally, a dose-dependent improvement trend of the orelabrutinib 75 mg QD group compared to the 50 mg QD group was observed.

At week 48, the orelabrutinib 75 mg QD group demonstrated significantly higher SRI-6 and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response rates compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05), meeting these secondary endpoints.

Orelabrutinib was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with the mechanism of action of BTK inhibition and the underlying disease biology of SLE.

Results of a previous Phase 2a clinical trial of orelabrutinib for SLE were previously presented as a late breaking oral presentation at the European Union Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2022).

In October 2025, Zenas and InnoCare announced a transformational license agreement. Zenas acquired the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize orelabrutinib in the field of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) globally, and non-oncology fields in all territories outside Greater China and Southeast Asia, while InnoCare retained full global rights in the field of oncology. Zenas also gained the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize ZB021, an oral, IL-17AA/AF inhibitor in all territories outside Greater China and Southeast Asia, and ZB022, an oral, brain-penetrant, TYK2 inhibitor globally.
