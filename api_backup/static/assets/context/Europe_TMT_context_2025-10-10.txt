[TITLE]EU Ambassador to USA: E.U.-U.S. Relations Going the 'Right Direction':
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON — European Union Ambassador to the United States Jovita Neliupšienė told Breitbart News exclusively in a lengthy interview last week that relations between Europe and the United States are going the “right direction” under the leadership of U.S. President Donald Trump and E.U. Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen.

“I think that they are going the very right direction because we had a meeting of Commission President Von der Leyen and President Trump in Scotland, in D.C., and on the margins of the NATO summit as well,” Neliupšienė said in the interview at the headquarters of the Delegation of the European Union to the United States in downtown Washington last week. “So I think that it’s really pretty clear that there are a lot of issues to be discussed. We have the most developed trade and investment relations. We have security alliances working. And I think that we are closer value-based allies than you can find around the world.”

Part of the strength of the relationship between the two, Neliupšienė said, is that Trump seems to respect Von der Leyen’s ability to deliver what she promises.

“Well, I think that the idea that first of all the Commission president is the one responsible for implementing our trade policy,” Neliupšienė said when asked

[TITLE]Enterprise AI survey: ambition, the value gap, and the importance of open source:
[TEXT]
EMEA organizations are primed for widespread AI adoption, and see enterprise open source as an important success factor; however, their ability to scale is challenged by skills gaps, high costs and shadow AI. That’s the headline finding of our latest survey of over 900 IT leaders and AI engineers in nine countries1.

According to the survey AI is a core strategic priority for 72%2 of organizations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and they have plans to increase their AI investments by an average of 32% by 20263.

The focus on AI is clear, yet the data also reveals a stark gap between ambition and reality: only 7% of organisations report “driving customer value” at scale from their AI investments today4. This is a crucial challenge for leaders who need to translate significant investment into tangible business outcomes.

So what is preventing organisations moving from small-scale pilots to enterprise-wide value?

Tackling the barriers to scale AI

Our survey data outlines the extent of the talent shortage faced, with 70% of respondents agreeing there is an urgent AI skills gap3. The most significant gaps cited by those respondents are in the practical application of AI, such as connecting AI to enterprise data (49%), and making efficient use of AI capabilities (48%). Nearly as many (47%) report difficulty educating the business to use AI effectively, which complicates organisation-wide adoption.

As the role of AI in the workplace is established, another layer of complexity emerges. ‘Shadow AI’, the use of unsanctioned AI tools by employees, is becoming a significant challenge to effective governance and scalable adoption.

The vast majority of responding EMEA organisations (91%5) admit their organisation is experiencing a shadow AI problem. This should serve as a wake-up call: AI is being adopted with or without IT teams’ authorisation. This introduces new risks and underscores the need for internal education and guardrails, supported by platforms that are accessible, governed, and designed with users in mind.

The solution: a platform approach built on open source

Overcoming these barriers requires moving from a collection of fragmented tools to a unified platform strategy. IT leaders and AI developers in EMEA already recognise the path forward, as 92% agree that enterprise open source is important to their AI strategy6. An enterprise open source AI platform can offer the consistency and control needed to build, deploy, and manage AI across any hardware and any cloud.

Organisations need a governed environment where teams can access the tools they need to experiment and build with confidence. Rather than spinning up lots of different systems in departmental silos (the top rated barrier to AI adoption7), the use of an open source platform helps replicate success rather than reinvent the wheel. This approach allows IT to enable innovation, not block it, helping to fulfill a major AI priority for 75%2 of respondents: transparency and openness. Open source provides this transparency as well as increasing standardization, helping enterprises retain control over AI and data decision-making. This control and flexibility is also vital to provide AI sovereignty, which is a priority for 74%2 of respondents.

An enterprise open source platform like Red Hat OpenShift AI also helps address the skills gap. By providing data scientists and developers with common tools and streamlined MLOps and LLMOps workflows, it boosts productivity as well as allowing organisations to tap into the broad range of talent and innovation within the open source ecosystem. It also simplifies connecting models to enterprise data to help solve the integration challenges that are top of mind7. Meanwhile Red Hat AI Inference Server optimizes inference for faster, more cost-effective model deployments, which helps surmount the cost barrier cited by 29%7 of respondents.

By standardising on robust, open platforms, leaders can better control and govern AI, de-risk scale, and turn transparency into a competitive advantage.

From ambition to value

To close the AI value gap, organisations must match their ambition with an IT platform strategy that prioritises innovation, choice and scale – much as hybrid cloud platforms have borne out to be the most sustainable model for the cloud world. The path from pilot to production relies on the flexibility to adapt and the ability to scale when ready.

With a platform like Red Hat AI, EMEA enterprises have the foundation to do exactly that - scale and manage AI with confidence on their own terms.

[TITLE]AMD's deal with OpenAI gives Nvidia much-needed challenger in market it dominates:

In the 1990s, when Intel dominated the PC chip market, the semiconductor maker needed Advanced Micro Devices to exist as a viable No. 2 to help avoid being charged with monopolistic behavior. Almost three decades later, AMD may be serving a similar role for Nvidia , which controls over 90% of the market for graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence workloads. When AMD announced a deal on Monday that involves selling many billions of dollars worth of GPUs to OpenAI, it announced itself as a serious rival the can pick up share in the quickly growing market for AI chips, analysts said.

"Right now, Nvidia almost has a monopoly, with AMD having a low-single-digit share in the $250 billion market" for AI data center silicon, said Mandeep Singh, senior analyst at Bloomberg intelligence. Up to this point, Nvidia and OpenAI have defined the new era of AI. Nvidia's GPU sales have pushed the company's market cap to $4.5 trillion. OpenAI's private market valuation has climbed to $500 billion, driven by the popularity of ChatGPT and the company's hyper-aggressive plans for building out data centers. Nvidia is a significant investor in OpenAI, and last month agreed to pour up to $100 billion into the AI startup's infrastructure buildouts. While AMD is a very distant challenger, the stock has also been a Wall Street darling because of the company's promises in AI and expectations that its GPUs will be enthusiastically snapped up by customers. But until its announcement with OpenAI this week, AMD's rally has largely been built on hope. AMD's stock soared 24% on Monday, its biggest gain since 2002. It's up 89% this year compared to Nvidia's 40% gain.

watch now

Nvidia's control of the burgeoning market has been so vast that in September of last year, during the waning days of the Biden administration, the company was reportedly subpoenaed by the Justice Department, though it denied the report. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., sent a letter to the DOJ's antitrust unit at the time supporting a probe. The company's growth, she wrote, "has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation." Nvidia said at the time that it wins on merit. The deal OpenAI and AMD announced on Monday could change the competitive dynamic. The tie-up is expected to bring "double digit billions" in revenue to AMD starting in the second half of next year. OpenAI could also end up owning 10% of AMD if the stock hits price targets over a period of years. AMD CEO Lisa Su described the agreement as a "win-win" on a call with reporters, and said it's proof that her company's chips are fast enough and priced to compete with those from Nvidia. She described OpenAI's commitment as a "clear signal" that AMD's GPUs and software offer the performance and economic value "required for the most demanding at-scale deployments." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday that the OpenAI-AMD deal was "unique and surprising." "I'm surprised that they would give away 10% of the company before they even built it," Huang said.

"It's clever, I guess," Huang said. The pact also allows OpenAI to show that its contracts and investments with suppliers like Nvidia aren't exclusive, to avoid any potential antitrust ramifications. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on social media that any AMD chips would be "incremental" to its Nvidia purchases, and that the "world needs much more compute." "None of these things are, as far as I'm aware, exclusive contracts tying up avenues to other competitors," said Alden Abbott, senior research fellow at Mercatus Center and a former general counsel at the Federal Trade Commission. "I don't see any argument that in the near term that shows monopolization or cartelization of AI suppliers." Representatives from Nvidia, AMD and OpenAI declined to comment.

'Committed to build'

When it comes to Washington, D.C., regulators aren't the only concern. Those pressures have seemingly diminished this year under the Trump administration's DOJ. Rather, semiconductor investors are worried

[TITLE]WTO downgrades global trade growth forecast to 0.5% for next year:
[TEXT]
GENEVA: The World Trade Organization sharply lowered its 2026 forecast for global merchandise trade volume growth to 0.5 per cent on Tuesday (Oct 7), citing expected delayed impacts from US President Donald Trump's tariffs.

It marks a significant revision down from its previous estimate in August of 1.8 per cent growth.

"The outlook for next year is bleaker ... I am very concerned," Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told reporters in Geneva.

WORLD TRADING SYSTEM SHOWING RESILIENCE

However, she said the world trading system is showing resilience, with the rules-based multilateral system providing some stability amid trade turmoil.

For 2025, the WTO upgraded its forecast for global trade volume growth to 2.4 per cent, from 0.9 per cent previously, driven primarily by the front-loading of imports into the United States ahead of tariff hikes and growth in the trade of AI-related goods. It is still below the 2.8 per cent growth seen in 2024.

Trump's tariff decisions since he took office in January have shocked financial markets and sent a wave of uncertainty through the global economy.

On Aug 7, Trump imposed higher tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, leaving major trade partners like Switzerland, Brazil and India scrambling for a better deal, while the EU struck a deal that set duties at 15 per cent on most EU goods imported into the United States.

GROWTH IN 2025 BUT OUTLOOK GLOOMY FOR 2026

Overall, world merchandise trade volume growth is expected to slow from 2.8 per cent last year to 2.4 per cent this year and 0.5 per cent next year.

The WTO also forecasts global GDP growth to ease slightly from 2.7 per cent in 2025 to 2.6 per cent in 2026.

"Tariff measures are weighing on trade, even though front-loading and the suspension of many duty hikes between April and August have pushed their effects back into the latter part of this year, and especially into next year," Okonjo-Iweala said.

In the first half of 2025, world merchandise trade volume, measured by the average of exports and imports, increased by 4.9 per cent year-on-year, with trade value rising 6 per cent compared to 2 per cent growth in 2024, according to the WTO report.

Consequently, WTO economists upgraded their trade growth forecast for this year to 2.4 per cent, above April's prediction of a 0.2 per cent fall.

The rush of exporters to send goods, including machinery, motor vehicles, and lumber to the US before the tariff increases, alongside a surge in demand for AI-related products, contributed to this growth, the report found.

Trade in AI-linked goods such as semiconductors and telecommunications equipment accounted for nearly half of overall trade growth, rising 20 per cent year-on-year. Asia's export performance was particularly strong, the report said.

Asia and Africa are expected to see the fastest export volume growth this year, while Europe’s export growth will slow, and North America’s is set to decline. All regions are projected to experience weaker import performance in 2026.

[TITLE]Greenland’s leader urges EU to invest in its mineral resources and renewable energy:
[TEXT]
BRUSSELS (AP) — Greenland’s leader on Wednesday thanked the European Union for being “a trusted friend” and urged the 27-nation bloc to invest in his country’s mineral resources, renewable energy, airports and internet services.

In a speech to the European Parliament, Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that “2025 has been an eventful if not dramatic year for Greenland.” He noted the challenge posed by climate change but did not mention President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing the Arctic island.

“We need cooperation and partnerships with like-minded countries and institutions who share our values. The EU has been a stable, reliable and important partner for Greenland for more than 40 years,” the 34-year-old premier said in Strasbourg, France.

He extended “a heartfelt thank you” to the EU “for your strong support for Greenland during challenging times we are going through right now. You have stood by us as a friend and partner. We will never forget this.”

Greenland was a colony under Denmark’s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later, Greenland became a self-governing entity. It remains part of the Danish realm.

Denmark, which also currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, and Greenland have rejected Trump’s offers to buy the island. He hasn’t ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich territory.

When asked by a reporter before his speech about relations with the Trump administration, Nielsen said that U.S.-Greenland ties should be managed “in mutual respect, with respect for international law.”

“We seek to have more and better cooperation also with the U.S.A., when we can fulfill the respectful tone,” he said.

During the speech, Nielsen said that Greenland has most of the critical raw minerals that the EU is seeking, but that mining these resources is “capital intensive.” He also urged the bloc to invest in the untapped hydroelectricity potential provided by the island’s rivers and glaciers.

Nielsen also called for financial support to develop telecommunications networks, particularly in the poorly connected north, and to build two regional airports.

“It is essential for us that those who operate telecommunications in Greenland are trusted and reliable actors. This is vital to ensure the stability of the infrastructure, and to prevent unauthorized parties from disrupting and compromising connections,” he said.

Lawmakers gave Nielsen a standing ovation as he said “thank you for being a trusted friend of Greenland.”

[TITLE]What’s up with… Deutsche Telekom, 6G R&D, AMD and OpenAI:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Deutsche Telekom claims eSIM swap breakthrough in Europe and expands its lineup of smartphones with integrated AI; the Netherlands gets a National 6G Testbed; AMD becomes a “major AI player” as a result of its deal with OpenAI, reckons analyst; and much more!

Deutsche Telekom has announced what it claims to be a first for Europe: The ability for a network operator to transfer embedded SIM (eSIM) profiles between devices with different mobile operating systems, namely Android and Apple iOS. The operator noted that it has been offering eSIM transfer between iOS devices since 2020, and between Android devices since 2023. Now, it is also possible to switch between Android and iOS devices – and vice versa, it said. In this process, the existing profile is transferred, meaning that the phone number and tariff remain the same. Michael Hagspihl, VP of global strategic projects and marketing partnerships at Deutsche Telekom, said the aim is to make it “easier than ever for our customers to switch devices. Simple, flexible, and secure – that is our goal”. The service is initially available for iPhones with software version iOS 26 and Google Pixel 10 devices. More Android models will follow soon, according to the operator. While initially available in Germany, the service will also be provided in other Deutsche Telekom territories in future. The new function is based on the international GSMA specification TS.43, which defines the standardised procedure for service entitlement configuration on devices during activation or verification, and on the entitlement server developed by Deutsche Telekom. This server checks the authorisations, controls the secure process and enables Deutsche Telekom to react quickly to new functions and innovations. For more details, see this Deutsche Telekom announcement. The operator’s move is certainly timely as eSIMs are growing in significance, not least because Apple is phasing out physical SIM cards in favour of the digital versions in certain markets. For example, it released US-exclusive, eSIM-only iPhone 14 models in 2022, and has now launched the more widely available ultra-thin iPhone Air model that also only comes with eSIM. Given these developments, expectations are that the global market for devices supporting eSIM and related technologies is set for “hyper growth” from now until 2028. According to a 2024 report from Counterpoint Research, shipments will surpass 9 billion between 2024 and 2030.

Still with Deutsche Telekom… The German giant is also on a drive to make AI “accessible to everyone – not just tech nerds or enthusiasts”, and has been quick to expand its new lineup of smartphones with integrated AI from one to two, with a focus this time on a device with greater functionality as part of its “T Phone Pro” lineup. After unveiling the first AI-phone (the T Phone 3) in August, Deutsche Telekom has now announced that the AI-phone Pro (T Phone 3 Pro) will be available from 14 October in Germany, as well as Austria, Croatia, Czechia, Greece, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Sales will start in North Macedonia from 20 October and in Montenegro from 23 October. Although more expensive than the earlier device, the AI-phone Pro still retails at a relatively affordable (for a smartphone) €229 without subscription, although prices vary by country. Like the first device, it also integrates generative AI (GenAI) capabilities from AI tech partner Perplexity. The price includes permanent access to the Perplexity Assistant application and free access to the more advanced Perplexity Pro for 18 months from the date of purchase. In addition, customers are offered a 12-month Picsart Pro licence with 500 additional credits per month for the design of individual avatars and backgrounds. According to the operator, the Pro version generally offers “better hardware, extended functions and a strong eco rating” (88/100, apparently). Meanwhile, the companion AI-tablet device (the T Tablet 2) is still available, and is priced at €199 in Germany, for example. Deutsche Telekom has now been plugging these devices for going on for two years and showed off a prototype at this year’s MWC25 event in Barcelona in March. For more details, see this Deutsche Telekom announcement.

We are more than half way through the 5G decade, and operators and vendors are already furiously at work on the next generation of mobile technology, known to all and sundry as 6G (why change a winning formula). The Netherlands is now getting fully on board with the official launch of a National 6G Testbed, which aims to offer Dutch SMEs and startups the “opportunity to develop, test and validate 6G applications under realistic conditions” before 6G is commercially available. The testbed is said to incorporate the latest mobile communications infrastructure and is implemented across a network of five regional 6G field labs in Amersfoort, Delft, Eindhoven, Groningen and The Hague.

[TITLE]6G Market Outlook 2026-2036: Sub-THz Networks, AI Integration, and Non-Terrestrial Systems Drive $300 Billion Opportunity:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Global 6G Market 2026-2036" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global 6G market represents the next transformational phase in wireless communications, projected to grow from nascent pre-commercial activity valued at $500M-1B in 2026 to a comprehensive ecosystem potentially worth $150B-300B annually by 2036. This explosive growth reflects 6G's evolution from laboratory research to commercial deployment, fundamentally reshaping telecommunications infrastructure, devices, applications, and business models across the decade.

The 6G market encompasses four primary segments with distinct growth trajectories and value propositions:

Infrastructure including base stations, core networks, and edge computing platforms represents the largest segment a

Devices and terminals spanning smartphones, IoT sensors, industrial equipment, and vehicles

Semiconductors and components enabling 6G - including GaN and InP power amplifiers, advanced transceivers, massive MIMO beamformers, and ultra-low-power processors

Services and applications leveraging 6G capabilities including holographic communications, digital twins, autonomous systems coordination, and immersive extended reality

Several converging technology trends enable 6G's commercial viability and differentiated value proposition. Sub-THz spectrum (100-300 GHz) provides massive bandwidth enabling multi-gigabit throughput but requires entirely new RF architectures including InP-based power amplifiers, advanced antenna arrays, and sophisticated beamforming - creating technology barriers favoring established players while opening opportunities for innovation. Artificial Intelligence integration throughout networks enables autonomous optimization, predictive resource allocation, and intelligent service delivery. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces extend coverage passively at fraction of traditional infrastructure costs while fundamentally changing network architecture philosophy. Non-Terrestrial Networks integrate 20,000-50,000 LEO satellites, HAPS platforms, and drone systems providing universal coverage addressing 3 billion unconnected people and enabling global IoT.

Despite enormous potential, 6G faces significant commercialization challenges including spectrum allocation complexity across 100+ countries with conflicting priorities, technology maturity gaps particularly at sub-THz frequencies where components remain expensive and power-hungry, business case uncertainty as operators question returns on massive infrastructure investments amid market saturation, and geopolitical fragmentation threatening unified global standards as US-China tensions drive divergent technology ecosystems. Successful market development requires continued technology advancement reducing costs and improving performance, regulatory harmonization enabling economies of scale through common standards, compelling applications demonstrating value beyond incremental 5G improvements, and sustainable business models justifying infrastructure investments through new revenue streams rather than cannibalizing existing services.

The Global 6G Market 2026-2036 report delivers an authoritative 400+ page analysis of the sixth-generation wireless technology revolution, providing strategic intelligence for telecommunications operators, equipment manufacturers, semiconductor companies, materials suppliers, and investors navigating this $150B-300B market opportunity.
