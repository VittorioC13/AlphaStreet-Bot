[TITLE]Lendlease REIT to Acquire 70% of PLQ Mall to Expand its Suburban Retail Portfolio in Singapore:
[TEXT]
Key Highlights

Following the acquisition, Singapore will represent 89% of the portfolio – reinforcing geographic focus while enhancing income stability and portfolio resilience.

Prime location with excellent connectivity to support long-term income growth.

Agreed property value of S$885.0 million represents approximately 2.1% discount on its latest valuation.

Post acquisition, gearing will be 38.3% on a pro forma basis.

Distribution per unit to increase by 2.5% on a pro forma basis.

SINGAPORE, Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lendlease Global Commercial Trust Management Pte. Ltd. (the “Manager”), the manager of Lendlease Global Commercial REIT (“Lendlease REIT”), is pleased to announce that DBS Trustee Limited, in its capacity as trustee of Lendlease REIT (the “Trustee”), has entered into (a) a unit purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party (the “Seller”) to acquire 70% indirect interest in PLQ Mall (the “Property”) via the acquisition of 70% of the total issued units in PLQM Trust, which holds an approximately 100% interest in the Property; and (b) a share purchase agreement with the Seller to acquire a 70% interest in the trustee-manager of PLQM Trust.

Upon completion of the transaction, Lendlease REIT’s total asset value will increase to S$3.9 billion (post completion of the Jem Office Divestment by 12 November 2025) with Singapore representing 89% of the portfolio. This reflects the continued execution of Lendlease REIT’s Singapore-focused growth strategy to acquire higher-yielding assets with long-term income growth potential.

The enlarged portfolio will be well-positioned to deliver consistent growth, with the proportion of essential services expected to rise from approximately 57.7% to 59.9% of the retail gross rental income. Trade sector mix by gross rental income will be more balanced, reducing tenant concentration risks. In addition, the suburban retail component will expand to 62.7%, supported by consumer demand for essential services and the stable, recurring income generated by well-located suburban malls.

Mr. Guy Cawthra, Chief Executive Officer of the Manager, said, “This acquisition marks a strategic step forward in strengthening our resilient suburban retail portfolio in Singapore. It offers immediate DPU accretion for Lendlease REIT’s unitholders, underpinned by an attractive entry valuation. With gearing expected to be approximately 38%, we continue to deliver sustainable growth while maintaining financial prudence.”

Agreed Property Value and Net Property Income (“NPI”) Yield

The agreed property value was arrived on a willing-buyer and willing-seller basis after taking into account the appraised value by Knight Frank Pte Ltd as at 31 October 2025. The agreed property value of S$885.0 million is approximately 2.1% or S$19.0 million discount to the appraised value. The agreed property value is determined on the basis of a 100% interest in the Property. The NPI yield is 4.5%1 based on the agreed property value.

Method of Financing

The total cost of the acquisition is approximately S$246.8 million, comprising (a) S$234.3 million for the sale of units consideration and sale of shares consideration; (b) the acquisition fee payable to the Manager of approximately S$6.2 million; and (c) other acquisition-related fees and expenses of approximately S$6.3 million.

The Manager intends to finance the total cost of the acquisition from the proceeds of the private placement offering of no less than S$270.0 million2 launched on 5 November 2025.

The transaction is not subject to unitholders’ approval under Rule 1014(3) of the Listing Manual.

[TITLE]Beyond Meat® Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) (“Beyond Meat” or “the Company”), a leader in plant-based meat, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 27, 2025.

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights1

Net revenues were $70.2 million, a decrease of 13.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China.

Loss from operations was $112.3 million, or operating margin of -160.0%, compared to loss from operations of $30.9 million, or operating margin of -38.2%, in the year-ago period. Loss from operations included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. Loss from operations also included the following charges recorded in operating expenses: $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses; $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a previously-disclosed contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer; and $0.6 million in costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s campus headquarters building in El Segundo, California (the “Campus Headquarters”).

Net loss was $110.7 million, or $1.44 per common share, compared to net loss of $26.6 million, or $0.41 per common share, in the year-ago period. Net loss in aggregate included $81.2 million in expenses related to non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets, the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China, certain non-routine SG&A expenses, incremental arbitration-related legal expenses, and costs related to a partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters.

Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $21.6 million, or -30.8% of net revenues, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.

Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, "As we approach the end of 2025, we’ve achieved three important building blocks for our broader transformation efforts. These are significantly reducing our overall leverage in connection with the previously announced exchange of substantially all of our 2027 convertible notes; meaningfully extending our debt maturity; and finally, adding substantial liquidity to our balance sheet.”

Brown continued “Simultaneously, we are taking equally strong measures to accelerate our path to sustainable operations, including pursuing further and sizable cost reductions, gross margin expansion investments and targeted strategic growth initiatives. Though category headwinds and an accompanying softer top-line continue to weigh on and reverberate throughout our current performance, including our Q3 results, we are closing out the year with a much improved balance sheet, important transformation spadework underway, and genuine optimism and excitement regarding our future.”

Third Quarter 2025

Net revenues decreased 13.3% to $70.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $81.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 10.3% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 3.5% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand, reduced points of distribution in the U.S. retail channel, and lower sales of burger products to Quick Service Restaurant (“QSR”) customers in the international foodservice channel. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts, changes in product sales mix and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

U.S. retail channel net revenues decreased 18.4% to $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $35.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.6% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 6.6% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and reduced points of distribution. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

U.S. foodservice channel net revenues decreased 27.3% to $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $14.5 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 27.1% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 0.3% decrease in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by weak category demand and the lapping of sales of chicken products to a U.S. QSR customer in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by higher trade discounts and price decreases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.

International retail channel net revenues decreased 4.6% to $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $16.6 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 12.5% decrease in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 9.1% increase in net revenue per pound. The decrease in volume of products sold was primarily driven by reduced sales of the Company’s burger, dinner sausage and chicken products. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by higher trade discounts.

International foodservice channel net revenues increased 2.3% to $15.3 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $15.0 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by a 4.4% increase in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in net revenue per pound. The increase in volume of products sold was primarily due to higher sales of chicken products to a QSR customer, partially offset by reduced sales of burger products to certain QSR customers. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by changes in product sales mix, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, lower trade discounts and, to a lesser extent, price increases of certain of our products.

Gross profit in the third quarter of 2025 was $7.2 million, or gross margin of 10.3%, compared to gross profit of $14.3 million, or gross margin of 17.7%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 included $1.7 million in expenses related to the suspension and substantial cessation of the Company’s operational activities in China. Additionally, gross profit and gross margin in the third quarter of 2025 were negatively impacted by increased cost of goods sold per pound and decreased net revenue per pound. The increase in cost of goods sold per pound primarily reflected higher materials costs and higher inventory provision, partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses, including depreciation, and lower logistics costs.

Operating expenses were $119.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $45.2 million in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 included $77.4 million in non-cash impairment charges related to certain of the Company’s long-lived assets. The Company performed a quantitative assessment in accordance with ASC 360 and concluded that an impairment of its long-lived assets existed at September 27, 2025. There were no such impairment charges in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 also included $0.8 million in certain non-routine SG&A expenses, $0.7 million in incremental legal and other fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer and $0.6 million in costs related to the partial lease termination of a portion of the Company’s Campus Headquarters. Excluding these items, the decrease in operating expenses compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by reduced marketing expenses and reduced non-production salaries and related expenses.

Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2025 was $112.3 million, compared to $30.9 million in the year-ago period. The increase in loss from operations was driven by the increase in operating expenses and the reduction in gross profit.

The following table summarizes certain charges recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the third quarter of 2025 (unaudited):

(in thousands) Charges recorded in cost of goods sold Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 1,721 Total charges recorded in cost of goods sold $ 1,721 Charges recorded in operating expenses Non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets $ 77,414 Certain non-routine SG&A expenses $ 838 Incremental legal and other fees and expenses related to a contractual dispute with a former co-manufacturer $ 662 Costs related to partial lease termination $ 555 Expenses related to suspension and substantial cessation of operational activities in China $ 36 Total charges recorded in operating expenses $ 79,504 Total $ 81,225

Total other income, net, was $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to total other income, net, of $4.4 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in total other income, net, was primarily due to a reduction in net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and an increase in interest expense related to leases and to the Company’s delayed draw term loan facility, partially offset by benefit from the remeasurement of warrant liability and interest income.

Net loss was $110.7 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $26.6 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per common share was $1.44 in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.41 in the year-ago period. The increase in net loss in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by the increase in loss from operations and the decrease in total other income, net.

Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $21.6 million, or -30.8% of net revenues, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.8 million, or -24.4% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.

[TITLE]Breakfast Cereals Market Report 2025: Key Players Analysis Recent Developments, Company Strategies, Sustainability Benchmarking, Product Launches, Key Persons, and Revenue Forecasts 2024-2033:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Breakfast Cereals Market: Key Players Analysis Recent Developments, Company Strategies, Sustainability Benchmarking, Product Launches, Key Persons, and Revenue Forecasts" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Breakfast Cereals industry is expected to expand lucratively to an estimated value of US$ 95.32 Billion by 2033, from US$ 65.25 Billion in 2024. This expansion reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.30% between 2025 and 2033.

The global breakfast cereals market is growing steadily, driven by changing consumer lifestyles, increasing health awareness, and the demand for convenience. Ready-to-eat (cold) cereals dominate in most regions, with hot cereals also gaining traction. Consumers are increasingly choosing cereals fortified with fiber, protein, whole grains, and vitamins, while seeking lower sugar content and "clean label" ingredients. Innovation in flavors, textures, and formats - such as on-the-go, single-serve options - is becoming more common. E-commerce and modern retail channels are expanding access, especially in urban and emerging markets.

Regionally, North America remains a major share contributor, but Asia-Pacific and other emerging markets are among the fastest growing. In these markets, rising incomes, urbanization, and exposure to Western dietary habits are encouraging greater cereal consumption. However, manufacturers are balancing growth with challenges such as raw material cost fluctuations, regulatory scrutiny (especially around sugar and nutrition labeling), and greater demand for sustainability - both in ingredient sourcing and packaging.

B&G Foods Inc. Strength Analysis

Strong Brand Portfolio & Distribution Reach

A core strength of B&G Foods lies in its established portfolio of trusted brands and its wide distribution network. The company owns many recognizable food labels across categories like vegetables, snacks, sauces, and seasonings, giving it customer familiarity and loyalty. Because its brands are staples in many homes, B&G is less dependent on constantly creating new consumer awareness - once it launches or repositions a product, its existing recognition helps support uptake. Moreover, B&G Foods has solid relationships with major retailers and grocery chains, ensuring its products are available in many outlets. This reach and consistency give it scale advantages in purchasing, logistics, and marketing, helping it maintain competitiveness in shelf-stable and frozen food categories.

B&G Foods Inc. Opportunity Analysis

Health & Wellness Trends and Portfolio Upside

B&G Foods has significant opportunity by aligning its product mix more closely with rising health and wellness trends. Consumers are increasingly seeking foods with better-for-you profiles - less sugar, cleaner labels, more plant-based or organic ingredients - and this shift presents scope for the company to innovate and expand into these areas. By introducing or reformulating products (snacks, frozen foods, sauces) that cater to these preferences, B&G can capture new market segments and justify premium pricing. Additionally, increasing its presence in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels could help it reach younger, health-aware consumers. Strategic acquisitions in niche health-forward brands or investing in R&D for healthier offerings will strengthen its growth potential and make its portfolio more resilient.

TreeHouse Foods Strength Analysis

Deep Position in Private Label and Supply Chain Relationships

TreeHouse Foods has a strong positioning as a leader in private-label manufacturing, supplying a wide range of products like sauces, snacks, soups, and beverages to many major retailers. Their scale gives them manufacturing efficiencies, as well as cost leverage in procurement and facility operations. They maintain high customer retention and long-standing relationships with retailers that value reliable supply, flexibility, and quality. Also, their diversified portfolio across multiple food categories helps reduce vulnerability to weakness in any single segment. Their large network of manufacturing sites allows closer sourcing, reduced shipping costs, and better responsiveness to shifting retailer demands. All of this gives TreeHouse Foods a resilient foundation, particularly as many consumers seek value in their grocery purchases.

TreeHouse Foods Opportunity Analysis

Expanding "Better-for-You" and E-Commerce Channels

An important growth opportunity for TreeHouse Foods is to deepen its offerings in the "better-for-you" food segment and to strengthen its presence in e-commerce channels. As consumers increasingly demand healthier, organic, natural, non-GMO, or reduced sugar options, there's space for the company to release new formulations or product lines that cater to nutrition and wellness trends. At the same time, online grocery and direct-to-consumer retail are expanding rapidly. TreeHouse can partner with or develop capabilities in digital platforms and online retailers to reach consumers who value convenience. By investing in healthier products and modern distribution channels, TreeHouse can broaden its market, improve margins, and build stronger consumer loyalty in changing market conditions.

[TITLE]Pasta Market Forecast and Company Analysis Report 2025-2033: Recent Developments, Strategy, Sustainability Benchmarking, Product Launch, Key Persons and Revenue:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Pasta Market Company Analysis, Forecast by Recent Developments, Strategy, Sustainability Benchmarking, Product Launch, Key Persons and Revenue" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Pasta industry is expected to expand lucratively to an estimated value of US$ 39.13 Billion by 2033, from US$ 27.79 Billion in 2024. This expansion reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.88% between 2025 and 2033.

The fast-paced nature of modern life leaves little time for sophisticated meal preparation. Customers are being pushed by this trend toward convenience foods that need less cooking time and are easy to prepare. Families, working professionals, and students are increasingly choosing pasta because of its versatility and quick preparation time. Its adaptability to various recipes and compatibility with readily available ingredients enhance its appeal as a quick dining option. Additionally, whole-grain, gluten-free, organic, and fortified pasta varieties are being developed in response to consumers' growing need for wholesome and nourishing food options. Customers are searching for options that fit their nutritional requirements, such as options that are high in protein and low in carbohydrates.

Furthermore, companies are advertising their ethical business practices in marketing campaigns, using eco-friendly packaging, and integrating materials that are organic and sustainably sourced. Demand is further increased by these programs, which appeal to environmentally and socially conscious consumers.

Customers looking for authentic and high-quality products are drawn to premium, organic, and artisanal pasta, which is driving the demand for pasta in the US market. Accessibility is also being improved by its broad availability in supermarkets, specialty food stores, and online platforms, particularly as e-commerce becomes more popular. For example, Etto Pasta made its debut on Amazon USA in 2024, offering artisan organic pasta made in Paso Robles, California, in small batches that can be delivered anywhere in the country with Amazon Prime. Etto Pasta aims to bring its authentic Italian-inspired flavors to American homes by using traditional methods and premium USDA-certified organic semolina durum wheat. The introduction highlights their local heritage in Tin City and provides a simple way to get their handcrafted goods.

SWOT Analysis of Unilever

Strength: Diverse and globally recognized brand portfolio

Unilever's greatest strength lies in its diverse and globally recognized brand portfolio. With over 400 brands - including household names like Dove, Knorr, Lipton, and Surf - Unilever enjoys widespread consumer trust across multiple sectors. This brand diversity allows it to operate successfully in over 190 countries and adapt quickly to changing market demands. Its billion-euro brands provide a strong revenue base and allow cross-leveraging of marketing, logistics, and innovation. This scale offers not only financial resilience but also the ability to drive impactful sustainability and health campaigns across the world. The sheer range of its offerings - from food to personal care - gives Unilever a significant competitive edge in both mature and emerging markets, insulating it from sector-specific disruptions.

Opportunity: Growing demand for health and wellness products

A key opportunity for Unilever is capitalizing on the growing demand for health and wellness products. Consumers worldwide are increasingly shifting toward plant-based, organic, and functional foods that support immunity, mental health, and overall well-being. Unilever is well-positioned to expand its presence in this space through innovation and acquisitions, especially in plant-based foods and vitamin-enriched personal care. Brands like Knorr and Hellmann's already have healthier product lines, and the company's investment in non-dairy ice cream and meat alternatives reflects this shift. As health-conscious lifestyles become mainstream - particularly among millennials and Gen Z - Unilever can build strong brand loyalty and increase its market share by offering credible, sustainable wellness solutions aligned with science and consumer ethics.

SWOT Analysis of Nestle

Strength: Global Brand Leadership and Product Diversification

Nestle's greatest strength lies in its status as the world's largest food and beverage company, with a highly diversified product portfolio spanning categories like coffee, dairy, baby nutrition, pet care, and health science. Its ownership of powerful, trusted global brands - such as Nescafe, Maggi, KitKat, and Purina - provides strong brand equity and consumer loyalty. This wide-ranging portfolio enables Nestle to weather market fluctuations and cater to diverse consumer needs across cultures and income levels. The company's consistent innovation and significant investment in R&D further solidify its leadership in both traditional and emerging product segments. This global presence and brand depth allow Nestle to maintain strong revenues and operational resilience in a highly competitive and evolving food industry.

Opportunity: Expanding Health and Nutrition Market

Nestle has a significant opportunity to lead in the rapidly growing health, wellness, and personalized nutrition sectors. Consumers are increasingly seeking functional foods, plant-based alternatives, and products with low sugar, high protein, or added health benefits. Nestle's Health Science division is already expanding its footprint in medical nutrition, supplements, and nutraceuticals, positioning the company to tap into the global shift toward preventive health. Additionally, Nestle's investment in plant-based innovations - such as dairy-free beverages and meat alternatives - aligns with both consumer demand and sustainability trends. By leveraging its global scale, scientific expertise, and trusted brand name, Nestle can accelerate growth in this high-potential segment and future-proof its portfolio against changing dietary and lifestyle preferences.
