[TITLE]Kaiser settles class-action web tracking lawsuit for $46M:
[TEXT]
Kaiser Permanente agreed to pay $46 million to resolve a class action lawsuit surrounding its use of web tracking technology. Complainants alleged that Kaiser's use of tracking tech within its websites, mobile apps and patient portals led to the improper disclosure of personal information to third-party companies.

Lawsuits related to the use of third-party tracking technology have increased in healthcare in recent years.

This specific incident impacted Kaiser's insurance division, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan. Kaiser reported the 13.4-million-record breach to HHS in April 2024. At the time, the health plan stated that the breach may have transmitted data to third-party vendors, such as Google, Microsoft and X.

The impacted data included member names, IP addresses and information that revealed how members interacted with Kaiser's sites. Kaiser removed the tracking tools from its website and applications.

The incident was the second-largest breach reported to HHS in 2024, behind the Change Healthcare data breach.

Several complaints were filed against Kaiser in the aftermath of the breach and were later consolidated into one class action complaint.

The consolidated class action complaint alleged that Kaiser violated several state privacy laws and was negligent. Kaiser denied all the claims but proceeded with the settlement to avoid continued litigation.

Kaiser agreed to a $46 million preliminary settlement, which may be increased to up to $47.5 million, contingent upon the terms of a confidential supplemental agreement. Final approval of the settlement will be granted following a fairness hearing on April 30, 2026.

[TITLE]FDA grants traditional approval to pirtobrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma:
[TEXT]
On December 3, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration granted traditional approval to pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca, Eli Lilly and Company) for adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have previously been treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor. In 2023, FDA granted accelerated approval to pirtobrutinib for adults with CLL/SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor.

Full prescribing information for Jaypirca will be posted here.

Efficacy and Safety

Efficacy was evaluated in BRUIN-CLL-321 (NCT 04666038), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial. The trial randomized 238 patients who were previously treated for CLL/SLL, including a covalent BTK inhibitor. Patients previously treated with a non-covalent BTK inhibitor were not permitted. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either pirtobrutinib or investigator’s choice of idelalisib plus a rituximab product (IR) or bendamustine plus a rituximab product (BR). Crossover to JAYPIRCA monotherapy was permitted for patients in the investigator’s choice arm after confirmed disease progression.

The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by an independent review committee using 2018 iwCLL criteria. Median PFS was 11.2 months (95% CI: 9.5, 11.4) in the pirtobrutinib arm and 8.7 months (95% CI: 7.2, 10.2) in the investigator’s choice of IR/BR arm (Hazard ratio 0.58 [95% CI: 0.38, 0.89]; p-value 0.0105). Of the 119 patients in the investigator’s choice arm, 50 crossed over to receive JAYPIRCA therapy. At an updated analysis with a median follow-up time of 19.8 months, the HR for overall survival (OS) was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.75).

The prescribing information includes warnings and precautions for infections, hemorrhage, cytopenias, cardiac arrythmias, secondary primary malignancies, hepatotoxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Recommended Dosage

The recommended pirtobrutinib dose is 200 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Expedited Programs

This review used the Assessment Aid, a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA’s assessment.

Pirtobrutinib received orphan drug designation. A description of FDA expedited programs is in the Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics.

[TITLE]Eisai Presents New Data on the Continued and Expanding Benefit of LEQEMBI® (lecanemab-irmb) Maintenance Treatment in Early Alzheimer’s Disease at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conf:
[TEXT]
Long-term LEQEMBI treatment suggests potential to delay disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to moderate Alzheimer’s disease by up to 8.3 years in low-amyloid group who started treatment at an early stage

New safety and efficacy data presented at scientific symposium on subcutaneous formulation for LEQEMBI initiation treatment, which is under regulatory review in the United States

TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that the latest findings on time savings with continued treatment with humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody lecanemab (generic name, U.S. brand name LEQEMBI®) were presented at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference. Additionally, a scientific symposium was held on the subcutaneous formulation (SC-AI), which was approved for maintenance treatment in the United States in August 2025, and the rolling supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for initiation treatment was completed in November 2025. The application for a subcutaneous injectable formulation in Japan was submitted in November 2025.

Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) is a progressive, relentless disease with Aβ and tau as hallmarks, that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* (PF) that begins before amyloid plaque removal and continues afterward.1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both PF and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

Estimating the 10-Year Time-Savings Benefits of Lecanemab Treatment (Presentation: December 3, 2:40 PM PT)

This analysis used data from the Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE) and 16 clinical studies of monoclonal antibodies for AD to estimate long-term AD progression over 10 years and the slowing effect of continued lecanemab treatment. The analysis evaluated estimated “time savings” (slowing of disease progression) compared to natural decline based on ADNI** (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) data (untreated group), using Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). These results suggest that early initiation and long-term lecanemab treatment may continue to slow AD progression and help maintain cognitive function over a longer period.

Findings from each group:

Time Savings from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Due to AD to Mild AD The time to progression from MCI due to AD to mild AD was 7.2 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to mild AD took 9.7 years, indicating a time savings of 2.5 years. In the low-amyloid group (patients who started treatment at an early stage: amyloid PET <60 centiloids), the time to progression from MCI to mild AD was 13.2 years with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, suggesting a time savings of 6.0 years.

Time Savings from MCI due to AD to Moderate AD

The time to progression from MCI due to AD to moderate AD was 10.1 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to moderate AD took 13.6 years, indicating a time savings of 3.5 years. In the low-amyloid group, the time to progression with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD was 18.4 years, suggesting a time savings of 8.3 years.

These findings indicate that earlier initiation of LEQEMBI treatment may provide a greater delay in disease progression. Furthermore, each additional year on LEQEMBI could further delay disease progression compared to stopping treatment, even long after plaque is expected to have been cleared.

Lecanemab Subcutaneous Formulation for Treatment Initiation in Early Alzheimer’s Disease: Optimizing Patient Care with a Potential New Option (Symposium Presentation: December 3, 3:10 PM PT)

In this symposium, the latest data from the lecanemab subcutaneous clinical development program were presented focusing on treatment initiation, including results from the subcutaneous (SC) formulation subcohort (n=273) in the Clarity AD trial OLE. It was shown that weekly administration of lecanemab SC-AI at 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) demonstrated bioequivalence in drug exposure compared to intravenous (IV) dosing of 10 mg/kg every two weeks (exposure ratio: 104%, 90% CI: 99.1%–109%).

Based on clinical data and modeling analysis, the effect on amyloid removal in the brain and safety (ARIA-E incidence) was shown to be independent of the route of administration and explained by exposure, suggesting that weekly 500 mg SC dosing provides similar efficacy and safety to biweekly 10 mg/kg IV dosing. Additionally, ARIA-E incidence was also predicted to be comparable between SC and IV administration (12.4% overall, 30.9% in ApoE4 homozygotes).

In this sub-cohort which had prior exposure to lecanemab, safety evaluation showed systemic infusion reactions occurred in 0% of patients receiving 500 mg SC, all of whom had previously received IV lecanemab, and 1.4% of patients who initiated on 720 mg SC by vial, which is favorable compared to systemic infusion reactions in the IV group (26.4%). Immunogenicity assessment indicated a low incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at 1.4%.

These results indicate that the subcutaneous formulations of lecanemab, designed with consideration for the convenience of patients and their care partners, maintains efficacy with a low incidence of systemic infusion reactions, and is otherwise equivalent to conventional IV administration.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

* Protofibrils are thought to be the most toxic Aβ species that contribute to brain damage in AD and play a major role in the cognitive decline of this progressive and devastating disease. Protofibrils can cause neuronal and synaptic damage in the brain, which can subsequently adversely affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms.3 The mechanism by which this occurs has been reported not only by increasing the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques, but also by directly damaging signaling between neurons and other cells. It is believed that reducing protofibrils may reduce neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, potentially preventing the progression of AD.4

** ADNI is a clinical research project launched in 2005 to develop methods to predict the onset and progression of AD and to confirm the effectiveness of treatments. The project involves a multi-year longitudinal observation targeting healthy elderly individuals as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early stages of AD.

INDICATION

LEQEMBI® is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with LEQEMBI should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: AMYLOID-RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES (ARIA) Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA, characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Incidence and timing of ARIA vary among treatments. ARIA usually occurs early in treatment and is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events, including seizure and status epilepticus, can occur. ARIA can be fatal. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) >1 cm, some of which have been fatal, have been observed with this class of medications. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy to a patient being treated with LEQEMBI. Apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) Homozygotes : Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes (~15% of patients with AD) treated with this class of medications have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious, and severe radiographic ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results. Prescribers should inform patients that if genotype testing is not performed, they can still be treated with LEQEMBI; however, it cannot be determined if they are ApoE ε4 homozygotes and at higher risk for ARIA.

Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of AD and the potential risk of serious ARIA events when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBI.

CONTRAINDICATION

Contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to lecanemab-irmb or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities

Medications in this class, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA-E, which can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H, which includes microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. ARIA can occur spontaneously in patients with AD, particularly in patients with MRI findings suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), such as pretreatment microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. ARIA-H generally occurs with ARIA-E. Reported ARIA symptoms may include headache, confusion, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, and gait difficulty. Focal neurologic deficits may also occur. Symptoms usually resolve over time.

Incidence of ARIA

Symptomatic ARIA occurred in 3% and serious ARIA symptoms in 0.7% with LEQEMBI. Clinical ARIA symptoms resolved in 79% of patients during the period of observation. ARIA, including asymptomatic radiographic events, was observed: LEQEMBI, 21%; placebo, 9%. ARIA-E was observed: LEQEMBI, 13%; placebo, 2%. ARIA-H was observed: LEQEMBI, 17%; placebo, 9%. No increase in isolated ARIA-H was observed for LEQEMBI vs placebo.

Incidence of ICH

ICH >1 cm in diameter was reported in 0.7% with LEQEMBI vs 0.1% with placebo. Fatal events of ICH in patients taking LEQEMBI have been observed.

Risk Factors of ARIA and ICH

ApoE ε4 Carrier Status

Of the patients taking LEQEMBI, 16% were ApoE ε4 homozygotes, 53% were heterozygotes, and 31% were noncarriers. With LEQEMBI, ARIA was higher in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (LEQEMBI: 45%; placebo: 22%) than in heterozygotes (LEQEMBI: 19%; placebo: 9%) and noncarriers (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 4%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 9% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes vs 2% of heterozygotes and 1% of noncarriers. Serious ARIA events occurred in 3% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes and in ~1% of heterozygotes and noncarriers. The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.

Radiographic Findings of CAA

Neuroimaging findings that may indicate CAA include evidence of prior ICH, cerebral microhemorrhage, and cortical superficial siderosis. CAA has an increased risk for ICH. The presence of an ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with CAA.

The baseline presence of at least 2 microhemorrhages or the presence of at least 1 area of superficial siderosis on MRI, which may be suggestive of CAA, have been identified as risk factors for ARIA. Patients were excluded from Clarity AD for the presence of >4 microhemorrhages and additional findings suggestive of CAA (prior cerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in greatest diameter, superficial siderosis, vasogenic edema) or other lesions (aneurysm, vascular malformation) that could potentially increase the risk of ICH.

Concomitant Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Medication

In Clarity AD, baseline use of antithrombotic medication (aspirin, other antiplatelets, or anticoagulants) was allowed if the patient was on a stable dose. Most exposures were to aspirin. Antithrombotic medications did not increase the risk of ARIA with LEQEMBI. The incidence of ICH: 0.9% in patients taking LEQEMBI with a concomitant antithrombotic medication vs 0.6% with no antithrombotic and 2.5% in patients taking LEQEMBI with an anticoagulant alone or with antiplatelet medication such as aspirin vs none in patients receiving placebo.

Fatal cerebral hemorrhage has occurred in 1 patient taking an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in the setting of focal neurologic symptoms of ARIA and the use of a thrombolytic agent.

Additional caution should be exercised when considering the administration of antithrombotics or a thrombolytic agent (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) to a patient already being treated with LEQEMBI. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, treating clinicians should consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy in a patient being treated with LEQEMBI.

Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LEQEMBI in patients with factors that indicate an increased risk for ICH and, in particular, patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy or patients with findings on MRI that are suggestive of CAA.

Radiographic Severity With LEQEMBI

Most ARIA-E radiographic events occurred within the first 7 doses, although ARIA can occur at any time, and patients can have >1 episode. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-E with LEQEMBI was mild in 4%, moderate in 7%, and severe in 1% of patients. Resolution on MRI occurred in 52% of ARIA-E patients by 12 weeks, 81% by 17 weeks, and 100% overall after detection. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-H microhemorrhage with LEQEMBI was mild in 9%, moderate in 2%, and severe in 3% of patients; superficial siderosis was mild in 4%, moderate in 1%, and severe in 0.4% of patients. With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-E was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (5%) vs heterozygotes (0.4%) or noncarriers (0%). With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-H was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (13.5%) vs heterozygotes (2.1%) or noncarriers (1.1%).

Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines

Baseline brain MRI and periodic monitoring with MRI are recommended. Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 14 weeks of treatment. Depending on ARIA-E and ARIA-H clinical symptoms and radiographic severity, use clinical judgment when considering whether to continue dosing or to temporarily or permanently discontinue LEQEMBI. If a patient experiences ARIA symptoms, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis, have occurred with LEQEMBI. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction and initiate appropriate therapy.

Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)

IRRs were observed—LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%—and most cases with LEQEMBI (75%) occurred with the first infusion. IRRs were mostly mild (69%) or moderate (28%). Symptoms included fever and flu-like symptoms (chills, generalized aches, feeling shaky, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation.

IRRs can occur during or after the completion of infusion. In the event of an IRR during the infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated as clinically indicated. Consider prophylactic treatment prior to future infusions with antihistamines, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% with LEQEMBI infusion every 2 weeks and ≥2% higher than placebo were IRRs (LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%), ARIA-H (LEQEMBI: 14%; placebo: 8%), ARIA-E (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 2%), headache (LEQEMBI: 11%; placebo: 8%), superficial siderosis of central nervous system (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 3%), rash (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%), and nausea/vomiting (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%)

Safety profile of LEQEMBI IQLIK for maintenance treatment was similar to LEQEMBI infusion. Patients who received LEQEMBI IQLIK experienced localized and systemic (less frequent) injection-related reactions (mild to moderate in severity)

LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) is available :

Intravenous infusion: 100 mg/mL

Subcutaneous injection: 200 mg/mL

Long-term LEQEMBI treatment suggests potential to delay disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to moderate Alzheimer’s disease by up to 8.3 years in low-amyloid group who started treatment at an early stage

New safety and efficacy data presented at scientific symposium on subcutaneous formulation for LEQEMBI initiation treatment, which is under regulatory review in the United States

TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that the latest findings on time savings with continued treatment with humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody lecanemab (generic name, U.S. brand name LEQEMBI®) were presented at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference.

INDICATION

LEQEMBI® is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with LEQEMBI should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: AMYLOID-RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES (ARIA) Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA, characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Incidence and timing of ARIA vary among treatments.

Apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) Homozygotes : Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes (~15% of patients with AD) treated with this class of medications have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious, and severe radiographic ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results. Prescribers should inform patients that if genotype testing is not performed, they can still be treated with LEQEMBI; however, it cannot be determined if they are ApoE ε4 homozygotes and at higher risk for ARIA.

Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of AD and the potential risk of serious ARIA events when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBI.

CONTRAINDICATION

Contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to lecanemab-irmb or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities

Medications in this class, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA-E, which can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H, which includes microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. ARIA can occur spontaneously in patients with AD, particularly in patients with MRI findings suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), such as pretreatment microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. ARIA-H generally occurs with ARIA-E. Reported ARIA symptoms may include headache, confusion, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, and gait difficulty. Focal neurologic deficits may also occur. Symptoms usually resolve over time.

Incidence of ARIA

Symptomatic ARIA occurred in 3% and serious ARIA symptoms in 0.7% with LEQEMBI. Clinical ARIA symptoms resolved in 79% of patients during the period of observation. ARIA, including asymptomatic radiographic events, was observed: LEQEMBI, 21%; placebo, 9%. ARIA-E was observed: LEQEMBI, 13%; placebo, 2%. ARIA-H was observed: LEQEMBI, 17%; placebo, 9%. No increase in isolated ARIA-H was observed for LEQEMBI vs placebo.

Incidence of ICH

ICH >1 cm in diameter was reported in 0.7% with LEQEMBI vs 0.1% with placebo. Fatal events of ICH in patients taking LEQEMBI have been observed.

Risk Factors of ARIA and ICH

ApoE ε4 Carrier Status

Of the patients taking LEQEMBI, 16% were ApoE ε4 homozygotes, 53% were heterozygotes, and 31% were noncarriers. With LEQEMBI, ARIA was higher in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (LEQEMBI: 45%; placebo: 22%) than in heterozygotes (LEQEMBI: 19%; placebo: 9%) and noncarriers (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 4%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 9% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes vs 2% of heterozygotes and 1% of noncarriers. Serious ARIA events occurred in 3% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes and in ~1% of heterozygotes and noncarriers. The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.

Radiographic Findings of CAA

Neuroimaging findings that may indicate CAA include evidence of prior ICH, cerebral microhemorrhage, and cortical superficial siderosis. CAA has an increased risk for ICH. The presence of an ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with CAA.

The baseline presence of at least 2 microhemorrhages or the presence of at least 1 area of superficial siderosis on MRI, which may be suggestive of CAA, have been identified as risk factors for ARIA. Patients were excluded from Clarity AD for the presence of >4 microhemorrhages and additional findings suggestive of CAA (prior cerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in greatest diameter, superficial siderosis, vasogenic edema) or other lesions (aneurysm, vascular malformation) that could potentially increase the risk of ICH.

Concomitant Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Medication

In Clarity AD, baseline use of antithrombotic medication (aspirin, other antiplatelets, or anticoagulants) was allowed if the patient was on a stable dose. Most exposures were to aspirin. Antithrombotic medications did not increase the risk of ARIA with LEQEMBI. The incidence of ICH: 0.9% in patients taking LEQEMBI with a concomitant antithrombotic medication vs 0.6% with no antithrombotic and 2.5% in patients taking LEQEMBI with an anticoagulant alone or with antiplatelet medication such as aspirin vs none in patients receiving placebo.

Fatal cerebral hemorrhage has occurred in 1 patient taking an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in the setting of focal neurologic symptoms of ARIA and the use of a thrombolytic agent.

Additional caution should be exercised when considering the administration of antithrombotics or a thrombolytic agent (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) to a patient already being treated with LEQEMBI. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, treating clinicians should consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy in a patient being treated with LEQEMBI.

Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LEQEMBI in patients with factors that indicate an increased risk for ICH and, in particular, patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy or patients with findings on MRI that are suggestive of CAA.

Radiographic Severity With LEQEMBI

Most ARIA-E radiographic events occurred within the first 7 doses, although ARIA can occur at any time, and patients can have >1 episode. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-E with LEQEMBI was mild in 4%, moderate in 7%, and severe in 1% of patients. Resolution on MRI occurred in 52% of ARIA-E patients by 12 weeks, 81% by 17 weeks, and 100% overall after detection. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-H microhemorrhage with LEQEMBI was mild in 9%, moderate in 2%, and severe in 3% of patients; superficial siderosis was mild in 4%, moderate in 1%, and severe in 0.4% of patients. With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-E was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (5%) vs heterozygotes (0.4%) or noncarriers (0%). With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-H was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (13.5%) vs heterozygotes (2.1%) or noncarriers (1.1%).

Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines

Baseline brain MRI and periodic monitoring with MRI are recommended. Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 14 weeks of treatment. Depending on ARIA-E and ARIA-H clinical symptoms and radiographic severity, use clinical judgment when considering whether to continue dosing or to temporarily or permanently discontinue LEQEMBI. If a patient experiences ARIA symptoms, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis, have occurred with LEQEMBI. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction and initiate appropriate therapy.

Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)

IRRs were observed—LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%—and most cases with LEQEMBI (75%) occurred with the first infusion. IRRs were mostly mild (69%) or moderate (28%). Symptoms included fever and flu-like symptoms (chills, generalized aches, feeling shaky, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation.

IRRs can occur during or after the completion of infusion. In the event of an IRR during the infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated as clinically indicated. Consider prophylactic treatment prior to future infusions with antihistamines, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% with LEQEMBI infusion every 2 weeks and ≥2% higher than placebo were IRRs (LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%), ARIA-H (LEQEMBI: 14%; placebo: 8%), ARIA-E (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 2%), headache (LEQEMBI: 11%; placebo: 8%), superficial siderosis of central nervous system (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 3%), rash (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%), and nausea/vomiting (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%)

Safety profile of LEQEMBI IQLIK for maintenance treatment was similar to LEQEMBI infusion. Patients who received LEQEMBI IQLIK experienced localized and systemic (less frequent) injection-related reactions (mild to moderate in severity)

LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) is available :

Intravenous infusion: 100 mg/mL

Subcutaneous injection: 200 mg/mL

[TITLE]FDA grants traditional approval to pirtobrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma:
[TEXT]
On December 3, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration granted traditional approval to pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca, Eli Lilly and Company) for adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have previously been treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor. In 2023, FDA granted accelerated approval to pirtobrutinib for adults with CLL/SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor.

Full prescribing information for Jaypirca will be posted here.

Efficacy and Safety

Efficacy was evaluated in BRUIN-CLL-321 (NCT 04666038), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial. The trial randomized 238 patients who were previously treated for CLL/SLL, including a covalent BTK inhibitor. Patients previously treated with a non-covalent BTK inhibitor were not permitted. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either pirtobrutinib or investigator’s choice of idelalisib plus a rituximab product (IR) or bendamustine plus a rituximab product (BR). Crossover to JAYPIRCA monotherapy was permitted for patients in the investigator’s choice arm after confirmed disease progression.

The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by an independent review committee using 2018 iwCLL criteria. Median PFS was 11.2 months (95% CI: 9.5, 11.4) in the pirtobrutinib arm and 8.7 months (95% CI: 7.2, 10.2) in the investigator’s choice of IR/BR arm (Hazard ratio 0.58 [95% CI: 0.38, 0.89]; p-value 0.0105). Of the 119 patients in the investigator’s choice arm, 50 crossed over to receive JAYPIRCA therapy. At an updated analysis with a median follow-up time of 19.8 months, the HR for overall survival (OS) was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.75).

The prescribing information includes warnings and precautions for infections, hemorrhage, cytopenias, cardiac arrythmias, secondary primary malignancies, hepatotoxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Recommended Dosage

The recommended pirtobrutinib dose is 200 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Expedited Programs

This review used the Assessment Aid, a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA’s assessment.

Pirtobrutinib received orphan drug designation. A description of FDA expedited programs is in the Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics.

Healthcare professionals should report all serious adverse events suspected to be associated with the use of any medicine and device to FDA’s MedWatch Reporting System or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.

[TITLE]UK and US agree zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals:
[TEXT]
The UK has secured a 0 per cent tariff rate for all UK medicines exported to the US for at least three years, officials have said, in return for the UK spending more on new medicines.

Under the deal, the US agreed to exempt UK-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes, the officials said on Monday.

The Trump administration said in return UK drugs firms committed to invest more in the US and create more jobs.

The UK government said the 0 per cent rate on all of its pharmaceuticals exports was the lowest offered to any country. As part of the deal, it said the country's National Health Service will spend around 25 per cent more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades.

Officials said that means UK health authorities will now be able to approve medicines that deliver significant health improvements but might have previously been declined purely on cost-effectiveness grounds, including breakthrough cancer treatments or therapies for rare diseases.

"This vital deal will ensure UK patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives," said Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall.

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the deal was "an important step towards ensuring patients can access innovative medicines needed to improve wider NHS health outcomes".

"It should also put the UK in a stronger position to attract and retain global life science investment and advanced medicinal research," said ABPI chief executive Richard Torbett.

US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement "strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to US-UK pharmaceutical trade".

AstraZeneca is among pharmaceutical giants that have cancelled or paused their investments in the UK in recent months. US ambassador Warren Stephens recently warned said American businesses will cut future investments if "there are not changes made and fast".

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed on a framework for a trade pact that would slash US import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for US products, including beef and ethanol. (AP) DIV DIV

[TITLE]Eisai Presents New Data on the Continued and Expanding Benefit of LEQEMBI® (lecanemab-irmb) Maintenance Treatment in Early Alzheimer’s Disease at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conf:
[TEXT]
Long-term LEQEMBI treatment suggests potential to delay disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to moderate Alzheimer’s disease by up to 8.3 years in low-amyloid group who started treatment at an early stage

New safety and efficacy data presented at scientific symposium on subcutaneous formulation for LEQEMBI initiation treatment, which is under regulatory review in the United States

TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that the latest findings on time savings with continued treatment with humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody lecanemab (generic name, U.S. brand name LEQEMBI®) were presented at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference. Additionally, a scientific symposium was held on the subcutaneous formulation (SC-AI), which was approved for maintenance treatment in the United States in August 2025, and the rolling supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for initiation treatment was completed in November 2025. The application for a subcutaneous injectable formulation in Japan was submitted in November 2025.

Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) is a progressive, relentless disease with Aβ and tau as hallmarks, that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* (PF) that begins before amyloid plaque removal and continues afterward.1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both PF and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

Estimating the 10-Year Time-Savings Benefits of Lecanemab Treatment (Presentation: December 3, 2:40 PM PT)

This analysis used data from the Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE) and 16 clinical studies of monoclonal antibodies for AD to estimate long-term AD progression over 10 years and the slowing effect of continued lecanemab treatment. The analysis evaluated estimated “time savings” (slowing of disease progression) compared to natural decline based on ADNI** (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) data (untreated group), using Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). These results suggest that early initiation and long-term lecanemab treatment may continue to slow AD progression and help maintain cognitive function over a longer period.

Findings from each group:

Time Savings from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Due to AD to Mild AD The time to progression from MCI due to AD to mild AD was 7.2 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to mild AD took 9.7 years, indicating a time savings of 2.5 years. In the low-amyloid group (patients who started treatment at an early stage: amyloid PET <60 centiloids), the time to progression from MCI to mild AD was 13.2 years with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, suggesting a time savings of 6.0 years.

Time Savings from MCI due to AD to Moderate AD

The time to progression from MCI due to AD to moderate AD was 10.1 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to moderate AD took 13.6 years, indicating a time savings of 3.5 years. In the low-amyloid group, the time to progression with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD was 18.4 years, suggesting a time savings of 8.3 years.

These findings indicate that earlier initiation of LEQEMBI treatment may provide a greater delay in disease progression. Furthermore, each additional year on LEQEMBI could further delay disease progression compared to stopping treatment, even long after plaque is expected to have been cleared.

Lecanemab Subcutaneous Formulation for Treatment Initiation in Early Alzheimer’s Disease: Optimizing Patient Care with a Potential New Option (Symposium Presentation: December 3, 3:10 PM PT)

In this symposium, the latest data from the lecanemab subcutaneous clinical development program were presented focusing on treatment initiation, including results from the subcutaneous (SC) formulation subcohort (n=273) in the Clarity AD trial OLE. It was shown that weekly administration of lecanemab SC-AI at 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) demonstrated bioequivalence in drug exposure compared to intravenous (IV) dosing of 10 mg/kg every two weeks (exposure ratio: 104%, 90% CI: 99.1%–109%).

Based on clinical data and modeling analysis, the effect on amyloid removal in the brain and safety (ARIA-E incidence) was shown to be independent of the route of administration and explained by exposure, suggesting that weekly 500 mg SC dosing provides similar efficacy and safety to biweekly 10 mg/kg IV dosing. Additionally, ARIA-E incidence was also predicted to be comparable between SC and IV administration (12.4% overall, 30.9% in ApoE4 homozygotes).

In this sub-cohort which had prior exposure to lecanemab, safety evaluation showed systemic infusion reactions occurred in 0% of patients receiving 500 mg SC, all of whom had previously received IV lecanemab, and 1.4% of patients who initiated on 720 mg SC by vial, which is favorable compared to systemic infusion reactions in the IV group (26.4%). Immunogenicity assessment indicated a low incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at 1.4%.

These results indicate that the subcutaneous formulations of lecanemab, designed with consideration for the convenience of patients and their care partners, maintains efficacy with a low incidence of systemic infusion reactions, and is otherwise equivalent to conventional IV administration.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

* Protofibrils are thought to be the most toxic Aβ species that contribute to brain damage in AD and play a major role in the cognitive decline of this progressive and devastating disease. Protofibrils can cause neuronal and synaptic damage in the brain, which can subsequently adversely affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms.3 The mechanism by which this occurs has been reported not only by increasing the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques, but also by directly damaging signaling between neurons and other cells. It is believed that reducing protofibrils may reduce neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, potentially preventing the progression of AD.4

** ADNI is a clinical research project launched in 2005 to develop methods to predict the onset and progression of AD and to confirm the effectiveness of treatments. The project involves a multi-year longitudinal observation targeting healthy elderly individuals as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early stages of AD.

INDICATION

LEQEMBI® is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with LEQEMBI should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: AMYLOID-RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES (ARIA) Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA, characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Incidence and timing of ARIA vary among treatments. ARIA usually occurs early in treatment and is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events, including seizure and status epilepticus, can occur. ARIA can be fatal. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) >1 cm, some of which have been fatal, have been observed with this class of medications. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy to a patient being treated with LEQEMBI. Apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) Homozygotes : Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes (~15% of patients with AD) treated with this class of medications have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious, and severe radiographic ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results. Prescribers should inform patients that if genotype testing is not performed, they can still be treated with LEQEMBI; however, it cannot be determined if they are ApoE ε4 homozygotes and at higher risk for ARIA.

Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of AD and the potential risk of serious ARIA events when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBI.

CONTRAINDICATION

Contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to lecanemab-irmb or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities

Medications in this class, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA-E, which can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H, which includes microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. ARIA can occur spontaneously in patients with AD, particularly in patients with MRI findings suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), such as pretreatment microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. ARIA-H generally occurs with ARIA-E. Reported ARIA symptoms may include headache, confusion, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, and gait difficulty. Focal neurologic deficits may also occur. Symptoms usually resolve over time.

Incidence of ARIA

Symptomatic ARIA occurred in 3% and serious ARIA symptoms in 0.7% with LEQEMBI. Clinical ARIA symptoms resolved in 79% of patients during the period of observation. ARIA, including asymptomatic radiographic events, was observed: LEQEMBI, 21%; placebo, 9%. ARIA-E was observed: LEQEMBI, 13%; placebo, 2%. ARIA-H was observed: LEQEMBI, 17%; placebo, 9%. No increase in isolated ARIA-H was observed for LEQEMBI vs placebo.

Incidence of ICH

ICH >1 cm in diameter was reported in 0.7% with LEQEMBI vs 0.1% with placebo. Fatal events of ICH in patients taking LEQEMBI have been observed.

Risk Factors of ARIA and ICH

ApoE ε4 Carrier Status

Of the patients taking LEQEMBI, 16% were ApoE ε4 homozygotes, 53% were heterozygotes, and 31% were noncarriers. With LEQEMBI, ARIA was higher in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (LEQEMBI: 45%; placebo: 22%) than in heterozygotes (LEQEMBI: 19%; placebo: 9%) and noncarriers (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 4%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 9% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes vs 2% of heterozygotes and 1% of noncarriers. Serious ARIA events occurred in 3% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes and in ~1% of heterozygotes and noncarriers. The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.

Radiographic Findings of CAA

Neuroimaging findings that may indicate CAA include evidence of prior ICH, cerebral microhemorrhage, and cortical superficial siderosis. CAA has an increased risk for ICH. The presence of an ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with CAA.

The baseline presence of at least 2 microhemorrhages or the presence of at least 1 area of superficial siderosis on MRI, which may be suggestive of CAA, have been identified as risk factors for ARIA. Patients were excluded from Clarity AD for the presence of >4 microhemorrhages and additional findings suggestive of CAA (prior cerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in greatest diameter, superficial siderosis, vasogenic edema) or other lesions (aneurysm, vascular malformation) that could potentially increase the risk of ICH.

Concomitant Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Medication

In Clarity AD, baseline use of antithrombotic medication (aspirin, other antiplatelets, or anticoagulants) was allowed if the patient was on a stable dose. Most exposures were to aspirin. Antithrombotic medications did not increase the risk of ARIA with LEQEMBI. The incidence of ICH: 0.9% in patients taking LEQEMBI with a concomitant antithrombotic medication vs 0.6% with no antithrombotic and 2.5% in patients taking LEQEMBI with an anticoagulant alone or with antiplatelet medication such as aspirin vs none in patients receiving placebo.

Fatal cerebral hemorrhage has occurred in 1 patient taking an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in the setting of focal neurologic symptoms of ARIA and the use of a thrombolytic agent.

Additional caution should be exercised when considering the administration of antithrombotics or a thrombolytic agent (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) to a patient already being treated with LEQEMBI. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, treating clinicians should consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy in a patient being treated with LEQEMBI.

Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LEQEMBI in patients with factors that indicate an increased risk for ICH and, in particular, patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy or patients with findings on MRI that are suggestive of CAA.

Radiographic Severity With LEQEMBI

Most ARIA-E radiographic events occurred within the first 7 doses, although ARIA can occur at any time, and patients can have >1 episode. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-E with LEQEMBI was mild in 4%, moderate in 7%, and severe in 1% of patients. Resolution on MRI occurred in 52% of ARIA-E patients by 12 weeks, 81% by 17 weeks, and 100% overall after detection. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-H microhemorrhage with LEQEMBI was mild in 9%, moderate in 2%, and severe in 3% of patients; superficial siderosis was mild in 4%, moderate in 1%, and severe in 0.4% of patients. With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-E was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (5%) vs heterozygotes (0.4%) or noncarriers (0%). With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-H was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (13.5%) vs heterozygotes (2.1%) or noncarriers (1.1%).

Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines

Baseline brain MRI and periodic monitoring with MRI are recommended. Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 14 weeks of treatment. Depending on ARIA-E and ARIA-H clinical symptoms and radiographic severity, use clinical judgment when considering whether to continue dosing or to temporarily or permanently discontinue LEQEMBI. If a patient experiences ARIA symptoms, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis, have occurred with LEQEMBI. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction and initiate appropriate therapy.

Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)

IRRs were observed—LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%—and most cases with LEQEMBI (75%) occurred with the first infusion. IRRs were mostly mild (69%) or moderate (28%). Symptoms included fever and flu-like symptoms (chills, generalized aches, feeling shaky, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation.

IRRs can occur during or after the completion of infusion. In the event of an IRR during the infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated as clinically indicated. Consider prophylactic treatment prior to future infusions with antihistamines, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% with LEQEMBI infusion every 2 weeks and ≥2% higher than placebo were IRRs (LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%), ARIA-H (LEQEMBI: 14%; placebo: 8%), ARIA-E (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 2%), headache (LEQEMBI: 11%; placebo: 8%), superficial siderosis of central nervous system (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 3%), rash (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%), and nausea/vomiting (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%)

Safety profile of LEQEMBI IQLIK for maintenance treatment was similar to LEQEMBI infusion. Patients who received LEQEMBI IQLIK experienced localized and systemic (less frequent) injection-related reactions (mild to moderate in severity)

LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) is available :

Intravenous infusion: 100 mg/mL

Subcutaneous injection: 200 mg/mL

Key Factors Driving the Growth of the SCD Market

Rising SCD Prevalence

According to DelveInsight’s assessment, in 2024, the total prevalent cases of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the 6MM were nearly 178.5K. These cases are anticipated to increase by 2034, with the majority occurring in individuals aged 18–44 years, followed by those aged 45–64 years, and fewer in younger (0–17 years) and older (65+ years) populations.

Current Standard of Care

The present treatment landscape for SCD includes NSAIDs, blood transfusions, chelating agents, nutritional supplements, and broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage complications. Established disease-modifying therapies include DROXIA (hydroxyurea), ENDARI (L-glutamine oral powder), and ADAKVEO (crizanlizumab-tmca). However, in September 2024, all lots of OXBRYTA were withdrawn across all markets, creating a treatment gap in the standard of care.

Launch of Emerging SCD Drugs

The SCD clinical trial landscape appears to be growing, with key players such as Novo Nordisk (etavopivat; NDec), Pfizer (osivelotor; inclacumab), Agios Pharmaceuticals (mitapivat), Fulcrum Therapeutics (pociredir), and others developing their assets in both early and late phases.

Sickle Cell Disease Market Analysis

Although sickle cell disease is widespread in the United States, many patients still receive inadequate care, particularly when treated by non-specialists. This highlights gaps within the healthcare system, leading to poor symptom control.

Management of SCD involves both drug-based and supportive therapies. Approved pharmacologic treatments include hydroxyurea, ENDARI (L-glutamine), ADAKVEO (crizanlizumab), CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel), and LYFGENIA (lovotibeglogene autotemcel). Pain is commonly managed with opioids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and corticosteroids. Non-drug interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation methods, biofeedback, and acupuncture, also play a supportive role.

Hydroxyurea remains the standard first-line option, while newer agents are being used to enhance symptom control. Therapies like ADAKVEO show strong adherence due to favorable dosing schedules and their ability to reduce vaso-occlusive crises.

Multiple next-generation treatments are progressing through the pipeline. Notable developers include Pfizer (inclacumab, GBT-601), Novo Nordisk (etavopivat), Bluebird Bio (lovo-cel), and Agios Pharmaceuticals (mitapivat). These emerging options aim to fill critical gaps by offering curative potential, improved safety, and greater convenience. With increasing disease burden and expected regulatory approvals, the SCD landscape is set for expansion and remains an attractive area for future investment.

[TITLE]BioNexus Gene Lab Corp. Completes Strategic Investment in Fidelion Diagnostics; Secures 15% Equity Stake in Global AI-Oncology Platform and Exclusive Southeast Asian Rights for VitaGuard™:
[TEXT]
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioNexus Gene Lab Corp. (NASDAQ: BGLC) ("BGLC" or the "Company"), a biotechnology company advancing precision diagnostics and gene-based technologies, today announced the formal completion of its strategic transaction with Fidelion Diagnostics Pte. Ltd. ("Fidelion") and Tongshu Biotechnology.

With the closing of the agreements, BGLC has become a strategic shareholder in Fidelion Diagnostics and secured exclusive commercial rights for the VitaGuard™ Tumor-Naïve Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) liquid biopsy platform across Southeast Asia (ASEAN) — positioning the Company for long-term growth as precision oncology adoption accelerates across the region.

Strategic Acquisition: 15% Equity Stake in Fidelion Diagnostics

BGLC has acquired a 15% equity position in Fidelion Diagnostics, the company that holds the exclusive global commercial rights (excluding Greater China) to the VitaGuard™ Tumor-Naïve AI-oncology platform. This investment provides BGLC shareholders with direct participation in Fidelion’s international expansion and future capital markets trajectory, including potential private financing rounds or a future “Qualified Financing Event,” which the agreements specifically include listing on Nasdaq or NYSE as options.

Exclusive Southeast Asian Commercial Rights

Simultaneously, BGLC has obtained exclusive, perpetual rights to manufacture, market, and distribute VitaGuard™ across all ASEAN markets, solidifying the Company as the sole provider of this advanced liquid biopsy technology in one of the world’s fastest-growing oncology regions.

Southeast Asia’s healthcare landscape is rapidly modernizing, with increasing demand for precision diagnostics and non-invasive tools for cancer management. The VitaGuard™ platform positions BGLC to capture early-mover advantage in this expanding market.

Capital-Efficient Deal Structure

The transaction was structured to maximize balance-sheet strength and minimize dilution:

Equity Stake (Share Swap): Acquired through a non-cash, share exchange, aligning long-term interests between BGLC and Fidelion.

Acquired through a non-cash, share exchange, aligning long-term interests between BGLC and Fidelion. Commercial License: The license fee is payable over 24 monthly installments, enabling BGLC to match outflows to expected commercial inflows.

This structure allows BGLC to accelerate market entry, build inventory, and expand regional sales functions while preserving shareholder value.

A “Dual-Asset” Value Creation Model

The completion of this transaction establishes a hybrid value model that is uncommon among micro-cap biotechnology companies:

1. A Commercial Asset

Through exclusive ASEAN rights, BGLC now controls a high-margin, high-growth cancer diagnostics franchise and has mobilized a commercial task force to engage major hospital networks and distributors across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand.

2. An Investment Asset

With a 15% equity stake in Fidelion, BGLC gains exposure to the global growth of Fidelion’s AI-driven oncology platform. This equity stake provides structured visibility into Fidelion’s pathway toward future financing milestones or potential liquidity events.

This combined model ensures that BGLC benefits both from immediate commercial activity and long-term enterprise value creation.

Management Commentary

“This partnership fundamentally elevates BGLC’s strategic position,” said Sam Tan, CEO of BioNexus Gene Lab Corp. “We are not only securing the engine for commercial growth in Southeast Asia; we are also now aligned as a strategic shareholder in a global AI-oncology platform. This structure gives our shareholders two distinct value levers — regional commercial expansion and exposure to Fidelion’s international growth and capital-market ambitions.”

Mr. Tan added, “We intentionally structured this transaction to preserve our financial strength and avoid unnecessary dilution. As the global precision oncology landscape shifts toward AI-enabled technologies, this partnership positions BGLC at the center of that transformation.”

Transaction Structure

Share Swap: BGLC now owns 15% of the issued and outstanding stock of Fidelion Diagnostics while Fidelion holds approximately 16.6% of the issued and outstanding stock of BGLC, which strongly aligns our mutual interests.

Transcript

Kevin Pho: Hi, and welcome to the show. Subscribe at KevinMD.com/podcast. Today, we welcome back Muhamad Aly Rifai. He is a psychiatrist, internist, and addiction medicine specialist. Today’s KevinMD article is “The rise of digital therapeutics in medicine.” Muhamad, welcome back to the show.

Muhamad Aly Rifai: Thank you very much for having me to talk about this very important and timely topic. Prescription digital therapeutics and digital therapeutics in medicine have come to help a lot of patients in my field of psychiatry and neurology, as well as other fields. This is going to become the wave of the future for patients by employing basically their phones to help them with the management of their illness.

Kevin Pho: For those who did not get a chance to read your article, tell us what it is about.

ADVERTISEMENT

Muhamad Aly Rifai: Basically, with the advancement of handheld devices, we have seen that handheld devices have been utilized more and more in daily life. Most people have a health app on their phone, whether it is an Apple-based phone or an Android, that measures how much they are walking. It can also connect to other health care equipment such as blood pressure cuffs and thermometers, and it can connect to their electronic watch that could check for their sleep and pulse.

Digital therapeutics and prescription digital therapeutics go a step further. They are not just a wellness tracker, and they are not just a medication app. They are medical treatments. If they are digital therapeutics, they undergo significant and rigorous testing. If they are prescription digital therapeutics, they actually undergo approval by the Food and Drug Administration that is rigorous. They undergo trials to understand and prove that they actually are effective in terms of treating the condition that they claim to treat.

We are seeing that there has been a plethora of new apps that have come out in the last 10 years, and we have seen the number accelerate. Specifically in my field of psychiatry, we have about three or four apps that are FDA-approved now as prescription digital therapeutics. That is why I wrote this article to draw attention to this coming phenomenon. It is something that a lot of our patients are going to be seeing and physicians are going to be dealing with on a regular basis.

Kevin Pho: Give us an overview of some of these conditions that they treat. In your article, you talk specifically about these digital therapeutics to address substance use disorder, ADHD, and major depressive disorder. Give us a sense of how they work from the end user’s perspective.

Muhamad Aly Rifai: Sure. The first application that was approved was actually for substance use disorders and alcohol use disorder. The app was called reSET, and it was granted FDA approval in 2017. This was one of the first apps. Basically, it had some traction but not a lot of traction. It manages a person’s daily life. It talks about healthy relationship needs, managing thoughts and emotions, and boundaries. It focuses on relapse management for individuals with drug and alcohol issues.

Later on, another app was approved for alcoholism and for opiate use. It did not get a lot of traction because it was very expensive, and insurers did not approve it on a regular basis. However, it is having a comeback. They have restructured the price, and I think people are going to be utilizing it. It is going to be modified a little bit. That software extends evidence-based therapy, such as abstinence therapy and relapse prevention for individuals who have drug and alcohol issues.

The next app was actually for attention deficit disorder, or ADHD. Because it was targeted toward adolescents, children, and adolescents, it was actually a game. It was a game-based app that targets attention and concentration. The child or the adolescent engages in this game in a pattern that would help them extend their concentration and focus. It does have a cognitive behavioral approach also to help with their concentration and focus. It is probably one of the most utilized apps because it was marketed and FDA-cleared for children and adolescents. Parents actually really advocated for their children to get that. Insurers were approving the app, and it does have very robust data. One of the apps that has the best robust data is the one for ADHD. There may be additional apps that would target different domains of the ADHD condition.

Kevin Pho: Now, these particular apps have to be prescribed. These aren’t simply apps that patients can download and pay for in the app store. These apps have to be prescribed by a physician.

Muhamad Aly Rifai: It will ask for a physician prescription. The way that is done is once the physician signs up in a portal, they are able to generate a code for the patient to utilize the app. In terms of payment for some of the newer apps, they are allowing the patient to pay for it but with a prescription from the physician. When the physician prescribes this app, that generates a code that will link the app of the patient to the physician. The physician would get feedback on the utilization of the app.

One additional point is very important. These apps are actually not dependent on the internet or broadband, so they could be utilized in underserved areas. The app could be downloaded when there is a Wi-Fi connection, but if there is not a robust Wi-Fi connection, the app can operate independently. The person could use the app. It does not need internet access. Only when it gains internet access again does it transmit the data of the utilization of the app and the patient’s progress to the physician.

It does have an emergency component as well, especially for the ones with ADHD, drug and alcohol issues, and depression. If the person is experiencing thoughts about harming themselves or harming others, it will dial 911. It does have a safety feature for the app. Basically, it is pretty straightforward for the physician to be able to prescribe that, but the insurance adoption is still pretty spotty.

Kevin Pho: Why does it have to be gatekept like that? Why can’t it just be released to the public in the app store? Are there any risks to the patients that require these apps to be prescribed?

Muhamad Aly Rifai: The app is actually on the app store, and you can download it, but you cannot get it activated without a code that gets generated by the physician. The apps are on the app store. The thought of why it requires a prescription is because it has an FDA component and it is a treatment. The thought is that if you have it available without physician supervision, individuals who have severe conditions may think that they could manage their condition just with an app and do not need to consult with a physician or need further treatment.

The FDA wants to make sure that the physician is involved in ensuring that the app is an adjunct treatment because it is not the main treatment. In the case of the app for depression, which is called Rejoyn, it is basically an adjunct treatment for individuals who are already on medications, such as antidepressant medications, or who are receiving other treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. We want to make sure that the individual is well cared for. It is not just that you download the app and think that is it and your depression is treated. Individuals may have untoward issues related to the fact that their condition is pretty severe, and they just thought that they could download an app and have their condition treated.

Kevin Pho: What are some of the indications where physicians can consider prescribing an app like this? For patients who are already being treated for say, ADHD and depression, what are some of the indications where prescribing an app may be in that patient’s best interest?

Muhamad Aly Rifai: Sure. Let’s talk a little bit about the app that is actually FDA-approved for depression. It is called Rejoyn. It is an adjunct app that employs a cognitive behavioral therapy approach for individuals who have depression. It is an add-on to medications. As you know, it is very difficult to find therapists. There is a lack of access to therapists, and there is very little access to psychiatrists. Primary care doctors could start their patients on antidepressant medications and add on the app, which would be a component of cognitive behavioral therapy.

It is a prescribed course of cognitive behavioral therapy for six weeks. It has modules where a person does a task every day focusing on their behavior, their concentration, their thought perception, and cognitive distortion. It does have a prescribed course of cognitive behavioral therapy that is FDA-approved. That is how it works as an adjunct to medications.

When it is prescribed by a physician, the physician is involved in that app and receives periodic reporting about how their patient’s progress is. Especially if the patient basically has significant adverse effects or develops suicidal ideation, the physician is notified and there is access to help if the patient’s condition deteriorates.

For example, the app for depression, Rejoyn, is available. The person could pay for the app. The price that I saw on their website is $200. You could download it and get a prescription from your physician if you are battling with a condition of depression or anxiety. Then you could pay for the app and get it activated. I think that they are becoming more and more available and more and more affordable for individuals as opposed to seeing a therapist.

Kevin Pho: Have you had personal experience prescribing these apps or heard about your colleagues prescribing these apps? What have their experiences or experiences that you have heard been like?

Muhamad Aly Rifai: When I got introduced to this app, I actually asked to see the app. The company that developed the app will give physicians a trial copy of the app so you can test it. I have it on my iPad, and I see the Rejoyn digital therapeutic. Basically, it has classes. You interact with the app on a daily basis for a few minutes with cognitive behavioral components. The app seems to be very helpful.

I tried it myself just to see what the patient’s experience with this app is. I have prescribed it for a few patients. They were very satisfied and have had good success in terms of it being an adjunct treatment for their depression. For example, if they are a busy professional who cannot go see a therapist, it helps. In addition to medications, it does boost the rates of response to medications in individuals who have depression.

There is very little adoption with a lot of my colleagues, and this is why I am trying to raise attention to it. It is a new topic. However, our patients are faster than us physicians. Our patients are on their phone all the time. They have all these apps. Why not use a prescription digital therapeutic to improve their condition? There are other digital therapeutics, for example, for managing migraine headaches that are prescription digital therapeutics. They are working on developing multiple other prescription digital therapeutics for other conditions.

I think that is the future. As physicians, we have to be able to get on that wave to basically be able to help our patients because our patients are there. They are going to come to us and ask if we can prescribe this for them. You cannot just tell your patients that you do not know what they are talking about. We have to be very well-educated about these things.

Kevin Pho: Logistically, how do physicians prescribe these apps?

Muhamad Aly Rifai: The physician will

[TITLE]Eisai Presents New Data on the Continued and Expanding Benefit of LEQEMBI® (lecanemab-irmb) Maintenance Treatment in Early Alzheimer’s Disease at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conf:
[TEXT]
Long-term LEQEMBI treatment suggests potential to delay disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to moderate Alzheimer’s disease by up to 8.3 years in low-amyloid group who started treatment at an early stage

New safety and efficacy data presented at scientific symposium on subcutaneous formulation for LEQEMBI initiation treatment, which is under regulatory review in the United States

TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that the latest findings on time savings with continued treatment with humanized anti-soluble aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody lecanemab (generic name, U.S. brand name LEQEMBI®) were presented at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference. Additionally, a scientific symposium was held on the subcutaneous formulation (SC-AI), which was approved for maintenance treatment in the United States in August 2025, and the rolling supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for initiation treatment was completed in November 2025. The application for a subcutaneous injectable formulation in Japan was submitted in November 2025.

Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) is a progressive, relentless disease with Aβ and tau as hallmarks, that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* (PF) that begins before amyloid plaque removal and continues afterward.1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both PF and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

Estimating the 10-Year Time-Savings Benefits of Lecanemab Treatment (Presentation: December 3, 2:40 PM PT)

This analysis used data from the Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE) and 16 clinical studies of monoclonal antibodies for AD to estimate long-term AD progression over 10 years and the slowing effect of continued lecanemab treatment. The analysis evaluated estimated “time savings” (slowing of disease progression) compared to natural decline based on ADNI** (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) data (untreated group), using Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). These results suggest that early initiation and long-term lecanemab treatment may continue to slow AD progression and help maintain cognitive function over a longer period.

Findings from each group:

Time Savings from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Due to AD to Mild AD The time to progression from MCI due to AD to mild AD was 7.2 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to mild AD took 9.7 years, indicating a time savings of 2.5 years. In the low-amyloid group (patients who started treatment at an early stage: amyloid PET <60 centiloids), the time to progression from MCI to mild AD was 13.2 years with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, suggesting a time savings of 6.0 years.

Time Savings from MCI due to AD to Moderate AD

The time to progression from MCI due to AD to moderate AD was 10.1 years in the untreated group, whereas with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD, progression to moderate AD took 13.6 years, indicating a time savings of 3.5 years. In the low-amyloid group, the time to progression with continued LEQEMBI treatment to the onset of moderate AD was 18.4 years, suggesting a time savings of 8.3 years.

These findings indicate that earlier initiation of LEQEMBI treatment may provide a greater delay in disease progression. Furthermore, each additional year on LEQEMBI could further delay disease progression compared to stopping treatment, even long after plaque is expected to have been cleared.

Lecanemab Subcutaneous Formulation for Treatment Initiation in Early Alzheimer’s Disease: Optimizing Patient Care with a Potential New Option (Symposium Presentation: December 3, 3:10 PM PT)

In this symposium, the latest data from the lecanemab subcutaneous clinical development program were presented focusing on treatment initiation, including results from the subcutaneous (SC) formulation subcohort (n=273) in the Clarity AD trial OLE. It was shown that weekly administration of lecanemab SC-AI at 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) demonstrated bioequivalence in drug exposure compared to intravenous (IV) dosing of 10 mg/kg every two weeks (exposure ratio: 104%, 90% CI: 99.1%–109%).

Based on clinical data and modeling analysis, the effect on amyloid removal in the brain and safety (ARIA-E incidence) was shown to be independent of the route of administration and explained by exposure, suggesting that weekly 500 mg SC dosing provides similar efficacy and safety to biweekly 10 mg/kg IV dosing. Additionally, ARIA-E incidence was also predicted to be comparable between SC and IV administration (12.4% overall, 30.9% in ApoE4 homozygotes).

In this sub-cohort which had prior exposure to lecanemab, safety evaluation showed systemic infusion reactions occurred in 0% of patients receiving 500 mg SC, all of whom had previously received IV lecanemab, and 1.4% of patients who initiated on 720 mg SC by vial, which is favorable compared to systemic infusion reactions in the IV group (26.4%). Immunogenicity assessment indicated a low incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at 1.4%.

These results indicate that the subcutaneous formulations of lecanemab, designed with consideration for the convenience of patients and their care partners, maintains efficacy with a low incidence of systemic infusion reactions, and is otherwise equivalent to conventional IV administration.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

* Protofibrils are thought to be the most toxic Aβ species that contribute to brain damage in AD and play a major role in the cognitive decline of this progressive and devastating disease. Protofibrils can cause neuronal and synaptic damage in the brain, which can subsequently adversely affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms.3 The mechanism by which this occurs has been reported not only by increasing the formation of insoluble Aβ plaques, but also by directly damaging signaling between neurons and other cells. It is believed that reducing protofibrils may reduce neuronal damage and cognitive impairment, potentially preventing the progression of AD.4

** ADNI is a clinical research project launched in 2005 to develop methods to predict the onset and progression of AD and to confirm the effectiveness of treatments. The project involves a multi-year longitudinal observation targeting healthy elderly individuals as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early stages of AD.

INDICATION

LEQEMBI® is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with LEQEMBI should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: AMYLOID-RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES (ARIA) Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA, characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Incidence and timing of ARIA vary among treatments. ARIA usually occurs early in treatment and is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events, including seizure and status epilepticus, can occur. ARIA can be fatal. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) >1 cm, some of which have been fatal, have been observed with this class of medications. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy to a patient being treated with LEQEMBI. Apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) Homozygotes : Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes (~15% of patients with AD) treated with this class of medications have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious, and severe radiographic ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results. Prescribers should inform patients that if genotype testing is not performed, they can still be treated with LEQEMBI; however, it cannot be determined if they are ApoE ε4 homozygotes and at higher risk for ARIA.

Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of AD and the potential risk of serious ARIA events when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBI.

CONTRAINDICATION

Contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to lecanemab-irmb or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities

Medications in this class, including LEQEMBI, can cause ARIA-E, which can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H, which includes microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. ARIA can occur spontaneously in patients with AD, particularly in patients with MRI findings suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), such as pretreatment microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis. ARIA-H generally occurs with ARIA-E. Reported ARIA symptoms may include headache, confusion, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, and gait difficulty. Focal neurologic deficits may also occur. Symptoms usually resolve over time.

Incidence of ARIA

Symptomatic ARIA occurred in 3% and serious ARIA symptoms in 0.7% with LEQEMBI. Clinical ARIA symptoms resolved in 79% of patients during the period of observation. ARIA, including asymptomatic radiographic events, was observed: LEQEMBI, 21%; placebo, 9%. ARIA-E was observed: LEQEMBI, 13%; placebo, 2%. ARIA-H was observed: LEQEMBI, 17%; placebo, 9%. No increase in isolated ARIA-H was observed for LEQEMBI vs placebo.

Incidence of ICH

ICH >1 cm in diameter was reported in 0.7% with LEQEMBI vs 0.1% with placebo. Fatal events of ICH in patients taking LEQEMBI have been observed.

Risk Factors of ARIA and ICH

ApoE ε4 Carrier Status

Of the patients taking LEQEMBI, 16% were ApoE ε4 homozygotes, 53% were heterozygotes, and 31% were noncarriers. With LEQEMBI, ARIA was higher in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (LEQEMBI: 45%; placebo: 22%) than in heterozygotes (LEQEMBI: 19%; placebo: 9%) and noncarriers (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 4%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 9% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes vs 2% of heterozygotes and 1% of noncarriers. Serious ARIA events occurred in 3% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes and in ~1% of heterozygotes and noncarriers. The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.

Radiographic Findings of CAA

Neuroimaging findings that may indicate CAA include evidence of prior ICH, cerebral microhemorrhage, and cortical superficial siderosis. CAA has an increased risk for ICH. The presence of an ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with CAA.

The baseline presence of at least 2 microhemorrhages or the presence of at least 1 area of superficial siderosis on MRI, which may be suggestive of CAA, have been identified as risk factors for ARIA. Patients were excluded from Clarity AD for the presence of >4 microhemorrhages and additional findings suggestive of CAA (prior cerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in greatest diameter, superficial siderosis, vasogenic edema) or other lesions (aneurysm, vascular malformation) that could potentially increase the risk of ICH.

Concomitant Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Medication

In Clarity AD, baseline use of antithrombotic medication (aspirin, other antiplatelets, or anticoagulants) was allowed if the patient was on a stable dose. Most exposures were to aspirin. Antithrombotic medications did not increase the risk of ARIA with LEQEMBI. The incidence of ICH: 0.9% in patients taking LEQEMBI with a concomitant antithrombotic medication vs 0.6% with no antithrombotic and 2.5% in patients taking LEQEMBI with an anticoagulant alone or with antiplatelet medication such as aspirin vs none in patients receiving placebo.

Fatal cerebral hemorrhage has occurred in 1 patient taking an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in the setting of focal neurologic symptoms of ARIA and the use of a thrombolytic agent.

Additional caution should be exercised when considering the administration of antithrombotics or a thrombolytic agent (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) to a patient already being treated with LEQEMBI. Because ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic an ischemic stroke, treating clinicians should consider whether such symptoms could be due to ARIA-E before giving thrombolytic therapy in a patient being treated with LEQEMBI.

Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LEQEMBI in patients with factors that indicate an increased risk for ICH and, in particular, patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy or patients with findings on MRI that are suggestive of CAA.

Radiographic Severity With LEQEMBI

Most ARIA-E radiographic events occurred within the first 7 doses, although ARIA can occur at any time, and patients can have >1 episode. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-E with LEQEMBI was mild in 4%, moderate in 7%, and severe in 1% of patients. Resolution on MRI occurred in 52% of ARIA-E patients by 12 weeks, 81% by 17 weeks, and 100% overall after detection. Maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-H microhemorrhage with LEQEMBI was mild in 9%, moderate in 2%, and severe in 3% of patients; superficial siderosis was mild in 4%, moderate in 1%, and severe in 0.4% of patients. With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-E was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (5%) vs heterozygotes (0.4%) or noncarriers (0%). With LEQEMBI, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-H was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (13.5%) vs heterozygotes (2.1%) or noncarriers (1.1%).

Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines

Baseline brain MRI and periodic monitoring with MRI are recommended. Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 14 weeks of treatment. Depending on ARIA-E and ARIA-H clinical symptoms and radiographic severity, use clinical judgment when considering whether to continue dosing or to temporarily or permanently discontinue LEQEMBI. If a patient experiences ARIA symptoms, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis, have occurred with LEQEMBI. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction and initiate appropriate therapy.

Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)

IRRs were observed—LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%—and most cases with LEQEMBI (75%) occurred with the first infusion. IRRs were mostly mild (69%) or moderate (28%). Symptoms included fever and flu-like symptoms (chills, generalized aches, feeling shaky, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation.

IRRs can occur during or after the completion of infusion. In the event of an IRR during the infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated as clinically indicated. Consider prophylactic treatment prior to future infusions with antihistamines, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% with LEQEMBI infusion every 2 weeks and ≥2% higher than placebo were IRRs (LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%), ARIA-H (LEQEMBI: 14%; placebo: 8%), ARIA-E (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 2%), headache (LEQEMBI: 11%; placebo: 8%), superficial siderosis of central nervous system (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 3%), rash (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%), and nausea/vomiting (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%)

Safety profile of LEQEMBI IQLIK for maintenance treatment was similar to LEQEMBI infusion. Patients who received LEQEMBI IQLIK experienced localized and systemic (less frequent) injection-related reactions (mild to moderate in severity)

[TITLE]FDA grants traditional approval to pirtobrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma:
[TEXT]
On December 3, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration granted traditional approval to pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca, Eli Lilly and Company) for adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have previously been treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor. In 2023, FDA granted accelerated approval to pirtobrutinib for adults with CLL/SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor.

Full prescribing information for Jaypirca will be posted here.

Efficacy and Safety

Efficacy was evaluated in BRUIN-CLL-321 (NCT 04666038), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial. The trial randomized 238 patients who were previously treated for CLL/SLL, including a covalent BTK inhibitor. Patients previously treated with a non-covalent BTK inhibitor were not permitted. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either pirtobrutinib or investigator’s choice of idelalisib plus a rituximab product (IR) or bendamustine plus a rituximab product (BR). Crossover to JAYPIRCA monotherapy was permitted for patients in the investigator’s choice arm after confirmed disease progression.

The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by an independent review committee using 2018 iwCLL criteria. Median PFS was 11.2 months (95% CI: 9.5, 11.4) in the pirtobrutinib arm and 8.7 months (95% CI: 7.2, 10.2) in the investigator’s choice of IR/BR arm (Hazard ratio 0.58 [95% CI: 0.38, 0.89]; p-value 0.0105). Of the 119 patients in the investigator’s choice arm, 50 crossed over to receive JAYPIRCA therapy. At an updated analysis with a median follow-up time of 19.8 months, the HR for overall survival (OS) was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.75).

The prescribing information includes warnings and precautions for infections, hemorrhage, cytopenias, cardiac arrythmias, secondary primary malignancies, hepatotoxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Recommended Dosage

The recommended pirtobrutinib dose is 200 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Expedited Programs

This review used the Assessment Aid, a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA’s assessment.

Pirtobrutinib received orphan drug designation. A description of FDA expedited programs is in the Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics.

Healthcare professionals should report all serious adverse events suspected to be associated with the use of any medicine and device to FDA’s MedWatch Reporting System or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.
