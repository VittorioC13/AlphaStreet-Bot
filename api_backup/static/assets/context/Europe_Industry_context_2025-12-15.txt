[TITLE]Motiv, Workhorse merge to take on the ICE establishment:
[TEXT]
Electric medium-duty startups Motive and Workhorse have logged millions of miles across their customer fleets — and by joining forces, they’re out to prove, once and for all, that electric vehicles can get the job done.

Following shareholder votes last month, Ohio-based Workhorse and San Francisco-based Motive are merging to form one of the largest commercial electric vehicle and last-mile delivery telematics solutions companies in the industry.

The all-stock transaction, announced last week, values the combined company at approximately $105 million and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to Workhorse shareholder approval. Under the terms of the agreement, Motiv’s controlling investor will become the majority owner with approximately 62.5% of the combined company, while Workhorse shareholders will maintain a significant equity stake of approximately 26.5%. FREIGHTWAVES

The move is intended to combine Workhorse’ manufacturing capabilities and nationwide dealer network with Motiv’s proven product portfolio and existing fleet relationships to serve the growing $23 billion medium-duty truck segment with a full range of Class 4-6 electric vehicles that plays to the strengths of both companies while, at the same time, proving them with economies of scale they’ll need to survive the next wave of fake “the EV market is dead” headlines.

“Bringing together two leading OEMs in the medium-duty space strengthens our ability to reduce the cost of electric trucks and make the total cost of ownership even more compelling,” said Scott Griffith, CEO of Motiv, who will lead the combined company. “We believe this is a coming-of-age moment — not just for Motiv and Workhorse, but for the industry as a whole.”

The companies anticipate a minimum of $20 million in cost synergies by the end of 2026 through reductions in redundant R&D, G&A, and facility costs (and, of course, the associated layoffs).

Workhorse’s Union City facility has the capacity to eventually produce up to 5,000 trucks per year — a significant manufacturing scale for the merged operation and light years ahead of what Motiv’s existing facilities can crank out.

“This transaction represents a significant milestone for Workhorse, our customers, our stakeholders and our shareholders,” Rick Dauch, CEO of Workhorse and advisor to the new, combined company told FreightWaves. “We believe Motiv is the right partner to support the advancement of our combined product roadmap and capture new growth opportunities.”

The new, combined electric box van company will being life with 10 of the largest medium-duty fleets in North America as existing customers, and hopes to expand their line of offerings into the electric bus and RV markets in the years to come.

Workhorse and Motive can spin this merger however they like — but this move is as much

[TITLE]XPENG Looking to Start EV Production in Malaysia:
[TEXT]
XPENG reportedly told press in Malaysia that it is in negotiations with EP Manufacturing Bhd to get EV production underway in Malaysia.

Mass production is supposed to begin at some point in 2026. The focus is not just on producing cars for Malaysia, but on producing cars for right-hand markets across the Asean region.

“EPMB is a Malaysian manufacturer of auto components such as plastic and aluminum body parts,” The Edge Malaysia writes. “Xpeng hopes to leverage EPMB’s existing capacity and planned expansions for EV production in Malaysia, the Chinese company said in a statement.”

No, we don’t have any details on production volume targets, models to be produced there, the investment total, or really anything else.

This follows XPENG starting production in Indonesia in July, at its first factory outside of China. The company is assembling the X9 there. Additionally, Magna announced in September that it would produce XPENG vehicles in Graz, Austria. Naturally, this is a way for XPENG to no longer have tariffs slapped on its vehicles being sold in the EU.

XPENG sales are up a lot this year. Across the first 11 months of the year, sales are up 156%, reaching 391,937 units. The company is doing great in its home market of China, but it could surely benefit from quickly growing overseas sales.

[TITLE]EU Lawmakers to Weigh Easing Capital Rules on Safest Bank Bonds:

[TITLE]ECB to simplify bank capital rules but stick to buffer requirements:

The European Central Bank (ECB) outlined plans to simplify bank regulation and capital rules on Thursday, but is sticking to its pledge not to ease overall capital reserve requirements.

The authority said the capital proposals are focused on having fewer – rather than lower – types of capital buffers lenders must hold to protect their balance sheets against shock losses.

Irish woman Sharon Donnery, a member of the ECB banking supervisory board, was a key member of the taskforce set up earlier this year to ease the burden of banking supervision following more than a decade of tighter rules in the wake of the global financial crisis, which resulted in taxpayer-funded bailouts of European banks.

In a statement, the ECB said its aim was to “simplify the framework” without endangering the “resilience of the European banking system”.

The ECB’s top decision-making body, its governing council, backed the recommendations. They will now be sent to the European Commission for consideration as part of a wider push by Brussels to streamline policies and laws to make the European Union more competitive.*

The taskforce concluded that the bloc’s current capital rules are overly complex and risk backfiring as investors may not understand them. European banks are at present subject to a number of individual capital buffers, four of which the ECB wants to merge into two.

“The variety of capital elements in place in the EU may decrease transparency and increase uncertainty as market participants face more challenges in assessing the capital framework,” the report said.

It suggested combining several individual capital surcharges that the ECB at present applies to banks based on their individual risk profile.

The report did not explicitly state whether the combined amount of capital that banks would be required to hold would stay the same, but it said lenders should “sustain current levels of resilience” to absorb losses in a crisis.

The ECB also proposed exempting more small lenders from the international Basel standards, which are designed for large, risky lenders with cross-border business.

At present, all banks with more than €5 billion in assets need to meet those rules, which the taskforce said created “undue complexity” and costs for lenders that were too small to have repercussions on financial stability.

The ECB suggested raising the threshold and adding more exemptions for smaller banks.

Still, the three domestic Irish lenders, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB will remain subject to standards set for larger banks.

The European Banking Federation welcomed the ECB’s report but said “concrete ‌and determined steps must now follow to enhance the global competitiveness of the EU’s financial sector”. – Additional reporting: Reuters, Financial Times

*Sentence corrected to read that the recommendations will now - rather than not - be sent to Brussels

Banks in the Asia-Pacific region, including those in India, have built stronger capital positions compared to their counterparts in the United States and Western Europe, Moody's highlighted in its latest survey report.The survey pointed out that a comparison of the largest banks in Asia-Pacific systems with peers in the US and Western Europe shows they generally have built strong capital positions under prudent regulatory supervision.Further, it noted that large Asia-Pacific banks' risk-weighted asset (RWA) densities reflect their underlying asset risks, consistent with their credit losses for the past 10 years. It also added that the banks' RWA densities vary across the Asia-Pacific.Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) represent a bank's assets adjusted for risk levels, meaning loans or investments considered riskier are assigned higher weights. A bank with higher RWA density indicates that a larger part of its assets carries higher risk.Explaining the capital strength, Moody's highlighted, "Large private sector banks in India have high CET1 capital adequacy and leverage ratios because their internal capital generation has outpaced their RWA growth in the past couple of years, and they can raise equity easily from capital markets when needed."CET1, or Common Equity Tier 1 capital, refers to a bank's core capital, primarily common shares and retained earnings, which serves as the first line of financial protection against losses. A higher CET1 ratio indicates a stronger ability to absorb shocks without affecting depositors.The report mentioned that as of the end of 2024, the average reported CET1 capital adequacy ratios of the large banks in Hong Kong, India, Korea in the sample stood at 18.0 per cent, 14.7 per cent, and 14.5 per cent, respectively, all above 13.5 per cent for the four largest banks in the US and 13.8 per cent for the top six banks in Western Europe.According to the survey, these banks can also raise equity easily from the capital markets when required. However, it stated that their government-owned peers remain weaker than private banks in both metrics.The report attributed the higher RWA densities in India, Vietnam and among certain Chinese banks to the use of the standardized approach, a regulatory method that assigns fixed risk weights rather than relying on banks' internal risk assessment models.It added that regulators in India have announced plans allowing banks to transition to the more advanced IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) approach by 2028, a move expected to lower RWA densities if successfully implemented.For India, the sample included State Bank of India ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank , together accounting for approximately 50 per cent of system assets.Overall, the report assessed a total of 35 banks across eight key Asia-Pacific banking systems, representing 75 per cent of total assets of all rated banks in these markets.

[TITLE]Grande Group Limited Announces Financial Results for the First Half of Fiscal Year 2026:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GRANDE GROUP LIMITED (“GRAN” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: GRAN), a Hong Kong-based financial services provider which principally engages in the provision of corporate finance advisory services and IPO sponsor services through its Hong Kong subsidiary, Grande Capital Limited, today announced its unaudited financial results for the six months ended September 30, 2025 (“First Half 2026”).

First Half of Fiscal Year 2026 Financial Results

For the Six Months Ended

September 30, Selected Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income Data 2025

USD 2024

USD Change

% Revenue 293,929 1,750,043 (83.2 ) Cost of revenue 336,543 499,092 (32.6 ) General and administrative expenses 1,158,751 716,183 61.8 Unrealized loss on equity security 370,666 — N/A Provision for income taxes — 97,248 (100.0 ) Net (loss) income (1,481,318 ) 442,832 (434.5 ) (Loss) income per share - basic and diluted (0.06 ) 0.04 (250.0 )

Revenues

Revenues decreased by 83.2% from $1,750,043 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 to $293,929 for the six months ended September 30, 2025. The decrease was primarily due to decrease in our initial public offering (“IPO”) sponsorship services, referral services, general advisory services, independent financial advisory services and compliance advisory services.

● Revenues from IPO sponsorship services was $52,083 in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $234,686 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to fewer milestone achievements in the First half 2026 for a continuing IPO engagement with the same client, as revenue from such services is recognized only upon the completion of specific listing-related milestones. ● Revenues from referral services was $nil in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $568,978 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the Company had no referral arrangement requiring the introduction of other professional parties in which we may obtain referral fees. Such referral fee is generally based on a percentage of the fee charged by our clients in the particular fund-raising exercises. ● Revenues from general advisory services, independent financial advisory services and compliance advisory services were $241,846 in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $892,597 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a lower number of advisory engagements and slower progress in ongoing projects, which resulted in fewer achievement of milestones and recognized as revenue during the First Half 2026.

Cost of revenue

Our cost of revenue decreased by $162,549, or 32.57%, from $499,092 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 to $336,543 for the six months ended September 30, 2025. This decrease was mainly attributable to decrease in staff costs and project related costs. The decrease in staff costs in First Half 2026 was due to a reduction in the number of staff, with a headcount of 18 as of September 30, 2025, compared to 20 as of September 30, 2024.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses were approximately 394.2% and 40.9% of total revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2025 and the six months ended September 30, 2024 respectively. General and administrative expenses are mainly management and office salaries and employee benefits, depreciation of office equipment and leasehold improvement, operating lease cost, transportation and entertainment and other office expenses. The general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.4 million or 61.8% from $0.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 to $1.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2025, mainly due to discretionary one-time bonuses payable to employees in administrative functions and higher traveling and entertainment expenses for client acquisition purposes.

Unrealized loss on equity security

During the six months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized an unrealized loss on equity security of $370,666 (2024: nil). This loss stems from its beneficial ownership in a publicly-traded company via an external investment arrangement, measured at fair value using quoted market prices.

Provision for income taxes

Our income tax expense changed from $97,248 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 to $nil for the six months ended September 30, 2025. Such change was attributable to the shift from net profit before provision for income taxes in the 2024 period to a net loss before provision for income taxes in the 2025 period, resulting in no current tax obligation for the interim period.

Net loss

Our net loss was $1,481,318 for the six months ended September 30, 2025, a marked shift from net income of $442,832 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Such change was the result of the combination of a substantial 83.20% decline in revenue, a $370,666 unrealized loss on equity securities, a 61.80% increase in general and administrative expenses, and a partial offset from a 32.57% reduction in cost of revenue.

Cash Flow

The table below sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:

For the Six Months

Ended September 30, 2025 2024 USD USD Net cash provided by operating activities 264,397 331,322 Net cash used in investing activities (550,000 ) — Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 9,696,399 (1,010,715 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 9,410,796 (679,393 )

Net cash provided by operating activities was $264,397 in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $331,322 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was mainly due to the swing from net income to net loss in the First Half 2026, partially offset by non-cash items including the $370,666 unrealized loss on equity security, depreciation, and operating lease right-of-use asset amortization. Changes in operating assets and liabilities also had a negative impact on operating activities for the First Half 2026. These impacts include favorable cash inflows attributable to movements in accounts receivable and contract assets, partially offset by cash outflows associated with accrued expenses, lease liabilities and income tax payable.

Net cash used in investing activities was $500,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to no cash outflow from investing activities in the 2024 comparable period. This change was entirely attributable to the Company’s $500,000 investment in equity security during the First Half 2026.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $9,696,399 for the six months ended September 30, 2025, a substantial reversal from net cash used in financing activities of $1,010,715 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. This dramatic shift was primarily driven by the $9,778,464 in net proceeds from the Company’s IPO and a $314,101 contribution from a non-controlling shareholder of a subsidiary during the First Half 2026, neither of which had a corresponding amount in 2024. These significant cash inflows were partially offset by $396,181 in payments of offering costs related to the IPO.

Recent Events

Initial Public Offering

On July 2, 2025, the Company closed its initial public offering of 1,875,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares), priced at $5.00 per share. Subsequently, the underwriter exercised its Over-allotment option in full, resulting in the issuance of an additional 281,250 Class A Ordinary Shares at the same offering price. The gross proceeds received from the Company’s initial public offering, including the proceeds from the sale of the over-allotment shares, totalled US$10.78 million. The Class A Ordinary Shares were previously approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and commenced trading under the ticker symbol “GRAN” on July 1, 2025.

Acquisition of Proplus Company Limited

On October 1, 2025, Grande Group has entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with United One Global Limited (the “Seller”). Pursuant to the SPA, Grande Group agreed to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Proplus Company Limited (the “Target Company”) from the Seller, the then sole shareholder of the Target Company, for consideration consisting of a cash payment in the amount of HK$78,000,000 (approximately $10,000,000) in cash, subject to certain terms. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Harvest Group Limited and Shenzhen Zhenjing Investment Consulting Co., Ltd., the Target Company principally engaged in supplying course materials.

[TITLE]TSA renews push to end collective bargaining agreement for airport security screeners:
[TEXT]
The Transportation Security Administration is renewing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s push to end a collective bargaining agreement with airport screening officers — the second such attempt this year, coming just a month after the longest government shutdown on record.

The agency said Friday the move relies on a September memo from Noem — issued months after a federal judge blocked her earlier directive — that says TSA screeners “have a primary function of national security” and therefore should not engage in collective bargaining or be represented by a union.

The American Federation of Government Employees swiftly vowed to fight the decision, calling it illegal and a violation of the preliminary injunction issued in June that halted Noem’s first attempt to terminate the contract covering 47,000 workers.

In the September memo cited by TSA, Noem acknowledged the injunction but did not explain why she concluded it did not prohibit her from pursuing the same outcome through a new directive while the case remains pending. The injunction barred TSA from rescinding the union contract or enforcing Noem’s orders to dismiss pending grievances, but it did not state whether its restrictions would extend to future directives by Noem.

“It definitely seems like they’re using all loopholes to try to eliminate collective bargaining rights for the transportation security officers,” Johnny Jones, secretary-treasurer of the bargaining unit for TSA workers, said Friday in a phone interview.

TSA declined Friday to comment on the union’s assertions. An emailed request for comment was sent to Homeland Security.

The agency said it plans to rescind the current seven-year contract in January and replace it with a new “security-focused framework.” The agreement, reached last May, was supposed to expire in 2031.

Adam Stahl, acting TSA deputy administrator, said in a statement that airport screeners “need to be focused on their mission of keeping travelers safe.”

“Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, we are ridding the agency of wasteful and time-consuming activities that distracted our officers from their crucial work,” Stahl said.

The announcement also comes weeks after Noem held a news conference in which she handed out $10,000 bonus checks to TSA officers who she said went “above and beyond” during the 43-day shutdown, when thousands of airport screeners continued reporting for duty despite missing more than six weeks of pay during the lapse in funding.

“This is how they’re going to be repaid for coming to work every single day during the government shutdown?” Jones said, calling the agency’s decision “a slap in the face to the people they’re handing checks to.”

Noem issued her first memo in February rescinding the collective bargaining agreement. But the union sued, claiming the move was retaliation for AFGE’s resistance to the Trump administration’s actions affecting federal workers, such as firing probationary employees. A trial is currently scheduled for next year.

In granting the preliminary injunction in June, U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman of Seattle said the order was necessary to preserve the rights and benefits TSA workers have long held under union representation.

Pechman wrote that AFGE had shown in its lawsuit that Noem’s directive “constitutes impermissible retaliation,” likely violated the union’s due process, and was “arbitrary and capricious” — findings that the judge said make it likely AFGE will ultimately prevail.

AFGE represents about 800,000 federal government employees and has been pushing back as the Trump administration has laid the groundwork to weaken or eliminate protections for federal workers in an effort to shrink the bureaucracy.

Noem issued her first memo in February rescinding the collective bargaining agreement. But the union sued, claiming the move was retaliation for AFGE's resistance to the Trump administration's actions affecting federal workers, such as firing probationary employees. A trial is currently scheduled for next year.

In granting the preliminary injunction in June, U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman of Seattle said the order was necessary to preserve the rights and benefits TSA workers have long held under union representation.

Pechman wrote that AFGE had shown in its lawsuit that Noem’s directive “constitutes impermissible retaliation,” likely violated the union's due process, and was “arbitrary and capricious” — findings that the judge said make it likely AFGE will ultimately prevail.

AFGE represents about 800,000 federal government employees and has been pushing back as the Trump administration has laid the groundwork to weaken or eliminate protections for federal workers in an effort to shrink the bureaucracy.

[TITLE]Jim Cramer Considers Union Pacific – Norfolk Southern Deal a “Good One”:
[TEXT]
Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer highlighted in light of the Fed rate cut. Cramer was bullish on the stock due to the upcoming merger, as he stated, “You can buy Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern because that takeover is a good one.”

Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) works in the railroad business as the company transports a variety of goods, including agricultural products, chemicals, construction materials, energy products, and vehicles. During the December 3 episode, Cramer called the merger a “great situation,” as the Mad Money host commented:

“Next group… the transports, which are also in breakout mode. We know that Union Pacific’s doing extraordinarily well, about to merge with Norfolk Southern. Great situation.”

Moreover, Cramer discussed the news of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) buying Norfolk Southern during the July 29 episode. He said:

“The rash of takeovers didn’t for once sour, it didn’t create any buying, and not even Union Pacific buying Norfolk Southern, truly creating a continent-wide railroad colossus, assuming the deal gets approved. Now, that’s much more likely under Trump than it was under Biden. But there are legitimate antitrust concerns. I think they will get the deal done, but not for a long time. Hence why target Norfolk Southern saw its stock drop $8 and 72 cents, although it’s still up nicely from when my colleague David Faber broke the story a few weeks ago, when you could still profit from it.”

With air quality deteriorating sharply across the Delhi-NCR, authorities on Saturday invoked the strictest curbs under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), imposing emergency restrictions across the region.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said its GRAP sub-committee decided to enforce all measures under Stage IV, classified as ‘Severe+’, after pollution levels breached critical thresholds. In an official statement, the panel said, “Keeping in view the prevailing trend of air quality and in an effort to prevent further deterioration, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP has decided to invoke all actions envisaged under Stage IV of the extant GRAP—‘Severe+’ air quality (Delhi AQI above 450)—with immediate effect across the entire NCR.”The commission added that these emergency measures would come into force in addition to the restrictions already being implemented under Stages I, II and III of the GRAP.Read more: Delhi-NCR pollution: GRAP-IV imposed as AQI crosses 450; check what's allowed and what's restricted The strictest norms comes hours after GRAP-III was invoked in the national capital due to the rising air pollution on Saturday.CAQM highlighted an increasing trend in Delhi's AQI and noted that, in its earlier meeting on December 12, the Sub-Committee on GRAP reviewed the region's deteriorating air quality and decided to keep a close watch on the situation.The change in the wind direction/pattern since yesterday and winds blowing easterly has further worsened the situation for the PM 2.5 concentrations, which is the predominant pollutant during the winter season and is on increasing trend. Almost all the AQI stations in Delhi are showing PM 2.5 as the predominant pollutant and the AQI of Delhi has been recorded as 387at 6:00 AM, 393 at 8:00 AM and recorded as 401 at 10:00 AM today already crossing the "Severe" category mark, the order highlighted.Stage 3 of GRAP includes a ban on construction and demolition activities in Delhi and the NCR.Delhi's air quality deteriorated sharply on Saturday morning, with the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) at 393 around 8 am, placing it in the 'Very Poor' category, according to data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The situation continues with the poor air quality observed on Friday. Several parts of the national capital remained enveloped in a dense layer of toxic smog, severely affecting visibility and causing discomfort to residents.

[TITLE]NUPRC issues permits to 28 companies for flare gas utilisation, targets $2 billion investment:
[TEXT]
The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) said it has issued permits to 28 companies to access flare gas, marking a significant step towards reducing carbon emissions and boosting energy production in the country.

The Nigerian government launched the National Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme in 2016 to involve third-party investors or off-takers in harnessing gas released as a byproduct of oil production.

The programme was one of the government’s initiatives to drive the attainment of zero routine gas flaring by 2035 and net zero emissions by 2060 in the country.

The government said 226 companies submitted bids before the project was suspended at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

In October 2022, the government announced the relaunch of the programme and opened bids. In September, 2023 the commission announced successful bidders for the programme.

The NUPRC said in a statement on Friday that the commission awarded the permits to the winners at the official ceremony held in Abuja.

The commission said the permits, awarded under the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP), are expected to attract up to $2 billion in investments, create over 100,000 jobs, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by six million tonnes annually.

The successful awardees, according to the statement, include: Ace Energy Limited; Afagaf Company Limited; AGH Lero; Almina Resources Limited; Amazon Energy Limited; AUT Energy; Beluga Asiko; Bodej Investment Limited; Cainergy Limited; Cimcmonobuo Nigeria Limited; Dawcon Consortium; Dawnwatch Limited; Fargab Limited; Folstaj International Limited; Geospectra Energy Limited; Izzi Project Limited; and MMLet Energy Limited.

Others are: MSN Consortium; Newgaz Integrated Services Limited; NG Lyon Construction Limited; Oaks Cluster Energy; Seal Energy Limited; Tecnis EPS International Limited; Teobell International; Terms Energies; Zipora Gas; and Stelog Gas Company Limited.

The Chief Executive of the NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, said the issuance of the Permit to Access Flare Gas (PAFG) under the 2022 NGFCP signifies the transition from legacy challenges to market-driven solutions that unlock economic opportunities, strengthen energy security, reduce emissions and improve operational efficiency across the industry.

“The commission is pleased to announce that 28 awardees have fully executed the required suite of commercial agreements, which include the connection agreements, milestone development agreements, and gas sales agreements; and now qualify to receive the permit to access flare gas. These entities represent a strong blend of operational capability, financial readiness, and technological competence,” Mr Komolafe said.

He added that the award aligns with the vision of President Bola Tinubu for the country to harness hydrocarbon resources, as reflected in the Executive Orders issued in 2024.

“Allow me to express deep appreciation to His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR. His reform-driven leadership and commitment to enabling the petroleum sector continues to shape the strategic direction of our work at NUPRC.

“The Presidential Executive Orders on NAG fiscal incentives and tax rebates, local content directives and cost efficiency demonstrate his emphasis on investment competitiveness for the sector,” he added.

He explained that the NGFCP was redesigned after the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and refined for transparency, commercial viability, and global competitiveness.

“From 300 initial expressions of interest, 139 applicants qualified for the RFP stage.”

Following a competitive and transparent evaluation process, he said 42 successful bidders were awarded 49 flare sites, “an achievement widely recognised for its integrity and rigour,” he said.

Between 250 and 300 mmscfd of currently flared gas, according to him, will be captured and commercialised, eliminating approximately six million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.

“The programme is expected to attract up to US$2 billion in investment. More than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created. About one hundred and seventy thousand (170,000) metric tons of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) will be produced annually, enabling clean energy access for approximately 1.4 million households. And nearly 3GW (gigawatts) of power generation potential will be unlocked.”

To ensure disciplined execution, he said the commission will closely monitor the implementation of milestone development agreements, conduct regular performance reviews, and proactively address emerging barriers.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs Is Bullish On The Boeing Company (BA):
[TEXT]
The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is among the 12 Best Performing Dow Stocks in 2025.

Goldman Sachs Is Bullish On The Boeing Company (BA)

On December 9, 2025, TheFly reported that Goldman Sachs kept a Buy rating and a $257 price target on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). This came after Goldman Sachs reviewed the company’s monthly delivery figures. The firm pointed out that The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s aircraft order inventory is still substantial in comparison to supply and that November gross orders were solid, extending year-to-date momentum. According to the company, a multi-year rise in deliveries across all aircraft platforms is supported by the backlog.

On the same day, Reuters reported that The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) had only delivered 44 in November, down from 53 in October, and was falling behind European rival Airbus, which delivered 72 planes. Deliveries included six 787s, two 777 freighters, four 767s, and 32 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, five of which were delivered to Southwest Airlines. In November, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported 164 new orders, 126 net new orders, and 38 cancellations. There were 74 orders for the 777X, including 65 from Emirates and 9 from China Airlines. Furthermore, the business received 30 orders from undisclosed customers for the 787 and 43 orders for the 737 MAX. Five 737 MAX orders from Comair, four 787 orders from Air Canada, and fifteen 777X orders from Etihad were cancelled. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) delivered 537 aircraft through November 30, booked 1,000 new orders, with 908 net after cancellations, and had a 6,019 order backlog at the conclusion of the month.

Jay Malave, the chief financial officer of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), stated last week that the business anticipates positive cash flow in 2026 as a result of growing jet deliveries.

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a key aerospace and defense company that operates in three segments: commercial aircraft; defense, space, and security; and global services.

While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Mexico’s aerospace sector is growing. Will it be undercut in USMCA review?:
[TEXT]
A North America trade deal helped Mexico get into aeroplane manufacturing. Now that is under threat with Trump.

Monterrey, Mexico – In April, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the country’s aerospace industry could see sustained annual growth of as much as 15 percent over the next four years, and attributed the sector’s expansion to a robust local manufacturing workforce, increasing exports, and a strong presence of foreign companies.

But with the review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) coming up – the free-trade treaty between the three countries that helped Mexico’s aerospace sector to grow and flourish – the industry’s future is no longer certain.

Stakeholders warn that ensuring investment stability and strengthening labour standards are essential to protecting the sector’s North American supply chain.

Mexico is striving to become one of the top 10 countries in aerospace production value, a goal outlined in Plan Mexico, the country’s strategic initiative to enhance global competitiveness in key sectors.

As the sixth-largest supplier of aerospace parts to the US, the industry has benefited significantly from the USMCA, which fostered regional supply chain integration, said Monica Lugo, director of institutional relations at the consulting firm PRODENSA.

However, the integration is no guarantee of business continuing to grow as the country is at an “unprecedented moment” with US President Donald Trump and his wide-ranging tariff policies.

Lugo, a former USMCA negotiator, said that recent tariffs on materials like steel and aluminium — critical to the aerospace sector— have eroded trust in the US as a reliable partner. She predicts that if current conditions continue, the sector risks losing capital, investments and jobs.

“Having this great uncertainty – one day it’s on, the next it’s off, who knows tomorrow – and based on no specific criteria, but rather on the president’s mood, creates chaos and severely damages the country and the economy,” she said.

On December 4, Trump suggested the US might let the USMCA expire next year, or negotiate a new deal. This follows comments by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to US news outlet Politico that the administration is considering separate deals with Canada and Mexico.

A booming aerospace sector

The Mexican aerospace market is valued at $11.2bn, and is expected to more than double to $22.7bn by 2029, Sheinbaum said, citing data from the Mexican Aerospace Industry Federation (FEMIA). Home to global companies like Bombardier, Safran, Airbus, and Honeywell, Mexico has established itself as a key player in the global aerospace market and is now the world’s twelfth-largest exporter of aerospace components.

Marco Antonio Del Prete, secretary of sustainable development in Queretaro, attributes this success in part to heavy investment in education and training. In 2005, the Queretaro government promised Canada’s Bombardier that it would invest in education and set up the Aeronautical University, which now offers programmes ranging from technical diplomas to master’s degrees in aerospace manufacturing and engineering.

“Since Bombardier’s arrival, an educational and training system was created that allows us to develop talent in a very efficient way, let’s say, fast track,” Del Prete told Al Jazeera.

Bombardier has served as an anchor, propelling Queretaro’s rise as a high-skilled manufacturing hub for parts and components.

While the Bombardier plant in Queretaro originally focused on wiring harnesses, it has evolved to specialise in complex aerostructures, including the rear fuselage for the Global 7500, Bombardier’s ultra-long-range business jet, and key components for the Challenger 3500, the mid-sized business jet.

Marco Antonio Carrillo, a research professor at the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ), pointed out that the area’s wide educational offerings have cultivated a powerful workforce, which has gained significant attention from aeroplane makers, mainly from the US, Canada and France.

“This development [of Queretaro] has been, if you look at it in terms of time, truly explosive,” Carrillo said.

Mexico also aims to join France and the US as the third country capable of fully assembling an engine for Safran.

But the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Union, which represents more than 600,000 workers in Canada and the US, is worried that progress could lead to more advanced manufacturing and assembly work to eventually shift to Mexico, given the local investment in aeronautical universities and training.

“Right now they’re [Mexican workers] doing more entry-level type things, but our concern is that later on, larger pieces of the aerospace operation will go to Mexico,” Peter Greenberg, the IAM’s international affairs director, told Al Jazeera.

High-skilled, low-cost workforce

Of the three countries in the USMCA agreement, Mexico’s biggest attraction has been its low-cost manufacturing.

Edgar Buendia and Mario Duran Bustamante, economics professors at the Rosario Castellanos National University, cite Mexico’s low labour costs and geographical proximity to the US as the country’s key advantages. This is partly why the US has intensified pressure on the Mexican government, including during the initial USMCA negotiations in 2017, to raise wages to level the playing field and reduce unfair competition.

“Most US companies have incentives to move their production here in Mexico, given the [low] wages and the geographic location. So, to prevent that from happening, the United States is pressuring Mexico to raise labour standards, ensure freedom of association, and improve working conditions,” Buendia told Al Jazeera, things that will benefit Mexican workers even as employer-dominated labour groups worry that they may lose their advantage.

The IAM originally opposed the USMCA’s predecessor, NAFTA. Greenberg said that while they acknowledge USMCA will continue, US and Canadian workers “would probably be perfectly happy” if the agreement ended as the NAFTA deal had led to plants being shuttered and workers being laid off as jobs moved from the US and Canada to low-cost Mexico.

“There is a need for stronger incentives to keep work in the United States and Canada. We want to see the wages in Mexico go up so that it doesn’t become automatically a place where companies go to because they know they will have lower wages and workers who do not have any bargaining power or strong units,” Greenberg added.

Under Sheinbaum’s Morena party, Mexico has raised the minimum wage from 88 pesos ($4.82) in 2018 to 278.8 pesos ($15.30) in 2025, with the rate in municipalities bordering the US reaching 419.88 pesos ($23). On December 4, Sheinbaum announced a 13 percent rise in the minimum wage — and 5 percent for the border zone— set to begin in January 2026.

Despite these increases and the competitiveness of wages in the aerospace sector, researchers agree that a significant wage gap persists between Mexican workers and their US and Canadian counterparts.

“The wage gap is definitely abysmal,” said Javier Salinas, a scholar at the UAQ Labor Center, specialising in labour relations in the aerospace industry. “The [aerospace] industry average is between 402 [Mexican pesos] and 606, with the highest daily wage being 815. [But] 815, converted to US dollars, is less than $40 for a single workday.”

By contrast, Salinas estimates that a worker in the US earns an average of
