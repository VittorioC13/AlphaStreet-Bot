[TITLE]Goldman Sachs Lends $53M for Acquisition of Energy Firm’s Boston-Area HQ – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
A joint venture between Pivotal Manufacturing Partners and Declaration Partners has landed $52.8 million of acquisition financing for the purchase of energy company Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ (CFS) global headquarters northwest of Boston.

Goldman Sachs supplied the loan for the sponsorship’s $74 million acquisition of the new 165,000-square-foot facility situated on a 47-acre research campus in Devens, Mass., that King Street Properties and The Baupost Group developed for CFS in 2022. CFS, which was founded out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018, now has the backing of investors such as Google, Nvidia, Temasek and Mitsubishi.

The Real Reporter first reported the financing and purchase.

Pivotal, a real estate investment platform focused on industrial assets, will manage the facility 44 miles northwest of Boston in partnership with Declaration, which has financing backing from the family office of David Rubenstein, founder of private equity giant Carlyle Group.

David Robbins, managing partner at Pivotal Manufacturing, said the deal is part of the firm’s goal of scaling its platform with more advanced manufacturing assets targeting industries “critical” to supply chain security.

“We are confident in the strategic value of this real estate — an asset benefiting from significant, market-leading existing infrastructure and heavy power access,” Robbins said in a statement. “As artificial intelligence and robotics continue to penetrate industrial supply chains, driving new requirements for infrastructure, we are excited to own and operate this trophy real estate asset with specifications tailored to this next generation industrial renaissance.”

David Rabin, a partner at Declaration, said in a statement the acquisition represents a “best-in-class building with an attractive long-term lease profile and a well-capitalized tenant.”

Goldman Sachs did not immediately return a request for comment.

[TITLE]Shale oil execs say Trump policies are hurting investment, 'business is broken':
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the UN headquarters on Sept. 23, 2025 in New York City.

Shale oil executives say President Donald Trump is hurting investment in the oil patch, and are giving a grim outlook for the future of the industry that turned the U.S. into the largest crude producer in the world.

The executives' anonymous comments were published in a quarterly survey of oil and gas companies by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas this week. The 139 companies that responded operate predominantly in Texas as well as northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.

Trump has championed fossil fuels while attacking the renewable energy industry since taking office in January. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, delivered virtually everything the oil lobby wanted.

But Trump's push for lower crude prices, higher tariffs, and the resulting uncertainty caused by his "stroke of pen" policies are hurting investment, executives at independent oil and gas producers told the Dallas Fed.

Nearly 80% of executives who participated in the survey said they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty

[TITLE]Oil giant BP quietly steps out of the takeover spotlight:
[TEXT]
Five months ago, British energy major BP was firmly in the spotlight as a prime takeover candidate. Now, not so much. Shares of the London-listed oil giant have climbed more than 32% since early April, outperforming many of its U.S. and European rivals. The improving sentiment can be attributed to a range of factors, including BP's fundamental strategic reset , a leadership shake-up , progress on its cost-cutting program and a string of recent oil discoveries . It marks a stark contrast to earlier in the year, when BP found itself to be the subject of intense takeover speculation , with British rival Shell , UAE oil giant ADNOC and U.S. majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron all among the names touted as possible suitors. BP CEO Murray Auchincloss insisted the company was focused on growth when asked

[TITLE]Chevron Strikes Deal With Israel To Build Natural Gas Supply Pipeline To Egypt:
[TEXT]
Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has signed a deal with Israel Natural Gas Lines, Israel’s state-owned pipeline operator, to begin construction of the Nitzana natural gas pipeline that will transport natural gas from the giant Leviathan Gas Field to Egypt. Scheduled to be completed in three years, the $610 million pipeline is expected to ease Egypt’s ongoing energy crisis, which currently spends billions of dollars every year importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet surging domestic energy demand. The Nitzana pipeline will transport ~600 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, bringing Israel's total export capacity to Egypt to more than 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. Israel’s NewMed is the largest shareholder in Leviathan, with a 45.3% working interest; Chevron is the operator with a 39.7% working interest, while Ratio Energies. (TASE: RATI) has 15%. Founded in 1992, Ratio Energy is one of Israel's leading energy partnerships, with a mission to develop and produce natural gas and oil.

Egypt's natural gas production has declined rapidly over the years due to the natural depletion of mature fields, including the Zohr gas field. Coupled with a lack of significant new discoveries since 2015, surging domestic demand for electricity, and past financial issues such as hard currency shortages and payment arrears to foreign companies, Egypt now finds itself in a tenuous position, becoming a net gas importer since 2022, and relying on imported Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as well as pipeline gas from Israel. Last year, Egypt imported a record 981 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Israel, good for 18.2% year-over-year increase. Egypt imports up to 20% of its gas from Israel. Last month, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced that the $35-billion gas supply agreement signed with Israel’s NewMed Energy was extended until 2040. But the fate of these gas flows now hangs in the balance, with tensions in the Middle East escalating after the Israeli military ordered residents of Gaza City to evacuate.

Last month, Netanyahu declared that he is "deeply committed to the vision of Greater Israel,’’ encompassing parts of Arab countries stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile. According to Israel Hayom, Netanyahu has instructed officials "not to move forward with the massive gas deal with Egypt without his personal approval.”

On its part, Chevron is now moving on three major geopolitical fronts at once: finalizing terms for the Nitzana pipeline to ship Israeli gas into Egypt, bidding for offshore blocks near Crete that Libya claims as its own and preparing a final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion. Together, the moves put the U.S. major at the center of the East Mediterranean’s most combustible mix of energy ambition and maritime dispute. Chevron has partnered with Greece’s HelleniQ Energy to bid for exploration rights in offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese. Athens views this development as a major step towards asserting its sovereignty over the contested waters. Waters south of Crete and the Peloponnese are contested due to a 2019 Turkey-Libya maritime agreement that ignores Greece's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims and is a response to potential hydrocarbon reserves in the area. Greece claims these areas based on international law, while Turkey disputes that islands like Crete can generate EEZs and views the situation as a geopolitical power struggle. Libya also claims significant portions of the area, aligning with Turkey's position.

Meanwhile, observers are awaiting Chevron’s final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion amid security concerns. However, Chevron and its partners, NewMed Energy and Ratio Energies, now expect to take the FID on the Leviathan Phase 1B expansion, which includes drilling, subsea systems, and a potential floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility, in the fourth quarter of 2025. This expansion is projected to significantly increase the field's annual production capacity and is supported by a recent historic gas export deal, a revised development plan approved by Israel in August 2025, and ongoing contract negotiations with potential customers.

Discovered in 2010, the Leviathan is located approximately 130 km off the shores of Haifa. The 330-square kilometer field holds ~22.9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, making it the largest natural gas reservoir in the Mediterranean, and one of the largest producing assets in the region. Production is facilitated by 4 subsea wells that are connected to an offshore platform via a subsea manifold and two 120 km long pipelines, where all processing of gas takes place. The gas is then piped to shore into the Israeli national grid and distributed to clients in Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.

Rectification note: The original article incorrectly stated that NewMed is the operator of the Leviathan gas field. The current operator is Chevron.
