[TITLE]LuxExperience to Sell The Outnet:
[TEXT]
LuxExperience B.V., the digital, multibrand luxury group that includes Mytheresa, has agreed to sell The Outnet website to The O Group LLC for $30 million.

The Outnet sells luxury fashion from previous seasons at off-price. It generated net sales of 260 million euros in fiscal year 2025, the company indicated.

The O Group is buying from LuxExperience all of the assets necessary to power The Outnet, including brand rights, customer data, inventory, and the U.S. distribution center, and is also taking control of The Outnet’s workforce in the U.S. and the U.K. The $30 million purchase price is subject to an adjustment based on inventory levels at the time of the closing.

LuxExperience will continue its commercial relationship with The Outnet after closing the deal, meaning it will provide merchandise. LuxExperience will also provide certain operational and IT services, priced at cost level, for a certain period after the closing. The closing is expected to happen during the first quarter of 2026, subject to certain conditions, including customary regulatory approvals and payment of the purchase price.

The company’s luxury e-commerce websites are Mytheresa, Net-a-porter and Mr Porter. Yoox and The Outnet comprise the off-price segment of LuxExperience. LuxExperience is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and operates in key markets worldwide.

“We are very pleased that we have found the optimal solution both for The Outnet and for our group,” Michael Kliger, chief executive officer of LuxExperience, said in a statement Friday when the deal was revealed.

“The transaction will allow The Outnet to achieve its full potential under a renewed independent, stand-alone business model,” Kliger added. “LuxExperience will fully focus its resources in off-price on creating the lean operating model required for Yoox in order to regain growth and financial strength. In addition, it will also allow us to accelerate the overall transformation plan in regards to an efficient infrastructure platform for Net-a-porter and Mr Porter.”

The company, in its official statement, noted, “The divestment of The Outnet assets is a strategic step in line with LuxExperience’s transformation plan announced in May 2025 that includes the simplification of its operating model by reducing complexity and is intended to allow the leading digital, multibrand luxury group to completely focus its off-price resources on regaining growth and financial strength for its Yoox business. In addition, it is also expected to allow LuxExperience to accelerate the overall transformation plan in regards to an efficient infrastructure platform for Net-a-porter and Mr Porter.”

LuxExperience, formerly known as just Mytheresa, finalized its deal to acquire Yoox Net-a-porter from Compagnie Financière Richemont last April. Along with Yoox Net-a-porter, LuxExperience picked up 555 million euros and a 100 million-euro credit facility from Richemont in return for a 33 percent stake in the company.

LuxExperience last month reported impressive results for its fiscal fourth quarter, beating analyst expectations, including earnings per share of 4.67 euros and revenues of 587.8 million euros. LuxExperience will release financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2026 before the U.S. market opens on Nov. 19.

Shareholders of The O Group LLC include Joseph Edery and Ritesh Punjabi, the CEO of the Timeless Group of Companies. The two individuals are considered “experts” in luxury fashion, LuxExperience indicated in its statement. The O Group helps brands shed excess or unsold inventory via off-price. The Timeless Group of Companies is a retail/distribution company.

[TITLE]iRobot Faces Bankruptcy After Elizabeth Warren Helped Kill $1.65 Billion Amazon Merger:
[TEXT]
A struggling American manufacturer may soon face bankruptcy. This was not just the result of low sales, but of government regulators butting in.

Online retail giant Amazon announced in August 2022 that it had agreed to purchase iRobot, makers of Roomba robot vacuums, for $1.65 billion. The acquisition would expand Amazon's footprint in the smart home market, after it previously purchased video doorbell company Ring.

The following month, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened an investigation into the merger. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) and several Democrats in the House of Representatives sent a letter to then-FTC Chair Lina Khan, saying "the FTC should use its authority to oppose the Amazon–iRobot transaction."

The letter alleged that rather than compete directly with iRobot—whose products accounted for 75 percent of the smart vacuum marketplace at the time—Amazon was simply trying to buy its way in. "Rather than compete in a fair marketplace on its own merits," the lawmakers warned, "Amazon is following a familiar anticompetitive playbook: leveraging its massive market share and access to capital to buy or suppress popular products."

The European Commission—the governing body of the European Union—soon launched its own investigation. Commissioners later signaled that, among their objections, a merger "may restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners."

"Amazon may have the ability to foreclose iRobot's rivals," the commission added, either by excluding them from its online marketplace or by "degrading their access to it."

In January 2024, Amazon and iRobot jointly announced the termination of the deal, seeing "no path to regulatory approval in the European Union." iRobot then announced it would cut 31 percent of its workforce; the company had hemorrhaged money while waiting for the deal to close, and it reported losing as much $285 million the previous year.

Since then, its outlook has not improved. "There is substantial doubt

[TEXT]
This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Release Date: October 31, 2025

For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

Positive Points

ACCO Brands Corp (NYSE:ACCO) improved its gross margins by 50 basis points despite sales being slightly below expectations.

The company is making significant progress on its $100 million multi-year cost reduction program, achieving an additional $10 million in savings in the third quarter.

ACCO Brands Corp (NYSE:ACCO) maintained market share in its office categories despite a decline in sales.

The company has a strong product pipeline with innovative new products, including exclusive IP, expected to drive future growth.

ACCO Brands Corp (NYSE:ACCO) successfully integrated the Bureau seating acquisition and is exploring geographic expansion opportunities.

Negative Points

Third-quarter sales were below the outlook due to softer global demand and delayed implementation of tariff-related price increases.

Sales in Latin America, particularly Brazil, were weaker than expected due to constrained consumer spending and delayed purchasing decisions.

The international segment experienced mixed demand, with softness in Europe partially offset by increases in Australia and Asia.

Kensington computer accessory sales declined modestly due to delayed business spending.

The company's adjusted operating income decreased compared to the previous year, impacted by lower volumes and SG&A cost deleveraging.

Q & A Highlights

Q: What underpins your confidence for improvement in the fourth quarter despite the current economic headlines? A: Tom Tedford, CEO: Our confidence is based on several factors. Firstly, our technology accessories business, which represents about 20% of our portfolio, is expected to return to growth due to the holiday season and support for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. Secondly, our pricing actions, which took longer to implement, are expected to show benefits in Q4. Lastly, some orders shifted from Q3 to Q4, which should improve our performance.

Q: Can you provide more color on the trade-down in some categories? A: Tom Tedford, CEO: We are seeing trade-down across most geographies. However, we are well-positioned with a brand portfolio that caters to various price points, which helps us maintain sales even as consumers trade down. This does impact top-line sales and has a modest effect on profitability.

Q: Are you considering additional acquisitions as part of your strategic opportunities? A: Tom Tedford, CEO: We are always looking for accretive acquisitions and synergistic opportunities that can reposition our product portfolio into faster-growing categories or markets. We also explore licensing agreements and expansion of ODM/OEM relationships to accelerate sales.

[TITLE]Amazon laid off over 14,000 people this week—but Wall Street is loving it anyway:
[TEXT]
The mighty heft of Amazon is hoisting the U.S. stock market higher on Friday.

The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, erasing much of its slump from the day before and nearing its all-time high set on Tuesday. The index is on track to close a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, which would be its longest monthly winning streak since 2021.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 37 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.

Amazon led the way after jumping 11.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming huge cloud-computing business has reaccelerated back to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022.

Apple also helped lift the market after its stock added 0.3%. It likewise delivered a better profit report than analysts expected, though by not as big a margin as Amazon did. CEO Tim Cook said it benefited from strong revenue for both its iPhone lineup and its services offerings, which include its app store.

The two Big Tech profit reports were the among most important on Wall Street Friday because Amazon, worth roughly $2.4 trillion, and Apple, at over $4 trillion, are two of the biggest companies in the market. They alone account for 10.6% of the S&P 500’s total value, even though they make up just 0.4% of its membership.

That means their stock movements can carry more weight on the S&P 500 index, which sits at the heart of many 401(k) accounts, than hundreds of other stocks.

Elsewhere on Wall Street, online message board Reddit jumped 14.7% to erase losses from earlier in the week after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Coinbase Global rose 3.2% after the crypto exchange’s profit likewise topped expectations.

Outside of earnings reports, Netflix added 1.9% after the video streamer announced a move that could make its stock price more affordable but still leave all its investors holding the same amount. Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, where it will give nine additional shares to every investor with one.

They helped offset a 3.7% drop for AbbVie, even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to how it’s beating forecasts by less than before, and expectations may have been high after AbbVie came into the day with a strong 28.4% gain for the year so far.

The pressure is on companies to deliver strong growth in profits to help justify the huge gains their stock prices have made since April. Criticism has been growing that the stock market has become too expensive.

Friday’s overall gains helped Wall Street recover from Thursday’s slump, when the S&P 500 fell 1%. Investors appeared unnerved by big increases in spending that Meta Platforms and Microsoft are planning as the investment spree related to artificial-intelligence technology keeps gushing. Financial markets also appeared skeptical that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would put an end to tensions between the two countries.

In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia Friday.

Stocks fell 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after data showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month and at the fastest pace in six months.

Japan’s Nikkei 225, meanwhile, jumped 2.1% to another record index after a report showed industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in September, beating market expectations.

In the bond market, Treasury yields eased a bit after their spurt higher in the middle of the week, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned markets that another cut to interest rates in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.”

The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 4.08% from 4.11% late Thursday, but it’s still above the 3.99% level it was at before Powell’s warning.

[TITLE]RedCloud Holds Signing Ceremony for Saudi Joint Venture, Targeting $61Bn Market with December 2025 Launch:
[TEXT]
RIYADH, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RedCloud Holdings plc (Nasdaq: RCT) (“RedCloud” or the “Company”), the RedAI trading platform used by Fast Moving Consumer Goods (‘FMCG’) businesses, announced the outcome of the Future Investment Initiative (FII9) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where it held a formal signing ceremony to seal its landmark joint venture agreement with Kayanat Holding, and held more than one hundred meetings as part of preparations for Saudi launch.

The formal signing ceremony, live on day three of the FII9 event, marked a pivotal milestone in RedCloud’s expansion into the Kingdom—aligning with Saudi Vision 2030 and the country’s strategic focus on digital transformation and supply chain modernization. The joint venture, RedCloud Arabia, will deploy RedAI’s algorithmic infrastructure to digitize and transform FMCG trade across the country.

The Company and Kayanat held joint meetings with key players within the Saudi FMCG Industry—who are believed to represent around 20% of the $61Bn market3—supporting a targeted launch date of December 2025.

“FII9 was a catalytic event for RedCloud, where we heard from industry leaders to heads of state who shared our concern for global trading challenges including spiraling consumer prices and the waste of critical resources,” said Justin Floyd, CEO and Founder of RedCloud. “Bloomberg built the intelligence foundation for financial markets. Google built it for the internet. Supply chains are next. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be a pioneer and leader in solving this problem and we are delighted to work with Majid and his team on expanding RedCloud’s intelligence foundation for global trade, moving human guesswork and manual trading to algorithmic transformation.”

“For nearly 90 years, Saudi Arabia has powered the world through reliable and affordable energy supply chains. Today, that same advantage will fuel the world’s AI factories,” added Majid Alghaslan, Founder of Kayanat. “Our collaboration with RedCloud reflects Vision 2030’s ambition to transform the Kingdom into a global hub where technology, data, and intelligence redefine trade—building predictive, autonomous, and sustainable economies of the future.”

RedCloud Arabia intends to focus on localizing RedAI’s capabilities to serve Saudi distributors, retailers, and manufacturers, enabling smarter purchasing decisions and addressing inventory shortfalls. The Company believes that traditional AI and LLMs train on public internet data, while RedCloud trains its models on private b2b supply chain data that can’t be accessed by the AI incumbents. The Company’s platform has already demonstrated success in high-growth markets such as Nigeria, Brazil, and South Africa, and is now poised to bring similar impact to the Middle East.

The announcement follows significant operational momentum for RedCloud: the Company more than doubled customer numbers year-over-year in the first half of 2025, launched a new partnership strategy for payments and financial services to maximize working capital across supply chains, and expanded its technology ecosystem through the NVIDIA Connect program alongside existing partnerships with AWS and Snowflake.

FII9 convened around 600 global leaders4 including heads of state, speakers and innovators under the theme “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth.” RedCloud’s presence at the event underscored its commitment to building the intelligence foundation for the FMCG industry—from manufacturer to retailer—within Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and beyond.

[TITLE]Judge blocks suspension of Snap food aid during US government shutdown:

A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday blocked US president Donald Trump’s administration from suspending all food aid for millions of Americans amid the ongoing government shutdown and directed it to use contingency funds to pay for the benefits.

US district judge John McConnell in Providence issued a temporary restraining order at the behest of cities, nonprofits and a union that argued the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, known as Snap or food stamps, starting Saturday, was unlawful.

He ruled from the bench minutes after another judge in Boston ruled that suspension was likely unlawful in a related case pursued by a coalition of Democratic-led states that also sought to avert the suspension.

“There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn’t already occurred in the terror it has caused some people

[TITLE]Americans facing hunger as shutdown enters second month:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON: The US government shutdown barreled towards its second month on Friday (Oct 31) and the pain is spreading fast – with federal workers broke, food aid under threat and millions of Americans caught in the crossfire.

What started on Oct 1 as a Washington sideshow has morphed into a slow-motion implosion of public services and a growing economic convulsion, with federal offices dark and President Donald Trump's government stuck in neutral.

Republicans have warned that millions will begin feeling the full force of the shutdown for the first time this weekend, as unresolved fights over funding for health care and food stamps make them hungrier and poorer.

"Most people haven't noticed up until this week. Thanks to Donald Trump finding a way to pay our troops last month, that pain was delayed," Republican House Whip Tom Emmer told Fox News. "But, starting this week ... this is starting to become very real."

At the heart of the fight is the expiry of insurance subsidies that make health care affordable for more than 20 million people. Premiums are expected to skyrocket when the new sign-up period opens Saturday.

Democrats refuse to reopen the government without a deal to extend the subsidies but Trump's Republicans say they won't talk until the lights are back on.

As Washington bickers, the shutdown is starting to pinch where it really hurts – the dinner table.

[TITLE]Puma warns of lower 2025 sales and swings to quarterly loss:
[TEXT]
Puma recorded a net loss of €62.3m versus net income of €127.8m in Q3 2024. Credit: darksoul72/Shutterstock.com.

Puma expects a low double-digit percentage decline in full-year 2025 sales on a currency-adjusted basis, alongside a reported loss in earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT), with capital expenditure planned at around €250m.

In the third quarter (Q3) of 2025, sales fell 10.4% on a currency-adjusted basis to €1.95bn. Currency movements, notably those of the US dollar and the Argentine peso, reduced revenue by €125m, pushing reported sales down 15.3%.

The German sportswear brand’s wholesale revenue dropped 15.4% to €1.38bn. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales rose 4.5% to €570m, driven by a 5.6% increase in e-commerce.

Sales in owned and operated stores were up 3.9%. The DTC share increased to 29.1% from 25.1% in Q3 2024.

In Q3 2025, Puma implemented measures to strengthen its base for 2026 and beyond, cutting lower-quality wholesale business, reducing excess inventory at retail partners, and scaling back promotions in e-commerce and full-price DTC stores.

The reset drove a broad sales decline across all regions. In the Americas, revenue fell 15.2% to €678.1m, with a modest dip in Latin America and the bulk of the decrease stemming from North America.

[TEXT]
Dive Brief:

Despite the impacts of a stronger euro, Adidas reported record-high revenue of 6.6 billion euros ($7.6 billion at press time) in Q3, up 3% year over year. Ignoring the 300-million-euro impact from currency fluctuations, sales were up 8%, per the retailer.

In the midst of a U.S. growth strategy, sales in North America fell 5% in the quarter, though they were up 1% in currency neutral terms. Recovery in China is also underway, with sales roughly flat year over year, but up 6% excluding currency fluctuations.

Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden praised the retailer’s local-driven strategy for the gains and noted that sales would have been higher in North America if Adidas wasn’t resetting its accessories business.

Dive Insight:

Adidas is leaning into local leadership and design to drive its growth across regions — and the effort is paying off.

[TITLE]Canada Goose Unveils Paris Flagship as the First of Its ‘2.0’ Luxury Retail Concept:
[TEXT]
PARIS — Canada Goose is ready to soar.

The outerwear brand has unveiled its ambitious retail concept with the opening of its flagship on Avenue des Champs-Élysées, marking the kickoff of its reboot as “Canada Goose 2.0.”

The location, which officially opened Thursday, lays out a global design concept to redefine its retail stores as upscaled and immersive. The opening also sets the groundwork for a renewed push into Europe, a region chief executive officer Dani Reiss frames as both its historic base and a key growth territory.

Despite the Canadian name, “Europe is where it started for us,” Reiss told WWD, with Italy and Scandinavia early territories for its parkas.

[TITLE]The Rise of the Artisan Economy:
[TEXT]
Developer Shaheen Sadeghi’s vision of an artisanal, small-business-driven economy seems oddly incompatible with his environment. After all, Orange County, Calif., where the 71-year-old Sadeghi has worked for four decades, bristles with mass-produced fabrication. Home to several of the nation’s most successful malls and endless shopping centers, the region has incubated such firms as McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, Cheesecake Factory, Marie Callender’s, Taco Bell, and the epicenter of faux American conformism, Disneyland.

Yet walking around his expanding development, called the Camp, it’s clear Sadeghi has made his vision real. Located on four acres in Costa Mesa — just one mile from the South Coast Plaza — one of the most successful mega-malls in the country — is a collection filled with dozens of independent, small businesses including oddball boutiques, diverse independent restaurants, and even a bar — Cowboy and Poodles — that celebrates southern California’s cowboy heritage, with Western images and artifacts matched with kitschy images of well-groomed dogs.

“Most of retail may be dying,” Sadeghi notes, “the next generation of customers won’t go to the big stores but are seeking out a direct human experience.” Moreover: “The traditional middleman role is obsolete. People may go online to buy necessities but when they go out to shop, they want something real, something that offers the possibility of serendipity.”

Sadeghi, who grew up in Michigan, is the child of Muslim Iranian immigrants. He graduated from Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute and worked in the surf-wear industry — eventually running Huntington Beach–based Quiksilver — for a decade until he came up with his concept of “the anti-mall” in 1993. His LAB company, which stands for “Little American Business,” has some 40 projects spread across the county. For many young residents, including my daughters, the Camp and Anaheim’s Packing House (both LAB developments) replaced the conventional mall as their preferred place to hang.

Sadeghi says he believes that his developments tap an unmet demand for personal, unique experiences and, most of all, human interaction. “The rise of artificial intelligence and virtual reality, a world of robots, suggests we don’t need to interface with people,” he says over lunch at Aba, a crowded and popular Israeli restaurant at the Camp. “But people need more than that. They want that personal experience, the unexpected. Providing that is what excites me.”

The notion of an artisan economy may seem odd in an age dominated by online sales and artificial intelligence. Yet, as Sadeghi points out, this is the opportunity. As we buy routine, depersonalized products online or at a mega retailers such as Target or Costco, there remains a desire for something more human. We seek to connect more closely to the farmer, the maker of products, and to products sourced close to the community.

This counterfactual development can be seen in such things as the rapid growth of flea markets, farmers’ markets, and that ultimate symbol of grassroots free markets, garage sales. The 2000s and 2010s saw the growth of the “buy local” movement and the rapid expansion of farmers’ markets in the U.S. — from fewer than 1,800 in the mid-1990s to more than 8,770 by 2019. Flea markets have also proliferated around the world, growing at 4.5 percent a year. By 2033, U.S. flea market sales are expected to grow from $12.5 billion to almost $17.5 billion. Similar growth is projected in Latin America, Europe, and Asia.

The shift is reflected as well in surging yard sales. A July survey by Morning Consult found that

[TITLE]LuxExperience to Sell The Outnet:
[TEXT]
LuxExperience B.V., the digital, multibrand luxury group that includes Mytheresa, has agreed to sell The Outnet website to The O Group LLC for $30 million.

The Outnet sells luxury fashion from previous seasons at off-price. It generated net sales of 260 million euros in fiscal year 2025, the company indicated.

The O Group is buying from LuxExperience all of the assets necessary to power The Outnet, including brand rights, customer data, inventory, and the U.S. distribution center, and is also taking control of The Outnet’s workforce in the U.S. and the U.K. The $30 million purchase price is subject to an adjustment based on inventory levels at the time of the closing.

LuxExperience will continue its commercial relationship with The Outnet after closing the deal, meaning it will provide merchandise. LuxExperience will also provide certain operational and IT services, priced at cost level, for a certain period after the closing. The closing is expected to happen during the first quarter of 2026, subject to certain conditions, including customary regulatory approvals and payment of the purchase price.

LuxExperience is considered the leading digital, multibrand luxury group selling men’s and women’s wear, kids, fine jewelry, watches and lifestyle products. The company’s luxury e-commerce websites are Mytheresa, Net-a-porter and Mr Porter. Yoox and The Outnet comprise the off-price segment of LuxExperience. LuxExperience is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and operates in key markets worldwide.

“We are very pleased that we have found the optimal solution both for The Outnet and for our group,” Michael Kliger, chief executive officer of LuxExperience, said in a statement Friday when the deal was revealed.

“The transaction will allow The Outnet to achieve its full potential under a renewed independent, stand-alone business model,” Kliger added. “LuxExperience will fully focus its resources in off-price on creating the lean operating model required for Yoox in order to regain growth and financial strength. In addition, it will also allow us to accelerate the overall transformation plan in regards to an efficient infrastructure platform for Net-a-porter and Mr Porter.”

The company, in its official statement, noted, “The divestment of The Outnet assets is a strategic step in line with LuxExperience’s transformation plan announced in May 2025 that includes the simplification of its operating model by reducing complexity and is intended to allow the leading digital, multibrand luxury group to completely focus its off-price resources on regaining growth and financial strength for its Yoox business. In addition, it is also expected to allow LuxExperience to accelerate the overall transformation plan in regards to an efficient infrastructure platform for Net-a-porter and Mr Porter.”

LuxExperience, formerly known as just Mytheresa, finalized its deal to acquire Yoox Net-a-porter from Compagnie Financière Richemont last April. Along with Yoox Net-a-porter, LuxExperience picked up 555 million euros and a 100 million-euro credit facility from Richemont in return for a 33 percent stake in the company.

LuxExperience last month reported impressive results for its fiscal fourth quarter, beating analyst expectations, including earnings per share of 4.67 euros and revenues of 587.8 million euros. LuxExperience will release financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2026 before the U.S. market opens on Nov. 19.

Shareholders of The O Group LLC include Joseph Edery and Ritesh Punjabi, the CEO of the Timeless Group of Companies. The two individuals are considered “experts” in luxury fashion, LuxExperience indicated in its statement. The O Group helps brands shed excess or unsold inventory via off-price. The Timeless Group of Companies is a retail/distribution company.
