Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has launched its first equity index tracking Hong Kong-listed technology companies, underscoring the city's ongoing shift from a market long dominated by property and finance towards innovation-driven growth.

Unveiled on Tuesday, the HKEX Tech 100 Index tracks 100 large-cap and mid-cap companies spanning artificial intelligence, biotech and pharmaceuticals, electric vehicles and smart driving, information technology, internet and robotics, according to the HKEX website.
