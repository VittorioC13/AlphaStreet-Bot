[TITLE]Coinbase, stablecoin startup BVNK walk away from $2B deal: Report:
[TEXT]
Coinbase and stablecoin startup BVNK have reportedly parted ways on a $2 billion acquisition deal that would have been among the largest crypto company deals ever and would’ve significantly expanded Coinbase’s institutional stablecoin offering.

Fortune reported on Tuesday that the decision was mutual, but it isn’t clear why the parties sought to cancel the deal. Coinbase and BVNK, which builds stablecoin infrastructure, had reached the due diligence stage of the deal after signing an exclusivity agreement in October.

“After discussing a potential acquisition of BVNK, both parties mutually agreed to not move forward,” a Coinbase spokesperson told Fortune, adding that it would continue to explore other opportunities.

It would have been Coinbase’s second-largest deal after completing its $2.9 billion purchase of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit in August.

Coinbase’s attempt to buy the stablecoin company comes as Wall Street’s interest in the tokens has skyrocketed, as international payment networks including Western Union, MoneyGram and SWIFT have started integrating stablecoin solutions.

The $312 billion stablecoin market is riding on regulatory momentum after the US passed the GENIUS Act in July, and the US Treasury estimated in April that the stablecoin market could grow to $2 trillion by 2028.

BVNK slated to expand Coinbase stablecoin revenue

The BVNK acquisition could have boosted Coinbase’s share of revenue from stablecoin services, which accounted for $246 million, or 19%, of its $1.9 billion in revenue reported by the crypto exchange in the third quarter.

Calling off the acquisition, however, could now free up capital for Coinbase to pursue another move in the stablecoin space.

BVNK to reassess

Meanwhile, BVNK will head back to the drawing board after also previously being in talks with Mastercard about a potential acquisition in October.

Citi’s venture capital arm, Citi Ventures, and Mastercard rival Visa also invested in BVNK back in May.

UK-based BVNK was launched in October 2021 by CEO Jesse Hemson-Struthers, chief technology officer Donald Jackson, and chief business officer Chris Harmse. It says it now processes more than $20 billion in annualized volume.

[TITLE]Workhorse Group Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results:
[TEXT]
CINCINNATI, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or “the Company”), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Management Commentary

“We continue to make important progress on our product roadmap at Workhorse,” said Company CEO Rick Dauch. “We recently announced the availability of the Utilimaster Aeromaster body for our W56 Class 5/6 step van, designed to enhance the flexibility, durability, efficiency, and safety of the W56 platform. This exciting new offering will enable us to deliver the performance and reliability of our step van in the traditional form factor that fleet operators already know and trust.

Demonstrating Real-World Performance and Enhancing Flexibility of the W56: Workhorse continues to demonstrate the reliability and performance of its W56 platform with more than 42 vehicles operating in customer and partner fleets across diverse real-world routes. These vehicles delivered 97% uptime in daily last-mile operations.

During the third quarter, Workhorse advanced its product roadmap to broaden W56 application options. This work included the completion of integration, testing and validation efforts for the industry-standard aluminum Aeromaster walk-in body from Utilimaster. The new configuration expands the proven capabilities of the W56 product line.

Conserving Cash and Improving Liquidity: The Company took additional actions to reduce costs and conserve cash during the third quarter, decreasing operating expenses by $1.2 million year-over-year. Comparing year to date nine-month periods, operating expenses decreased $17.5 million in 2025 compared to 2024.

In connection with its proposed transaction with Motiv, Workhorse has benefitted from funding totaling approximately $25 million from Motiv’s controlling investor, including a $20 million sale leaseback transaction and $5 million secured convertible note financing. At closing of the merger, which is expected in the fourth quarter of this year, all remaining indebtedness and other obligations to Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender, including all warrants currently held by the lender, will be repaid and/or cancelled, with the only remaining secured indebtedness of the combined companies being the $5 million secured convertible note held by an affiliate of Motiv’s controlling investor, which may convert to equity in connection with post-closing financing. The transaction with Motiv also includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s largest investor provide Workhorse with up to $20 million in debt financing at the closing.

Third Quarter Financial Results

Sales, net of returns and allowances, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The decrease in sales of $0.1 million was primarily due to lower sales of approximately $2.3 million related to the sale of fewer trucks in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, offset by an increase of $2.2 million related to the recognition of seven vehicles from deferred revenue.

Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $10.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively. The increase in cost of sales of $3.5 million was primarily a result of an increase in inventory excess and obsolescence reserve of $3.3 million.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $7.8 and $7.7 million, respectively. The increase in SG&A of $0.1 million was primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in consulting and legal expenses due to the proposed Motiv merger, offset by a $2.9 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses, a decrease of $0.2 million in marketing and trade show related expenses, and a decrease of $0.3 million in IT-related expenses.

Research and development (“R&D”) expenses for three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The decrease in R&D expenses of $1.2 million was primarily driven by a $0.3 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to lower headcount, a $0.5 million decrease in prototype part expenses and a $0.3 million decrease in consulting and professional services expenses.

Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $0.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The difference was primarily driven by higher financing fees related to the 2024 Notes recognized in the prior year period compared to current period.

As of September 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of the notes held by Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender (the “2024 Notes”) totaled $27.1 million and the estimated fair value of the Convertible Note from Motiv’s controlling investor was $5.1 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender converted $19.0 million in principal into Common Stock, and the Company recorded a $1.4 million fair value net loss on conversion.

As of September 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of the warrants held by Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender (the “2024 Warrants”) totaled $10.0 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded a net fair value loss of $6.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to the 2024 Warrants.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized a gain on sale of assets of $13.8 million primarily related to the Sale Leaseback of its Union City, IN Facility.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized a gain of $4.8 million related to deferred revenue upon termination of the Tropos Assembly Services Agreement.

As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $12.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25.5 million in restricted cash, net accounts receivable of $1.2 million, other receivables of $1.5 million, net inventory of $30.0 million and accounts payable of $11.2 million.

The proposed transaction with Motiv includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s largest investor provide Workhorse with up to $20 million in debt financing at closing. Approximately $10 million is to be made available after the closing for general corporate purposes pursuant to a revolving credit facility, and $10 million is to be made available after the closing to fund vehicle manufacturing upon the receipt of confirmed purchase orders pursuant to an ABL facility. The terms of this financing have not been finalized.

Third Quarter Financial Overview

“Our proposed transaction with Motiv will provide Workhorse with a simplified capital structure and the near-term liquidity to support our operations through the proposed transaction close,” said Workhorse CFO Bob Ginnan. “We continue to take additional steps to extend our financial runway and efficiently manage our cash flow by reducing operating costs and improving working capital needs. We are confident in our ability to generate additional purchase orders and revenue from our customers while strengthening our financial position, and we look forward to completing the proposed transaction with Motiv.”

Mumbai: Telecom sector experts have raised concerns over Vodafone Idea 's declining capital expenditure in absence of external funding and the operator's ability to strengthen its network to compete with rivals Jio and Bharti Airtel During the September quarter, the telco's capex fell 28% to ₹1,750 crore, sharply below analyst expectations of around ₹2,600 crore, and marked a steep decline from ₹2,440 crore in the previous quarter, according to reports from UBS, JPMorgan and Axis Capital The company's net loss narrowed to ₹5,560 crore from ₹6,610 crore in the previous quarter, primarily driven by lower interest charges. Revenue increased 2.4% year-on-year to ₹11,190 crore, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 3% to ₹4,690 crore with margins stable at 41.9%. According to UBS, the net loss was lower than its estimated loss of ₹6,700 crore due to lower than expected interest charges.Operationally, Vodafone Idea showed signs of stabilisation. The company lost a million subscribers during the quarter, bringing its total to 196.7 million, the lowest quarterly loss in more than 20 quarters. Average revenue per user increased 1.2% quarter-on-quarter to ₹167. The company added about 400,000 4G subscribers to reach 127.8 million, while data consumption jumped 19% year-on-year.Network expansion slowed alongside the capex reduction. Axis Capital said the telco's broadband tower and site additions declined significantly compared to recent quarters. The company's 4G population coverage stands at 84%, with plans to expand to 90%, while 5G service is now available in 29 cities across 17 circles."Lower capex can impact network quality/improvements at VI," JPMorgan said.Analysts emphasised in their reports that the company's commentary on capital raising and regulatory relief on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues would be crucial for investor sentiment.Recent Supreme Court rulings allowing reassessment of AGR dues provided some relief, as Vodafone Idea said it "welcomes the judgments" and is "in discussion with DoT (Department of Telecommunications) for next steps", according to the reports. The company's bank debt declined to ₹1,530 crore from ₹1,930 crore during the quarter, but cash reserves more than halved to ₹3,080 crore from ₹6,830 crore.Analysts maintained cautious ratings on the company's stock. UBS held a 'neutral' rating with a ₹9.7 price target, JPMorgan kept 'neutral' at ₹7.5 and Axis Capital maintained 'reduce' at ₹6. JPMorgan said, "Key stock driver will be management comments on capital raising in light of potential government relief on past AGR dues."

[TITLE]Industry bodies oppose auction of 6GHz spectrum:
[TEXT]
Industry body Broadband India Forum (BIF), international bodies such as the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) Alliance and companies such as Qualcomm have called for a delicensing of spectrum, in contrast to leading telcos calling for an auction of the 6GHz spectrum.

In a submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) regarding auction of Radio Frequency Spectrum for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT), the BIF said that the Upper 6GHz band should be completely delicensed while low-power indoors (LPI) and Very Low Power Wi-Fi should be permitted.

“India’s digital future depends on broadband wireless connectivity delivered by Wi-Fi. Importantly, 6 GHz Wi-Fi technology is available now, enabling advanced and affordable communications. However, currently in India, 6 GHz Wi-Fi capabilities are impaired because access to the spectrum remains unavailable,” said BIF.

The association argued that this keeps Indian consumers and enterprises from realising the full benefits of higher data rates, ultra-low and deterministic latencies, improved mobility, better power efficiency, optimisation of energy utilisation or support for high densities of users and devices.

It also pointed out how US and other countries have delicensed the entire 6GHz band more than five years ago, resulting in huge economic value from opening the band years ago.

“Device affordability improves when manufacturers can sell globally standard 6 GHz-enabled devices, instead of having to make regionspecific variants. This brings down costs everywhere,” it said.

Similarly, Qualcomm asked that the entire Upper 6 GHz band (including 6425–6725 MHz and 7025–7125 MHz spectrum bands) be earmarked for IMT, and revisited post-World Radiocommunication Conference 2027 (WRC-27). This would help India align with global harmonisation efforts and its own 6G ambitions.

“India must resist the temptation of short-term spectrum monetisation and instead prioritise strategic long-term economic and national security gains. The Upper 6 GHz band is critical for mobile growth in India and it may be noted that several other countries like China, Brazil and European countries are considering the entire 700 MHz in this Upper 6 GHz band for 6G,” said Qualcomm.

ITU-APT Foundation of India (IAFI) is a non-profit, non-political, non- partisan organisation argued that 5G deployment relies on extensive low-, mid-, and high-band frequencies across dense small-cell networks — dramatically raising capital costs. Traditional auctions force telcos to pay high upfront fees for exclusive, long-term licenses, which limits cash flow for infrastructure expansion and innovation.

“Spectrum auctions inherently favour incumbents with deep pockets. Large operators can afford to spend billions on licenses, while startups or smaller regional carriers cannot. This dynamic entrenches existing monopolies or oligopolies and limits new entrants who might offer innovative services or business models. In India, this structure has effectively discouraged new entrants,” it said.

Earlier, telecom operators Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea were reported to have asked the government for auction allocation of the entire 6GHz band, with 1200MHz of spectrum, with no sharing with others for low-powered delicensed wifi use. It may be noted however, that the India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA) India asked the government to defer the auction until 2030 to ensure clear international consensus and market readiness.

[TITLE]Before spectrum goes under the hammer, telcos make an urgent plea:
[TEXT]
Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have called for sharply lowering the base price for the next spectrum auctions and extending the spectrum usage period to as long as 40 years. In submissions made to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the telecom operators said this is needed to ensure robust network expansion and accelerate 5G deployment.

The request, which comes ahead of the next spectrum auction likely early next year, reflects persistent concerns among operators that steep reserve prices are stifling investment, leaving valuable airwaves unsold, and ultimately undermining the government’s Digital India vision. Having cheaper airwaves is necessary to free up capital for network infrastructure, the telecom companies said.

“Excessively high reserve prices keep valuable spectrum idle and result in operators facing capacity and capital constraints," Rahul Vatts, chief regulatory officer of Bharti Airtel, stated in a submission to Trai. He said spectrum that remains unsold or underutilized due to inflated pricing is a "direct loss to the country," delaying network expansion and degrading service quality. By reducing costs, operators could redirect capital toward “network densification, faster 5G rollout, and wider rural coverage."

Spectrum represents a critical revenue stream for the government, which sets a base price and expects companies to bid higher. A premium over the reserve price translates into higher government revenue. However, aggressive bidding has eased since 2021, with most of the airwaves sold near reserve prices—a shift driven by industry consolidation, high base prices, and the financial burden of recent 5G rollouts.

Reliance Jio, India's largest telco by market share, urged Trai to recommend a reserve price set at 50% of the spectrum valuation, arguing that the current valuation of 70% is "too steep and not conducive of wider participation." Jio contended that this aggressive pricing prevents genuine price discovery and competition, leading instead to sales at or near the reserve floor.

Validity

Beyond pricing, operators have also called for extending the duration of using spectrum to 30 or 40 years from the current 20 years. They argue that a longer term provides greater policy stability, enhances business viability, and enables the sustained investments required for next-generation network technologies. The Union cabinet had previously approved increasing the tenure to 30 years in 2021 to infuse liquidity, but this was never implemented, with Jio noting that Trai's valuation had simply multiplied the 20-year price by 1.5, negating the intended financial benefit.

The industry's request runs contrary to the public stance of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal recently pushed back on the necessity of lower prices.

“I have not seen any TSP come to me saying that they are not using a respective spectrum because its pricing is high," Mittal told reporters last month, questioning how data prices remain low if spectrum acquisition costs are supposedly prohibitive. Mittal maintained that the timing of the next auction would be determined by the "appetite and the demand" among stakeholders. If the reserve prices are so high, how could data prices be so low, Mittal questioned.

Bharti Airtel also said that in future auctions, telcos should be allowed a payment moratorium of six years, followed by 14 equal annual installments. This is because any new network takes a time period of at least 4-5 years to monetize and huge upfront payments combined with short moratorium periods could cause significant financial strain on operators, according to Airtel.

Currently, operators can make full or part upfront payment for the spectrum within 10 days from issuing spectrum. They can also make an upfront payment equal to the installments of at least two years, with the balance payable in equal installments with applicable interest, within the 20-year spectrum holding period. Operators are also allowed to make payment for spectrum in 20 equal annual instalments.

Unsold spectrum

Trai is also looking into concerns raised by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), which flagged a lack of effective competition in previous auctions due to industry consolidation and the oversupply of unsold airwaves. The DoT data shows over 12,000 MHz of traditional band spectrum remains unsold. In an effort to mitigate this issue, Trai has sought comments on potentially allowing other entities—such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or large connected device network operators—to bid for spectrum alongside wireless carriers.

The telecom carriers uniformly opposed this proposal. Vodafone Idea stated that allowing non-traditional bidders would "impact the robustness of the licensing framework" and create "huge complications related to valuation," arguing it runs counter to the structure of the new Telecommunications Act 2023.

Operators also said that referring to the currently available spectrum inventory as an “over-supply" may not accurately reflect market realities. “Rather, this spectrum should be viewed as strategic reserve capacity intended to address future growth requirements and regional variations in demand," Bharti Airtel said.

A recent analysis by V.J. Christopher, wireless advisor at DoT, flagged that nearly 36% of the spectrum on auction since 2010 was cleared at the base price, and only 15.5% was sold at a premium.

Another grouse relates to the duration of using the spectrum.

Currently, spectrum is issued for a period of 20 years. The Union cabinet in 2021 recommended increasing it to 30 to ensure long-term policy stability, improve business viability, and facilitate sustained investment in advanced technologies. However, the move did not take off. Jio said this should have been implemented in 2022 itself but wasn't, due to what it called Trai’s "aggressive valuation".

While the three carriers agree on the need for cheaper spectrum, they are divided on auctioning some new bands.

Reliance Jio is advocating for a comprehensive release strategy, urging that all nationally and globally identified International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) bands be auctioned immediately to ensure policy predictability and accelerate 6G readiness. Specifically, Jio wants the entire 6 GHz band to be auctioned now, with payment obligations kicking in only when the full band becomes available in 2030.

Bharti Airtel, is opposed to the plan. The company wants the auction of new bands like 600 MHz and parts of 6 GHz to be deferred for approximately two years. Airtel cited unresolved technical conflicts and the current "early stage" of the device and network ecosystem for both bands, suggesting that a premature auction would lead to underutilization.

The operators also requested the government to relax minimum rollout obligations, designed to ensure the swift deployment of purchased spectrum. Airtel highlighted the difficulty in meeting these commitments for the 26 GHz band, citing limited device compatibility and chipset constraints, and requested an extension to avoid financial penalties. The debate underscores a critical tension between the government’s desire for revenue maximization and the industry’s need for capital efficiency to fund the massive investment required for a true, nationwide 5G transformation.

[TITLE]Multi-Tenant Data Centers Business Analysis Report 2025: Market to Reach $91 Billion by 2030, Driven by Growing Demand for Scalable IT Infrastructure and Rise in 5G Deployments:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Multi-Tenant Data Centers - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Multi-Tenant Data Centers was estimated at US$47.9 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$91.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Multi-tenant data centers (MTDCs) have become an essential part of the global digital infrastructure, providing a shared space for multiple organizations to house their data and IT assets. The rise of cloud computing and the rapid increase in data generation have created a strong demand for scalable and cost-effective data management solutions, driving the growth of MTDCs.

These centers allow companies to benefit from the latest data storage technology without the burden of high upfront capital expenditure and maintenance costs. MTDCs offer better flexibility, enhanced security features, and customizable options to meet individual business needs, making them a preferred choice over traditional on-premises data centers. Furthermore, the increased reliance on IT services across industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce means that MTDCs offer a solution that can effectively support these sectors` digital transformation needs.

What Factors Are Driving the Growth of the Multi-Tenant Data Centers Market?

The growth in the multi-tenant data centers market is driven by several factors, including the increasing adoption of cloud computing services, the expansion of digital economies, and the need for scalable and cost-effective IT infrastructure. One key driver is the growing demand for hybrid cloud solutions that require a reliable and secure physical backbone, which MTDCs provide. The rise of data-intensive technologies such as IoT, AI, and big data analytics has also led to an increased need for facilities capable of handling large volumes of data, pushing more organizations to adopt MTDC solutions.

Additionally, the emphasis on sustainability and green practices in data center operations has attracted enterprises that prioritize environmentally conscious partnerships. The proliferation of 5G technology and the resulting need for edge computing capabilities have further boosted the market, as MTDCs help reduce latency by providing strategically located data processing points. Lastly, regulatory requirements for data localization in various regions have pushed companies to leverage MTDCs to maintain compliance without the heavy investments needed for building standalone facilities.

How Is Cloud Adoption Revolutionizing the MTDC Landscape?

The cloud adoption trend is reshaping the MTDC market as enterprises seek hybrid cloud solutions that combine the benefits of public and private clouds with on-premises systems. MTDCs play a crucial role in this integration by providing a middle-ground that facilitates workload portability and seamless connectivity between different environments. This trend has spurred demand for MTDC services, especially from businesses focusing on disaster recovery and business continuity solutions.

The colocation model offered by MTDCs enables companies to access a high-performance, low-latency network infrastructure without the complexity of managing their own data centers. In addition, the rise of IoT (Internet of Things) devices has contributed to data volume growth, pushing the need for more data center space and capacity. MTDCs are thus at the forefront, providing the infrastructure needed to handle the immense data generated from interconnected smart devices.

What Role Does Sustainability Play in Shaping the Future of MTDCs?

Sustainability is increasingly becoming a focal point in the development of MTDCs. Data centers are known to consume vast amounts of energy, prompting significant environmental concerns. As a result, operators of MTDCs are investing heavily in renewable energy sources, energy-efficient cooling solutions, and green building designs to reduce their carbon footprints.

This focus on sustainability has not only improved the operational efficiency of data centers but has also become a critical factor for enterprises when choosing a data center partner. The trend toward carbon-neutral operations is motivated by both regulatory pressures and a growing preference among customers for eco-friendly IT solutions. To meet this demand, MTDC providers are integrating technologies like liquid cooling, waste heat recycling, and even partnerships with utility companies to ensure their operations contribute less to greenhouse gas emissions.
