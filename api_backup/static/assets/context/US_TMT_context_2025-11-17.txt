[TITLE]RBC Capital says these software companies are the most likely to be acquired as AI eats the world:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for "opportunistic" buyers.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.

According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.

"We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity," the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

A chart showing software M&A activity RBC Capital Markets

While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.

While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.

Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

Asana (ASAN): Under pressure amid rising AI-native competition and ongoing industry consolidation, the workplace and project management company remains a potential takeover target despite its founder-controlled voting structure.

Box (BOX): With growth stagnating and shares undervalued, the cloud content management company could attract private equity buyers seeking to reset expectations or strategic acquirers interested in its horizontal content platform.

Confluent (CFLT): Positioned attractively in the data streaming layer, Confluent could appeal to a strategic buyer seeking deeper data infrastructure capabilities.

Coursera (COUR): Despite headwinds in EdTech, Coursera's large learner base and AI partnerships make it an appealing target for strategic buyers or as a cornerstone for a PE-led rollup.

Dropbox (DBX): Lacking the scale advantages of larger cloud storage rivals, Dropbox could become a target if new products underperform, with greater value realized as part of a bigger platform.

DocuSign (DOCU): If the e-signature company's identity access management pivot fails to gain traction, DocuSign could attract private equity interest, though its valuation may deter many bidders.

Elastic (ESTC): Elastic's GenAI momentum and leadership in search make it a logical target for strategic consolidation.

Five9 (FIVN): With strong contact-center-as-a-service (CCaaS) technology and margin improvement potential, Five9 could appeal to enterprise companies such as Salesforce or Cisco, or to private equity once leadership stabilizes.

Fastly (FSLY): Its solid edge-computing technology and reasonable valuation could make Fastly an attractive target to acquirers such as Google or Cisco.

Gen Digital (GEN): With stable margins, strong cash flow, and revenue synergies, the cybersecurity and fintech platform could be a compelling buyout candidate for private equity.

GitLab (GTLB): GitLab's growing presence in developer security operations and GenAI developer tools positions it as an appealing strategic acquisition.

ZoomInfo (GTM): This company's valuable customer relationship management data and integration potential make it a fit for large platforms such as Salesforce or a PE candidate for operational optimization.

N-Able (NABL): Its foothold in the fragmented managed service provider and small and medium-sized enterprise market makes N-Able an attractive consolidation play for private equity.

NICE (NICE): Misunderstood by markets and undervalued, NICE's CCaaS and compliance businesses could unlock value through a takeover or breakup.

Nutanix (NTNX): As hybrid-cloud adoption grows, Nutanix's scale and SaaS shift could make it a strategic target for major IT vendors.

PagerDuty (PD): PagerDuty fits as a logical acquisition to strengthen an integrated IT operations platform.

Qualys (QLYS): High margins and leadership in vulnerability management make Qualys an attractive consolidation target within the cloud security sector.

Rapid7 (RPD): Following restructuring and a pivot from cybersecurity toward DevSecOps, Rapid7's improved cash profile could appeal to private equity buyers.

Teradata (TDC): Its progress in cloud analytics positions Teradata as a potential acquisition target for large vendors or PE firms.

Varonis (VRNS): Focused on data security and governance, Varonis is well placed for a strategic GenAI-driven acquisition.

Zoom (ZM): While a sale is unlikely soon, Zoom's best-in-class video platform could entice acquirers seeking synergies in AI and collaboration.

[TITLE]US-China tech war: Nexperia saga exposes Europe's loosening grip on chip supply chain:
[TEXT]
"Chinese wafer fabs possess the technical capability to fulfil Nexperia's orders," said Arisa Liu, chief director and research fellow at Taiwan Industry Economics Services, a databank of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

Experts, however, suggested that Chinese fabs might be ready to supply the wafers needed by Nexperia's local facility.

Nexperia's Chinese management refused to comply with directives from its head office and planned to switch to local wafer suppliers, a transition that could take at least six months. Meanwhile, the Dutch headquarters warned clients that products from the Chinese facility may be substandard.

Nexperia's Chinese facility had relied on wafers from its fabrication plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, but those shipments were abruptly halted as the Dutch-based company grappled with an internal conflict.

Wafers, which are cut into dies, are the core materials in assembling integrated circuits used in computing, communications and power switch applications.

For nearly a month, parts of Nexperia's Dongguan production lines have sat idle. Two factory workers said this week that some machinery had been turned off due to a wafer shortage since late last month, with one estimating that a third of the machines were idled - echoing earlier reports by the Post.

The Nexperia saga, which has created a global car chip shortage, reveals a new reality: Europe's once-vaunted neutrality and industrial sovereignty are eroding, while China's foundational role in manufacturing has become too large to fail and too complex to legally unwind.

[TITLE]Restoring America’s manufacturing backbone through semiconductor leadership:
[TEXT]
It’s no secret that America—the birthplace of the transistor and, by extension, the modern semiconductor industry—has gradually ceded its leadership in the manufacturing of semiconductors.

These chips power everything from smartphones and cars to satellites, advanced defense systems and artificial intelligence. They are the backbone of the modern economy and the foundation of next generation technology such as quantum computing. Simply put, semiconductors are essential for modern life and critical to our technological future.

For decades, many American semiconductor companies followed a “design here, build elsewhere” strategy that led to a decline of U.S.-based manufacturing from 37% in 1900 to just 10% by 2022.

While these companies were following clear economic logic, the negative consequences to both economic, supply chain and national security should concern us all. Without a strong semiconductor manufacturing base, America is vulnerable in times of crisis. And our leadership role in the technologies of the future that rely on semiconductors is at risk.

The Trump administration has taken bold and necessary steps to reverse this decline. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act enhanced the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit, sending a clear signal: the United States is serious
