[TITLE]Paramount Skydance’s David Ellison Sends Letter to Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholders Making Case for Why Its Bid Is Better Than Netflix Deal: ‘I Am Passionate and Dedicated to This Pursuit’:
[TEXT]
David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount Skydance who has launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, is urging WBD shareholders to tender their shares and “register their view with the WBD board of directors that they prefer the superior Paramount transaction,” the company said.

Paramount sent a letter from Ellison Wednesday addressed to WBD shareholders (read the full text below). According to Paramount, the letter “clearly sets out why Paramount’s $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD’s transaction with Netflix.”

“We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business,” Ellison wrote in the letter. “I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today.”

Among other points, Ellison’s letter to WBD shareholders reiterates Paramount’s claim that the Netflix deal with Warner Bros. Discovery undervalues WB’s TV networks. According to Paramount’s estimates, the WBD networks group (which the company plans to spin off as Discovery Global) has a value of $1 per share, whereas the WBD board’s rejection of Paramount’s $30/share offer for the entire company implies WBD is valuing the global networks business at at least $2.25/share.

On Monday, Ellison’s Paramount Skydance launched a direct-to-shareholders hostile takeover effort for WBD, with its most recent bid carrying an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. That came after Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery on Dec. 5 announced an $83.7 billion agreement, under which the streamer would buy WB’s studios, HBO, HBO Max and games divisions.

Warner Bros. Discovery said Monday that its board will “carefully” review the Paramount offer and issue a recommendation within 10 business days (as required by law). WBD’s review of the Paramount bid is a formality, as Paramount already had submitted the $30/share bid on Dec. 4 to the board.

The next step would be a higher per-share offer from Paramount Skydance in the coming days. Ellison noted that Paramount had communicated to WBD’s representatives that the $30/share proposal was not Paramount’s “best and final” offer.

Earlier Wednesday, two Democratic lawmakers — U.S. Reps. Sam Liccardo (D-Calif.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) — sent a letter to WBD CEO David Zaslav expressing “serious national security concerns” over Paramount Skydance‘s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery because the Paramount bid is backed by the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. According to Paramount, the three Arab wealth funds “have agreed to forgo any governance rights — including board representation,” which the company asserts means it does not need a review by CFIUS, interagency government entity tasked with oversight of foreign investment in U.S. companies.

[TEXT]
NOV becomes investor in Natura Resources (“Natura”) and appoints representative to Natura’s Board of Directors in conjunction with the sale of Shepherd Power

NOV and Natura sign Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to establish a supply chain agreement where NOV will leverage its manufacturing, supply chain, and project management expertise to support scaling advanced nuclear power solutions

HOUSTON, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOV Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today announced the sale of Shepherd Power, its advanced nuclear development company, to Natura, a leading developer of advanced small modular reactor (“SMR”) technology. As part of the transaction, NOV and Natura have signed an MOU to establish a supply chain agreement where NOV will provide manufacturing and project management expertise to support scaled deployment of Natura’s advanced nuclear reactors.

Specifically, the supply chain agreement is expected to support Natura’s plans to deploy 100-megawatt molten salt reactor units for data center and industrial markets starting in 2029 and reaching scale in 2032. The cooperation will leverage NOV’s manufacturing footprint and procurement expertise alongside Natura’s reactor platform.

“The power market is one of the most significant industrial growth opportunities of the next decade,” said Jose Bayardo, President and COO of NOV. “Our collaboration with Natura allows NOV to bring its unmatched manufacturing and project management capabilities into an adjacent sector that demands the same rigor, scale, and reliability we have delivered to energy customers for more than a century. We believe that Natura’s technology will be one of the first advanced reactors commercially available in the United States. Natura’s molten salt reactor design incorporates critical safety features and leverages the existing uranium supply chain, enabling the ability to scale manufacturing of reactors that can economically produce heat and power.”

“This strategic transaction will accelerate commercialization of our molten salt reactor technology and enhance our ability to offer comprehensive power solutions to customers,” said Doug Robison, Founder and CEO of Natura Resources. “Shepherd Power is a leading voice in the advanced nuclear regulatory space, having significantly contributed to commercial licensing clarity with federal and state regulators and has expertise in the requirements to site, build, own and operate reactors. Combined with NOV’s expertise in scaling highly engineered equipment to drive down delivery costs, this transaction positions us to lead in delivering gigawatts of safe, advanced nuclear reactors within the next 5 years to support critical power needs and fuel American A.I. leadership.”

Natura is developing molten salt SMR technology, engineered for use at modern datacenters supporting artificial intelligence expansion, large industrial micro-grid applications, and industrial heat installations. Shepherd Power, founded by NOV, has catalyzed regulatory and licensing reform at the federal and state level. Its integration into Natura unites complementary capabilities focused on commercial reactor deployment. As part of the transaction, NOV will become an investor in Natura and will appoint a representative to Natura’s Board of Directors, ensuring continued collaboration in advanced nuclear technologies.

Insurance Australia Group Ltd (ASX: IAG) shares are lagging the broader market on Thursday.

While the ASX 200 index is up 0.7%, the insurance giant's shares are trading slightly lower at $7.82, weighed down by competition concerns raised by regulators.

So, what's going on today? Let's find out.

ACCC blocks IAG's proposed RAC Insurance acquisition

The big news dragging on investor sentiment is that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will oppose IAG's proposed acquisition of RAC Insurance (RACI) from the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia.

In a detailed ruling, the competition watchdog concluded that the deal would likely substantially lessen competition in Western Australia's insurance market.

RACI is the market leader in both motor and home insurance in the state, while IAG, through brands such as NRMA, is already one of the state's strongest competitors.

According to the ACCC, combining the two would give IAG:

55% to 65% market share in motor insurance, and

50% to 60% market share in home and contents insurance.

These are numbers the regulator says would allow IAG to raise premiums and reduce service quality due to less competitive pressure. The ACCC's chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said:

We concluded that the proposed acquisition would eliminate the significant competition between IAG and RACI, and reduce the competitive pressure they each place on rival insurance brands. We concluded that the acquisition would be likely to allow IAG, after acquiring RACI, to increase premiums and reduce the quality of its suite of insurance products, with likely flow on effects to the offerings of other insurers.

The ACCC also rejected the argument that RACI might struggle to compete in the future, adding:

Our investigation found that RACI remains a strong and profitable competitor and is adequately positioned to manage these challenges. We have concluded that if IAG doesn't acquire RACI, RACI would have the capability to continue to compete effectively in Western Australia in the future.

IAG responds

IAG has acknowledged the ACCC's decision but isn't walking away from the proposal.

The ASX 200 stock revealed that it will lodge an application under the new mandatory merger control regime, which begins on 1 January 2026.

IAG's CEO, Nick Hawkins, maintains that the alliance would ultimately benefit RAC members and the broader WA community. He said:

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow jumps 650 points to post record, S&P 500 climbs above 6,900 for first time:
[TEXT]
The Dow and S&P 500 notched new records on Thursday as US stocks mostly rose, with tech stocks under more pressure after Oracle (ORCL) earnings revived AI overspending worries.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), gained around 1.3%, or nearly 650 points, to set a new all-time high, even as the likes of component Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also notched a fresh record close at 6,900, adding to Wednesday's rally that followed the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid by 0.3%.

Stocks largely continued on Wednesday's rally despite a nearly 11% slide from Oracle (ORCL). The company's earnings late Wednesday brought AI spending fears back with a vengeance, after the software giant missed on cloud sales and hiked its already aggressive data center spending by $15 billion.

But Wall Street's mostly upbeat mood continued after a split Fed voted to lower rates for the third time this year. Policymakers signaled a more gradual path of easing in the months ahead, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate hike would be off the table for January, while talking up the US economy's strength.

Powell said the Fed is "well positioned to wait and see" how economic conditions evolve, adding that tariffs imposed under President Trump have contributed to inflation pressures that the central bank sees as a "one-time" increase.

That put the spotlight on a weekly update on jobless claims on Thursday, which came in significantly higher than expected at 236,000. That was the biggest jump since 2020, after dipping to a three-year low in the Thanksgiving week. The next signal on the labor market will come from the delayed November jobs report, set for release next Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest in over five years as exports surged, potentially reflecting a boost to the wider economy in the third quarter.

Also, earnings reports continue with Broadcom (AVGO), Costco (COST), and Lululemon (LULU) all set to release results.

[TITLE]South Korea eyes creating $3.1bn foundry to grow local chip sector:
[TEXT]
SEOUL (Reuters) -- South Korea is considering building a 4.5 trillion won ($3.06 billion) foundry to make essential chips, funded by state and private investment, part of efforts to gain an edge in a race to nurture local semiconductor firms as demand for AI chips grows.

President Lee Jae Myung presided over a meeting on Wednesday attended by executives from chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, as well as policymakers and experts to lay out plans to maintain the country's lead in memory chips, strengthen the foundry business and expand fabless chip design in the artificial intelligence era.

"South Korea needs to take a new leap forward, and ... the semiconductor sector is an area where we are very competitive," Lee said.

South Korea, home to the world's two biggest memory chip makers, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, has been struggling to catch up in the contest to design and manufacture logic chips, led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. as well as Nvidia, Qualcomm and other firms.

South Korea will consider setting up a 12-inch, 40-nanometer foundry to help fabless firms develop and test legacy chips that are used in cars, data centers and other applications, the industry ministry said in a statement.

The ministry said it will consult with South Korean foundry companies like Samsung Electronics and DB HiTek to set up the facility, which will be jointly funded by the public and private sectors.

"We face a very serious crisis and challenge. The semiconductor industry has already escalated from competition between companies to war between nations," Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan said, citing competition among China, the U.S., Europe and Japan to support their own chip industries.

South Korea will also seek to produce locally defense-related semiconductors, given that the sector relies on imports for 99% of its supplies, the ministry said.

The government will consider putting in a provision for the priority purchase of domestic semiconductors in national security infrastructure in a related law, it said.

A special committee on semiconductors will be established under President Lee to act as the control center for national policies on chips, the statement said.

[TITLE]Japan’s Cyber Chief Warns Nation Still Behind on Cybersecurity:
[TEXT]
Japan still lags behind the US and Europe in defending against cyber threats and improvements are needed across the corporate sector, the nation’s new cyber chief said.

“We have our intention to improve our capability, but it’s just started,” National Cyber Director Yoichi Iida said in an interview with Bloomberg News on the sidelines of a cybersecurity conference in Tokyo on Tuesday.

A string of recent breaches have highlighted Japan’s vulnerabilities. A crippling ransomware attack halted operations at Asahi Group Holdings Ltd., while Askul Corp. suffered a breach that disrupted its e-commerce platform. Nikkei Inc. also reported a virus infection that may have exposed employee and business partner information.

At the CYDEF 2025 conference, Iida said the severity and volume of cyberattacks against Japan had increased significantly, with an internet-connected device facing some form of malicious communication every 13 seconds.

Smaller Japanese companies remain the most exposed because of a lack of resources, but larger firms are far from immune, he told Bloomberg shortly after his speech.

“I would not be surprised if I found some hole or some mistake even by the major companies,” Iida said.

Japan’s goal is to raise its level of cybersecurity to at least the standard of advanced western nations such as the US and European countries. Earlier this year, it adopted an “active cyber-defense” law that will allow authorities to seek to neutralize the source of malicious cyberactivity and publicize information

[TITLE]Embed worker inputs while deploying AI:
[TEXT]
As Indian companies race to implement artificial intelligence across operations, a critical stakeholder remains conspicuously absent from the conversation: trade unions. While commentators proclaim unions’ declining relevance, global trends tell a different story. From the US to Europe, union membership is resurging as workers face economic uncertainty and technological disruption. In this context, the silence around AI and labour isn’t just problematic — it’s a strategic failure by both companies and unions.

When companies deploy AI without engaging union leaders, they create a vacuum that speculation quickly fills. Workers hear

[TITLE]Democrats will strangle AI with woke rules — unless Trump takes action:
[TEXT]
Democrats certainly learn from past mistakes.

After watching President Bill Clinton let the internet grow without federal rules, Democrats want to control artificial intelligence — and if need be, to kill it in the crib.

The only question is, where?

The executive order issued by President Joe Biden would have turned AI into a federal hand puppet serving the public policy goals of unions, educators and leftist activists.

But President Donald Trump reversed it, closing that path.

Now Democrats are looking to blue states to regulate AI instead, balkanizing its development under a hodgepodge of state rules.

That’s why Trump is pushing to place AI under federal jurisdiction.

He’s aiming to preempt state authority, thus avoiding a European Union-style AI quagmire here while protecting America’s national security position vis-à-vis China.

But Trump’s efforts are not going well.

In 1996, as the internet age dawned, Clinton declared that “the private sector should lead” its development.

Under his policy, the web “develop[ed] as a market-driven arena, not a regulated industry.”

Clinton’s approach meshed with those of congressional Republicans: Their 1996 Telecommunications Act established federal control over interstate service, with limits on liability exposure.

Today’s mobile communications miracles, with thousands of apps serving users on millions of phones, is a legacy to Clinton’s pragmatism.

Biden’s AI legacy would have been the opposite.

His EO, among the longest in history, imposed a federal top-down, command-and-control regulatory approach.

It required AI models to undergo extensive “impact assessments” before going forward, and “post-deployment performance monitoring” as well.

America’s AI would have been forced to reflect Biden’s “dedication to advancing equity and civil rights” by advancing “racial equity and support for underserved communities” and by improving “environmental and social outcomes.”

Now, with Biden out and Trump in, the AI traps have moved to the states — with California, of course, and Colorado taking the lead.

California has long wielded its economy — the fourth-largest in the world — in a tail-wagging-the-dog approach to push political and social change.

It’s thrown its economic weight around to make all US businesses meet California’s standards, such as its stringent CAFE auto fuel-efficiency rules.

California’s proposed AI legislation would empower its state attorney general as an AI uber-czar, making all AI models comply with Sacramento’s requirements for “safe, ethical, equitable, and sustainable” systems.

With $1 million in fines per violation, California’s law would create massive industry uncertainty, hindering AI’s development.

Colorado’s state law involves a “Mother, may I” approach to AI innovation — a process so unworkable that its Democrat-controlled legislature and governor have agreed to delay implementation to ease its burdens on Colorado businesses.

If AI nationwide developed under Colorado’s rules, the US Chamber of Commerce projects, the US would lose 713,000 jobs, shed $53 billion of GDP and cut national productivity —the single most important determinant of real wage growth — by 1%.

And that’s just one state and one law, with more than 1,100 AI bills pending in state legislatures.

To avoid an EU-like jambalaya of state rules and regulations, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tried to add a limited federal preemption of state AI laws in the One Big Beautiful Bill when it was still being hammered out.

Under Cruz’s plan, states could still impose AI restrictions preventing unfair or deceptive practices and protecting children — provided they did not impose excessive burdens on development.

His solution left some hot topics unaddressed — in particular, that of AI models’ use of intellectual property and their allegedly illegal lifting of copyrighted work.

But the Cruz amendment failed, and Congress remains deadlocked on a potential federal solution.

That’s why Trump is on the verge of taking action.

“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” he declared Monday in a Truth Social post.

This week, the president is expected to issue an executive order to put Cruz’s proposal into practice, limiting states’ ability to handcuff AI development.

To give it teeth, the order could direct regulators to withhold federal broadband funding and other grants from states that implement restrictive AI laws.

It’s a jerry-rigged solution at best: Federal legislation is still necessary to effectively override state AI rules.

Congress’ next shot will come in the New Year, as part of the Jan. 30 government funding bill.

Leaving the cutting-edge technology that will determine both our nation’s future economic prospects and its military security in the hands of 50 state legislatures seems unwise and dangerous — but that appears to be Congress’ plan.

[TITLE]Intel pursued deals that boosted CEO Lip-Bu Tan's fortune, sources say:
[TEXT]
Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.

Intel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a ‌venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.

Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.

The events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources.

Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials ‌are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.”

Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.

Meta’s interest spurred Intel to ​make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion.

Tan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company.

Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan.

Story Continues

Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said.

In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan.

Intel declined to make Zinsner available for an interview.

Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic U.S. chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said.

Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.”

Tan’s dealmaking comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating it as strategic to the U.S. and effectively making its citizens shareholders.

Some chip-industry analysts have said in ⁠research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.”

Tan does not ‌perceive his dealmaking at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these startups and at Intel make him uniquely able to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said.

In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s dealmaking posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date.

U.S. regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers ‍exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock.

DEALS TO REVIVE INTEL’S AI STRATEGY

Tan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalizing its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.”

Rivos was one of the major targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing startup SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said.

The rationale - debated inside Intel - was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said.

SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the startup and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said.

Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks.

Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke ​by Trump that the U.S. chip manufacturer’s CEO was "highly CONFLICTED.”

According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on U.S. national and economic security. In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal.

Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time.

TAKING CONTROL OF INTEL CAPITAL

Soon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control ‌of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganized the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change.

Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said.

One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the startup, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A&E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows.

ProteanTecs declined to comment. A&E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan "has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.”

Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show.

Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows.

Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million.

Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s dealmaking raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies.

One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don't want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specializing in corporate disclosures and insider trading.

TAN TOUTS HIS BOOK

The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio ⁠in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows.

At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in ​proteanTecs and SambaNova.

Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind ​conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.”

The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information.

Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure.

The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said.

The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10% of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or ‍2% of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, ⁠fell under this policy, which pre-dated Tan’s leadership.

INTEL EXPLORES BID FOR A STRUGGLING STARTUP

In 2018, SambaNova was a startup with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on its board.

Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper.

SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova.

But the startup’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which ⁠is designed for more specific AI applications.

In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15% of its staff, in April.

The chip startup tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 ‌billion at most, two of the sources said.

Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said.

In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the startup, two people familiar with the insider round said.

In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the startup recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.”

Deal talks with SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources ‌said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said.
