[TITLE]RBC Capital says these software companies are the most likely to be acquired as AI eats the world:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for "opportunistic" buyers.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.

According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.

"We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity," the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

A chart showing software M&A activity RBC Capital Markets

While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.

While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.

Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

Asana (ASAN): Under pressure amid rising AI-native competition and ongoing industry consolidation, the workplace and project management company remains a potential takeover target despite its founder-controlled voting structure.

Box (BOX): With growth stagnating and shares undervalued, the cloud content management company could attract private equity buyers seeking to reset expectations or strategic acquirers interested in its horizontal content platform.

Confluent (CFLT): Positioned attractively in the data streaming layer, Confluent could appeal to a strategic buyer seeking deeper data infrastructure capabilities.

Coursera (COUR): Despite headwinds in EdTech, Coursera's large learner base and AI partnerships make it an appealing target for strategic buyers or as a cornerstone for a PE-led rollup.

Dropbox (DBX): Lacking the scale advantages of larger cloud storage rivals, Dropbox could become a target if new products underperform, with greater value realized as part of a bigger platform.

DocuSign (DOCU): If the e-signature company's identity access management pivot fails to gain traction, DocuSign could attract private equity interest, though its valuation may deter many bidders.

Elastic (ESTC): Elastic's GenAI momentum and leadership in search make it a logical target for strategic consolidation.

Five9 (FIVN): With strong contact-center-as-a-service (CCaaS) technology and margin improvement potential, Five9 could appeal to enterprise companies such as Salesforce or Cisco, or to private equity once leadership stabilizes.

Fastly (FSLY): Its solid edge-computing technology and reasonable valuation could make Fastly an attractive target to acquirers such as Google or Cisco.

Gen Digital (GEN): With stable margins, strong cash flow, and revenue synergies, the cybersecurity and fintech platform could be a compelling buyout candidate for private equity.

GitLab (GTLB): GitLab's growing presence in developer security operations and GenAI developer tools positions it as an appealing strategic acquisition.

ZoomInfo (GTM): This company's valuable customer relationship management data and integration potential make it a fit for large platforms such as Salesforce or a PE candidate for operational optimization.

N-Able (NABL): Its foothold in the fragmented managed service provider and small and medium-sized enterprise market makes N-Able an attractive consolidation play for private equity.

NICE (NICE): Misunderstood by markets and undervalued, NICE's CCaaS and compliance businesses could unlock value through a takeover or breakup.

Nutanix (NTNX): As hybrid-cloud adoption grows, Nutanix's scale and SaaS shift could make it a strategic target for major IT vendors.

PagerDuty (PD): PagerDuty fits as a logical acquisition to strengthen an integrated IT operations platform.

Qualys (QLYS): High margins and leadership in vulnerability management make Qualys an attractive consolidation target within the cloud security sector.

Rapid7 (RPD): Following restructuring and a pivot from cybersecurity toward DevSecOps, Rapid7's improved cash profile could appeal to private equity buyers.

Teradata (TDC): Its progress in cloud analytics positions Teradata as a potential acquisition target for large vendors or PE firms.

Varonis (VRNS): Focused on data security and governance, Varonis is well placed for a strategic GenAI-driven acquisition.

Zoom (ZM): While a sale is unlikely soon, Zoom's best-in-class video platform could entice acquirers seeking synergies in AI and collaboration.

[TITLE]Can Xiaomi (XIACF) Overcome Safety and Production Issues in Its EV Business?:
[TEXT]
Xiaomi Corp. (OTC:XIACF) is among the most fantastic stocks every investor should pay attention to. On November 4, analysts from CLSA reaffirmed their “Buy” rating on the stock with a price target of HK$69.00, which equates to approximately $8.87 as of November 7 and a 63% upside potential.

Just three days before CLSA, on November 1, analysts from Goldman lowered their price target on Xiaomi Corp. (OTC:XIACF) to HK$56.50 ($7.26) from around HK$66.00 ($8.48) earlier. Among other reasons for the target cut, the analysts argued that the rising prices of memory semiconductors will lead to margin pressure for the company, as reported by Bloomberg. The company is expected to report a 23% year-over-year growth in revenue, according to the Bloomberg consensus, when it reports Q3 2025 earnings on November 18.

Can Xiaomi (XIACF) Overcome Safety and Production Issues in Its EV Business?

However, the weakness in the electric vehicle business appears to be overshadowing the company’s near-term outlook. A November 6 Bloomberg report highlighted that Goldman Sachs Group had noticed an increasing number of bearish bets on Xiaomi Corp. (OTC:XIACF), with caution being led by pension and hedge funds.

According to the feedback Goldman received from hedge funds, market sentiment has turned cautious amid ongoing safety concerns, production delays, and weaker-than-expected demand for its electric vehicles despite recent promotional efforts. They further indicated that Xiaomi is “a consensus short/sell at least in the short term due to a lack of catalysts”.

That said, the company remains a strong Buy, with a consensus 12-month median price target indicating 55% potential upside, based on data compiled by TipRanks.

Xiaomi Corp. (OTC:XIACF) is a consumer technology company known for its smartphones, smart home devices, and broader IoT products. The company has also expanded into electric vehicles in recent years.

While we acknowledge the potential of XIACF as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you’re looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Is SK Hynix (HXSCL) Positioned for Multi-Year Upside in the AI Memory Cycle?:
[TEXT]
SK hynix Inc. (OTC:HXSCL) is among the most fantastic stocks every investor should pay attention to. SK Hynix is the top performer in our list with YTD gains of around 260%. On October 31, Goldman Sachs upgraded the company’s rating to Buy from Neutral and raised the price target from KRW 300,000 to KRW 700,000. The analyst expects the company to be a beneficiary of “one of the strongest memory upcycles” through 2026.

Is SK Hynix (HXSCL) Positioned for Multi-Year Upside in the AI Memory Cycle?

Goldman expects the company to “meaningfully outgrow consensus expectations” with a 50% year-over-year growth in its High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) shipments. They also estimate that the server memory supply-demand dynamic will remain highly favorable for the company as large investments in AI infrastructure continue. According to their analysis, the majority of growth in next year’s DRAM supply will be consumed by server-related demand.

The investment bank also believes that emerging demand from the next-generation computing architecture, SOCAMM, will potentially account for 5% of global DRAM demand in 2026 and rise to 9% by 2027.

Goldman Sachs argues that “substantial upside remains” for earnings due to the accelerating AI memory cycle, despite street estimates for SK Hynix having already moved higher since September.

Separately, in a November 4 interview, Simon Woo, Director of Korea Research at Bank of America (BofA), observed that, unlike in previous cycles, when profits were largely cyclical, companies such as SK hynix Inc. (OTC:HXSCL) are now securing more stable earnings through long-term contracts. BofA recently raised its price target on SK Hynix to KRW700,000. Woo expects the recent rally in SK Hynix, as well as in Samsung Electronics, to sustain in the near term.

SK hynix Inc. (OTC:HXSCL) is a major global producer of memory semiconductors, including DRAM, NAND flash, and advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM), used in AI and data center applications.

While we acknowledge the potential of HXSCL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]YMTC moves ahead with third chipmaking fab in Wuhan despite U.S. sanctions — blacklisted Chinese chipmaker bets big on memory:
[TEXT]
Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC), China’s top NAND flash manufacturer and one of the most heavily scrutinized names in the chip war, is pushing ahead with plans for a third semiconductor plant in Wuhan. The facility is expected to begin mass production in 2027, in a move that underscores Beijing’s intention to double down on domestic memory capacity even as YMTC remains barred from acquiring advanced U.S. chipmaking tools.

The Wuhan expansion marks the company’s most ambitious project since being placed on the U.S. Entity List in December 2022, a designation that has crippled access to EUV and advanced DUV lithography, precision etching gear, and key U.S.-origin design IP. Yet, instead of collapsing, YMTC is adapting slowly with the full backing of China’s industrial policy apparatus.

Surviving the blacklist

YMTC’s situation is unlike that of Huawei, which was forced into a radical pivot toward software and cloud services following its sanctions. YMTC, by contrast, continues to manufacture supply-constrained NAND flash chips at scale, albeit at reduced efficiency and with aging process nodes. Its most advanced product, the 232-layer Xtacking 3.0 NAND, was benchmarked in late 2022 as competitive with Micron’s and Samsung’s offerings. But sustaining that lead has proven impossible without access to ASML’s cutting-edge tooling.

Various reports suggest that YMTC’s Fab 2 has been operating with domestic workarounds and modified legacy tools, relying in part on procurement from third-party intermediaries to secure essential chemicals and maintenance components. However, these workarounds are slow and painful.

One potential candidate is SMEE’s immersion lithography equipment, but this has yet to deliver consistent yields beyond 28nm logic equivalents, far from the sub-20nm half-pitch necessary for leading-edge NAND stacking. Still, YMTC’s new fab suggests confidence that by 2027, domestic toolchains will be capable enough to support high-volume NAND production if not at the bleeding edge, then at commercial scale.

Memory nationalism

The report by Nikkei Asia suggests that the timing of this announcement also aligns with China’s broader recalibration toward AI infrastructure resilience. With U.S. export restrictions locking out Chinese firms from Nvidia H100 and A100-class GPUs, Beijing has redirected its subsidies and engineering talent toward local accelerator design, sovereign foundation models, and the underlying memory and packaging stacks that make them viable.

In that context, NAND flash is arguably foundational. While DRAM remains the performance bottleneck in AI inference, NAND underpins persistent storage for massive model checkpoints, training data lakes, and parameter weights for retrieval-augmented generation. YMTC’s success here is thus critical not because its chips are the fastest, but because they’re Chinese.

That imperative is reflected in the composition of China’s "Little Giants" initiative, which is understood to support key industrial chains and strategic emerging industries such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing in the upstream value chain. YMTC, though technically a commercial entity under Tsinghua Unigroup, functions effectively as a state-backed lynchpin for this ecosystem.

It’s also worth noting that YMTC’s return to expansion mirrors Beijing’s new appetite for high-risk, high-capex investment in areas where U.S. export controls bite hardest, but enforcement remains inconsistent. In that grey area, YMTC might be betting that Washington’s resolve may soften over time, or that domestic tooling will catch up just enough to justify the investment.

Sanctions or no, it’s a tough NAND world

From a business standpoint, YMTC’s decision to break ground on a third fab lands during one of the tightest NAND cycles in recent memory. According to Phison CEO K.S. Pua, the price of a 1Tb TLC NAND die has more than doubled in the past six months, climbing from $4.80 to $10.70, with virtually all 2026 production capacity already sold out. NAND flash pricing is expected to remain elevated into 2027, as AI datacenter deployments and enterprise SSD demand continue to outpace wafer output across the major suppliers.

Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung are all riding that upturn, but their responses have been measured. Micron is prioritizing DRAM and HBM3E, while SK Hynix has pivoted to premium AI NAND. Samsung, for its part, is accelerating its transition to eighth-generation 3D V-NAND while absorbing the cost pressures that come with it. What none of them are doing is flooding the market with new capacity. YMTC, by contrast, is hoping to do exactly that, not because it sees an opening to grab global share, but because its political and economic mandate is different.

Beijing’s industrial planners are less concerned with global pricing cycles than with insulating domestic AI infrastructure from foreign dependency. If YMTC can bring its third fab online by 2027 — even at 128-layer or similar nodes — it can serve national storage demand across hyperscalers, surveillance systems, and edge compute. That volume won’t threaten Samsung’s lead, but it could give Chinese cloud providers a secure NAND supply at a time when export controls are steadily tightening and global inventories are already claimed.

There’s no denying that YMTC’s third fab is a geopolitical play as much as an economic one. On paper, its production timeline puts it three years away from volume output, which is an eternity in semiconductor terms. By 2027, however, the efficacy of U.S. sanctions will hinge on how well Chinese tooling ecosystems mature. YMTC bets that by then, it won’t need American equipment, or at least not enough to make the fab infeasible. Whether that turns out to be true is uncertain.

(Image credit: TSMC)

For the world’s top memory makers, YMTC’s continued growth even under U.S. sanctions is more than a marginal concern. With a third fab now in planning and domestic demand accelerating, the company is on track to become the fifth-largest NAND producer globally, and could climb to fourth if its expansion proceeds on schedule. According to Nikkei Asia, industry executives estimate that YMTC could capture 10% or more of global NAND production capacity by as early as next year, potentially overtaking Micron in volume terms.

Even if YMTC remains focused on serving China’s domestic market, that shift has global implications. For Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, it may force a recalibration of pricing strategies and long-term exposure to China, especially as Beijing continues to push for procurement of domestic components.

A fresh wave of spending to finance investments in artificial intelligence will help drive 2026 issuance in the US investment-grade market to a record $1.81 trillion next year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The full year projection surpasses the prior record of $1.76 trillion set in 2020, JPMorgan credit strategists including Nathaniel Rosenbaum and Eric Beinstein wrote in a note Friday. Issuers looking to refinance over $1 trillion of maturing debt, a boost in mergers and acquisitions, as well as the boom in AI capital spending will be key drivers for the material uptick in new bonds next year, they said.

This year’s debt binge was driven in part by better borrowing rates, the surge in AI spending as well as a revival in acquisitions. Despite all the recent worries

[TITLE]Chinese Tech Firm Leak Reportedly Exposes State Linked Hacking:
[TEXT]
A major data leak recently hit the Chinese security firm Knownsec (aka Chuangyu), where over 12,000 secret files briefly appeared on GitHub around November 2, 2025. It gave experts a rare look into China’s government-backed hacking tools and operations. The files were taken down quickly, though some evidence suggests the actual data theft may have happened as early as 2023.

Key Details

Knownsec is a huge player in China’s cybersecurity network, having received a major investment from Tencent in 2015, and it works closely with government offices. The stolen files seem to confirm how deeply a private company can be mixed up in national cyber programs, including helping build “cyber weapons” and keeping a list of international targets.

As the Chinese news outlet, Mrxn, reported, the leak is truly unprecedented because it points directly to spying and data collection on over 20 countries and regions globally. This list includes places like Japan, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, there’s a spreadsheet that claims to detail attacks on 80 foreign organisations, mainly critical infrastructure like telecommunications companies.

The amount of data reportedly stolen is overwhelming. This includes an enormous 95GB of immigration records from India and 3TB of call logs taken from the South Korean phone company LG U Plus. We also saw mentions of 459GB of transport data from Taiwan in the breach documents

Details, including one shared on X (formerly Twitter) by International Cyber Digest, highlighted the details of the hacking tools. These include Remote Access Trojans (RATs), which you can think of as hidden programs that let hackers secretly control computers or devices remotely.

The files also reveal special hacking tools for Android phones that sneakily pull out message histories from apps like Telegram and other well-known Chinese chat apps. It is worth noting that the documents even mention a seemingly harmless, malicious power bank designed to secretly upload data from a victim’s device while pretending to charge it.

Official Response and Security Lessons

When questioned about the leak, the Chinese government, through its Foreign Ministry spokesperson, officially denied having any knowledge of a breach at Knownsec. The spokesperson repeated that China is firmly against and fights all kinds of cyberattacks. However, the statement did not go so far as to deny that state-associated companies get involved in cyber intelligence work.

Security experts warn that basic antivirus and firewalls are often not enough anymore. Companies need a stronger, layered defence, which means combining standard protection with constant checking of their networks.

Nokia awarded multi-year deal to deploy nationwide 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) network across Indonesia

Nokia to deploy unique RAN and CPE solution for FWA delivering high-speed, low-latency broadband access in areas with limited fiber connectivity

Project supports Indonesian government's digital inclusion and affordable broadband initiatives

14th November 2025

Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced a multi-year partnership with leading Indonesian digital and telecommunications solutions provider, Surge, to enhance the country’s internet connectivity through an extensive 5G FWA network deployment in provinces including Java, Papua, and Maluku. The project will support the Indonesian government’s digital transformation goals and its ‘Affordable Broadband’ initiative to bridge the digital divide by bringing connectivity to more citizens. Deployment will start in December 2025.

Nokia will support Surge’s efforts to build a large-scale 5G FWA network based on the n50 spectrum band to deliver high-speed, low-latency broadband access to its customers, leveraging Nokia’s existing FTTx, IP and Optics infrastructure for backhaul and transport. Nokia has developed a customized, RAN and CPE solution for Surge, specifically for FWA use cases, delivering high-speed, low-latency broadband access, particularly in areas with limited fiber connectivity.

Nokia will also supply equipment from its industry-leading, energy-efficient AirScale Radio Access Network (RAN) portfolio, its latest generation of Nokia AirScale Baseband combined with RRH (Remote Radio Head), and zero-footprint site solutions for unmatched coverage across multiple deployment scenarios. These solutions are powered by Nokia’s energy-efficient ReefShark System-on-Chip technology, boosting Surge’s network for maximum performance, efficiency, and reliability.

Surge will also benefit from Nokia’s intelligent network management system, MantaRay NM, which provides a consolidated network view for optimal monitoring and management. The deal also includes deployment, maintenance, and support services that leverage AI for enhancing performance, efficiency, and safety.

Shannedy Ong, Director at Surge Indonesia commented: “This deal with Nokia gives us a platform to build a unique and best-in-class 5G network ready for the digital world that will bridge the digital divide and bring affordable connectivity to even more people. Digitalization will give our customers the best possible user experience.”

Mark Atkinson, Head of Radio Access Networks at Nokia, said: “This significant new partnership will see us work collaboratively to deliver premium connectivity experiences and accelerate the digitalization of society in Indonesia. We have created a unique solution combining our best-in-class technology that directly solves the specific demands of Surge as they deploy 5G connectivity across the country.”

[TITLE]Ericsson opens Bengaluru R&D unit to drive 5G software development:
[TEXT]
Ericsson has established a new Radio Access Network (RAN) software research and development (R&D) unit in Bengaluru, India

In explaining the rationale for its move, the comms tech provider says Bengaluru is recognised as one of the country’s fastest-growing technology hubs, and is well known for its skilled professional talent pool – especially in software engineering – hence the presence of major global telecom companies. It adds that the dynamic ecosystem positions the city as a prime location for R&D operations in India.

The initiative follows a number of recent Ericsson R&D investments in India, reflecting both the country’s skilled workforce and Ericsson’s commitment to the local and global markets.

Already boasting three R&D centres in India, located in Chennai, Bengaluru and Gurgaon, in 2023, Ericsson announced the launch of an India 6G programme with the formation of an India 6G research team in its Chennai R&D centre. This comprises senior research leaders and a team of researchers across the areas of radio, networks, artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud, who have been entrusted with developing fundamental services for the future of telecommunications.

Current R&D initiatives in the region include the recent expansion of application-specific integrated circuit development, unveiled in June 2025, aimed at fostering the semiconductor ecosystem in India. These efforts are designed to underscore Ericsson’s commitment to enhancing its portfolio.

The company’s R&D sites in Chennai, Bengaluru and Gurugram span critical telecom domains including transport, packet core, OSS, BSS, cloud and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The R&D unit will initially focus on developing 5G and 5G Advanced features for the Ericsson 5G baseband. The work will be carried out in close collaboration with the company’s global RAN software teams.

Ericsson is also collaborating with Volvo and Airtel to integrate XR and Digital Twin technologies at Volvo’s Bengaluru R&D Centre and working with IIT Madras to advance AI research for 6G networks, focusing on responsible AI frameworks. Additional partnerships with the Indian Statistical Institute and IIT Kharagpur target cyber physical systems, AI-driven networks, secure communications and edge computing.

On a broader note, regarding its global research funding, Ericsson said it invests approximately $5bn in R&D each year, mainly to drive 5G and next-generation technology development.

Nitin Bansal, managing director at Ericsson India and head of network solutions for South East Asia, Oceania and India, said: “Setting up the R&D Centre in India for RAN software development represents a significant step forward towards strengthening our R&D operations in India. Even as we leverage Indian software talent, we are also contributing to building the knowledge base and the telecom ecosystem in the country.”

David Bjore, head of RAN software and compute platforms at Ericsson, added: “This latest Ericsson R&D investment and commitment shows how important India is to our work on next-generation technology.

“We’re building on the strong partnerships we’ve formed in Bengaluru, Chennai and Gurugram, and for the first time, we’re developing this RAN software ourselves in India. This is a significant step, as it not only supports India’s rising tech scene, but also enables us to create solutions in the country that can have a global impact.”
