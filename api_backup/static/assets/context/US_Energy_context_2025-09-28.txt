[TEXT]
ZIBO, China, Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunrise New Energy Co., Ltd. (“Sunrise”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) (NASDAQ: EPOW), a leading innovator in battery anode materials, today announced that it has been recognized as one of the top eleven global suppliers of artificial graphite anode materials, covering both energy storage batteries and electric vehicle (EV) batteries. This recognition reflects Sunrise’s strong growth momentum and continuous advancements in technology and capacity.

After nearly four years of continuous effort, Sunrise has filed 97 domestic and international patents and has been granted 39 patents, including three patents in the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. According to ICC XINLUO Information’s report “2024 Global Artificial Anode Material Market Landscape”, Sunrise ranks among the top eleven worldwide in shipment volume.

A core strength of Sunrise lies in its fully self-operated graphitization process. The Company independently carries out all graphitization steps in-house, ensuring strict quality control, continuous process optimization, and stable supply. At the same time, Sunrise has significantly enhanced automation levels and improved supply chain management efficiency. These initiatives have led to a substantial reduction in production costs and enabled the Company to achieve profitability.

Looking ahead, Sunrise expects that ongoing optimization of production processes, combined with steady capacity expansion, will further drive down production costs. This cost advantage is expected to provide robust support for the Company’s continued revenue growth and sustained profitability in the years to come.

India said it held “constructive meetings” with the US this week on a trade deal, although Washington’s demand that New Delhi stop buying Russian oil is weighing on the negotiations.US trade negotiators made it clear to their Indian counterparts that resolving the Russia issue was crucial to reducing India’s tariff rate and sealing a trade deal, a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. While the negotiations this week were positive, they failed to yield any significant breakthroughs, the person said.An Indian team led by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal offered concessions to the US officials, including easing some restrictions on the import of genetically modified corn, and offering to buy more American defense and energy goods, the person said. Goyal said Wednesday that India was willing to buy more energy goods from the US “in the years to come.”President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50% last month, accusing New Delhi of helping Russian leader Vladimir Putin finance his war in Ukraine. India’s government has struck a defiant tone, saying it won’t halt Russian purchases and calling the US’s actions “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.”The trade negotiations in Washington from Sept. 22-24 were constructive, with both sides exchanging views on the “possible contours of the deal,” India’s government said in a statement. Goyal met with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Sergio Gor, Trump’s nominee for ambassador to India. The minister also met with Indian businesses and investors during the trip.A spokesperson for the US embassy in New Delhi said it doesn’t comment on private diplomatic conversations, while reiterating the Trump administration’s position that India’s actions were undermining US efforts to counter Russia. The 25% penalty on India “aims to deter countries from supporting the Russian economy through oil revenue and impose serious economic consequences on Russia for its ongoing aggression,” the spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.The impasse makes prospects for a trade deal uncertain despite optimism following last week’s resumption of talks and a call between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The US president’s recent crackdown on the immigration of skilled workers — rules that will disproportionately hurt Indian nationals — further complicates the negotiations.New Delhi’s broad strategy to secure a trade deal includes reducing the trade surplus with the US by buying more American goods, improving access to Indian markets and easing trade barriers, people familiar with the matter said.India is considering roughly $40 billion of big-ticket purchases such as defense and oil from the US, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. New Delhi is discussing buying limited quantities of genetically-modified corn, not meant for human consumption, and non-core dairy products, which aren’t produced in the nation, the people said.The US’s trade deficit with India stood at $42.7 billion in 2024.Officials have also conveyed to the US that any significant reduction in Russian oil imports would require Washington to instead allow crude purchases from sanctioned suppliers Iran and Venezuela, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

[TITLE]Shale oil execs say Trump policies are hurting investment, 'business is broken':
[TEXT]
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the UN headquarters on Sept. 23, 2025 in New York City.

Shale oil executives say President Donald Trump is hurting investment in the oil patch, and are giving a grim outlook for the future of the industry that turned the U.S. into the largest crude producer in the world.

The executives' anonymous comments were published in a quarterly survey of oil and gas companies by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas this week. The 139 companies that responded operate predominantly in Texas as well as northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.

Trump has championed fossil fuels while attacking the renewable energy industry since taking office in January. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, delivered virtually everything the oil lobby wanted.

But Trump's push for lower crude prices, higher tariffs, and the resulting uncertainty caused by his "stroke of pen" policies are hurting investment, executives at independent oil and gas producers told the Dallas Fed.

Nearly 80% of executives who participated in the survey said they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty

Trump urges Turkey to stop buying Russian oil as Erdogan chases deal on F-35s

Watch: Trump greets Turkey's Erdogan ahead of meeting

US President Donald Trump has urged Turkey to stop buying oil from Russia, part of a wider drive to cut off Moscow's energy funding as the war in Ukraine rages on. Speaking alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House, Trump said halting those imports would be "the best thing" his Turkish counterpart could do. The Oval Office meeting ended without any firm commitments to lift US sanctions on Turkey or to sell advanced F-35 fighter jets, though Trump expressed optimism on both issues. Turkey has for years been prevented from buying US F-35s. In 2019, it was expelled from a programme where it produced parts for the warplane after it acquired air defence systems from Russia.

During a brief question-and-answer session alongside Erdogan in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he would like Turkey to stop "buying any oil from Russia while Russia continues its rampage against Ukraine". "The best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia," Trump said. "If he did that, that would be the best thing." Trump added that he believes Erdogan is respected both by Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, meaning that he could "have a big influence" on the war "if he wants to". Alongside India and China, Turkey is among Moscow's biggest customers for oil and gas exports, and data shows that the volume of Russian gas that reached Europe through Turkey rose by more than 26% earlier this year. The US president's comments come just weeks after he said he stood poised to impose tougher sanctions on Russia if Nato countries met conditions that included halting imports of Russian oil. Earlier this week - during a lengthy speech at the UN General Assembly - Trump also accused Nato allies of "funding the war against themselves" through their purchases of energy from Moscow.

[TITLE]Chevron Strikes Deal With Israel To Build Natural Gas Supply Pipeline To Egypt:
[TEXT]
Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has signed a deal with Israel Natural Gas Lines, Israel’s state-owned pipeline operator, to begin construction of the Nitzana natural gas pipeline that will transport natural gas from the giant Leviathan Gas Field to Egypt. Scheduled to be completed in three years, the $610 million pipeline is expected to ease Egypt’s ongoing energy crisis, which currently spends billions of dollars every year importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet surging domestic energy demand. The Nitzana pipeline will transport ~600 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, bringing Israel's total export capacity to Egypt to more than 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. Israel’s NewMed is the largest shareholder in Leviathan, with a 45.3% working interest; Chevron is the operator with a 39.7% working interest, while Ratio Energies. (TASE: RATI) has 15%. Founded in 1992, Ratio Energy is one of Israel's leading energy partnerships, with a mission to develop and produce natural gas and oil.

Egypt's natural gas production has declined rapidly over the years due to the natural depletion of mature fields, including the Zohr gas field. Coupled with a lack of significant new discoveries since 2015, surging domestic demand for electricity, and past financial issues such as hard currency shortages and payment arrears to foreign companies, Egypt now finds itself in a tenuous position, becoming a net gas importer since 2022, and relying on imported Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as well as pipeline gas from Israel. Last year, Egypt imported a record 981 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Israel, good for 18.2% year-over-year increase. Egypt imports up to 20% of its gas from Israel. Last month, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced that the $35-billion gas supply agreement signed with Israel’s NewMed Energy was extended until 2040. But the fate of these gas flows now hangs in the balance, with tensions in the Middle East escalating after the Israeli military ordered residents of Gaza City to evacuate.

Last month, Netanyahu declared that he is "deeply committed to the vision of Greater Israel,’’ encompassing parts of Arab countries stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile. According to Israel Hayom, Netanyahu has instructed officials "not to move forward with the massive gas deal with Egypt without his personal approval.”

On its part, Chevron is now moving on three major geopolitical fronts at once: finalizing terms for the Nitzana pipeline to ship Israeli gas into Egypt, bidding for offshore blocks near Crete that Libya claims as its own and preparing a final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion. Together, the moves put the U.S. major at the center of the East Mediterranean’s most combustible mix of energy ambition and maritime dispute. Chevron has partnered with Greece’s HelleniQ Energy to bid for exploration rights in offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese. Athens views this development as a major step towards asserting its sovereignty over the contested waters. Waters south of Crete and the Peloponnese are contested due to a 2019 Turkey-Libya maritime agreement that ignores Greece's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims and is a response to potential hydrocarbon reserves in the area. Greece claims these areas based on international law, while Turkey disputes that islands like Crete can generate EEZs and views the situation as a geopolitical power struggle. Libya also claims significant portions of the area, aligning with Turkey's position.

Meanwhile, observers are awaiting Chevron’s final investment decision (FID) on the Leviathan expansion amid security concerns. However, Chevron and its partners, NewMed Energy and Ratio Energies, now expect to take the FID on the Leviathan Phase 1B expansion, which includes drilling, subsea systems, and a potential floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility, in the fourth quarter of 2025. This expansion is projected to significantly increase the field's annual production capacity and is supported by a recent historic gas export deal, a revised development plan approved by Israel in August 2025, and ongoing contract negotiations with potential customers.

Discovered in 2010, the Leviathan is located approximately 130 km off the shores of Haifa. The 330-square kilometer field holds ~22.9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, making it the largest natural gas reservoir in the Mediterranean, and one of the largest producing assets in the region. Production is facilitated by 4 subsea wells that are connected to an offshore platform via a subsea manifold and two 120 km long pipelines, where all processing of gas takes place. The gas is then piped to shore into the Israeli national grid and distributed to clients in Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.

Rectification note: The original article incorrectly stated that NewMed is the operator of the Leviathan gas field. The current operator is Chevron.
