[TITLE]Cosmos Health Enters New Nanotechnology R&D Program to Develop Next-Generation Nutraceutical Formulas with Enhanced Phytochemical Efficacy:
[TEXT]
CHICAGO, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cosmos Health Inc. ("Cosmos Health" or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:COSM) , a diversified, vertically integrated global healthcare group, today announced the initiation of a new research and development program leveraging nanotechnology to enhance the effectiveness of phytochemical constituents used in its dietary supplement formulas.

This new initiative builds upon the proprietary know-how developed during the creation of CCX Hydrogel, a breakthrough platform for optimised bioactive delivery. The Company is now expanding its innovation pipeline by developing plant-based extract-loaded phytosomes intended for use in dietary supplements. These nanostructured systems are designed to significantly improve the absorption, stability, and bioactivity of phytochemicals, leading to measurable efficacy improvements.

The approach follows a sustainable, solvent-free process, emphasising environmentally responsible, green formation of phytosomes that are fully suitable for incorporation into nutraceutical applications. This aligns with Cosmos Health’s broader commitment to sustainable innovation, scientific advancement, and responsible manufacturing.

Greg Siokas, CEO of Cosmos Health, stated: “Our platform represents a promising step toward the development of sustainable, bioactive-enriched food technologies. By combining nanotechnology with advanced phytochemical formulations, we aim to deliver next-generation dietary supplements with validated functional performance and enhanced consumer benefits.”

Dr Panagiotis Zoumpoulakis, Head of Research & Development at Cosmos Health, added: “The integration of nanotechnology into our R&D strategy enables us to explore the full potential of phytochemicals at the molecular level. Through precise nanoscale engineering, we can optimise how these bioactive compounds are absorbed and interact within the body, resulting in superior effectiveness and consistency. This marks a significant advancement in our pursuit of scientifically driven nutraceutical innovation.”

FDA moves to fast-track biosimilars, potentially lowering drug costs — but at what cost?

FDA proposes easing clinical trial requirements for biosimilars, allowing manufacturers to rely more on lab testing rather than costly human studies.

Biologic drugs account for 51 percent of U.S. drug spending despite making up only five percent of prescriptions, driving demand for cheaper alternatives.

New guidance could cut biosimilar development time in half, saving companies up to $100 million per drug.

Critics warn reduced testing may compromise safety, raising concerns

[TITLE]How Democrats Can Save Social Security—and Win Elections:
[TEXT]
The infamous Project 2025 document contains 900-plus pages of ideas for strangling the federal government, many of which Donald Trump’s administration has already implemented. But one huge policy area, accounting for roughly one-quarter of all federal spending, is barely mentioned: Social Security.

Perhaps that’s because its Heritage Foundation authors knew that Social Security is one of the waning policy points on which the right and left still agree. In 2024, 77 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats said Social Security benefits should not be reduced in any way.

Yet how to avoid this is likely to be a major issue in the next presidential election. Already, Social Security’s mounting negative cash flow is adding significantly to the federal government’s overall deficits and need to borrow money from the public but worse is yet to come. In June, the Social Security Administration (SSA) projected that the system’s main trust fund, responsible for financing retirement benefits, will run out of money entirely in little more than seven years, which under current law will force steep, across-the-board benefit cuts.

Since the SSA’s June forecast, Republican policies have worsened the fiscal outlook for Social Security. Contrary to Trump’s claim that immigrants threaten the program, his clampdown on immigration will cost the trust funds. In 2022, undocumented immigrants contributed an estimated $25.7 billion toward Social Security, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, while typically collecting no benefits. And then there’s the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by the Republicans in Congress and signed by Trump in July. That bill drains an additional $168 billion in revenue from the main Social Security trust fund by reducing the amount of federal income taxes that affluent Social Security recipients pay on their benefits. Because of this loss of revenue, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates, future benefits will have to be cut even more than was already in the cards—to a full 24 percent. This amounts to benefit cuts of

Lifecore to Execute Commercial Site Transfer and Become New Supplier of Choice for Leading Commercial Injectable Pharmaceutical Product

Represents Second Agreement Signed with Same Major Multinational Organization in Recent Months

Separate Pre-Clinical Formulation Development Agreement Signed with New Early-Stage Biotech Customer

CHASKA, Minn., Oct. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. (NASDAQ: LFCR) (“Lifecore”), a fully integrated contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”), today announced that it has signed an agreement with a leading global pharmaceutical company. Under the terms of the agreement, Lifecore will transfer the commercial manufacturing for a leading injectable pharmaceutical product from the current manufacturer to Lifecore’s facilities. Upon completion of the transfer and satisfaction of all regulatory requirements, Lifecore will be the commercial supplier of choice for the product. This is the second agreement that Lifecore has signed with the same multinational organization in recent months, highlighting the company’s growing reputation for technical excellence, quality, and reliability in sterile injectables.

“This commercial site transfer is a significant accomplishment in our ongoing growth strategy as we work to expand our CDMO business and build long-term partnerships with leading global pharmaceutical companies. Importantly, this product will broaden our commercial customer base while also allowing us to increase our capacity utilization and expand into new modalities,” said Paul Josephs, chief executive officer of Lifecore. “We are thrilled to win this business, and believe that our proven regulatory track record and technical expertise in fill-finish operations were key determinants in our selection as the supplier of choice for this program.”

In additional business development news, Lifecore also announced the signing of a separate agreement with an early-stage biotechnology company to provide pre-clinical formulation development services. This new customer addition continues to grow the company’s early-stage program pipeline, addressing another one of Lifecore’s three growth strategies.

“As we look to capitalize on the strong tailwinds in our industry, we continue to see tremendous momentum generated by our business development team. Each new win serves to strengthen Lifecore’s position as a trusted, U.S.-based CDMO partner and reinforces our role in supporting domestic manufacturing for sterile injectables,” commented Mr. Josephs.
