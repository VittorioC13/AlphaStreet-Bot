[TITLE]New Sodium-Ion Batteries Threaten The US Coal Recovery Plan:
[TEXT]
Like zombies rising from the grave to devour the living, old coal power plants have begun to shake off the dust, adding to the burden of skyrocketing electricity costs. Not to worry. They won’t last long. The so-called national “energy emergency” that promised new life to the nation’s fleet of aging coal power plants is already evaporating under the weight of new sodium-ion batteries and other economical energy storage systems that take full advantage of the nation’s abundant, economical supply of wind and solar energy.

The Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Solution

By now, everyone knows that wind and solar — especially solar — are the fastest, most accessible, and most economical domestic energy resources available in the US today, with energy storage systems adding to the mix.

That explains why renewable energy has been the overwhelming choice for new capacity additions in recent years. The numbers don’t lie. In the first half of this year, for example, renewable energy resources accounted for 93% of new capacity additions to the US grid, for a total of 30.2 gigawatts, with solar and energy storage projects accounting for 83%.

All else being equal, wind and solar capacity additions will accelerate as energy storage systems drop in cost. The first half of that equation depends on which way the winds of federal energy policy blow, but the second half is a matter of innovation and investor engagement, and that is where a fresh burst of cleantech activity has already materialized.

In recent years, researchers have been focusing on sodium-ion technology as a more economical alternative compared to the familiar lithium-ion formula for battery energy storage systems (see more sodium-ion battery background here). Advocates for a sodium-ion future suffered a setback earlier this year when the high-profile US startup Natron shut down operations at its North Carolina factory and Michigan headquarters. However, other sodium-ion innovators have already picked up the torch.

The Peak Energy Sodium-Ion Solution

Among the torch bearers is the US energy storage firm Peak Energy. The startup launched only two years ago but it came into the sodium-ion scene with a head start in experience among senior executives, including from Tesla and Apple as well as the leading global energy storage firm Powin.

Peak Energy surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar when it burst out of stealth mode in October of 2023 with a business model based on vertical integration and a cost-cutting passive cooling system, and they hit the ground running. In July of 2024, Peak nailed down $55 million in Series A funding, spearheaded by the Xora Innovation branch of Temasek along with existing investor Eclipse and strategic partner TDK Ventures. Newcomers Lachy Groom, Tishman Speyer, TechEnergy Ventures, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures, and DETV-Scania Invest also supported the Series A round.

“Peak Energy claims that its sodium-ion battery technology can offer advantages in cost, supply chain security, scale, and safety over lithium-ion, the industry’s current default battery storage choice. The funding is also expected to lay the groundwork for a domestic, giga-scale sodium-ion battery factory slated to open in 2027,” Mercom Capital reported last year.

Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Coal Power Plants

One advantage of sodium-ion technology over other formulas is its scalability, and Peak already aims to put that to the test. Earlier this year, the company launched its grid-scale sodium-ion system into the market, and last week it announced plans to build the largest sodium-ion BESS in the world, in partnership with the up-and-coming independent power producer Jupiter Power.

The initial agreement calls for a 720-megawatt sodium-ion system to be delivered to Jupiter in 2027. With Jupiter holding an option for another 4,000 megawatts between 2028 and 2030, Peak estimates that the total value of the contract could top $500 million.

As for what sparked Jupiter’s interest in a new energy storage platform when the old one is working so well, that’s a good question. There is always room for improvement. In addition to its existing portfolio, Jupiter has a 12,000-megawatt pipeline brewing in the US, and Peak Energy promises to deliver more bang for the buck.

“Peak’s sodium-ion batteries promise less degradation over their lifetime and reduced operations and maintenance costs compared to lithium-ion systems on the market today,” Peak explains, putting the 20-year improvement at 30% compared to other systems.

“Lower system degradation can also reduce augmentation requirements, meaning operators will not have to add additional battery units or components over a project’s lifetime in order to maintain storage capacity over the project’s lifespan,” Peak adds.

Peak also draws attention to its passive cooling system, which enables it to bypass fabrication, maintenance, and repair costs typical of lithium-ion systems while reducing auxiliary power costs by 97%.

Zombie Coal Power Plants Rise From The Dead To Attack The Living

Against the backdrop of falling costs for wind, solar, and utility-scale energy storage systems, it’s difficult to see how any coal power plant in the US can survive much longer. The coal industry was already bending under the weight of low-cost natural gas in the early 2000’s, and now renewables and energy storage have added to the pressure.

In addition, coal power does not necessarily meet the oversimplified, under-defined “reliability” standard set forth by US President Donald Trump’s own American Energy Dominance policy. The 932-megawatt Sandy Creek coal power plant in Texas, for example, suffered a catastrophic failure in April and restoration is not expected until March of 2027.

The pace of coal retirements, though, is complicated by existing grid conditions and rising electricity demand, among other factors. In February, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reported that the US grid would drop 8.1 gigawatts of coal power this year in scheduled retirements, including some of the nation’s largest: Intermountain Power in Utah (1.8 gigawatts), JH Campbell in Michigan (1.33 GW), and Brandon Shores in Maryland (1.27 GW). However, by February, the wheels were already in motion to push the Brandon Shores closure back to 2029. The new date was reached under an agreement between the plant operator Talen Energy, the Maryland Public Service Commission, local ratepayers and utilities, and the Sierra Club, among other stakeholders, pending a major upgrade to the regional transmission system.

In addition, coal retirements are not necessarily replaced by renewables. The Intermountain capacity, for example, will be replaced in part by a new gas power plant.

In May, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright also shook things up when he summarily ordered the JH Campbell facility to keep running 90 days past its scheduled retirement date of May 31, an order later extended to November despite the extra costs.

The JH Campbell order is just one piece of the coal puzzle. Last spring, the Energy Department announced that coal projects will share in a new federal low-cost loan pot of $200 billion, and in October, Energy Secretary Wright announced a new round of $625 million in funding specifically aimed at coal, including $375 million set aside to recommission and retrofit old power plants.

Coal industry stakeholders have begun to respond to the new incentives, but one thing is for sure. The sun will rise and the wind will blow long after the current occupant of the White House leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully one hopes, this time. When he does, a new generation of reliable, economical energy storage systems will be ready to restore the momentum to the renewable energy transition in the US.

[TITLE]Oil and gas companies are falling back in love with Canada, one multibillion-dollar deal at a time:

[TITLE]Oil Stabilizes After Selloff Amid OPEC Reassessment and U.S. Funding Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices steadied on Wednesday after a sharp 4% slide the day before, with Brent trading near $63.08 and WTI around $58.80 at 11:01 a.m. ET, as traders reassessed the latest OPEC shift toward a more balanced 2026 market outlook. The passage of the U.S. funding deal that ended the government shutdown removed one macro problem, but crude remained focused on supply signals rather than broader risk sentiment.

The modest rebound contrasted with the equity rally highlighted by Bloomberg, where U.S. indices advanced on softer inflation readings, renewed risk appetite and relief following the shutdown resolution. The move in equities had limited pull on crude, which stayed driven by evolving supply projections and near-term balance concerns.

The recovery follows Tuesday’s selloff linked to OPEC’s updated projections, which show the cartel moving away from its earlier deficit view and toward a neutral supply-demand balance next year. Traders reacted to signals that rising non-OPEC output and incremental OPEC+ barrels could offset moderate consumption growth. Those factors, combined with a softer demand trajectory outlined in the IEA’s latest assessment, left the market focused on potential surplus risk.

Diesel margins firmed during the session, while crude futures recovered more slowly. Murban traded near 65.43 on steady Asian buying and stable demand for middle distillates. Natural gas edged toward 4.62, supported by early-season heating needs and lower storage levels.

The Bloomberg update showed equities rising as Treasury yields fell, but that shift offered little lift to crude. Traders said oil remains tied to OPEC+ supply decisions and demand expectations through early 2026, not the broader market mood.

A softer dollar and lower Treasury yields added some support to commodities, though they did not shift the outlook for crude supplies. Asia continued to take regular cargoes, and early-winter demand for diesel and jet fuel stayed firm. Traders said many positions were still small following Tuesday’s selloff as the market waits for guidance on upcoming OPEC+ output levels and demand expectations for early 2026.

Energy operators offshore Norway expect to invest $24.8 billion (249 billion Norwegian crowns) in oil and gas activities next year, Statistics Norway’s latest quarterly survey showed on Thursday.

The estimate is $1.9 billion higher compared to the previous quarter’s forecast, mainly driven by higher forecasts of investments in field development and operating fields, the Norwegian statistics office said.

The increased estimate of investment in field development is chiefly pushed up by higher costs being reported for some development projects.

Since the autumn of 2024, the total costs of the ongoing projects have increased by

Zombie Coal Power Plants Rise From The Dead To Attack The Living

Against the backdrop of falling costs for wind, solar, and utility-scale energy storage systems, it’s difficult to see how any coal power plant in the US can survive much longer. The coal industry was already bending under the weight of low-cost natural gas in the early 2000’s, and now renewables and energy storage have added to the pressure.

This article was originally published by The Empowerment Alliance and is re-published here with permission.

Imagine if the federal government enacted legislation that would lead to generations of prosperity for Americans without resorting to budget-busting federal handouts or subsidies.

Imagine if the law guaranteed the most affordable heating and cooling bills for households and businesses for decades to come.

Imagine if such legislation ensured U.S. energy independence and security, forever ending the threat of foreign countries cutting off our supply of oil or gas – and even making other countries dependent on American energy.

As the United States approaches its 250th birthday, could there be any better gift than such guarantees, securities and freedoms?

We don’t have to imagine such a tremendous birthday present. A bill has been introduced in Congress which would accomplish all those objectives and more.

U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R-OH), has introduced the Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act (ARC-ES), designed to codify into law several commonsense directives that the nation’s leaders should have been following for decades.

[TITLE]Judge holds 3am court at home to send laundering accused to ED custody:
[TEXT]
ED Raids Aap Leader Saurabh Bhardwaj In Alleged Hospital Construction Scam Across Delhi-NCRatishi

Realtor running 'nationwide laundering scam', says ED

NEW DELHI: It was not the sort of work that is associated with state machinery. The court of additional sessions judge Shefali Barnala Tandon (of the Patiala House courts) was convened at her residence around 3 am on Friday to remand a person accused of money laundering, Swaraj Singh Yadav, in ED's custody.Yadav, who is the promoter of Ocean Seven Buildtech Pvt Ltd, is accused of illegally selling PM Awas Yojana flats in Gurgaon in all-cash transactions.After a daylong search, Yadav was held by the agency before midnight on Thursday. ED's move came in connection with the alleged laundering of more than Rs 222 crore of funds generated from illegal sale of apartments meant for the poor under PM Awas Yojana.These were sold at an inflated price of Rs 40-50 lakh each to new buyers by cheating the original allottees whose allotment was cancelled, with not even their deposits being refunded. The original cost of a flat was Rs 26.5 lakh.Using these funds, ED said, the accused acquired personal assets, including 500 acres at Ware village in Maharashtra, 100 acres on Pune-Alibag Road, Sai Rupa Resorts in Tirthan Valley in Himachal Pradesh and land in Boston (US), besides financial assets in the UK."The search for the arrestee started at 6.55 am, and he has to be produced before the court within 24 hours of the search, as per the guidelines of Supreme Court and various high courts," the ED submitted before the judge while producing the accused "at this odd hour" at her residence.The legal counsel of the accused was still on his way when the court began its proceedings at 3.05 am, and by the time the hearings from both the sides concluded, it was 6.30 am. The judge remanded the accused in ED's custody till Nov 28, when he is to be produced again. Not taking a chance, the judge specifically instructed that the accused be brought before the court at 2 pm on that day.The ED accused Yadav of committing "a nationwide money laundering scam since 2006, duping thousands of buyers in Mumbai, Jaipur, Kotputli and Gurugram". As per FIRs registered against him with the Delhi police, an estimated Rs 222 crore of homebuyers' money was siphoned by the accused after layering them through a related "in-house construction agency"."The concerted and accelerated liquidation of both personal and company-held assets by arrestee Swaraj Singh Yadav in the recent past strongly indicates his intent to dispose of the proceeds of crime and escape action under provisions of law. The investigation records confirm the urgent disposal of assets and liquidation of funds in anticipation of legal action. He had already sold a flat in Jalvayu Vihar in Gurugram, 40 acres of land in Borgaon, Maharashtra, and 15 acres in Jaipur," the ED said."This coincides with his wife Sunita Swaraj relocating to the US in Aug 2025," the agency added and brought to the notice of the court the fact that the accused had transferred huge amounts to the US via a bank account of his wife's in Bank of Baroda.With his children pursuing graduation from Trinity College, Connecticut, US, there is every possibility of his fleeing from justice, the agency said.

[TITLE]RE sector financing doubles as outstanding loans surge 2x in Sep:
[TEXT]
Indian banks are bullish on India’s renewable energy (RE) sector with loans outstanding to the sector as of September, more than doubling year-on-year (y-o-y).

Data from RBI shows that the outstanding credit to the renewable energy sector stood at ₹14,842 crore as of September 2025 as against ₹6,778 crore in the same period last year.

The growth significantly outpaces the rate of growth in other priority sectors like agriculture, MSMEs and Housing and is also up compared to the 39 per cent y-o-y growth from the September 2023 to September 2024 period

Speaking to businessline, industry experts said the increase in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution with GST reductions and favourable policy landscape pushing projects that were previously on hold to the implementation stage.

Healthy growth

Sachin Sachdeva, Vice President, Sector Head - Financial Sector Ratings , ICRA Ltd, said the overall growth of renewable energy sector remains healthy with significant capacity additions taking place y-o-y. “Consequently, a large part of the funding goes towards the under-construction projects as the already developed project would primarily have refinancing requirements,” he added.

Sachdeva noted that large infrastructure non-banking finance companies (NBFC-IFCs), who have a big play in the RE space, have also seen their assets under management (AUM) grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 30 per cent over the last two years.

Ramneek Sehgal, Chairman & Managing Director of infrastructure firm Ceigall India Ltd, noted that the surge in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution rather than just pipeline build-up, especially in the solar energy sector.

“With the sharp reduction in solar module prices and the ramp-up of domestic manufacturing capacity, many projects that were previously on hold have now moved into the implementation stage,” he said. Sehgal added that the solar sector has opened up after a period of supply-side constraints and policy adjustments with 42 Giga Watt of solar capacity additions expected in FY26.

Overall installed RE capacity in India as of October 2025 stood at around 2 lakh Mega Watt (MW) (excluding Large Hydro Power) with 27,927 MW added in the April-Oct 2025 period.

Vivek Jain, Director, India Ratings and Research said, “When we look at the loans outstanding it is a combination of both under-construction and commissioned projects and hence we see a significant jump in loans outstanding,” he added. Jain mentions that this trend will persist if under-construction projects continue at the same pace but if their pace declines, the loan growth would appear slower than capacity growth.

Costs moderating

Experts added that the rise in financing is more reflective of expanding execution activity rather than cost inflation.

“Input and equipment costs have largely stabilised over the past year. In fact, the reduction in GST and improved domestic supply chains have helped offset earlier cost pressures. Across the industry, scale efficiencies and better value engineering are enabling developers to optimize overall project costs,” Sehgal said.

Sachdeva from ICRA says project costs have generally trended downward and the growth in funding to the sector seems to be primarily driven by capacity additions taking place at a faster pace.

[TITLE]TotalEnergies agrees renewable power deal with Google for Ohio data centres:
[TEXT]
Oil major TotalEnergies has agreed a 15-year power purchase deal to supply Alphabet's Google with 1.5 terawatt hours of renewable electricity from its Montpelier solar farm in Ohio, the French company said on Wednesday.

The solar facility, which is nearing completion, is connected to the PJM grid, the largest in the United States, and will help power Google’s data centre operations in the state, it said.

"This agreement illustrates TotalEnergies’s ability to meet the growing energy demands of major tech companies by leveraging its integrated portfolio of renewable and flexible assets," said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables and Power at TotalEnergies.

The company's growing investment in electricity is helping the company secure a steadier revenue stream and avoid the boom-and-bust cycles typical of oil and gas, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said earlier this month at the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi.

The Paris-listed firm is deploying a 10 gigawatt portfolio in the United States, with onshore solar, wind and battery storage projects.

[TITLE]Turbo Energy to pilot tokenized financing for renewable energy projects on Stellar:
[TEXT]
Turbo Energy (Nasdaq: TURB) is launching a pilot project to tokenize financing for hybrid renewable energy systems, starting with an on-site solar and battery installation at a supermarket in Spain. The initiative aims to demonstrate how blockchain-based debt instruments can fund distributed energy projects.

The project is being developed in collaboration with digital asset infrastructure firm Taurus and the Stellar Development Foundation. According to an announcement, the pilot will test how tokenized financing can support liquidity and improve capital access to renewable energy funding.

Energy-as-a-Service is a model that allows customers to pay for energy use or performance without owning any equipment. It allows businesses to access clean energy through subscription-style contracts while providers handle installation, maintenance and operation.

The pilot will tokenize debt financing for on-site Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) using Turbo Energy’s SUNBOX solar storage systems. The model aims to create a scalable framework for financing commercial and industrial solar projects worldwide.

Taurus will issue and manage Turbo Energy’s renewable-energy tokens using the Stellar blockchain, which will enable fractional, onchain financing, allowing more investors to participate in funding clean-energy projects.

According to data from Grand View Research cited by Turbo Energy, the global EaaS sector was valued at $74.43 billion in 2024 and is expected to more than double to $145.18 billion by 2030.

Clean energy in blockchain

In Bitcoin’s early years, critics often claimed that its heavy energy use made it harmful to the environment. While it is true that Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains consume significant amounts of electricity to secure their networks, innovation within the crypto ecosystem is also driving eco-friendly solutions.

In January, Italian renewable energy company Enel Group teamed up with crypto wallet company Conio to let investors buy tokenized shares of solar panels on the Algorand blockchain. The offering allowed Italian investors to purchase fractional ownership in Enel’s solar farms and apply the generated energy to offset power consumption in their homes.

In October, Thopen, a Brazilian solar power company, announced it was considering a pivot into Bitcoin mining to “absorb local generated energy” from the country’s renewable sector.

In August, the UK-based publicly traded company Union Jack Oil, announced plans to use natural gas from undeveloped wells to generate electricity for Bitcoin mining.
