[TITLE]At $3 billion, retail sector deal value jumps 4x over last quarter: Report:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: India’s consumer and retail sector witnessed a decisive rebound in the Sept quarter, with deal volumes rising to 132 and values crossing $3.4 billion, nearly four times higher than previous quarter.The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel and accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce , Grant Thornton Bharat’s Q3 2025 Consumer and Retail Dealtracker report showed.A total of 97 PE/VC deals worth $1.3 billion were registered during the third quarter, more than doubling in value QoQ. Investors focused on festive-led categories — apparel, e-commerce, and consumer electronics — with notable rounds for VIP Industries, Zepto, Jumbotail, and Miko, it said.The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints. There were 24 M&A deals worth $955 million, led by domestic consolidation in food processing and apparel. Big-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue and Titan’s purchase of Damas Jewellery anchored the rebound, while outbound activity revived with five cross-border acquisitions.With policy tailwinds and festive demand, investor confidence remains strong across consumption-linked sectors. Six IPOs and five QIPs raised over $1.1 billion, led by Urban Company, Bluestone Jewellery, Tilaknagar, and Lenskart, reflecting renewed investor appetite for consumer names. Naveen Malpani, consumer industry leader Grant Thornton Bharat, said: “The festive quarter reaffirmed e-commerce’s role as a structural engine of consumption. Online festival sales have already crossed Rs 60,700 crore in the opening week, up about 29 % YoY, with more than half of the Rs 1.2 lakh crore projected festive GMV logged early.”

[TITLE]Consumer and retail sector recorded deal activity valued at $3.4 billion in September quarter:
[TEXT]
Consumer and retail sector witnessed robust deal momentum recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion in Q3 CY2025 marking a rebound.

According to Grant Thornton Bharat’s Consumer and Retail Dealtracker, the sector witnessed robust deal momentum in Q3 2025, recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion, up 6 per cent in volumes and 9 per cent in value compared to Q3 2024, including public market activity. Excluding public market deals, M&A and PE deal activity accounted for 121 deals worth $2.3 billion, marking a 168 per cent increase in value quarter on quarter, it added.

“The surge was driven by five high-value deals above $100 million and 26 deals above $10 million, together contributing $2 billion or 89 per cent of total deal value, signalling strong investor confidence in scale, brand strength, and growth-oriented consumer businesses,” it added.

Naveen Malpani, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat said, “Q3 marked a decisive rebound for India’s consumer and retail sector. The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel & accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce. These categories reflect the intersection of traditional strengths and digital disruption shaping India’s consumption story. The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints.”

Festive season

While textiles, apparel, and accessories remained a top focus, attracting significant M&A and private equity inflows, food processing and e-commerce segments benefited from festive season momentum, with online sales surging and quick commerce capturing growing consumer attention.

“The rise in average deal size to $18.8 million from $7.2 million in Q2 highlights a shift toward value-driven transactions, underpinned by larger, capital-intensive deals and selective strategic investments across the sector,” it added.

Meanwhile, food processing, FMCG and textile sector lead M&A deal activity. “These sectors drove deal activity, accounting for 67 per cent of volumes and nearly 94 per cent of values. Large-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue ($488 million) and Titan’s acquisition of Damas Jewellery ($283 million) anchored the rebound,” the report added.

[TITLE]5 GPO Buildings on Dublin’s Henry Street on sale for €2.7m:
[TEXT]
Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM) is seeking €2.7 million through agent Bannon for 5 GPO Buildings, on Henry Street in Dublin city centre. The sale of the retail investment property offers the prospective buyer an initial yield of 13.5 per cent.

Acquired by Irish Life in 2015 as part of its wider €154 million purchase of a collection of eight retail units and five office blocks known as the Sovereign portfolio from Royal London Asset Management, 5 GPO Buildings comprises a ground floor and basement “lock-up” retail unit extending to a total area of 165sq m (1,774sq ft). Located within the historic GPO building, the entire property is let to phone retailer Three Ireland and sublet to international jewellery brand Lovisa. There are three years remaining on the existing lease and the current rental income is €410,000 a year. Three Ireland have vacated the property, and it is sublet under licence to Lovisa Ireland Limited at an annual rent of €175,000, expiring one month before the Three Ireland lease. Should Lovisa decide to sign a new lease agreement at that point, the purchaser of the property could reasonably expect to secure at least the same annual rent, according to the selling agent.

Brian Morton of Bannon says: “Number 5 GPO Buildings offers the opportunity to acquire a high-yielding prime retail asset located within one of the country’s most historic buildings”.

[TITLE]US CPI Rises Less Than Expected, Fed Remains on Track for Rate Cut:
[TEXT]
A delayed snapshot of inflation in September came in softer than expected, potentially offering a path for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates beyond next week’s meeting.

The core consumer price index , excluding the often volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% from August, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data out Friday. That was the slowest pace in three months and restrained by the smallest increase in a key measure of housing costs since early 2021.

[TITLE]With food inflation rising, Conservatives demand Liberal action on cost of living:
[TEXT]
With food inflation increasing in September, the Conservatives are blasting the federal Liberals over the cost of living, as the minority government prepares to table a budget that will need the support of at least one other party.

Shoppers paid four per cent more for groceries in September compared to the same period last year, Statistics Canada said Tuesday. This follows a 3.5 per cent increase in August. The overall inflation rate rose to 2.4 per cent.

While food inflation is down from its post-pandemic peak of over 11 per cent in late 2022 and early 2023, the rate of increase has been rising since April, affected by shortages of beef and coffee along with pricier fresh vegetables and sugary goods.

"Grocery prices are going up twice as fast as the target," Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Tuesday in the House. "Will the prime minister in the upcoming budget decrease his taxes and inflationary spending so Canadians can live affordable lives?"

In response, Finance Minister François-Philippe promised "good news on Nov. 4," when the government releases its 2025 budget, the first for Prime Minister Mark Carney's government.

The Conservatives have been calling for an “affordability agenda” as they seek to hold Carney to his words on the cost of living.

Following his cabinet swearing-in ceremony in May, Carney told reporters that “Canadians will hold [the government to] account by their experience at the grocery store, when they're paying their electricity bill, when they or their children are looking for a place to live.”

'H idden taxes on food '

In a Monday letter to Carney laying out Conservative demands, Poilievre blamed "hidden taxes on food" for the rising costs.

While food bought in grocery stores is not generally taxed, Poilievre argued that an industrial carbon tax on fertilizer and farm equipment, the federal fuel standard, food packaging regulations and inflation all amounted to taxes on Canadians.

With global factors like climate change contributing to rising food prices worldwide, it’s not clear that the factors cited by Poilievre are main contributors to food inflation in Canada.

The now-scrapped consumer carbon pricing system had a negligible impact on inflation, a study published in December found, suggesting that the smaller industrial carbon tax would have an even lower impact.

Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Champagne said the government was working to bring down the cost of living.

“We know it's the number one concern for Canadians,” he said, pointing to a grocery code of conduct and the national school food program as two areas where the government had taken action.

Government House Leader Steven Mackinnon, meanwhile, called Poilievre’s demands for an affordable budget “ludicrous.”

With two weeks until the budget, Mackinnon said he was worried opposition parties were not “seriously” engaging in debate.

“We have two opposition parties principally that aren't taking this matter very seriously,” he said.

“Canadians are looking for certainty. We had an election six months ago. Canadians are looking for predictability, stability and especially a plan. We intend to present a plan to Canadians to deal with this very critical moment in our history.”

Over 1 million people in Massachusetts will probably be left without food because of the government shutdown in the United States, according to Gov. Maura Healey. If things do not get better before November 1, 2025, and federal money for food stamps remains frozen, more than a million people in the US state will end up bearing the brunt of the funding lapse.Besides Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, New York, and Texas are also on the verge of losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Massachusetts is one of the states across America that could lose the benefits starting next Saturday (November 1, 2025).SNAP provides benefits to low-income families so they can buy groceries. It includes benefits for adults who might otherwise face hunger and malnutrition. These benefits were earlier known as food stamps. SNAP benefits include monthly funds on an EBT card to buy food. More fruits and vegetables when you use your EBT card at participating HIP farms, SNAP Path to Work free education and training opportunities, Free nutrition education classes and resources, Connections to other kinds of help, like utility discounts, free school meals, and discounted admissions to many Commonwealth museums and cultural institutions via EBT Card to CultureThe US Department of Agriculture oversees the federal food stamps program. The department stated that the lapse in appropriations because of the shutdown will leave them with "insufficient funds" to pay full benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in November, according to CBS News.Both the USDA and the White House have refused to comment on the looming issue. According to the Greater Boston Food Bank, one in three residents in Massachusetts faced food insecurity in 2024.On normal days, SNAP beneficiaries receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use to buy produce, meat, dairy, and other household food staples, according to CBS News. Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP.While speaking on the prevailing situation, Governor Healey stated that Massachusetts doesn't have the ability to backfill those benefits. She said that it is because state funding can't match the amount of federal funding the state gets for SNAP."Two hundred forty million dollars a month is what the state receives, its residents receive from the federal government for these benefits, so you can't begin to make this up," said Healey, as quoted by CBS News.While speaking at a news conference on Friday (October 24, 2025) in Roxbury, Healey said her administration is partnering with local food banks and organizations, including Project Bread and the United Way, to help families. They announced the creation of the United Response Fund, hoping to generate donations."Those who have the means, this is the time to step up," Healey said. She further stated that she is planning to make a donation herself. The Massachusetts governor is also calling on President Trump to release contingency funds to keep SNAP going while the government is shut down. She asserted that children, the elderly, and the disabled will be impacted the greatest.

[TITLE]SNAP recipients told to buy shelf-stable food or go to food banks as funding deadline looms:
[TEXT]
Recipients of SNAP food assistance benefits across the country face a looming deadline: Come Nov. 1, their cards may not get refilled because of the government shutdown in Washington.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which serves nearly 42 million people each month, allocates money to states on a monthly basis. Benefits were largely uninterrupted over the past three weeks because funding for October was allocated to states before the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

But in a letter to SNAP state agency and regional directors on Oct. 10, the Department of Agriculture warned that there would not be enough funding to pay full SNAP benefits — also known as food stamps — in November if the shutdown persists.

Many states have announced that they plan to suspend SNAP benefits if the shutdown continues into next month. That could upend people’s ability to buy food on an unprecedented scale — the program has not lapsed during any government shutdown in recent history.

As Nov. 1 approaches, some state leaders are recommending that people turn to food banks or use their remaining benefits to buy non-perishable items.

“If you have accrued SNAP benefits from previous months on your account, use those funds now to buy shelf-stable foods that can last through November and beyond,” the Arkansas Department of Human Services says on its website.

But food banks say it will be impossible to fill the gap.

“There’s no way that our charitable food network or the system in this country can provide that much food overnight or quickly. It’s an impossible task,” said Catherine D’Amato, CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Her organization is already receiving calls from people asking where they can go to feed their families, she said. D’Amato estimated that suspending SNAP benefits would create a deficit of up to 56 million meals in Massachusetts in November.

At least one state, Pennsylvania, has already stopped issuing SNAP benefits. The state announced that “starting October 16, SNAP benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA.”

Texas, meanwhile, said next month’s SNAP benefits won’t be issued if the shutdown continues past Oct. 27. And in Wisconsin, SNAP recipients got a letter this week informing them that even their remaining funds from October may not carry over.

“Benefits may not be available in November,” the letter said. “This may include any funds remaining on your card at the end of October. You may want to use your benefits to stock up on food before the end of October.”

The state treasurers of Oregon and Massachusetts said Thursday on a press call that their states have no contingency plans for SNAP if the federal government doesn’t provide the funding. State budgets can’t afford to cover the full cost of people’s benefits, they added.

“At a time when the cost of groceries continues to go up, SNAP makes the difference between having enough and going hungry,” said Elizabeth Steiner, the Oregon state treasurer. “This decision on behalf of the federal government is an absolute abdication of its responsibility to families in Oregon and across the United States who are struggling to make ends meet.”

She added that “up until now, every administration, Republican or Democrat, has understood that feeding Americans is a fundamental responsibility of the federal government.”

US President Donald Trump unveiled a flurry of trade deals during his first day in Asia, looking to shore up access to critical minerals and a market for US agricultural goods ahead of a critical meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping."My message to the nations of Southeast Asia is that the United States is with you 100% and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come," Trump said at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday.The US president dangled exemptions from his reciprocal tariff regime on key exports from Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia as part of the agreements. He also expressed optimism during a meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva that they could easily strike a trade agreement, as the Latin American country seeks to reduce the 50% tariff on many of its goods.The White House's hope is that the framework trade pacts - set to be enacted in the coming weeks - can bolster Trump's hand before he sits down with Xi later this week in South Korea. Ahead of that summit, Beijing has cut off soybean purchases and announced new restrictions on critical mineral exports, earning Trump's ire and threatening to roil the US economy.Still, the scant details offered in many of the framework agreements made it difficult to gauge their ultimate impact. While countries agreed to roll back tariffs and regulations on the purchase of US goods, negotiations will continue on what relief they will receive - and whether key sectors like apparel and electronics earn a break."It's a step in the right direction but there's still considerable uncertainty out there," said Peter Mumford, who covers Southeast Asia at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, citing questions on the rules of origin for reciprocal agreements, sectoral tariffs and transshipment levies. "And none of these are legally binding agreements too. They're all quite flexible agreements."Southeast Asia is now a larger source of goods for the US than China, underscoring the potential importance of the deals signed on Sunday. That's particularly true for Vietnam, which is rising quickly as a top exporter to the US.The pact with Cambodia affirms the country will drop all its tariffs on US food and agricultural imports as well as industrial products. In exchange, the White House identified hundreds of goods it planned to exempt from the 19% tariff Trump has imposed on Cambodian goods.While Cambodia is "pleased" with the agreement, the nation also hopes the US will lower the rates for garment, footwear and travel goods, Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol said in a text message. The garment industry makes up more than half of Cambodia's exports."We wish to thank President Trump for granting us the reciprocal rate that allows us the ability to compete and expand our trade and investment," Sun Chanthol added.The White House also reached an agreement with Thailand that will eliminate tariff barriers on 99% of US goods, including the full range on industrial, food and agricultural products. The US will soon identify a set of Thai goods it plans to exempt from reciprocal tariffs. Like Cambodia, exports from Thailand currently face a 19% rate. The two countries also signed a critical minerals pact that should offer US companies preferential access to rare earths, crucial minerals used to produce high-tech products including semiconductors and jet engines.

[TITLE]As Southeast Asia welcomes Trump, it battles headwinds unleashed by him:
[TEXT]
Southeast Asia and its ‘China Plus One’ supply chain are feeling the fallout from the US trade war.

Southeast Asia was one of the biggest winners from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war with China in 2018, luring manufacturers to the region to avoid new tariffs on Chinese goods.

It benefitted from investment, tax revenues and technology transfers that came with the expanding “China Plus One” supply chain concept.

Seven years later, Southeast Asia finds itself in a very different situation as Trump’s second trade war drags on, and it gets squeezed by the world’s top two economic powers. New tariffs from the US threaten its export-driven economy, while it’s also facing a separate surge in Chinese goods looking for an alternative to the US market.

It’s now trying to find its way forward despite the economic pressure, said Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.

“Southeast Asia has been trying to walk the tightrope and do a balancing act of not picking sides between the US and China. Both are important economic partners,” he told Al Jazeera.

China is the largest trading partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – a regional bloc of 10 countries plus new member, East Timor. The US is its fourth-largest trade partner, but it holds an outsized importance in other areas like regional security.

The region’s relationship with the US has been under significant stress since Trump returned to the White House earlier this year on the promise of slashing the US trade deficit by imposing tariffs on most trade partners.

Southeast Asia was hit hard in April by Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, when he added duties of 49 percent on Cambodia, 48 percent on Laos, and 46 percent on Vietnam. Even Thailand and the Philippines, both US military allies, were initially hit with tariffs of 36 percent and 17 percent.

Regional tariffs have since fallen to 10 to 20 percent for most ASEAN countries after individual countries negotiated with Trump, but they remain at a high 40 percent for Myanmar and Laos. Further tariffs remain on specific exports like steel, aluminium and auto parts. In late July, the White House announced an additional 40 percent tariff on so-called “transshipments”.

The term refers to goods that are shipped through the region to avoid tariffs – in this case, pre-existing tariffs on Chinese goods – as Beijing and Washington continue to negotiate a separate tariff deal.

The transshipment tariff has put the China Plus One production model in the “crosshairs” of Washington, said Nick Marro, lead analyst for global trade at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

“[It’s] a risk, especially now because you have a threatened tariff of 40 percent on transshipments which seems pretty squarely aimed at emerging markets,” he said.

Against this backdrop, the Asian Development Bank revised its 2025 growth forecast for Southeast Asia from 4.7 percent to 4.3 percent, citing the emergence of a “new global trade environment, shaped by tariffs and updated trade agreements”. ADB’s growth forecast for 2026 is also 4.3 percent.

Complicating the picture, though, is that Chinese exports to Southeast Asia are on the rise. The trend began before Trump returned to the White House, but it’s accelerated over the past year.

Chinese customs data shows that exports to ASEAN rose 12 percent to $586bn year on year in 2024. The trend is set to continue in 2025 as Chinese exports to the region are up 14.7 percent, hitting $487.5bn in the first nine months of the year. The total volume of trade in 2025 is also up 8.6 percent and hit $776.7bn in September.

Conversely, Chinese exports to the US have been falling. They hit $317bn between January and September 2025, a drop of 16.9 percent over the same period, according to Chinese customs data. China’s total volume of trade has also fallen 15.6 percent year on year to $425.8bn, according to the same data.

Customs data alone doesn’t explain the reasons for these parallel trends, according to experts, but they say that two factors could be driving this shift.

Experts told Al Jazeera that Chinese manufacturers might be shipping more goods through Southeast Asia.

“Exports from Southeast Asia to the US have grown in tandem with exports from China to Southeast Asia. This tells you that this trade is being diverted through these countries to some extent,” said ISEAS’s Menon.

ASEAN exported $352.1bn worth of goods and services to the US in 2024, up 13.3 percent from a year earlier, according to data from the US Trade Representative.

The figure is also nearly double the value of ASEAN’s US exports in 2017, just before Trump started his first trade war. That year, ASEAN exported $192bn in goods and services to the US, according to the USTR.

But Chinese companies are also shipping finished goods to Southeast Asia as the final destination, as they seek out new customers to replace the US.

“There’s no precise data on how much is exported and how much is then re-exported. Survey [data] seems to suggest that the majority is part of the supply chain, but there’s a growing share of exports that are destined to be finally consumed in the Southeast Asian countries,” Menon said.

A survey of more than 300 companies in the Asia Pacific exporting to the US and 30 US importers by New York-based consultancy GLG in July found that 66 percent of Chinese exporters said they were looking for markets beyond the US, as it had become a “challenging and less predictable trade partner”.

Eighty-three percent said they were looking at the European Union as an alternative, followed by another 71 percent who cited ASEAN as a potential market, according to the report, which was written by Menon.

While consumers in Southeast Asia may welcome more products on e-commerce sites like Shein, Temu, Alibaba, Lazada and Shoppee, the uptick in Chinese goods is also making some local industries nervous, said the EIU’s Marro.

Chinese exports are extra competitive this year thanks to a depreciation in the dollar, and with it the Chinese renminbi, but China also has a longstanding problem of making more than it needs. The issue has been exacerbated with its post-pandemic economic slowdown and a fall in domestic demand, which means it needs somewhere to send this “overcapacity”.

While exporters have looked for new markets overseas, some have been accused of “dumping,” or deliberately undercutting local markets with artificially low prices in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.

“We have started to see a lot more anxiety among various governments in the last couple of months around a potential flood of Chinese goods into certain markets. This doesn’t necessarily restrict itself to things like phones or electric vehicles. It can also include commodities like steel or other types of things like textiles or apparel,” Marro said.

“There is a very big risk that Southeast Asia is also going to get hit by the distortions in China’s economy,” he added.

Much like transshipments, whether exports are “dumping” is in the eye of the beholder, said Chris Beddor, deputy director of China Research at the Beijing-based Gavekal Dragonomics.

Investigating another country for dumping can be a politically and economically costly move that can end in tariffs or trade disruptions on both sides. It’s a risk many countries are not willing to take with China, he said.

“A lot of the ASEAN countries, frankly, don’t have a lot of incentive to be pointing fingers at China for dumping because of the supply chains being rerouted. They want a slice of the action,” he told Al Jazeera.

It’s much like the approach that Southeast Asia has taken with the US. Rather than push back against Trump’s tariffs, regional leaders lined up to negotiate with the White House one-on-one rather than as a bloc – much the way that Trump prefers.

Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told Al Jazeera this strategy could, however, cost Southeast Asia in the long run.

“This is a result of ASEAN’s passive ‘not choosing sides’. They thought they could have some side help them or that Washington and Beijing could always court them,” he said. That optimism ignored the possibility that they could be squeezed by both sides. They may end up not having to make choices, since these have been made for them elsewhere.”

ISEAS’s Menon said he was also worried that more trouble could still be on the horizon. The US and China have yet to reach a deal on tariffs, and even if they succeed, the famously mercurial Trump could still change his mind.

“My big fear is that this is not the end, but the beginning of a continuing process of tariff increases,” said ISEAS’s Menon. “Trump has been very clear about two things. One is that he loves tariffs. The second thing is that he wants to use them to reduce bilateral deficits. The bottom line is, I don’t think he can be stopped.”

[TITLE]Is Sustainability Still Worth It? Fashion Industry, Supply Chain Say Resounding Yes:
[TEXT]
VENICE, Italy — As sustainability faces disruption and political backlash globally, fashion finds itself questioning how to move the needle forward after a decade of quantum leap efforts.

Against a dampened economy and geopolitical turmoil, the stakes are higher than ever.

Global supply chains, including Italy’s, are under pressure — and increasingly under scrutiny. Policymakers are navigating the complexity of dealing with a different world — and business views. The performance of the fashion sector is still iffy and the outlook hard to predict.

“The issue at hand concerns the models we want to champion for the future, the vision of the world we want to embrace,” said Vittorio Emanuele Parsi, international relations professor at Milan’s Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, at the fourth two-day edition of the Venice Sustainable Fashion Forum held here at the Fondazione Cini.

“This is the time to have the courage to face our era head-on,” echoed Carlo Cottarelli, director of the program for education in economic and social sciences and of the observatory on Italian public accounts at the same university.

Industry players at the forum recognized the importance of scaling up, rather than back, their efforts and of doing so collaboratively.

“Not only Made in Italy fashion is under attack. The reality is that it’s part of a much broader ecosystem, one we share with our European partners. This is a multifaceted attack,” said Luca Sburlati, president of Confindustria Moda, in reference to the many pressing issues faced by the sector.

“We are working within a model where ethics, economy and innovation are all evolving rapidly, so it’s crucial that we take center stage in this discussion and make decisions to bring to the attention of the policymakers,” he said.

The Italian association was among the organizers of the event alongside Confindustria Veneto Est and consultancy The European House Ambrosetti, or TEHA Group.

A study by the latter titled “Just Fashion Transition 2025,” provided a candid picture of where the fashion sector stands in its eco-journey.

Drawing from data by the European Environment Agency, the research said that the EU fashion sector has cut 37 percent of its carbon emissions since 1990.

An additional 18 percent is still required to comply with the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles for 2030, which the consultancy estimates would require at least 4.4 billion euros.

“The cost of waiting is higher than the cost of taking action,” said Carlo Cici, partner and head of sustainability practices at TEHA Group. “When it comes to sustainability, waiting is not a viable strategy for growth,” he added, sparking applause from the audience.

Making his point, Cici said that biodiversity and the health of natural ecosystems are crucial enablers of growth as
