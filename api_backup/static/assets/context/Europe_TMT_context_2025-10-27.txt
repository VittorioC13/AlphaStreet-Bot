Dutch say takeover of chipmaker Nexperia 'not against China'

by AFP Staff Writers

Brussels, Belgium (AFP) Oct 23, 2025

The Netherlands' seizure of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia was not a "measure against China", Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said Thursday as trade tensions spike between Europe and Beijing.

Dutch officials invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to effectively take control of Nexperia, citing national security concerns, as chip manufacturing increasingly becomes a focus of geopolitical tensions.

The company says Beijing has, in turn, banned it from exporting certain goods from China since October 4.

Scale AI alum Bilal Abu-Ghazaleh has launched startup building artificial intelligence infrastructure 1001 to modernize large industries across the Middle East and North Africa.

The company on Sunday announced a $9 million seed round led by venture capital firm CIV, General Catalyst, and Lux Capital. Other investors include Stanford AI Lab Professor Chris Ré, Replit founder and CEO Amjad Masad, DAMAC Managing Director and PRYPCO founder Amira Sajwani, RAED Venture Partner Khalid Bin Bader Al Saud, and Lean Technologies co-founder and CEO Hisham Al-Falih.

The company's mission focuses on addressing inefficiencies in high-impact sectors such as aviation, logistics, construction, and oil and gas. Abu-Ghazaleh told TechCrunch that across the Gulf region, these industries lose more than $10 billion annually due to delays and outdated operational systems.

Real-Time Decisioning Platform Tackles $10 Billion In Regional Inefficiencies

1001 said it aims to create an "AI-native operating system" that helps organizations make faster and more precise operational decisions. The system integrates live data, operational modeling, and real-time oversight tools to automate daily workflows. According to 1001, the platform enables decisions that save time, improve utilization, and create measurable outcomes.

Abu-Ghazaleh told TechCrunch that many daily operational calls are still handled manually, such as assigning ground crews or rerouting vehicles in airports. "With our system, that orchestration happens automatically. The AI orchestrator uses real-time data to reroute vehicles, reassign crews, and adjust operations without human intervention," he said.

1001's approach draws from Abu-Ghazaleh's years at Scale AI, where he led teams developing data annotation systems for generative AI. That experience deepened his understanding of how data-driven automation can reduce complexity in large-scale operations, according to TechCrunch.

Born in Amman, Jordan, Abu-Ghazaleh studied computer science in the U.S. before working for Hive AI and Scale AI. His new company represents a return to the region to build locally relevant AI infrastructure. "Many of us left to work at the cutting edge; 1001 is a place to come back and build it here," he said in the company’s statement.

Mumbai: India is proving to be a tough market to navigate for global automakers, with the exception of some Japanese and Korean car companies. To find traction in this market, the third largest in the world with plenty of room for growth, some of these automakers are exploring options that include partnerships with Indian business houses, which may be operating in a different industry but can provide support to navigate policy uncertainties and market insights. They already have a template in the MG Motor-JSW Group joint venture.Big American automakers General Motors and Ford have left India after failing to build a sustainable business here. Meanwhile, foreign companies that have built local joint ventures, such as Skoda-Volkswagen and Renault-Nissan, have yet to find sustained success in the Indian market, even after decades of presence and product renewals here.As the market tightens and technology and consumer preferences shift rapidly, industry executives and analysts said some of these companies, as well as new entrants like Vietnam’s VinFast and Chinese automakers BYD, Geely and Chery, are considering local partnerships. “India is no longer an easy market to read,” said an auto analyst with a leading brokerage. “Demand has become fragmented, regulations keep evolving and competition is cutthroat. Companies without scale or deep local understanding find it hard to sustain distribution and after-sales support. Partnering with an Indian player may be the only viable way to stay relevant.”Global automakers have long viewed India as a market of promise — high growth potential, a large young population and increasing incomes. But turning that promise into profitability has proved elusive for most. The Renault-Nissan alliance, once buoyed by models like the Kwid and Duster, has seen its market share erode. The Skoda-Volkswagen group’s ‘India 2.0’ project has brought new products like the Kushaq and Slavia, yet volumes remain modest in a market that sold nearly 4.3 million cars and utility vehicles in 2024.Unlike Japan’s Maruti Suzuki, Korea’s Hyundai and Kia, or homegrown players Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, most global automakers have yet to fully decode the Indian buyer’s mix of value, reliability and affordability. Japan’s Toyota Motor, which has a local minority partner in Kirloskar, and Honda have seen success in certain segments. “Hyundai and Kia have a strong local supply base, India-first product strategy, and aggressive market positioning. The two Korean brands now account for over a quarter of all passenger vehicle sales," said a Mumbai-based analyst. "That’s why India is now their growth engine globally."Companies like Maruti Suzuki, Tata and Mahindra have invested for the long haul and built strong supplier and dealer networks. Several global automakers have been hesitant or underinvested in these areas. Having a local partner could matter in these circumstances. For several global brands, the missing piece has been a dependable local ally, said industry experts. Beyond capital, such a partner can provide policy assurance, local market knowledge and help understand regulatory complexities — especially critical for companies from geopolitically sensitive regions such as China. “A domestic partner can lend credibility and continuity, particularly when regulatory frameworks are unpredictable,” said a senior executive of a car company. “It can also improve after-sales reach and dealer confidence, areas where most foreign OEMs lag due to low volumes.”Chinese-owned British brand MG Motor tied up with Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Group after it found bringing foreign investment to scale up difficult amid worsening India-China relations. JSW bought a 35% stake in MG Motor India from China’s SAIC Motor in late 2023, which has helped the brand gain local credibility, expansion headroom and policy comfort. French automaker Renault is reportedly in early discussions with the JSW Group for a potential joint venture in India, as it seeks to strengthen its India presence. Its market share in India remains less than 1%.JSW Motors, the SAIC-JSW Group joint venture, is also in talks with other automakers like BYD and Skoda VW for technology and platform access, as it actively seeks new partnerships to expand its presence in the electric mobility segment. Chery Automobile will provide components to the JSW Group, facilitating the launch of a new-energy vehicle brand in India by 2027. “We will have collaborations to draw upon the unique strengths of industry-leading partners from around the world like sourcing proven EV and battery technologies from China, design and safety excellence from Europe, software and connectivity from the US, and combining them with India’s manufacturing strength and digital agility,” said JSW Motors chief executive Ranjan Nayak.Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast, meanwhile, said it is always open to collaborating with potential strategic partners in India. “Several experienced local suppliers have already reached out to us with partnership proposals, which we are currently reviewing," said its India CEO Tapan Kumar Ghosh. A spokesperson for Skoda Auto Volkswagen India said India is a key market in Škoda Auto’s internationalisation plans. “To fully explore the country’s growth potential, we are always considering new business opportunities and are evaluating various options to ensure the best possible solution to implement our strategy in the highly dynamic Indian market.” Skoda Auto Volkswagen India and Mahindra had explored a partnership, but the talks have now stalled. Companies such as Renault and Geely did not comment on potential plans for a partnership. Industry sources said exploratory talks were taking place quietly.To achieve sustainable growth, automakers in India must collaborate and form strategic partnerships, said Kavan Mukhtyar, leader automotive at PwC India. “With technology becoming increasingly disruptive, the need for significant investment and profitable expansion is driving automakers to actively explore alliances and joint ventures,” he said. Ravi Bhatia, president of automobile consultancy Jato Dynamics, said local support will help foreign automakers scale operations as well as cut costs. “Renault with its underutilised Chennai plant (33% capacity) boasts modular architecture, but needs partners to scale exports and leverage India's 50% localisation mandates for duty cuts,” he said. “Strategic partnerships could bridge gaps, cutting EV costs by 15-20%.”However, experts caution that local tie-ups are no guarantee of success. Past alliances such as Mahindra-Ford and Premier Automobiles-Peugeot underscore the risks of mismatched strategies and governance issues. “Partnerships only work when both sides bring more than money; they need long-term commitment and strategic alignment,” said an auto industry veteran. “Many earlier JVs failed because the foreign partner saw India as an export base, not a domestic growth story.”For now, several global automakers are leaning on exports from their Indian plants to stay viable, even as their domestic market share remains marginal. With India’s position in the global automobile market continuing to grow, analysts believe localisation in manufacturing, products and management will determine who thrives. “India rewards long-term commitment,” said an analyst. “Without it, even the biggest global brands will remain on the fringes.”

[TITLE]Trump To Install New Pro-Crypto CFTC Chair? Here’s What We Know So Far:
[TEXT]
New reports reveal that United States President Donald Trump has picked pro-crypto Michael Selig as the new chair nominee for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC’s role involves overseeing the futures, options, and crypto markets, ensuring these industries operate fairly and transparently while protecting participants from fraud and manipulation. With Selig being a widely recognized crypto supporter, this move by Trump could significantly impact the regulatory landscape of digital assets.

Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Selig As CFTC Chair

According to a Bloomberg report on October 24, Trump selected Selig to chair the CFTC, sending his nominations to the Senate for confirmation hearings. Selig currently serves as the Chief Counsel for the Crypto Task Force and Senior Advisor to the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul S. Atkins.

Notably, Selig had also worked as a partner specializing in crypto at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. His career has been closely aligned with the cryptocurrency industry, while harmonizing regulatory strategies for the SEC and the CFTC across both traditional and digital finance sectors.

If his nomination is confirmed, Selig would lead the CFTC at a crucial moment, as Congress considers bills that could significantly expand the agency’s oversight and authority of the crypto and digital asset markets. Interestingly, this is not the first time Trump has nominated a candidate for the chair position of the CFTC.

Selig’s nomination marks the second attempt to fill the role. Trump previously chose Brian Quintenz, the former commissioner of the CFTC and a previous Head of Policy at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). However, Quintenz was withdrawn from consideration after concerns over potential conflicts of interest were raised by prominent industry figures, including Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

Crypto Community Reacts To Selig’s Nomination

The crypto community has largely welcomed Selig’s nomination as the CFTC Chair, viewing it as a potential turning point for regulatory clarity in the crypto sector. Chris Dixon, a managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, emphasized the timing of the nomination as crucial for the passage of market structure legislation, noting that Selig’s leadership could provide clear, actionable rules for developers and consumers alike.

Kristin Smith, the President of the Solana Institute, praised Selig as an “outstanding choice” whose expertise in the cryptocurrency and regulatory sectors could strengthen coordination between the US SEC and the CFTC. Moreover, she believes that as the next chair of the CFTC, Selig could foster a pro-crypto innovation-friendly environment in the US.

Other members of the crypto community echoed similar positive sentiments, with some expressing optimism that Selig’s leadership could be bullish for the crypto market. Many expect his tenure to coincide with a more streamlined and supportive regulatory framework, which could potentially accelerate adoption and innovation within the digital asset industry.

[TITLE]China's rare earth limits may have 'gone too far this time' as US trade talks start:
[TEXT]
Top U.S. and Chinese officials met in Malaysia on Saturday to lay the groundwork for a summit between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, with some on Wall Street saying Beijing overplayed its hand by imposing draconian restrictions on rare earth exports.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng held negotiations that the U.S. characterized as constructive. But sources told the Financial Times China was reluctant to ease the export controls.

If Beijing refuses to budge and talks between Trump and Xi on Thursday don’t result in a deal to roll back export controls, U.S. tariffs on China would soar to 157%. In addition, other countries may increasingly side with Washington, overcoming earlier backlash against the U.S. over Trump’s global tariffs.

“As China’s leader Xi Jinping stands firm on implementing sweeping export controls on rare-earths and other critical minerals, signs are mounting that Asia’s biggest economy has gone too far this time,” Yardeni Research said in a note on Tuesday.

For example, officials in Europe and Japan joined the U.S. in denouncing China’s export controls, which could curb the supply materials that are critical to a wide range of industries.

The negative response to Beijing’s tactics also prompted the G7 to vow a united front against the export controls, Yardeni pointed out.

The often unilateral Trump administration has spotted an opportunity to flip the script and even discovered a taste for multilateralism, with Bessent saying recently he will huddle with Australia, Canada, India and Asian democracies to formulate a collective response.

For its part, China has blasted U.S. efforts to limit software and chip exports, while also shifting trade toward other countries to offset the plunge in exports to America.

“Yet Xi’s latest trade war tactic may be tipping the geostrategic balance back toward the US as companies around the world think better of doing business in China generally,” Yardeni said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. is scrambling to develop alternative sources of rare earths and turning to allies like Australia, though new supplies could take years to reach the market.

Trump also has formidable trade weapons of his own to deploy against China in the event he seeks to ratchet up U.S. retaliation.

But he has signaled he’d rather reach a deal and softened his tone recently, saying last week that he is “not looking to destroy China” after previously warning he could.

And while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Malaysia, Trump was open to a compromise.

“Sure they’ll have to make concessions. I guess we will too,” he said. “We’re at 157% tariff for them. I don’t think that’s sustainable for them. They want to get that down, and we want certain things from them.”

Volkswagen warned workers at its Wolfsburg plant this week that it would suspend production of the Golf from next Wednesday because it was running out of some essential microchips. Made by Nexperia, a Chinese-owned company based in the Netherlands, the chips are not the most advanced but they are responsible for keeping the brakes, lights, switches and wipers working.

The Dutch government took control of Nexperia, using for the first time a law introduced during the 1950s that allows the state to seize companies for national security reasons, removing its Chinese owner as chief executive. They said they were worried

[TITLE]More chips please! Semiconductor shortage to hit car makers again as VW admits problem:
[TEXT]
Remember the semiconductor chip shortage that plagued the automotive world just a few years ago? Well, it’s threatening to happen all over again. Leading microchip manufacturer Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands, has raised concerns about the availability of semiconductor products it needs for its computer chips. This has the potential to halt car production and restrict the availability of new cars for consumers.

The Volkswagen Group is one of the car companies that relies on chips from Nexperia. In a statement, the VW Group said “vehicle production at the Wolfsburg, Emden, Zwickau, Osnabrück and Dresden sites is secured for the coming week”. However, VW added that it’s “in close contact with stakeholders in light of the current situation”, and that “short-term effects on production cannot be ruled out”.

Among the other firms that source chips from Nexperia either directly or indirectly are Nissan, Volvo, Honda, Mercedes and BMW. In light of the potential issues facing the automotive industry with chip shortages, a Nissan spokesperson said the company is “assessing the situation and will take appropriate measures as needed”.

Nexperia was partly-owned by the Chinese government and has manufacturing operations in China but due to “serious managerial shortcomings” the Dutch government took control of the company last month. The fallout from the move saw the Dutch courts replace Nexperia’s CEO Zhang Xuezheng with a non-Chinese executive, and this caused the Chinese government to respond by banning the export of Nexperia’s products.

[TITLE]Bitcoin Bull Run Hasn’t Died—It’s Evolving, Says Galaxy Research Head:
[TEXT]
Bitcoin’s grinding tape, tamed volatility and repeated, incremental all-time highs are not symptoms of a failed cycle but evidence of a market changing hands and changing character, according to Alex Thorn, Galaxy’s head of firmwide research in an interview released October 23.

Bitcoin Bull Run Gone Quiet: Here’s Why

The researcher argues that the driver capping bitcoin’s near-term upside is exogenous—US–China tariff risk—rather than any structural deterioration in the asset’s fundamentals or adoption. “I don’t yet think it’s more existential than that for the bull market,” he said, describing the current price action as “sort of crab,” with the market “still” climbing a wall of worry.

The price discussion hinged on two linked observations. First, bitcoin is not trading like gold yet because “markets move on the margins,” and marginal flows still treat BTC as risk. Second, those margins are shifting, with passive, long-term allocators steadily absorbing distribution from older cohorts. “Significant distribution from old hands to new hands” has created resistance, he said, but that process is “healthy,” widening ownership and maturing the market. He framed a psychological and structural line of demarcation at six figures: “Maybe we delineate there the pre-$100K bitcoin world versus the post-$100K bitcoin world. I think it’s going to look a lot different.”

He contends gold’s behavior helps explain the present inter-asset divergence. “This still is the debasement trade…and it’s the anti-US government trade,” he said, noting that recent gold strength has been “all offshore,” with bids arriving “during European and Asian hours,” consistent with “foreign central banks and large…sovereign wealth funds” diversifying away from US exposure.

By contrast, the bitcoin price is pinned to risk appetite at the edges of the market. That said, he expects the asset to converge toward a gold-like profile as ownership migrates to institutions: “BlackRock’s chilling the digital gold narrative…Fidelity, this is how they talk about it,” he said, adding that as more supply moves into the hands of registered investment advisors and passive vehicles, BTC “will…trade a lot more like a risk-off, non-sovereign scarcity hedge asset.”

The near-term overhang, in his view, is the tariff scare that followed statements on October 10 about potential 100% levies on China, which “caused” a leverage washout and stalled a strong October. “Quite simply an abatement of the tariff war between the US and China…would sort of set us right back on course in risk markets,” he said, anticipating a compromise rather than a “protracted bloody trade war.”

Thorn also downplayed the next Federal Reserve meeting as a catalyst for bitcoin’s direction, while acknowledging that with official economic data delayed, the Fed’s own proprietary datasets could make its communication unusually market-relevant: “They’re going to have data. We don’t have data, but they’ll share the data.”

Galaxy Lowers EOY Bitcoin Price Prediction

Against that backdrop, he marked down—but did not abandon—his year-end targets. “At the beginning of the year, I was calling for $150,000 and then $185,000 in Q4… I am going to materially draw down that prediction to maybe like $130,000 by EOY,” he said.

Thorn described 2025’s path as a slow, volatile stair-step higher—“from like $100k to…$74k to then $126k to now $108l”—with realized volatility declining. To illustrate the regime change, host Joe Consorti highlighted a 90-day realized volatility reading near 29, far below the 2017 and 2021 cycle peaks, and summarized the shifting drivers: “It’s more of a macro trade than anything…moving much further into…being impacted…by the macro regime.”

Related Reading

Institutional distribution channels were a recurring theme. The Galaxy research head pointed to wealth-platform access and custody bank initiatives as late-cycle but powerful accelerants. Thorn cited Morgan Stanley’s move to let advisors recommend a small allocation (2-4%) through spot ETFs and said that three of the four largest global custody banks have either launched or announced digital-asset custody, with one notable holdout.

The implication, he argued, is that the ETF bid and wirehouse adoption are replacing the old, concentrated holder base: “The era of the early bitcoin adopter is now finally, I think, fully coming to an end. And now you’re in…whatever that stage is…this is going to be a widely owned macro asset in everybody’s portfolio.”

NEW EPISODE: Over The Horizon 🎙️ Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) joins me to discuss:

– Why markets are so anxious

– Institutional adoption and Bitcoin’s next era

– AI CapEx & lessons from the dot-com boom

– The future of digital asset treasuries pic.twitter.com/pVuKs3MWJH — Horizon (@JoinHorizon_) October 23, 2025

Macro cross-currents complicate the timing. The AI capital-expenditure boom—he called it “the most important trend in markets”—is either nearing a speculative blow-off or, in a more geopolitical framing, just entering a Manhattan Project–style national-priority phase. If the latter proves correct, the knock-on effects for liquidity, rates, energy and semiconductors could be larger and longer-lived than typical tech cycles.

But for bitcoin specifically, he kept coming back to tariffs as the decisive near-term swing factor and to microstructure as the reason the chart feels both heavier and sturdier than past cycles: a passive ETF bid absorbing OG supply at psychologically significant round numbers, without the “massive uplifts” that once followed fresh all-time highs.

The base case he outlined is not euphoria but endurance. Or, as he put it more bluntly earlier in the conversation, the bull run hasn’t died—“it’s evolving.”

At press time, BTC traded at $111,183.

[TITLE]Syria signs landing deal for first international submarine cable with Medusa, state-run TV reports:
[TEXT]
Synopsis

Syria's telecommunications ministry has partnered with Medusa Submarine Cable System to land the country's first international submarine cable. This project aims to significantly improve internet connectivity, which has been hampered by years of conflict and sanctions. The cable will connect 12 countries across North Africa and southern Europe, enhancing access to global networks.

[TITLE]What Would an Antitrust Review Look Like for a Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery Merger?:
[TEXT]
In a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery’s board, David Ellison argued that Paramount would be the “best partner” to merge with, citing “significant (perhaps insurmountable) hurdles” for other potential acquirers due to their “dominant market positions.” But that doesn’t mean a Paramount-WBD deal would be without its own regulatory challenges.

Unlike Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount, an acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery would not require a review by the Federal Communications Commission, as there is no required transfer of broadcast licenses. But a deal would still be subject to the same standard antitrust review that other bidders would face, not to mention the financial burden that comes with taking on Warner Bros. Discovery’s roughly $35 billion in debt.

A Paramount-WBD combination appears to be in the pole position in the eyes of the White House, with President Donald Trump reportedly throwing his support behind the company’s bid. Paramount is also able to leverage the expertise of its chief legal officer Makan Delrahim, who served as a former assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division during Trump’s first term.

Still, Hollywood has already been left battered from years of consolidation, and a deal of such magnitude will draw scrutiny on a number of levels. Regulators could see divestitures or other long-term commitments to offset the power and reach a combined company would have.

“In contrast with the Skydance/Paramount deal in which almost no one other than the principals and the President was affected by the outcome, here everyone, from theater owners to sports leagues to streamers to broadcasters to all the MVPDs and VMVPDs to all the Hollywood guilds will be affected, due to the increased leverage PWBD will have in negotiations,” New Street Research analyst and former FCC chief of staff Blair Levin wrote in a Sept. 16 research note. “As far as we can see, everyone in the sector will be negatively affected if the deal is approved.”

In other words, it’s not a slam dunk, despite Trump’s support.

Representatives for Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment.

What would a DOJ antitrust review look like?

For any bidder, the Department of Justice’s review would look at a combined company’s impact on the market concentration across areas such as theatrical, streaming, advertising and sports.

The agency calculates market concentration using what’s known as the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI), which operates on a scale of zero to 10,000 points. An HHI between 1,000 and 1,800 points is considered moderately concentrated, while an anything in excess of 1,800 points is considered highly concentrated.

Based on his own initial review, Levin estimated that a combined Paramount-WBD’s impact on the concentration of movie studios could climb from an HHI score of 1,730 to

[TITLE]Europe plans satellite powerhouse to rival Musk's Starlink:

Europe plans satellite powerhouse to rival Musk's Starlink

By Olga NEDBAEVA

Paris (AFP) Oct 23, 2025

Three leading European aerospace groups announced Thursday a plan to merge their satellite operations to create a powerhouse for competing in particular against Elon Musk's Starlink internet system.

The merger, whose financial details were not disclosed, comes as Starlink and Amazon's Project Kuiper are racing to deploy satellite networks to offer broadband internet access in vast regions of the world lacking reliable connectivity.

Airbus, Thales and Italy's Leonardo said they aimed "to strengthen Europe's strategic autonomy in space, a major sector that underpins critical infrastructure and services related to telecommunications, global navigation, earth observation, science, exploration and national security".

It would not include space launchers such as Airbus's Ariane rockets, which, unlike the Falcon launchers of Musk's SpaceX, are not reusable.

Many Falcon flights have carried the more than 8,000 satellites that currently make up Starlink.

In response, the European Union is planning to create its own internet satellite constellation called IRIS2, set to become operational in 2030.

While it would have just 300 satellites, IRIS2 would focus more on "secure communications", European Space Agency director Josef Aschbacher told AFP in an interview this month.

"Europe needs it absolutely urgently," he said.

Thales said separately Thursday that an initial 100-million-euro ($116 million) engineering contract with satellite operators for IRIS2 would allow it to halt planned job cuts in its space operations.

- 'Excellent news' -

Annual revenues for the new European satellite group were estimated at 6.5 billion euros based on current operations, and its order backlog would represent over three years of projected sales.

It will be headquartered in Toulouse, southern France, where each company already has major production and R&D facilities.

If approved by regulators, the new project, called Bromo, would be operational in 2027, with Airbus owning a 35 percent stake while Thales and Leonardo would hold 32.5 percent each.

The companies build, deploy and service a range of telecommunications and navigation satellites that will underpin the rollout of high-speed networks worldwide.

"This partnership aligns with the ambitions of European governments to strengthen their industrial and technological assets, ensuring Europe's autonomy across the strategic space domain and its many applications," the CEOs of each company said in a joint statement.

Finance Minister Roland Lescure of France, which along with Germany and Spain owns minority stakes in Airbus, called the deal "excellent news".

"The creation of a European satellites champion will increase investments in research and innovation in a strategic industry and reinforce our European sovereignty in an area of intense global competition," he said in a statement.

[TEXT]
Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Scale AI alum Bilal Abu-Ghazaleh has launched startup building artificial intelligence infrastructure 1001 to modernize large industries across the Middle East and North Africa.

The company on Sunday announced a $9 million seed round led by venture capital firm CIV, General Catalyst, and Lux Capital. Other investors include Stanford AI Lab Professor Chris Ré, Replit founder and CEO Amjad Masad, DAMAC Managing Director and PRYPCO founder Amira Sajwani, RAED Venture Partner Khalid Bin Bader Al Saud, and Lean Technologies co-founder and CEO Hisham Al-Falih.

The company's mission focuses on addressing inefficiencies in high-impact sectors such as aviation, logistics, construction, and oil and gas. Abu-Ghazaleh told TechCrunch that across the Gulf region, these industries lose more than $10 billion annually due to delays and outdated operational systems.

Real-Time Decisioning Platform Tackles $10 Billion In Regional Inefficiencies

1001 said it aims to create an "AI-native operating system" that helps organizations make faster and more precise operational decisions. The system integrates live data, operational modeling, and real-time oversight tools to automate daily workflows. According to 1001, the platform enables decisions that save time, improve utilization, and create measurable outcomes.

Abu-Ghazaleh told TechCrunch that many daily operational calls are still handled manually, such as assigning ground crews or rerouting vehicles in airports. "With our system, that orchestration happens automatically. The AI orchestrator uses real-time data to reroute vehicles, reassign crews, and adjust operations without human intervention," he said.

1001's approach draws from Abu-Ghazaleh's years at Scale AI, where he led teams developing data annotation systems for generative AI. That experience deepened his understanding of how data-driven automation can reduce complexity in large-scale operations, according to TechCrunch.

[TITLE]Energy Secretary Chris Wright Proposes Changes to Power American Manufacturing, Lead AI Innovation:
[TEXT]
Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate a rulemaking to accelerate American manufacturing and ensure that the United States continues to lead in artificial intelligence.

Wright wrote to commissioners of the FERC:

To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.

The Energy secretary wrote that, while FERC has historically not exerted jurisdiction over load interconnections to the interstate transmission system, he believes that interconnection of large loads falls “squarely within” FERC’s jurisdiction.

He explained why this move is so important for American manufacturing and AI development:

This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing and driving American AI innovation, both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously. Thus, pursuant to my authority under section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, I attach for the Commission’s consideration the enclosed advance notice of proposed rulemaking.

Yahoo News wrote:

This type of rule change has been eagerly anticipated by tech and power executives in the aftermath of the FERC’s rejection of a request by Talen Energy Corp. to directly supply an Amazon.com Inc. data center from a Pennsylvania nuclear plant. But it also risks pushback from states grappling with soaring power demand from data centers, new factories, and electric vehicles — and the resulting higher utility bills.

Wright’s proposed rule would give data centers an expedited review if they include additional power plants or agree to limit power usage if the regional grid system faces increased strain, such as during a heatwave.

Data center companies cheered the news.

“Then there’d be a lot more certainty when you start a project that you’d know when it would be energized,” Raul Martynek, CEO of DataBank, which operates about 75 data centers across the country, said.

He added, “On behalf of the American people, and given the urgency of this issue, I look forward to your consideration and final action (no later than April 30, 2026).”
