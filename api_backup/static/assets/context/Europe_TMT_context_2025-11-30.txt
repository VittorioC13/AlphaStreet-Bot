Amazon workers in more than 30 countries launched coordinated strikes and protests on Black Friday, kicking off the sixth annual "Make Amazon Pay" campaign with what organizers say is the movement's largest mobilization to date.

The wave of walkouts, rallies, and demonstrations runs through December 1, spanning warehouses, data centers, offices, and public spaces worldwide. UNI Global Union, which represents millions of service sector workers worldwide, and Progressive International, a global network of labor and activist organizations, are organizing the protests.

Organizers say the actions reflect mounting frustration over everything from heat-related warehouse injuries and aggressive productivity pressure to Amazon's booming AI and cloud operations, rising climate impact, and its work with immigration and law-enforcement agencies.

"Amazon, Jeff Bezos, and their political allies are betting on a techno-authoritarian future, but this Make Amazon Pay Day, workers everywhere are saying: enough," said Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union, in a statement. "For years, Amazon has squashed workers' right to democracy on the job through a union and the backing of authoritarian political figures."

An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement, "The fact is at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities—all from day one. We directly employ more than 1.5 million people around the world, and provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings."

Amazon workers in India demand labor protections

This year, thousands of workers are rallying in New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, and more than 20 other Indian cities, demanding fair wages, safe conditions, and protection from extreme heat.

A UNI Global Union survey of 474 Amazon warehouse and delivery workers in India, conducted between June and July, illustrated labor concerns driving this year's actions. Three-quarters of respondents said they or a coworker required medical attention due to heat exposure. More than half reported "extremely hot and unsafe" or "unbearable" working conditions.

The findings come one year after India's Human Rights Commission called for an investigation into labor practices at an Amazon facility near New Delhi, where workers were reportedly discouraged from taking water breaks during a severe heat wave. Amazon workers in India also held protests over this last year.

"No worker should be forced to risk their health — or their life — for Amazon's bottom line," Hoffman said. "Heat protections must be enforceable, and workers themselves must have a say in setting the standards."

Protesters criticize Amazon's environmental impact and ICE ties

Over 1,000 Amazon corporate employees published an open letter criticizing the company's rollout of artificial intelligence. The letter argues that Amazon is abandoning its climate commitments to fund AI infrastructure, citing a $150 billion investment in new data centers despite the company's pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2040.

The employees demanded that Amazon power all data centers with renewable energy, establish worker committees with authority over AI deployment decisions, and refuse to provide AI technology for what they describe as "violence, surveillance, or mass deportation."

The expanded agenda of "Make Amazon Pay" this year emphasizes what organizers call a "techno-authoritarian future" — the convergence of Big Tech companies with authoritarian political forces. The coalition said that Amazon funded Trump's inauguration and that the company's recent filings show it paid $1.4 billion less in taxes.

Outside of Amazon, organizers planned protests across multiple US cities, including Chicago, Newark, New York, Oakland, San Bernardino, and Washington, D.C. Demonstrators are focusing on Amazon's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, demanding the company stop providing infrastructure they say powers the agency's deportation operations.

"Amazon is no longer just a retailer — it is a pillar of a new authoritarian order built on surveillance and exploitation," David Adler, co-general coordinator of the Progressive International, said in a statement. "From ICE raids to the repression of Palestinians, Amazon's technologies are woven into systems of violence worldwide."

Amazon workers call for unionization efforts

In Germany, the services union Verdi coordinated work stoppages at nine logistics facilities, Reuters reported. About 3,000 workers participated, according to the union, which continues to seek a collective bargaining agreement.

Amazon maintains about 40,000 employees at German logistics centers, plus 12,000 additional seasonal hires for the holiday rush. The company told Reuters the walkouts would not affect customer deliveries and that its compensation is competitive.

Additional protests took place in Canada, where CSN, a major trade union, and CTI, an advocate for immigrant workers, held a demonstration in downtown Montreal, calling for a boycott of Amazon.

The protest followed Amazon's closure of several Quebec distribution centers that resulted in 4,500 job losses, CityNews Montreal reported. Union leaders accused Amazon of retaliating against workers' unionization efforts, with one organizer noting the timing between the unionization of a warehouse and Amazon's decision to close facilities in the region.

Other actions occurred in Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Brazil, Bangladesh, Colombia, Denmark, Luxembourg, Poland, Greece, the UK, South Africa, and Gaza.

Amazon workers achieved some union victories in 2025. A warehouse in Delta, British Columbia, has become the first Canadian Amazon facility to gain union representation after labor officials ruled that the company improperly interfered with the organizing campaign. Amazon is contesting the ruling.

[TITLE]Snapchat is nearing 1 billion monthly users. Why can’t it turn a profit?:
[TEXT]
By Queenie Wong, Los Angeles Times

Snapchat, an app whose disappearing messages and silly face filters made chatting with loved ones more casual, is close to a milestone that few social media platforms achieve: reaching 1 billion monthly users.

But Snap, the Santa Monica company behind the app, faces a crucial test. The 14-year-old tech company is still losing money and has seen its share price tumble as it barrels forward to popularize augmented reality glasses next year.

And even though more people in developing countries are using the app, Snapchat usage in markets where the company makes more revenue per user, including the United States and Europe, has dropped.

Snapchat has 943 million monthly active users globally, according to the company.

Growth in India, where TikTok is banned, and Pakistan have fueled Snapchat’s global user growth, data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show. In India, Snapchat monthly users have surpassed 250 million, making up more than a quarter of its user base, according to numbers Snap released in July.

At the same time, in the third quarter, Snapchat monthly active users declined by 4% in the U.S. and double digits in France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, Sensor Tower said.

Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel wrote in a September note to employees the company is in a “crucible moment,” comparing it to a “middle child” wedged between larger tech giants and smaller rivals.

[TITLE]Credit Scoring Platform Marketing Strategies For Financial Institutions:
[TEXT]
Credit scoring platform marketing represents a specialized approach within financial technology marketing where companies developing credit assessment tools promote their services to lenders, financial institutions, and other businesses that need credit evaluation capabilities. This marketing discipline requires deep understanding of both B2B sales cycles and complex regulatory requirements that govern credit reporting and lending decisions.

Key Summary: Credit scoring platform marketing focuses on promoting algorithmic credit assessment tools to institutional buyers while navigating strict compliance requirements and demonstrating measurable risk reduction outcomes.

Key Takeaways:

Credit scoring platforms serve B2B markets including banks, fintech lenders, and alternative finance companies

Marketing strategies must address complex regulatory compliance requirements under FCRA, ECOA, and state lending laws

Successful campaigns emphasize risk reduction, automation benefits, and integration capabilities

Demonstration of model accuracy and bias testing is critical for institutional adoption

Long sales cycles require sustained thought leadership and relationship-building approaches

Integration with existing lending infrastructure represents a key decision factor

Understanding the Credit Scoring Platform Market

Credit scoring platform marketing operates within a highly regulated B2B environment where institutional buyers evaluate vendors based on risk mitigation, compliance capabilities, and integration complexity. Unlike consumer fintech marketing, credit scoring platforms target sophisticated buyers including chief risk officers, lending technology teams, and compliance departments.

The market encompasses traditional credit bureaus expanding their offerings, fintech companies developing alternative scoring models, and specialized analytics firms serving niche lending segments. Each segment requires distinct marketing approaches based on buyer sophistication, regulatory requirements, and integration timelines.

Credit Scoring Platform: A software solution that uses algorithmic models to assess borrower creditworthiness, typically incorporating traditional credit data, alternative data sources, and machine learning techniques to generate risk scores for lending decisions. Learn more from CFPB

Marketing professionals in this space must understand complex technical concepts including model validation, bias testing, and fair lending compliance while communicating value propositions to multiple stakeholders within target organizations.

What Are the Primary Target Markets for Credit Scoring Platforms?

Credit scoring platform marketing targets several distinct institutional segments, each with unique needs, compliance requirements, and decision-making processes. Traditional banks represent the largest market segment but often have the longest evaluation cycles due to extensive risk management protocols.

Primary Market Segments:

Regional and community banks seeking to compete with larger institutions through improved risk assessment

seeking to compete with larger institutions through improved risk assessment Online lending platforms requiring fast, automated decisioning for consumer and business loans

requiring fast, automated decisioning for consumer and business loans Credit unions looking to expand lending programs while maintaining member-focused approaches

needing real-time credit assessment capabilities Mortgage originators seeking enhanced pre-approval and underwriting tools

Each segment requires tailored messaging that addresses specific pain points, regulatory concerns, and operational requirements. For comprehensive strategies across financial verticals, explore specialized marketing approaches for banking and fintech sectors.

How Do Regulatory Requirements Shape Marketing Strategies?

Regulatory compliance represents the most critical factor influencing credit scoring platform marketing strategies. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and various state lending laws create strict requirements for how credit data is collected, processed, and used in lending decisions.

Marketing materials must demonstrate comprehensive understanding of these requirements while positioning platforms as compliance-enabling rather than compliance-complicating solutions. This includes showcasing bias testing capabilities, audit trails, and documentation systems that help lenders meet regulatory obligations.

Key Compliance Marketing Elements:

Model validation documentation showing statistical accuracy and bias testing results

showing statistical accuracy and bias testing results Adverse action notice capabilities enabling lenders to provide required consumer disclosures

enabling lenders to provide required consumer disclosures Data governance features demonstrating secure handling of consumer credit information

demonstrating secure handling of consumer credit information Fair lending compliance tools helping identify and prevent discriminatory lending patterns

helping identify and prevent discriminatory lending patterns Regulatory change management showing how platforms adapt to evolving compliance requirements

Agencies specializing in financial services marketing, such as WOLF Financial, integrate compliance considerations into every campaign element to ensure messaging meets regulatory standards while effectively communicating platform benefits.

What Marketing Channels Work Best for Credit Scoring Platforms?

Credit scoring platform marketing relies heavily on relationship-building channels and thought leadership approaches due to complex B2B sales cycles and high-stakes decision-making processes. Direct outbound marketing often proves less effective than establishing credibility through industry expertise and peer recommendations.

Most Effective Marketing Channels:

Industry conference participation at events like LendIt, Money20/20, and regional banking conferences

at events like LendIt, Money20/20, and regional banking conferences Regulatory publication content in compliance-focused trade magazines and newsletters

in compliance-focused trade magazines and newsletters Webinar series addressing current regulatory challenges and technical implementation topics

with complementary fintech vendors and system integrators LinkedIn thought leadership from executives and risk management professionals

Content marketing proves particularly valuable when addressing complex technical topics that help prospects understand platform capabilities and competitive advantages. Educational content that explains regulatory changes or industry best practices builds trust while positioning platforms as knowledgeable partners.

How Should Companies Demonstrate Platform Effectiveness?

Demonstrating credit scoring platform effectiveness requires presenting quantifiable evidence of risk reduction, operational efficiency, and compliance improvement. Institutional buyers evaluate platforms based on measurable outcomes rather than feature lists or general capabilities.

Successful marketing campaigns present validation data from independent testing, peer-reviewed research, and real-world implementation results. This evidence-based approach helps overcome institutional skepticism and supports procurement processes that require detailed vendor evaluation.

Key Effectiveness Metrics:

Model accuracy statistics including Gini coefficients, KS statistics, and AUC measurements

including Gini coefficients, KS statistics, and AUC measurements Default rate reduction percentages from existing customer implementations

percentages from existing customer implementations Processing time improvements showing automated decision speed versus manual underwriting

showing automated decision speed versus manual underwriting False positive reduction demonstrating improved approval rates for qualified borrowers

calculations showing operational efficiency gains Integration timeline data from successful platform deployments

Model Validation: The process of testing credit scoring algorithms to ensure statistical accuracy, regulatory compliance, and absence of discriminatory bias in lending decisions. Independent validation provides institutional buyers with confidence in platform reliability.

What Role Does Alternative Data Play in Marketing Positioning?

Alternative data capabilities represent a key differentiator in credit scoring platform marketing, particularly when targeting lenders seeking to serve underbanked populations or improve risk assessment accuracy. However, alternative data usage requires careful regulatory positioning due to fair lending concerns and consumer protection requirements.

Marketing messages must balance innovation benefits with compliance assurance, demonstrating how alternative data enhances rather than complicates regulatory compliance. This includes showing how platforms validate alternative data sources and test for bias across protected class characteristics.

Alternative Data Marketing Strategies:

Data source transparency explaining specific alternative data types and collection methods

explaining specific alternative data types and collection methods Bias testing results demonstrating fair lending compliance across demographic groups

[TITLE]DJI ban: how the world’s biggest dronemaker is getting shoved out of the US:
[TEXT]
December 23rd, 2025. That’s the day DJI will automatically be banned from the United States — unless Trump steps in.

You’ll still be able to fly your existing DJI drones and film with existing Osmo cameras. But DJI will be barred from importing any new products into the US, and the FCC can retroactively ban imports of old DJI products too, after a waiting period. Not just drones, by the way — anything with a wireless radio.

Why a ban? Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle claim to be worried the Chinese company is spying on us, even though the US government has never publicly provided evidence of that. Some worry China could compel the company to turn over drone data. (DJI has denied it shares any data with China, claims it stores all such data in the US and announced it would delete all US flight logs in September 2024.)

Some also suggest DJI wouldn’t need to be compelled because DJI is allegedly “owned by the Chinese Communist Party,” though a US judge decided there wasn’t enough evidence to back that up in September 2025.

Either way, lawmakers and Trump would clearly prefer that American drones “dominate” the skies rather than Chinese ones, and it’s true that DJI’s drones dominate today. No other company has been able to produce similarly a volume of high-quality, low-cost drones, to the point that some Republican lawmakers finally began to push back against a ban just weeks before the December 2025 deadline.

They argue that DJI drones are important for farmers, energy companies, and rescue workers since no viable alternatives exist. Most of of DJI’s old competitors, like Skydio, have pivoted to enterprise and military — the new Insta360/Antigravity A1 is an unusual exception.

[TITLE]Amazon is selling Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at the old cheap price:
[TEXT]
Gamers of all stripes freaked out when Microsoft jacked up prices on its Game Pass subscription by 50 percent two months ago — which is why it’s terrific that Amazon is ignoring Microsoft’s demands and selling Game Pass Ultimate at the “old” price of $59.99 for a three-month code.

For me, the three-month Game Pass Ultimate deal for $59.99 is the big one: It covers both the Xbox and the PC, and gives you the most access to the most games. There was a huge outrage when Microsoft jacked up its Game Pass prices, but this feels a bit like the loopholes Microsoft quietly tucked into some of its Windows upgrades — you know, the ones you’re not officially supposed to know about, but are (or were) there.

Basically, Amazon is saving you $30. Nice!

Amazon is also hosting deals for the one-month subscription to Game Pass, too, for a slightly discounted $18.99. And, if you’re strictly a PC gamer, you can also buy a three-month code to PC Game Pass for $35.99, too. All of these are the “old” prices, so the price hikes haven’t taken effect.

Note that these are digital codes, so instead of Amazon sending you a scratch-off card, ordering this deal will trigger Amazon to drop it into your “Games and Software Library” section of your Amazon account. At that point, you’ll need to register the code with your Xbox account.

Look, I’m a huge proponent of just tying my Microsoft account to Microsoft Rewards and not paying for anything Microsoft-related, Game Pass included. I know a lot of you have also completely given up on Game Pass and moved on. But if you want to keep Game Pass going, and you’d like to stick it to the man and buy Game Pass for the “old” price, this is the way to do it. And none of us have any idea about how long this deal will hang on for.

Buy three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at the "old" $59.99 price

It may not surprise anyone who is tech-aware that publications such as The Verge track the affiliate links that their readers click — in fact, every article that links to a vendor has this statement on top: “If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.”

So we will be totally honest with you: we do have some idea of which products our readers are purchasing during the Black Friday sales. (But no, we have no idea what you personally purchased.) And it can be interesting to see which products are more popular — because they are definitely not all tech.

[TITLE]What’s up with… Deutsche Telekom, Proximus, Bouygues Telecom, Veon:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: After three years of R&D, the DT-led 6G-TakeOff project unveils its outcomes; the enterprise services arm of Proximus teams up with France’s Mistral AI for European sovereign digital service development; Bouygues Telecom deploys a sovereign agentic AI platform; Veon’s software unit teams up with a specialist partner to develop local language LLMs for its various operating markets; and more!

The Deutsche Telekom (DT)-led 6G-TakeOff project, which was first announced in October 2022, has presented the results of three years of R&D efforts that have been focused on “3D networks and their key components”. These three-dimensional networks comprise base stations located on the ground, on high-altitude platform systems (HAPS) and aboard satellites. “The project focused on the holistic view of a 3D network and the question of how the various network elements can be connected to each other in a unified 6G architecture. By combining and intelligently coordinating the various access technologies, optimal access to connectivity is thus enabled for every application. The results of the project are an important part of basic research for so-called non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and will be incorporated into the standardisation of the future generation of mobile communications,” noted DT in this

[TITLE]FDI insurge: Robust inflows into future-focused fields could help India stare down global economic uncertainty:
[TEXT]
Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a long history of transforming industries—from steel to semiconductors. This has been true in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and India.

But there’s an FDI shake-up underway, according to a new study from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).

As investment decisions increasingly follow geopolitical lines, India stands as the world’s top emerging-market destination for announced ‘greenfield’ FDI—that is, cross-border investment projects that create net new production capacity.

From 2022 through the first five months of 2025, India’s greenfield FDI inflow announcements have averaged $83 billion a year—24% higher than in the 2015 to 2019 period.

Of those billions pledged to India since 2022, nearly 80% were destined for advanced manufacturing, communications and software, and resource-related sectors—industries poised to shape tomorrow’s global economy.

These are neither the conventional textile nor basic product investments that played large roles in years past. While India’s large and growing domestic market continues to pull in foreign investors, it is far from the only factor in play in the post-pandemic years.

[TITLE]Altice International Shifts Assets From Lenders, Raises Debt:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- Altice International has moved two of its units out of the reach of creditors, and raised new debt from one of them, in an aggressive move aimed at stabilizing its finances.

The telecommunications provider has designated Altice Portugal SA, which holds all of the company’s operations in Portugal, and Altice Caribbean Sarl, housing its activities in the Dominican Republic, as so-called unrestricted subsidiaries, according to a statement on Friday.

As such, the units aren’t governed by the rules of existing financing agreements. Instead, they are free to incur debt, sell assets, or pay dividends without needing approval from lenders.

At the same time, one of the Altice Portugal divisions has raised €750 million ($870 million) of new debt to pay upcoming Altice International liabilities, as well as for general working capital purposes, the statement said.

The company also flagged the possibility of raising €2 billion of additional debt at the level of Altice Portugal, according to the note, which would allow it to further bolster its liquidity position.

Altice International’s move — a so-called drop-down — is one of several aggressive tools borrowers and owners can deploy to raise money when struggling with a growing debt pile.

The company has been looking at various options to deal with its €8.7 billion stack of net liabilities.

“Altice founder Patrick Drahi’s latest game of asset Jenga leaves Altice International creditors in a perilous position and facing a restructuring scenario,” wrote Aidan Cheslin, the head of European credit research at Bloomberg Intelligence. The decision to designate its core Portugal and Caribbean assets as unrestricted leaves “the remaining restricted group (principally Israel) with an annualized net debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 26x.”

Altice International’s 5.75% dollar-denominated bonds due in August 2029 were down over 7 cents to below 67 cents on the dollar following the announcement, according to Trace pricing data.

Negotiations Ahead

Creditors have organized ahead of potential debt talks with the company.

Three independent members have been added to the board of Altice International, the statement said, adding that Altice Caribbean is now held by a direct subsidiary of Altice Group Lux Sarl.

The telecommunications firm also announced a strategic review of its portfolio of assets on Friday and will assess some potential disposals over the coming years.

The company posted third quarter results indicating a year-on-year drop in earnings of 12.1%, as well as a 4.2% growth in revenues. Profits were impacted as the streams of revenue currently growing have lower margins, the company said. On top of that, Altice International grappled with higher operating costs.

(Adds analyst comment in eighth graph, bond pricing in ninth, details on earnings in thirteenth.)

[TITLE]Europe chooses resilient and secure space-enabled connectivity with €2.1 billion investment:
[TEXT]
In a time of profound technological and geopolitical challenges, Europe will continue to support the need for secure satellite communications. This was the clear message given at the European Space Agency's (ESA) Council meeting at Ministerial Level, in Bremen, Germany.

Over the past decades, ESA has elevated satellite connectivity by investing in pioneering ideas and technologies. Building upon this success, the continuation and growth of the programmes will further Europe’s and Canada’s competitiveness and strengthen our Members States’ leadership. By working in partnership with industry and academia, ESA will accelerate the delivery of advanced technology, products and services.

This landmark decision will see ESA contributing to Europe’s innovation, resilience and connectivity within the satellite telecommunications sector. The subscriptions will enable small and large companies across Europe and Canada to advance their competitiveness and respond to global challenges and opportunities.

About our programmes

ARTES 4.0

Our Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES) programme turns ideas into fully-fledged products, systems and services. The programme provides European and Canadian industry with the capacity to respond rapidly to global market and security challenges.

ARTES has enabled technologies to develop and companies to mitigate the inherent risk of innovation before entering the satellite communications market. From optical and quantum communications to space-based 5G connectivity, ESA has supported ground-breaking technology and talent.

With the current subscription for ARTES, we will continue to support European leadership in the GEO market through the HummingSat and Novacom projects. We will be able to deliver on optical and quantum communications, key technologies to further our autonomy and resilience. Our project HydRON will establish a true “internet of space” and further expand our network of optical ground stations.

[TITLE]Huawei, ZTE seal 5G deals in Vietnam after US tariffs, as ties with China warm​:
[TEXT]
China's leading telecommunication firms Huawei and ZTE have won a string of contracts this year to supply 5G equipment in Vietnam, in another sign of Hanoi's strengthening bonds with Beijing, stirring concern among Western officials, seven people with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.For years, Vietnam was seen as reluctant to use Chinese technology in sensitive infrastructure, but in recent months it has embraced Chinese tech companies as sometimes frosty relations with its northern neighbour have warmed while ties with Washington have soured over tariffs on Vietnamese goods.While Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia secured contracts for Vietnam's 5G core infrastructure, with US chipmaker Qualcomm providing network equipment, Chinese companies have begun winning smaller tenders with state-owned operators, so far unreported public procurement data shows.A consortium including Huawei was awarded a $23 million contract for 5G equipment in April, weeks after the White House announced tariffs on Vietnamese goods. ZTE has won at least two contracts, one last week, totalling more than $20 million for 5G antennas. The first publicly disclosed deal came in September, a month after US tariffs took effect.Reuters could not establish whether the timing of these wins was linked to US tariffs, but the deals raised concerns among Western officials.The exclusion of Chinese contractors from Vietnam's digital infrastructure, including undersea fibre-optic cables, has long been identified by Washington as a key condition for support in advanced technologies.Huawei and ZTE are banned from US telecom networks as an "unacceptable risk" to national security. Sweden and other European countries have similar restrictions.Ericsson declined to comment on Chinese companies, but said it was "fully committed to support its customers in Vietnam."Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Qualcomm, the US embassy in Vietnam, China's embassy, Sweden's foreign ministry or Vietnam's tech ministry responded to requests for comment.The unaligned Southeast Asian nation is a crucial battleground in the competition for global influence. Its proximity to China has made it a major industrial hub for multinationals such as Apple, Samsung and Nike , which rely on Chinese components and Western consumers.Under Western pressure, Vietnam long took "a wait-and-see approach" to Chinese technology, said Nguyen Hung, a specialist in supply chains at RMIT University Vietnam. But "Vietnam has its own priorities," he added, noting the new deals could spur deeper economic integration with China.Hanoi and Beijing have made progress recently on other sensitive projects, including cross-border rail links and special economic zones close to the Chinese border, which Vietnam had previously discarded as security risks.Huawei lost multiple bids this year on 5G equipment in Vietnam, according to tender data. But it has cooperated on technical services, and signed an agreement in June on 5G technology transfers with Viettel, Vietnam's army-owned main telecom operator, according to Vietnam's defence ministry.Viettel did not respond to a request for comment. One person at the company said Chinese technology was cheaper. The sources declined to be named because the information they shared was not public.The Chinese contracts have been discussed in at least two meetings of senior Western officials in Hanoi in recent weeks, diplomatic sources said. In one meeting, a U.S. official warned they could undermine trust in Vietnam's networks and jeopardise access to US advanced technology.In a meeting this month officials explored whether areas using Chinese technology could be sealed off from the rest of the network to prevent data leaks, one of the sources said.But suppliers of antennas and equipment could still gain access to network data, said Innocenzo Genna, a telecommunications lawyer, noting "Western contractors may face the awkward prospect of working alongside firms they do not trust."

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Amazon workers in more than 30 countries launched coordinated strikes and protests on Black Friday, kicking off the sixth annual "Make Amazon Pay" campaign with what organizers say is the movement's largest mobilization to date.

The wave of walkouts, rallies, and demonstrations runs through December 1, spanning warehouses, data centers, offices, and public spaces worldwide. UNI Global Union, which represents millions of service sector workers worldwide, and Progressive International, a global network of labor and activist organizations, are organizing the protests.

Organizers say the actions reflect mounting frustration over everything from heat-related warehouse injuries and aggressive productivity pressure to Amazon's booming AI and cloud operations, rising climate impact, and its work with immigration and law-enforcement agencies.

"Amazon, Jeff Bezos, and their political allies are betting on a techno-authoritarian future, but this Make Amazon Pay Day, workers everywhere are saying: enough," said Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union, in a statement. "For years, Amazon has squashed workers' right to democracy on the job through a union and the backing of authoritarian political figures."

An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement, "The fact is at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities—all from day one. We directly employ more than 1.5 million people around the world, and provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings."

Amazon workers in India demand labor protections

This year, thousands of workers are rallying in New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, and more than 20 other Indian cities, demanding fair wages, safe conditions, and protection from extreme heat.

A UNI Global Union survey of 474 Amazon warehouse and delivery workers in India, conducted between June and July, illustrated labor concerns driving this year's actions. Three-quarters of respondents said they or a coworker required medical attention due to heat exposure. More than half reported "extremely hot and unsafe" or "unbearable" working conditions.

The findings come one year after India's Human Rights Commission called for an investigation into labor practices at an Amazon facility near New Delhi, where workers were reportedly discouraged from taking water breaks during a severe heat wave. Amazon workers in India also held protests over this last year.

"No worker should be forced to risk their health — or their life — for Amazon's bottom line," Hoffman said. "Heat protections must be enforceable, and workers themselves must have a say in setting the standards."

Protesters criticize Amazon's environmental impact and ICE ties

Over 1,000 Amazon corporate employees published an open letter criticizing the company's rollout of artificial intelligence. The letter argues that Amazon is abandoning its climate commitments to fund AI infrastructure, citing a $150 billion investment in new data centers despite the company's pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2040.

The employees demanded that Amazon power all data centers with renewable energy, establish worker committees with authority over AI deployment decisions, and refuse to provide AI technology for what they describe as "violence, surveillance, or mass deportation."

The expanded agenda of "Make Amazon Pay" this year emphasizes what organizers call a "techno-authoritarian future" — the convergence of Big Tech companies with authoritarian political forces. The coalition said that Amazon funded Trump's inauguration and that the company's recent filings show it paid $1.4 billion less in taxes.

Outside of Amazon, organizers planned protests across multiple US cities, including Chicago, Newark, New York, Oakland, San Bernardino, and Washington, D.C. Demonstrators are focusing on Amazon's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, demanding the company stop providing infrastructure they say powers the agency's deportation operations.

"Amazon is no longer just a retailer — it is a pillar of a new authoritarian order built on surveillance and exploitation," David Adler, co-general coordinator of the Progressive International, said in a statement. "From ICE raids to the repression of Palestinians, Amazon's technologies are woven into systems of violence worldwide."

Amazon workers call for unionization efforts

In Germany, the services union Verdi coordinated work stoppages at nine logistics facilities, Reuters reported. About 3,000 workers participated, according to the union, which continues to seek a collective bargaining agreement.

Amazon maintains about 40,000 employees at German logistics centers, plus 12,000 additional seasonal hires for the holiday rush. The company told Reuters the walkouts would not affect customer deliveries and that its compensation is competitive.

Additional protests took place in Canada, where CSN, a major trade union, and CTI, an advocate for immigrant workers, held a demonstration in downtown Montreal, calling for a boycott of Amazon.

The protest followed Amazon's closure of several Quebec distribution centers that resulted in 4,500 job losses, CityNews Montreal reported. Union leaders accused Amazon of retaliating against workers' unionization efforts, with one organizer noting the timing between the unionization of a warehouse and Amazon's decision to close facilities in the region.

Other actions occurred in Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Brazil, Bangladesh, Colombia, Denmark, Luxembourg, Poland, Greece, the UK, South Africa, and Gaza.

Amazon workers achieved some union victories in 2025. A warehouse in Delta, British Columbia, has become the first Canadian Amazon facility to gain union representation after labor officials ruled that the company improperly interfered with the organizing campaign. Amazon is contesting the ruling.

Markets are pricing in an 85% chance of a 25 basis point interest rate cut at the US Federal Reserve’s Dec. 10 meeting, up from 39% a week before, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
