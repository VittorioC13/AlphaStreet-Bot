[TITLE]McDonald’s is losing its low-income customers. Economists call it a symptom of the stark wealth divide:
[TEXT]
In the early 2000s, after a severe slump, McDonald’s orchestrated a major turnaround, with the introduction of its Dollar Menu.

The menu, whose items all cost $1, illustrated just how important it was to market to low-income consumers — who value getting the most bang for their buck.

Coming at a time of flagging growth, tumbling stock and the company’s first report of a quarterly loss, the Dollar Menu reversed the fast-food giant’s bad fortune. It paved the way for three years of sales growth at stores open at least a year and ballooned revenue by 33%, news outlets reported at the time.

But no longer.

Industry-wide, fast-food restaurants have seen traffic from one of its core customer bases, low-income households, drop by double digits, McDonald’s chief executive Christopher Kempczinski told investors last week. Meanwhile, traffic from higher earners increased by nearly as much, he said.

The struggle of the Golden Arches in particular — long synonymous with cheap food for the masses — reflects a larger trend upending the consumer economy and makes “affordability” a hot policy topic, experts say.

McDonald’s executives say the higher costs of restaurant essentials, such as beef and salaries, have pushed food prices up and driven away lower-income customers who already are being squeezed by the rising cost of groceries, clothes, rent and child care.

With prices for everything rising, consumer companies concerned

[TITLE]Fast food is losing its low-income customers. Economists call it a symptom of the stark wealth divide:
[TEXT]
At hotel chains, luxury brands are holding up better than low-budget options. Revenue at brands including Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis is up 2.9% this year, while economy hotels experienced a 3.1% decline for the same period, according to industry tracker CoStar.

Josephson and other economists say the shrinking traffic of low-income consumers is emblematic of a larger trend of Americans diverging in their spending, with wealthier customers flexing their purchasing power and lower-income shoppers pulling back — what some call a "K-shaped economy."

"Happy Meals at McDonald's are prohibitively expensive for some people, because there's been so much inflation," Josephson said.

India’s food delivery and quick commerce (QC) sectors are entering another phase of heightened competition after a brief period of rationalization, as leading players ramp up promotional campaigns and spending to capture market share. However, unlike the intense cash burn witnessed in late FY25, the current cycle is expected to be more measured, supported by operating leverage and improving unit economics Over the past two quarters, profitability in both food delivery (FD) and QC segments improved amid slower dark-store expansion and disciplined discounting. That trend, however, appears to be reversing. With fresh capital infusions and renewed marketing pushes—including nationwide “no-fee” campaigns and brand refresh initiatives—industry competition is expected to intensify once again.Despite these developments, analysts note that this phase differs from the earlier land-grab cycle. Dark-store additions are likely to be much lower, with new launches estimated to moderate by nearly 90 percent compared to last year’s aggressive buildout. Most newly opened stores are already past their breakeven phase of four to six months, paving the way for incremental throughput and margin improvement. For major platforms, throughput—measured as daily orders per store—is projected to rise by roughly 30 percent over the next four quarters, offering a key cushion against rising promotional expenses.The FD market continues to consolidate as a stable duopoly, with gross order value (GOV) growth expected to remain robust at 20–22 percent annually over FY26–27. High user stickiness and consistent take rates underpin a healthy medium-term outlook for the segment, supported by operating leverage and steady consumer demand.In contrast, QC remains a more volatile but fast-growing category. The industry setup resembles the previous cycle, but with lower burn intensity and faster normalization in contribution margins. Efficiency improvements—from better dark-store utilization to higher average order values—are expected to accelerate profitability recovery.Overall, while renewed discounting could temporarily pressure margins, the sector’s structural fundamentals appear intact. With a more disciplined expansion strategy, rising throughput, and strong consumer adoption, the food delivery and quick commerce markets are positioned for sustainable, medium-term growth even amid competitive resurgence. Eternal is witnessing strong momentum as it shifts to an inventory-led model, driving a sharp 90 percent quarter-on-quarter and 183 percent year-on-year surge in net revenue through full-value recognition of goods sold. Its quick commerce arm delivered exceptional performance in 2QFY26, with monthly order value up 137 percent year-on-year, aided by scale-up and store expansion. Contribution margins improved from 3.9 to 4.6 percent, supported by the inventory model that now contributes around 80 percent of order value, lifting gross margins. Franchise and e-commerce revenues are also gaining traction, underscoring a scalable business mix. Despite higher marketing spends, consolidated EBITDA margins improved, reflecting early operating leverage. Eternal’s diversified model and Blinkit’s growth potential position it well for sustained value creation.Swiggy’s medium-term outlook remains positive, driven by improving efficiency and operating leverage across food delivery and quick commerce. In 2QFY26, the company halved its cash burn quarter-on-quarter through tighter cost control, targeted marketing, and optimized incentives. Management expects quick commerce breakeven by 1QFY27, supported by higher dark-store throughput and rising average order values. Non-grocery categories now form 26 percent of gross order value, aiding margin stability and diversification. Food delivery profitability continues to improve, reinforcing structural gains in unit economics. The planned ₹100 billion fundraise enhances financial flexibility to sustain growth amid renewed competition. With better visibility on profitability, disciplined capital use, and a resilient operating model, Swiggy is well placed for long-term value creation.(The author is Head – Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd : Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

[TITLE]Tesla deploys its first Superchargers owned by 3rd-party in the US:
[TEXT]
Tesla has officially deployed its first Supercharger station owned by a third party in the US, a step in the automaker’s effort to accelerate the charging infrastructure growth while reducing capital expenditure.

The new station, located at a Suncoast Charging in Land O’Lakes, Florida, consists of 8 stalls and is now open to the public.

While Tesla has previously sold Supercharger hardware to other networks – most notably BP Pulse back in 2023 – this site represents a different model.

The station is owned by the host but fully managed by Tesla, meaning it appears and functions exactly like any other Supercharger in the navigation system and app, maintaining the seamless user experience Tesla owners, and now non-Tesla owners, are used to.

Tesla’s official charging account confirmed the deployment in a post on X today:

[TITLE]Reliance Retail brings in Carrefour veteran to sharpen grocery play:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: Reliance Retail has hired former Carrefour executive Guillaume de Colonges to oversee its grocery business, in a sign he could potentially succeed Damodar Mall, the current chief executive of the company’s grocery retail division.

The move comes as the retail arm of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) prepares for an initial public offering, likely in 2027 or 2028. The retail business is currently valued at around $100 billion, according to an October 13 report by Axis Securities.

Colonges, who formerly served as chief commercial officer at Carrefour, was hired earlier this year, according to people in the know.

Carrefour is a French retail group that operates a network of more than 14,000 multi-format stores across over 40 countries. Its formats include hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, and cash-and-carry, or wholesale, outlets. The Carrefour Group is one of the world leaders in food commerce.

Mall is a retail industry veteran. He has worked in large companies such as Hindustan Unilever and was also part of the Future Group, where he held various leadership roles including the director of food strategy. He was a core member of Future Group founder Kishore Biyani’s team.

Mall joined Reliance Retail in 2013, and currently leads the grocery business.

Colonges is being groomed for a larger role, said the people cited earlier. “He is trying to get a full understanding of the B2B (business-to-business) and consumer-facing businesses, including stores and some parts of online. The focus is to improve the overall store experience and bring in more of his international expertise to create a better offline shopping experience,” one of the persons cited earlier said.

There is no indication yet of when Mall plans to step down, this person said.

Queries sent to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the parent of Reliance Retail, did not elicit a response.

The move to appoint Colonges looks like an attempt to up the game in retail, said an equity analyst speaking to Mint on the condition of anonymity.

"However, modern retail in India retail is very different versus global retail because there are many India's within India. Retail also requires very close grassroots level knowledge of consumer habits in India,” this analyst said.

Colonges has held several country CEO roles, including CEO of Carrefour Turkey, and CEO of Carrefour Malaysia and Singapore. He has over 30 years of experience in the retail industry.

Reliance Retail operates multiple business verticals led by separate CEOs, including Akhilesh Prasad (president and CEO fashion and lifestyle), Sandeep Varaganti (CEO, JioMart), and Brian Bade (Reliance Digital).

V. Subramaniam is the managing director of Reliance Retail Ltd.

Reliance Retail is the largest retailer in India, with businesses spanning consumer electronics, grocery, fashion and lifestyle, and connectivity (selling SIM cards, mobile phones, tablets etc). In FY25, its revenue from operations stood at ₹2.91 trillion. The business reported an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of ₹25,094 crore, up 8.6% year-on-year.

India's total retail market was estimated at $1.15 trillion in 2025, according to Deloitte. This is expected to swell to $1.8 trillion by 2030. Grocery continues to command the largest share of retail spending in the country, followed by apparel, accessories and footwear—the broader fashion segment.

It operates small-format grocery stores and supermarkets under Reliance Smart, Reliance Smart Bazaar (including stores acquired from the Future Group), Fresh Signature, Freshpik, and Metro Cash & Carry, along with JioMart, its online grocery platform.

RIL does not give a break-up of its store count, but operates close to 5,000 outlets under the grocery category.

Some of the formats under the grocery business also sell general merchandise, apart from offering their own private labels in segments such as snacks and home care.

As of the September quarter, the company operated 19,821 stores in total.

In 2020, RIL acquired the retail, wholesale, logistics, and warehousing businesses from Kishore Biyani’s Future Group for ₹24,713 crore. This acquisition gave Reliance access to hundreds of stores across Future Group’s Big Bazaar, FBB, Easyday, Central, and Foodhall formats. It converted these into its own existing brands, while shuttering some. In 2023, it also acquired German wholesale retailer Metro Cash & Carry's India business for ₹2,850 crore.

To be sure, small kirana stores still dominate India’s grocery landscape, modern retail—where Reliance is a key player—accounts for 23.5% of the value share of packaged consumer goods across more than 50 cities as of the September quarter, according to NielsenIQ.

Reliance competes with the likes of DMart, Samara Capital-backed More Retail, Amazon, Spencer's Retail, and Lulu Hypermarket. DMart operates 415 stores, while its revenue from operations stood at ₹57,790 crore in FY25.

Reliance Retail undertook consolidation last fiscal, shutting several large-format grocery and fashion stores to pivot towards smaller formats. The company invested ₹33,696 crore in FY2024–25—up 37.5% year-on-year—towards store expansion, consumer-goods acquisitions, warehousing and retail infrastructure.

It closed last fiscal with 19,340 stores, a 2.7% increase compared to the previous year, however, total retail area declined to 77.4 million sq. ft. from 79.1 million sq. ft. due to the rationalisation of larger spaces. Having completed this consolidation phase, Reliance Retail has returned to expansion, adding 412 stores in the September quarter of the current fiscal.

[TITLE]Nvidia Might Be the Stock Story of the Day—But Walmart's Shares Are Rising Even More:
[TEXT]
Key Takeaways Walmart beat estimates Thursday in its latest earnings report, and lifted its full-year sales and profit forecasts.

The retailer is also moving its stock listing to the Nasdaq. Shares of the retailer jumped in recent trading.

Shares of Walmart jumped Thursday, putting them among the S&P 500's top gainers, after the company reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street's estimates and boosted its outlook.

Walmart (WMT) earned an adjusted $0.62 per share in the third quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, 2 cents above the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Revenue rose 5.8% from the same time a year ago to $179.5 billion, $2 billion more than analysts had forecast. Walmart's comparable sales rose by 4.2%, just above the analyst estimate. Walmart's e-commerce sales rose 27%, and the company's advertising revenue grew 53%.

The company also lifted its full-year outlook for sales and adjusted EPS. Revenue is expected to rise 4.8% to 5.1% in the full fiscal year, up from 3.75% to 4.75% previously, and adjusted EPS is now forecast at $2.58 to $2.63, up slightly from the prior range of $2.52 to $2.62.

The numbers are a sign that American consumers continue to spend as the holiday selling season picks up steam. Walmart shares were up 6% in recent trading, working their way back in the direction of recent highs after a late-October slide. Since the start of the year, they have gained nearly 15%.

Why This Matters For You As the largest retailer in the U.S., Walmart is uniquely positioned to provide insights into the health of the American consumer, like recent quarters when it has said more higher-income consumers are shopping at its stores.

JPMorgan analysts said that despite some concerns—like grocery sales and what it considered a cautious outlook—they "don’t see a lot of change from what WMT has been posting" for the last several quarters.

Last week, Walmart announced that CEO Doug McMillon will step down from his role at the end of January after serving as CEO since February 2014. John Furner, CEO of Walmart U.S., will take over the top job at the retailer.

The retail giant also said Thursday that it is moving its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq exchange, keeping its "WMT" ticker and expecting to make the move by Dec. 9. "Moving to Nasdaq aligns with the people-led, tech-powered approach to our long-term strategy," CFO John David Rainey said in Thursday's announcement.

Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner said Walmart could also be motivated by a potential inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, the stock index that tracks the 100 largest companies on the Nasdaq, "which continues to see consistent capital inflows, which could buoy the stock higher."

[TITLE]Flipkart fintech super.money preps buy-now-pay-later play:
[TEXT]
Flipkart-backed UPI app super.money is preparing a fresh push into buy now, pay later (BNPL) by partnering regulated banks and lenders, as it hunts for its next leg of growth beyond credit on UPI, according to two people aware of the plans.

The company is looking to compete with existing checkout-finance players such as Axio and Snapmint in the tightly contested intersection of e-commerce and lending, said the first person, asking not to be named as the product is still under development.

“Once it is fully built, the launch will have two parts," this person added. “One is to offer super.money as a checkout option on e-commerce sites, and the other is to bring an e-commerce layer inside the app itself with BNPL-style financing at checkout."

The second person said the broader idea is to position super.money as a one-stop destination for e-commerce journeys supported by credit, so that users can move from discovery to payment in a single, smooth flow on its interface.

Mint could not independently ascertain a firm timeline for the launch. However, the two people cited above said the BNPL product is currently in development and testing, and is expected to go live only after the company completes tighter KYC and other regulatory checks that apply to this category.

This emerging category, where BNPL is offered as a checkout option across commerce sites, is not new. Companies such as Snapmint, which raised

[TITLE]Italy Embedded Finance Business Report 2025-2030: Scalapay, Fabrick, Telepass, Satispay, Yolo Group, and Opyn Drive Italy's Expanding Embedded Finance Ecosystem:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Italy Embedded Finance Market Size & Forecast by Value and Volume Across 100+ KPIs by Business Models, Distribution Models, End-Use Sectors, and Key Verticals (Payments, Lending, Insurance, Banking, Wealth) - Databook Q4 2025 Update" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The embedded finance market in Italy is expected to grow by 7.1% on an annual basis to reach US$11.96 billion by 2025. The embedded finance market in the country has experienced robust growth during 2021-2025, achieving a CAGR of 10.3%. This upward trajectory is expected to continue, with the market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% from 2026 to 2030. By the end of 2030, the embedded finance market is projected to expand from its 2024 value of US$11.17 billion to approximately US$14.51 billion.

Across lending, insurance, payments, and mobility, embedded finance in Italy is evolving through sector-specific use cases rather than horizontal platforms. Fintech adoption remains moderate compared to peers like Germany or France, but Italy's regulatory alignment with EU digital finance reforms, coupled with growing digital consumption patterns, is driving steady momentum. Over the next 2-4 years, expect Italy's embedded finance landscape to intensify in vertical depth especially in SME lending, lifestyle insurance, and urban mobility while broader integration across banking and retail ecosystems continues to develop.

B2B Embedded Lending Is Expanding Among Italian SMEs

Embedded lending solutions are increasingly being adopted in Italy's B2B segment, particularly by small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking faster access to credit within the platforms they already use for procurement or invoicing. For instance, Credimi a digital lender focused on SMEs has been collaborating with ecosystem platforms to offer credit products directly at the point of need. Italian marketplaces and procurement platforms are also embedding credit solutions into supplier portals to ease working capital friction.

The key driver is the longstanding credit gap faced by SMEs in Italy, often due to traditional underwriting delays by banks. The digitization of B2B workflows through platforms like TeamSystem and Fatture in Cloud creates a natural entry point for embedded lending providers. The 2023 EIB Investment Survey showed persistent financing obstacles among Italian SMEs, reinforcing demand for more integrated and responsive credit access.

This trend is likely to intensify, with embedded B2B lending expected to expand across vertical SaaS platforms and digital invoicing ecosystems. The growth of e-invoicing, coupled with EU-backed digital finance reforms, will accelerate API-based integration of lending products into ERP and supplier systems.

Embedded Insurance Solutions Are Targeting Mobility and Lifestyle Use Cases

Embedded insurance is gaining traction across mobility, travel, and electronics retail in Italy. Companies such as Telepass are embedding micro-insurance offerings (e.g., accident or breakdown protection) within subscription and tolling services. Similarly, e-commerce platforms like Unieuro and MediaWorld embed extended warranty products within checkout flows for consumer electronics.

The rise of on-demand consumption in Italy, particularly in urban centers, is increasing demand for low-ticket, bundled coverage options. Italian consumers are also showing growing willingness to adopt usage-based or pay-per-use models, which aligns well with embedded insurance tied to specific products or experiences. Regulatory flexibility introduced by IVASS (Italy's insurance regulator) around digital insurance distribution is another enabler.

The embedded insurance market is expected to stabilize but diversify in terms of use cases. With further regulatory clarity from IVASS and deeper partnerships between insurers and digital platforms, the next growth wave will likely involve lifestyle insurance embedded into fintech apps, ticketing platforms, or subscription services.

BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) Embedded Into Retail and E-Commerce Ecosystems

BNPL adoption is growing steadily in Italy through integration with both online and in-store retail platforms. Scalapay remains a dominant player, offering pay-in-three options at checkout across major fashion and lifestyle brands such as Calzedonia and Liu Jo. Klarna and PayPal also maintain strong merchant partnerships across Italian e-commerce, embedding BNPL within payments flows.

The key driver is demand from younger consumers for flexible, short-term credit options without traditional bank friction. Italian e-commerce continues to grow post-pandemic, and embedded BNPL offers a frictionless upsell tool for merchants. Payment service providers are incentivized to include BNPL options as a value-added feature in merchant integration packages.

The embedded BNPL market is expected to intensify, with new models (e.g., B2B BNPL or invoice factoring) emerging alongside consumer use cases. Tighter scrutiny by the Bank of Italy on consumer protection may reshape disclosure requirements, but the underlying demand for embedded checkout financing is unlikely to taper.

Fintech-Bank Collaborations Are Accelerating Embedded Finance Integration

Banks in Italy are increasingly partnering with fintechs and technology providers to integrate embedded finance use cases especially in areas such as digital payments, personal finance tools, and card-linked services. For example, Fabrick (a Banca Sella initiative) continues to expand its API marketplace for third-party integration, supporting embedded finance across multiple touchpoints.

Italian banks face competitive pressure from both domestic fintechs and European neobanks. Collaborating through API layers allows banks to remain relevant in the value chain while outsourcing innovation. Regulatory encouragement of open finance under PSD2 and the upcoming PSD3 has further accelerated interest in embedded models that rely on bank-fintech partnerships.

This trend will intensify as Italy prepares for PSD3 and digital identity frameworks under the EU Digital Finance Strategy. More banks are expected to adopt platform-based models, enabling embedded offerings such as personalized savings nudges, loyalty-linked payments, or embedded credit scoring within third-party apps.

Mobility and Smart City Platforms Are Testing Embedded Payments and Tolling

Embedded finance is being piloted in Italy's urban mobility sector, especially in the integration of toll payments, fuel cards, and transport services. Telepass has expanded its embedded tolling and micro-payment features across public and private transport networks. Similarly, startups like Satispay are embedding payments within mobility platforms, including parking and charging stations.

The development of smart cities, increasing adoption of mobility-as-a-service (MaaS), and Italy's decarbonization commitments are pushing cities and operators to unify payments across modes of transport. Consumer preference for seamless mobility experiences especially in cities like Milan and Rome further supports this evolution.

The embedded payments trend in mobility will likely accelerate, supported by EU-level smart mobility funding and digital infrastructure upgrades. Multi-service embedded wallets and single-click checkout for tolls, parking, and transit could become more mainstream, especially as municipal-level partnerships mature.

Embedded Finance Activity Is Increasing but Remains Concentrated in Specific Verticals

Embedded finance in Italy is still in a growth phase, with activity largely concentrated in retail payments, SME lending, and digital insurance. While the ecosystem is less saturated than in Northern Europe, competition is intensifying in areas like Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) and embedded B2B credit. The maturity of Italy's digital infrastructure and moderate fintech adoption rates have resulted in a market led by a few dominant platforms often tied to banks or telcos rather than a broad set of digital-native disruptors.

Unlike markets with high fintech proliferation, Italy's embedded finance landscape is being shaped by hybrid entities such as Fabrick that operate both as enablers and service providers. This structure has kept competitive intensity moderate, but concentrated, with increased collaboration between incumbent banks and API-centric fintechs.

The market is expected to diversify, particularly as embedded models extend into mobility, utilities, and enterprise software platforms. However, a few dominant infrastructure enablers are likely to maintain control over core payment and lending rails unless major new entrants disrupt the stack.

Key Players Span Fintechs, Banks, Telcos, and Sector-Focused Platforms

Scalapay remains a prominent player in the embedded BNPL segment, operating with merchant integrations across e-commerce and fashion verticals.

Fabrick, owned by Banca Sella, functions both as a fintech and a middleware API platform, powering embedded finance offerings across partners such as Nexi and Enel X.

Telepass, traditionally a toll operator, has broadened into embedded finance with micro-insurance, payments, and mobility-linked financial products.

Satispay, a mobile payments startup, has expanded its in-app payment capabilities across everyday merchant categories, embedding finance into retail and transport flows.

Newer startups and sector-specific SaaS platforms are entering the embedded lending and insurance markets, including players like Yolo Group (embedded digital insurance) and Opyn (digital SME lending). These firms are building API-first products that integrate directly into retail, travel, and e-invoicing platforms.

A handful of infrastructure-layer players especially Fabrick are expected to anchor the growth of embedded finance in Italy, while use-case-specific players in insurance, lending, and payments expand across sector platforms.
