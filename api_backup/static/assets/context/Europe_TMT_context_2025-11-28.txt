[TITLE]Nvidia’s Q3 earnings call says the AI boom is the future. Here’s how it could reshape your money, job and life:
[TEXT]
Nvidia’s Q3 fiscal 2026 earnings didn’t just mark another monster quarter, they marked a turning point. The company used its earnings call to make something very clear: the AI surge isn’t slowing, and it isn’t a hype-fueled bubble. It’s the start of a multi-year infrastructure build-out that could reshape the global economy.

Revenue hit $57 billion, up 62% year over year, and a record sequential revenue growth of $10 billion. Nvidia’s newest AI platforms is so strong that CFO Colette Kress said, “Demand for AI infrastructure continues to exceed our expectations” (1). Behind the numbers, the company outlined a future where AI hardware is becoming as essential as roads, utilities and cloud computing.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP

CEO Jensen Huang went even further, saying the shift from generative AI to “agentic” and physical AI will be “revolutionary,” powering new industries, new business models and entirely new kinds of applications. Nvidia now sees more than $500 billion in visibility for its next-generation GPUs through 2026, not just from Big Tech, but from governments, enterprises and AI factories around the world.

For Americans trying to understand what all this means, Nvidia’s message lands with real implications. If the company is right, AI will quietly run the systems that touch your job, your money and your daily routines — not years from now, but starting now.

AI boom, not a bubble

To Nvidia, the AI boom isn’t inflating toward a burst, it’s the foundation of an AI infrastructure cycle that’s only just beginning.

CEO Jensen Huang said, “The transition to generative AI is transformational and necessary, supercharging existing applications and business models. The transition to agentic and physical AI will be revolutionary, giving rise to new applications, companies, products, and services.”

The scale is staggering. Nvidia says it now has roughly $500 billion of visibility for its Blackwell and Rubin GPU platforms through 2026, showing strong demand not just from cloud giants but also from broader enterprise projects (2). Basically, the company is laying the foundation for AI infrastructure as essential as roads or power grids.

It’s not just about tech companies getting richer. AI is quietly running behind the scenes in medicine, banking, transportation, and retail, automating workflows and making decisions (3). Nvidia sees a future where intelligent systems are woven into entire industries.

[TITLE]Data Centers, AI, and Energy: Everything You Need to Know:
[TEXT]
The primary bottleneck for AI expansion has shifted from power generation to physical infrastructure, with long lead times for grid upgrades, a global transformer shortage, and geopolitical vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chain (copper, lithium, rare earth elements) creating acute risks.

Despite major tech companies' net-zero pledges, the sheer velocity of the AI buildout forces a reliance on reliable baseload power from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas through 2030, with nuclear power viewed as the long-term, carbon-free solution.

The exponential energy demand of AI-driven data centers, particularly from high-performance accelerated servers (GPUs and ASICs), is rapidly outpacing global energy efficiency trends, leading to a projected doubling of data center electricity consumption by 2030.

For the past decade, the defining narrative of the global energy sector has been the transition of supply. Governments, utilities, and investors have focused almost exclusively on shifting generation assets from fossil fuels to renewables, retiring coal plants in favor of wind farms and solar arrays....

The narrative for the next decade, however, is currently being rewritten by a structural shift in demand that few predicted would happen this quickly: the exponential rise of the data center.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) transitions from theoretical models in research labs to wide-scale commercial deployment, data centers have evolved. They are no longer passive warehouses for email storage and website hosting; they are now active, energy-intensive industrial engines. These facilities have become the "refineries" of the digital age, processing raw data into economic value, and in doing so, they are exerting unprecedented pressure on electricity grids, water resources, and critical mineral supply chains.

The implications for the energy market are profound. We are witnessing a collision between the digital economy's exponential growth curve and the physical economy's linear constraints. This guide provides a comprehensive analysis of how data centers utilize resources, the specific energy mixes powering them across different geopolitical regions, and the systemic risks posed by the integration of hyperscale compute infrastructure with legacy power grids.

Part I: The Anatomy of Consumption

To understand the macro-level impact of the sector on global energy markets, it is necessary to first understand the micro-level physics of the data center itself. These facilities are complex aggregations of IT equipment, environmental controls, and power management systems, each with distinct energy profiles that contribute to the total load.

From CPU to GPU and Custom Silicon

The fundamental driver of increasing energy density is the changing nature of the silicon chip. For decades, the industry relied on Central Processing Units (CPUs) for general-purpose computing. While powerful, CPUs operate within a relatively predictable energy envelope. The rise of Generative AI has necessitated a wholesale shift toward "accelerated servers."

The GPU Explosion

The initial phase of the AI infrastructure buildout has been defined by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). To understand the energy implications, one must understand the architecture. A traditional CPU is designed to do a few complex tasks very quickly in sequence. A GPU, conversely, is designed to do thousands of simple mathematical tasks simultaneously. Since AI training is effectively one giant matrix multiplication problem, the GPU is exponentially more efficient at the task than a CPU.

However, this computational density comes at a severe thermodynamic cost. As the industry packs more transistors onto silicon wafers to process larger models, the power draw per chip has skyrocketed. We have moved from an era of "general purpose" computing to "high-performance" computing, where energy consumption is the primary constraint on performance.

The market for these high-performance chips is currently dominated by a few key players driving the energy intensity of the sector:

Nvidia H100 "Hopper": Currently the industry standard for AI training. A single H100 chip can consume up to 700 watts at peak utilization. When installed in a server rack of 8 to 16 GPUs, the power density exceeds anything legacy data centers were built to handle.

Nvidia B200 "Blackwell": The next-generation architecture. It promises massive performance gains but raises the thermal stakes significantly, with a single chip capable of drawing up to 1,200 watts.

AMD Instinct MI300X: The primary competitor to Nvidia, offering high-density memory configurations that also require significant power and cooling infrastructure.

The deployment of these chips is fundamentally altering the physical requirements of the data center building. A legacy server rack typically draws 5 to 10 kilowatts (kW) of power. A modern rack packed with Blackwell or H100 GPUs can draw between 50 and 100 kW.

This tenfold increase in power density forces a transition from air cooling (fans blowing over metal heatsinks) to liquid cooling. Air is simply not a dense enough medium to carry away the waste heat generated by a 100kW rack. Consequently, the next generation of data centers is being plumbed like industrial chemical plants, with coolant loops running directly to the silicon die to prevent thermal throttling.

The Hyperscaler Rebellion

As energy constraints tighten and power costs rise, the major technology giants—the "Hyperscalers"—are seeking to reduce their dependence on general-purpose GPUs. While GPUs are excellent for AI, they still include legacy graphics logic that AI models do not need. This "silicon bloat" equates to wasted watts.

To solve this, companies are evolving toward Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These are custom chips designed from the ground up to do exactly one thing: run neural networks. By stripping away general-purpose features, these chips achieve significantly higher performance per watt, allowing data center operators to get more compute out of the same grid connection.

The major players have all launched proprietary silicon strategies:

Google (TPU): Google’s Tensor Processing Units are the veterans of this space. The latest 6th-generation "Trillium" TPU is explicitly engineered for energy efficiency, offering a 67% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the previous generation.

AWS (Trainium & Inferentia): Amazon Web Services has bifurcated its silicon. Trainium is built for the heavy lift of training models, while Inferentia is designed for the low-cost, low-energy task of "inference" (running the model for end-users).

Microsoft (Maia): Microsoft has introduced the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator, custom-designed to run large language models on the Azure cloud. It features a unique "sidekick" liquid cooling setup that fits into existing data center footprints.

Meta (MTIA): The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator is designed specifically for Meta's recommendation algorithms, optimizing for the specific math heavily used in social media ranking rather than generative text.

This shift toward ASICs represents the industrialization of AI. Just as the automotive industry moved from general workshops to specialized assembly lines, the data center industry is moving from general-purpose servers to specialized AI pods.

These custom chips allow Hyperscalers to decouple their growth from the broader supply chain constraints of the merchant GPU market. More importantly, they allow for a holistic system design. Because Google designs the TPU, the server rack, the cooling loop, and the data center shell, they can optimize the cooling flow to match the exact thermal profile of the chip, squeezing out efficiency gains that are impossible with off-the-shelf hardware.

Beyond the Silicon Limit

Looking further ahead, the industry recognizes that even custom silicon has a physical limit. As transistors shrink to the size of atoms, electrical resistance creates heat that cannot be easily mitigated. To break this energy curve, R&D labs are exploring exotic architectures that abandon traditional electronics entirely.

Two specific technologies are currently moving from theory to prototype:

Silicon Photonics: Current chips use copper wires to move data. Copper has resistance, which generates heat. Companies like Lightmatter and Ayar Labs are replacing copper with light (photons). Light generates virtually no heat compared to electricity and travels faster, potentially solving the data movement energy bottleneck that currently plagues large clusters.

Neuromorphic Computing: Traditional computers separate memory and processing, wasting energy moving data back and forth (the Von Neumann bottleneck). Neuromorphic chips are designed to mimic the human brain’s architecture, using "spiking neural networks" where processing and memory happen in the same location. These promise orders-of-magnitude reductions in power for specific sensory processing tasks.

This architectural pivot from CPU to accelerated silicon—and eventually to photonics—is not merely a technical detail; it is creating a two-speed energy market. The "old" internet of email and web hosting will continue to run on efficient, low-growth CPU servers. The "new" economy of AI will run on power-hungry accelerated infrastructure.

According to 2024 data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), this split is already visible in the data. Conventional servers are projected to see electricity consumption grow at a modest rate of 9 percent annually. In stark contrast, electricity consumption for accelerated servers (GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs) is projected to grow by 30 percent annually. By 2030, these accelerated servers will account for almost half of the net increase in global data center electricity consumption.

The Breakdown of Power Usage

A data center’s electricity consumption is distributed across five primary categories. Understanding this breakdown is critical for investors and analysts trying to identify where efficiency gains—and energy wastes—are located.

Source: IEA

Servers: Servers account for approximately 60 percent of total demand in a modern facility. This is the electricity actually doing the "work" of computation. As chip density increases, this percentage is rising relative to auxiliary systems, meaning the grid is becoming more directly coupled to the computational workload. When an AI model is training, the load is constant and high; when it is idle, it drops. This variability introduces new challenges for grid operators accustomed to steady industrial loads.

Cooling and Environmental Control: Cooling represents the single largest variable in data center efficiency, accounting for anywhere between 7 percent and 30 percent of total electricity intake. This massive variance highlights a divided market.

"Hyperscale" data centers—those massive campuses owned by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft—utilize advanced techniques to keep cooling demands near that 7 percent floor. They employ hot-aisle containment, free-air cooling, and increasingly, direct-to-chip liquid cooling. The shift to TPUs and high-end GPUs has made water cooling a necessity rather than a luxury, as air alone can no longer dissipate the heat generated by modern silicon.

In contrast, smaller enterprise data centers and legacy facilities are far less efficient. Many of these older facilities burn up to 30 percent of their total electricity intake just fighting the laws of thermodynamics, using energy-intensive air conditioners to keep servers from overheating. This sector is also the primary driver of water usage in data centers.

Storage, Network, and Infrastructure: The remainder of the power wedge is split between storage systems (5 percent), network equipment like switches and routers (5 percent), and general infrastructure like lighting and physical security. While individually small, the sheer volume of data being retained for AI training datasets means that storage energy demands are growing in absolute terms.

This internal distribution of energy—heavily weighted toward the silicon itself—explains why the industry is so focused on chip efficiency. Every watt saved at the server level cascades through the system, reducing the need for cooling, power distribution, and backup infrastructure. However, as the breakdown illustrates, the "low hanging fruit" of cooling efficiency has largely been harvested by the hyperscalers. The next frontier of efficiency gains must come from the compute load itself.

Ultimately, understanding the micro-level physics of the server rack is only the first step. While an individual GPU or TPU is a marvel of engineering, the aggregation of millions of these chips into global fleets creates a macro-economic force. The efficiency gains at the chip level are currently being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of deployment, leading us from the physics of the rack to the physics of the grid.

To grasp the full impact on global energy markets, we must move beyond the walls of the facility and look at the aggregate demand these components are placing on national power systems. The internal struggle between heat and compute is now spilling over into a global struggle for capacity.

Part II: The Scale of Demand

Data centers currently occupy a relatively small niche in global energy usage compared to heavy industry or transportation, but their growth velocity is outpacing almost every other sector in the global economy.

Current Baseline and Future Trajectories

In 2024, global data centers consumed an estimated 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. To put that in perspective, 415 TWh is roughly equivalent to the total annual electricity consumption of France. This represents approximately 1.5% of global electricity consumption. While this figure may appear marginal to the casual observer, the rate of change indicates a looming crunch.

Over the last five years, consumption has grown at 12 percent annually. Looking forward to 2030, the IEA projects this demand to accelerate, outlining three distinct scenarios that market watchers should monitor.

The Base Case: In the most likely scenario, global electricity consumption for data centers is projected to double, reaching roughly 945 TWh by 2030. In this future, the sector would consume just under 3 percent of the world’s total electricity. This doubling in just six years would require the addition of power generation capacity roughly equivalent to the entire current grid of Germany.

The "Lift-Off" Case: This scenario assumes that current supply chain constraints are resolved rapidly and that AI adoption accelerates unchecked by regulation or economics. Under these conditions, demand could surge to 1,700 TWh by 2035—consuming nearly 4.5 percent of the world's electricity. This would place data centers on par with the energy footprint of the entire country of India.

The Headwinds Case: Conversely, if technical bottlenecks, geopolitical fracturing, or slow AI adoption prevail, demand may plateau around 700 TWh. Even in this conservative view, the sector remains a massive industrial consumer, but one that stays below 2 percent of global demand.

Source: IEA

The Carbon Footprint

Beyond raw electricity usage, the carbon implications are significant. Today, data centers account for roughly 180 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 emissions annually, which is roughly 0.5% of global energy-related emissions. While this is currently lower than aviation or shipping, the trajectory is steeper.

If the "Lift-Off" scenario comes to pass, these emissions could rise to 1.4% of the global total. While hyperscalers are offsetting this with renewable purchases, the "location-based" emissions (the actual carbon emitted by the local grid powering the facility) often remain higher than the "market-based" emissions (the net figure after offsets). This discrepancy is key for ESG investors: a data center in a coal-heavy region like Inner Mongolia or West Virginia has a physical carbon footprint that no amount of paper credits can fully erase.

The End of the Efficiency Era

Regardless of which scenario plays out, the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Contextualizing the Surge

Regardless of which scenario plays out—Base, Lift-Off, or Headwinds—the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition, creating a wedge of new demand that the grid was not built to accommodate.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Part III: The Energy Mix and Carbon Reality

There is a significant divergence between the stated decarbonization goals of major technology companies and the physical reality of the grids powering their facilities. Most hyperscalers have aggressive "Net Zero" targets, often aiming to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2030. However, the physical electrons flowing into their servers largely come from fossil fuels and will likely continue to do so through the medium term due to the mechanics of baseload power.

Source: IEA

1. Coal

Despite global efforts to phase out coal, it remains the silent workhorse of the digital economy. Coal is currently the largest single source of electricity for data centers globally, accounting for approximately 30 percent of the sector's power.

This reliance is heavily skewed by geography, specifically China. As the world's second-largest market for data infrastructure, China derives nearly 70 percent of its data center power from coal. However, even in Western markets, the baseload requirements of data centers often necessitate reliance on grid mixes that still contain coal generation, particularly during periods of low renewable output. The IEA projects that while coal's share will eventually decline, it will remain a critical pillar of supply until at least 2035, challenging the "green" narrative of the AI revolution.

2. Natural Gas

Natural gas currently meets 26 percent of global data center demand, but its role is arguably more critical than the raw percentage suggests. Gas is expected to be a primary beneficiary of the AI boom in the short term, particularly in North America.

Data centers operate on a standard of "five nines" (99.999%) of reliability. A power outage is not an inconvenience; it is a catastrophic financial event. Intermittent renewables like wind and solar cannot yet provide this level of uptime without massive battery storage, which is not yet deployed at sufficient scale. Consequently, natural gas serves as the dispatchable generation source of choice.

In the United States, natural gas is already the largest fuel source for data centers, accounting for over 40 percent of demand. Between 2024 and 2030, natural gas and coal combined are expected to meet over 40 percent of the additional electricity demand generated by data centers. For natural gas investors, the data center boom represents a new, durable source of industrial demand that is largely price-insensitive.

3. Renewables

[TITLE]Comcast to pay $1.5M fine for vendor breach affecting 270K customers:
[TEXT]
Comcast will pay a $1.5 million fine to settle a Federal Communications Commission investigation into a February 2024 vendor data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 275,000 customers.

The breach occurred in February 2024, when attackers hacked into the systems of Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collector Comcast had stopped using two years earlier.

The FCBS data breach was initially believed to have affected 1.9 million people in total, but the tally was raised to 3.2 million in June and, finally, to 4.2 million in July.

FBCS, which filed for bankruptcy before revealing a data breach in August 2024, notified Comcast on July 15 (five months after the attack) that customer data had been compromised, affecting 273,703 Comcast customers. Previously, it had assured Comcast in March that the breach did not affect any of its customers.

The threat actors stole personal and financial information between February 14 and February 26, including the names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and Comcast account numbers of affected current and former customers. Affected customers had used Comcast's Xfinity-branded internet, television, streaming, VoIP, and home security services.

Under the consent decree announced by the FCC on Monday, Comcast has also agreed to implement a compliance plan that includes enhanced vendor oversight to protect data and ensure customer privacy, ensuring its vendors properly dispose of customer information they no longer need for business purposes, as required by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984.

The telecommunications giant must also appoint a compliance officer, conduct risk assessments of vendors handling customer data every two years, file compliance reports with the FCC every six months over the next three years, and report any material violations within 30 days of discovery.

However, Comcast said in a statement to Reuters that it "was not responsible for and has not conceded any wrongdoing in connection with this incident," noting that its network wasn't breached and that FBCS was contractually required to comply with security requirements.

A Comcast spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer.

Comcast is an American mass media, telecommunications, and entertainment multinational company, and the fourth-largest telecom firm in the world by revenue, after AT&T, Verizon, and China Mobile.

It also has over 182,000 employees, hundreds of millions of customers worldwide, and reported revenues of $123.7 billion in 2024.

[TITLE]Naoris Ventures Outlines Cross-Sectoral Mission to Drive Real-World Deployment of Post-Quantum Technology:
[TEXT]
Porto, Portugal / Wilmington, DE , Nov. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Naoris Ventures , the acceleration venture of Naoris Protocol , the first in production quantum-resistant blockchain and cybersecurity mesh architecture, has unveiled its roadmap to accelerate real-world deployment of post-quantum technology in high-impact sectors including robotics, smart cities, energy, finance, defense, and AI.

The European Commission and EU Member States recently released a coordinated roadmap to transition the bloc’s digital infrastructure to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), recognizing the threat quantum computers pose to existing encryption. The plan sets a unified timeline: all Member States must begin national PQC strategies and initial migration steps by 2026; critical infrastructure and other high-risk sectors must adopt quantum-resistant encryption by 2030; and, by 2035, the PQC transition should be completed for all systems that can feasibly be upgraded.

Against this backdrop, Naoris Ventures is actively investing in, building with, and integrating alongside companies creating secure, resilient, and post-quantum-ready solutions across these critical industries.

Across industries, the practice of Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) has quietly become one of the most pervasive cybersecurity threats of the decade. Malicious actors are systematically collecting and storing encrypted data today, from sensitive financial transactions to patient health records, personal identifiers, and corporate communications, with the intent of decrypting it once quantum computing becomes commercially viable. This threat is particularly acute in data-rich sectors such as telecommunications, finance, and healthcare, where vast volumes of encrypted information are routinely transmitted and archived. Even if this data is currently protected by conventional cryptography, once quantum computers achieve sufficient processing power, the encryption algorithms underpinning today’s digital world could be rendered obsolete, exposing decades of stored data to retroactive exploitation.

Naoris Ventures recognizes that this looming vulnerability demands proactive innovation rather than reactive defense. By leveraging decentralized, quantum-resistant encryption architectures, Naoris can neutralize the Harvest Now, Decrypt Later threat by ensuring that even data harvested today remains secure in a post-quantum world. This not only safeguards sensitive assets like financial data, patient records, and personal communications but also establishes a resilient digital foundation for enterprises navigating the quantum era.

Last month Naoris Protocol was cited in a research submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the reference model for quantum-resistant blockchain infrastructure in its Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework (PQFIF). Within this framework, Naoris Protocol is recognized as a proven, evidence-based implementation model for industry-wide adoption.

Buoyed by Naoris Protocol’s landmark SEC citing, Naoris Ventures will accelerate initiatives that strengthen resilience, trust, and efficiency in an increasingly automated and interconnected world, with a view to partnering with visionary founders building solutions that secure the foundations of the next technological era.

Founders joining the Naoris Ventures ecosystem will benefit from access to the protocol’s deep research and engineering capabilities, advanced cybersecurity knowledge, and post-quantum infrastructure. Combined, these elements form a secure foundation for innovation to grow without sacrificing integrity. In the weeks ahead, Naoris Ventures will be unveiling new partnerships, co-developed proof-of-concepts, and initiatives aimed at strengthening resilience across high-impact industries.

“Naoris Ventures has a clear mandate to be the capital and coordination layer of a new global standard for digital trust,” said Regan Melin, Managing Partner of Naoris Ventures. “Today we are setting out our ambitious roadmap to scale secure and intelligent systems across critical industries such as robotics, smart cities, energy, finance, defense, and AI systems. We are just getting started”

Since launching its testnet in January, Naoris Protocol has recorded significant growth, with over 104 million post-quantum transactions processed, over 3.3 million wallets onboarded, over 1M security nodes and over 600 million cyber threats mitigated as well as 31 active projects under development across sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, defense, and IoT.

[TITLE]Upgrad appoints former G20 sherpa Amitabh Kant as independent director:
[TEXT]
Ronnie Screwvala-led Upgrad has appointed Amitabh Kant , former G20 Sherpa of India, to its board as an independent non-executive director.Kant’s appointment comes as the higher-education and upskilling company ramps up its global expansion plans. It also coincides with UpGrad’s plan for a potential public listing within the next 18 months.In the last two years, the Mumbai-based company has expanded its global footprint, catering to enterprise clients in the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the US, while also partnering with universities across the UK, Australia, Europe, and North America.The firm has also invested in developing multi-campus learning infrastructure, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven learning systems, and personalised content, it said.“I’ve seen Upgrad’s online platform and physical centre, and their work is cutting-edge with strong young talent behind it. That’s why I chose to join. India now needs large-scale, rapid upskilling and collaboration with strong companies, and that’s exactly what Upgrad is doing,” Kant told ET.Upgrad reported Ebitda profitability in FY25 and gross revenue of Rs 1,943 crore, which, post Ind-AS (accounting standard) adjustment, closed at a total income of Rs 1,650 crore. It expects substantial profitability in FY26 with revenue between Rs 2,200 crore and Rs 2,400 crore, ET had reported.The firm competes with the likes of Eruditus, Great Learning and Simplilearn. It last raised $60 million from Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek at a flat valuation of $2.25 billion last year After a period of slowdown, India’s edtech sector witnessed a rebound in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. Funding activity picked up momentum, surging more than fivefold, with capital largely flowing into companies focussed on study-abroad services, workforce skilling platforms, and startups leveraging AI to expand into language learning and vernacular education.While the sector has moved past the turmoil triggered by Byju’s, after the company came under scrutiny from investors and lenders over alleged governance lapses, edtech firms have been moving towards AI adoption and outcome-driven models.“The whole sector cannot be sullied by one or two over-investments. You don't need that kind of money to make an impact in skilling and education . You just do not need the kind of money that got brought into one or three of those startups. Second, they were in the K-12 sector, not in higher education ,” Screwvala told ET.Screwvala said that while Indian investors continue to back the sector, many foreign investors have pulled back after the fall of Byju's.“If you put that $5 billion of capital into the private sector for skilling today, we would have another five million people with more skills. That's the tragedy of the situation, but we have to move on from that,” he added.Screwvala is also focussing on investing in startups with a planned $50 million corpus aimed at backing frugal, customer-obsessed disruptors in AI and other frontier technologies He has recently invested in AI-led platforms like SpeakX, Round1 by Grapevine, CuePilot AI, ZuAI, Activate AI, and TrueFan, with a space-tech deal also in the works, ET reported on Wednesday.On November 14, ET was the first to report on Upgrad submitting an expression of interest (EoI) to bid for Think & Learn, the bankrupt parent of edtech firm Byju's. Screwvala will mainly look at Great Learning and Aakash.Upgrad is also holding discussions with Unacademy’s investors and cofounders for an acquisition, valuing the SoftBank-backed startup at $300-320 million — 90% less than its last private valuation.

[TITLE]Baobab Ventures Debuts $15 Million Fund for AI Projects:

The $15 million Baobab Ventures fund will focus on pre-seed and seed technical teams and has already closed seven deals, Reina wrote in a LinkedIn post Wednesday (Nov. 26).

“The thesis for Baobab is simple: Building companies has dramatically changed over the past 3 years. What previously worked is no longer useful,” wrote Reina, who has invested in Revolut and ElevenLabs.

In an interview with Tech Funding News, Reina said he works alongside founders on market strategy, hiring, operations and sales execution at a time when launching a startup no longer means what it once did.

“Sales cycles are faster, there are hundreds of competitors within months, and AI has killed cold outreach conversion rates. Founders need to move incredibly quickly while building a sales and growth motion fit for the AI age,” he told the news outlet.

“To do that, they need operators on their cap table who can draw on relevant frontline experience from the AI era and who are hands-on with their help. This AI-informed operator experience is a clear gap in the European landscape, and it’s one I believe Baobab can fill.”

In other artificial intelligence and robotics news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the emergence of physical AI as the next stage of robotics. This is happening as the next stage of robotics makes strides in sensing, perception and large AI models give machines capabilities never supported by traditional automation.

“Earlier robots followed fixed commands and worked only in predictable environments, struggling with the unpredictability found in everyday operations such as shifting layouts, varying item shapes, mixed lighting, and human movement,” that report said.

“That is beginning to change as research groups show how simulation, digital twins and multimodal learning pipelines enable robots to learn adaptive behaviors and carry those behaviors into real facilities with minimal retraining.”

The report also points to findings from the World Economic Forum on a similar shift happening in manufacturing. Their analysis looked at how improvements in robot dexterity, machine perception, environment mapping and model-based reasoning are turning robots from isolated, fenced-off stations into shared work areas bolstering production, inspection and transport tasks.

According to the WEF research, companies are beginning to think of robots as intelligent mobile systems that can adjust to new product lines, swap out tasks and work alongside people without the need for rigid constraints.
