Good morning, Asia editor Nick Gordon, filling in for Allie Garfinkle.

Fortune just wrapped up its Global Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The agenda featured several financial sector luminaries: Barclays CEO C. S. Venkatakrishnan, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, DBS CEO Tan Su Shan and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio.

I had to enjoy the Forum remotely this year due to another mega-event (the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea). But I made sure to tune in to Monday’s mainstage session with Eng. Khalid Abdullah Al Hussan, CEO of the Saudi Tadawul Group; Bonnie Chan, CEO of HKEX; and Bob McCooey, vice chair of Nasdaq.

After a couple of down years, blockbuster IPOs have come back this year. The U.S. was home to two of the year’s biggest listings: CoreWeave on the Nasdaq and Figma on the NYSE, which raised $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. Hong Kong’s listings are dwarfing those in the U.S.: battery maker CATL’s secondary listing in the Chinese city is still the year’s largest IPO, raising $5.5 billion back in May.

The global competition for IPOs can seem cutthroat at times, as exchanges pitch friendly regulations, investor knowledge, and deeper pools of capital to win listings from their competitors.

But Nasdaq’s McCooey on Monday claimed that he spent a lot of time suggesting that executives look at home first, before looking abroad.

“I believe that most companies belong in their local markets. I firmly do,” he said. “I don’t go to Hong Kong, China, Tokyo, Singapore, Argentina, and try to convince companies not to list in their local markets, because most companies do belong there.” (Lest one think McCooey was being too charitable, he also said Nasdaq has “the strongest value proposition” for those companies that do decide to list overseas.)

Exchanges aren’t just competing against each other anymore. “The pace of change–on the alternative platforms, on the sophistication of investors–it’s unheard of,” Al Hussan, from Tadawul, said. “I have been in this business for the last 18, 19 years. You wake up every morning, there’s a new channel, there’s a new way of doing things, there’s a new requirement.”

Chan, from HKEX, agreed, noting that budding investors have a lot more options, like cryptocurrency, commodities and other “exotic instruments.”

“We’re entering into a stage where exchanges are not really competing with one another,” she said. “We’re working together with one another to make sure that we all stay relevant.”

Still, Chan can certainly feel secure

[TITLE]Hong Kong stocks slide after Xi-Trump meeting yields few surprises:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong stocks erased earlier gains on Thursday as a high-stakes meeting between the Chinese and US state leaders stopped short of generating surprises and the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone tamped down hopes of an interest-rate cut in December.

The Hang Seng Index fell 0.2 per cent to 26,282.69 at the close, reversing a gain of 0.9 per cent that at one point lifted the benchmark to a three-week high. The Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 0.7 per cent. Hong Kong's market was shut for a holiday on Wednesday.

On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index slid 0.8 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.7 per cent.

Sunny Optical Technology Group, which makes camera modules for mobile phones, slumped 4.8 per cent to HK$76.95 and Budweiser Brewing sank by that much to HK$8. Biotech firm Wuxi AppTec retreated 3.7 per cent to HK$108.50 after a major shareholder revealed a plan to sell a stake on the Shanghai exchange. On the positive side, Meituan advanced 2.4 per cent to HK$102.40 on a plan to sell US$3 billion of dual-currency notes.

A tariff truce had already been widely expected by the market, according to analysts. Photo: AFP alt=A tariff truce had already been widely expected by the market, according to analysts. Photo: AFP>

Sell-offs kicked in when more details about the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump emerged.

After the sit-down that lasted about one hour and 40 minutes in Busan, South Korea, Trump said that China would delay a sweeping curb on rare earth exports and resume purchases of American soybeans. Meanwhile, China said the US would extend a pause on so-called reciprocal tariffs by an additional year and refrain from adding more Chinese companies to a blacklist.

Most of the results from the meeting fell within a preliminary agreement reached by negotiators from the two nations earlier this week, which had been well expected and digested by the market.

"We don't see a material reduction in long-term geopolitical risks," said Lorraine Tan, director of equity research at Morningstar. "We think the probability of further decoupling is more likely than not."

She said the main relief was that US tariffs on China rising to 157 per cent was avoided. "However, the markets had already moved on from this expectation," Tan said. "This is one reason why we don't see a significant uptick in the broad market."

MANILA, Philippines -- Asian shares are mixed after the U.S. stock market sank from record heights as Wall Street sifted through various developments such as trade relations with China and profits of Big Tech giants.

U.S. futures advanced and oil prices fell.

President Donald Trump hailed his talk Thursday with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, but major tensions remain between the world’s two largest economies.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.7% to 52,201.05, touching fresh records after data showed industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in September, beating market expectations and rebounding from a 1.5% drop the previous month.

In Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.9% to 26,050.08 and the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.6% to 3,963.01.

Data released Friday showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month. The official NBS Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.0 from 49.8 in September.

South Korea's Kospi rose 0.4% to 4,105.81, while Australia's S & P/ASX 200 added 0.2% to 8,903.50. Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.5%.

On Thursday, the S & P 500 fell 1% to 6,822.34, pulling further from its all-time high set on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% to 47,522.12. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.6% from its record set the day before, closing at 23,581.14.

Stock markets elsewhere in the world were mixed, coming off a highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies. Trump rated his meeting with Xi as a “12” on a scale of zero to 10, saying he would cut tariffs.

But stocks had already run to records on expectations for potentially bigger improvements in trade friction between Beijing and Washington.

Earnings of Big Tech companies were also feeling the pressure of high hopes. Meta Platforms dropped 11.3%, cutting into what had been a 28.4% jump for the year so far. It was the heaviest weight on the S & P 500. Analysts said investors were likely perturbed by how much Facebook’s parent company said it’s planning to spend in 2026. Companies across the industry have been on an investment spree to build out their artificial-intelligence capabilities, and the concern is whether it will all pay off.

“There are moments in market history when capital stops behaving like money and starts acting like obsession — when spending becomes the strategy, not the consequence. That’s exactly where we are now with artificial intelligence,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Microsoft sank 2.9% even though it reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Analysts pointed to how it also expects to spend more on investments in 2026 than in 2025, while growth for its Azure business may have fallen a bit short of some investors’ expectations.

On the winning side of Big Tech was Alphabet. Shares of Google’s parent company climbed 2.5% after its profit and revenue for the latest quarter easily topped analysts’ expectations.

How such companies do matters incredibly for investors. The trio of Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft alone account for 14.5% of the total value of all the companies in the S & P 500 index, which dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts. That means movements for them and a handful of other Big Tech companies can easily overshadow what hundreds of other stocks are doing.

In other dealings early Friday, benchmark U.S. crude oil shed 42 cents to $60.15 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 42 cents to $63.95.

The U.S. dollar fell to 153.95 Japanese yen from 154.14 yen. The euro rose to $1.1573 from $1.1566.

[TITLE]Asian stocks soar to record peak on trade deal optimism:
[TEXT]
Asian stocks surged while gold and bonds retreated on Monday as signs of easing trade tensions between China and the US buoyed risk appetite, in a strong start to a week that will be headlined by central bank meetings and megacap earnings.

Top Chinese and US economic officials hashed out on Sunday the framework of a trade deal for US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to decide on later this week in their eagerly anticipated meeting in South Korea.

A trade deal would pause steeper American tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls, helping soothe investor nerves that were frayed due to escalating trade tensions between the world's top two economies.

That sent stocks sharply higher, with South Korea's KOSPI, Taiwan stocks and Japan's Nikkei adding more than 2 per cent each and crossing landmarks to record highs. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 1.3 per cent to a record peak.

"Investors will want to see confirmation that the trade truce holds and that China's stimulus and reform signals translate into tangible growth momentum," said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo.

US stock futures jumped, with Nasdaq futures up 1 per cent. European futures were 0.5 per cent higher. The Nikkei breached 50,000 for the first time, while the Kospi rose above 4,000.

George Boubouras, managing director of K2 Asset Management, said the market is content with the US-China momentum in recent days. "Over the past few months the market has been looking through global tariff negotiations understanding that some commentary can be a bit of theatre and noise."

The Australian dollar, often seen as a risk and China proxy, climbed 0.42 per cent to $0.6541, near a two-week high. Chinese blue-chip stocks added 0.84 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.78 per cent.

Safe-haven gold eased 1 per cent, while US Treasuries fell, leaving the benchmark 10-year bond yield up 3.8 basis points. Commodities, including soyabeans, wheat and corn rose on trade deal prospects.

Central bank meetings await

Investor focus this week will also be on central bank meetings in Japan, Canada, Europe and the US.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points after data showed US consumer prices increased slightly less than expected in September, but the government shutdown and its impact on data remain a concern.

The dollar was slightly higher at 151.13 yen, hovering near a two-week high. The euro last bought $1.16215. The dollar index was flat at 98.982.

The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are both broadly expected to hold rates steady later this week.

Although the BOJ is likely to debate whether conditions are ripe to resume rate hikes as worries about a tariff-induced recession ease, political complications may keep it on hold for now.

Focus on megacap earnings

The busiest part of the US earnings season is upon us, with megacaps Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms all due to report results this week.

While the profit edge of the "Magnificent Seven", a group of companies with huge market capitalisations whose shares dominate equity indexes, over the rest of the index is narrowing, they are still expected to post stronger results for this period.

A number of the megacap companies are also key players in the artificial intelligence industry, enthusiasm for which has been the main driver of stock market performance.

Saxo's Chanana said the US earnings season and guidance from big tech will be key to gauging how resilient corporate profits remain in a slowing economy.

"So while sentiment has improved, the coming week will test whether optimism can turn into durable conviction."
