[TITLE]How scientists are hacking bacteria to treat cancer, self-destruct, then vanish without a trace:
[TEXT]
Bacteria are rapidly emerging as a new class of “living medicines” used to kill cancer cells.

We’re still a long way from a “cure” for cancer.

But one day we could have programmable, self-navigating bacteria that find tumours, release treatment only where needed, then vanish without a trace.

Here’s where the science is up to.

Current treatments aren’t perfect

Many tumours are hard to treat. Sometimes, treatments cannot penetrate them. Other times, tumours can “fight back” by suppressing certain parts of the immune system, reducing the impact of treatments. Or tumours can develop resistance to treatments.

Using bacteria could overcome these obstacles.

More than a century ago, surgeons noticed some people with cancer who developed bacterial infections unexpectedly went into remission. That is, their cancer signs or symptoms decreased or disappeared.

Now we’re learning what could explain this. Broadly speaking, bacteria can activate the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells.

In fact, this approach is already used in the clinic. Bacteria are now the treatment of choice worldwide for certain cases of bladder cancer. When doctors deliver a weakened version of Mycobacterium bovis directly into the bladder through a catheter, the body’s immune response destroys the cancer.

Why bacteria?

Certain bacteria have an unusual talent. They can naturally find and grow inside solid tumours – ones that grow in organs and tissues – but leave healthy tissue relatively untouched.

Solid tumours are perfect homes for these bacteria as they contain lots of nutrients from dead cells, are low in oxygen (an environment these bacteria prefer), and typically have reduced immune function, so cannot defend themselves against the bacteria.

All this suggests possible careers for these bacteria as delivery couriers to carry targeted, anti-tumour therapies.

Over the past 30 years or so, more than 500 research papers, 70 clinical trials and 24 startup companies have focused on bacterial cancer therapy, with growth accelerating sharply in the past five years.

Most bacterial cancer therapies in clinical trials today target solid tumours, including pancreatic, lung, and head and neck cancers, which are the kinds that often resist conventional treatments.

Bacteria could deliver cancer vaccines

Cancer vaccines work by presenting a cancer’s unique molecular “fingerprints”, known as tumour antigens, to the immune system so it can hunt down and eliminate tumour cells displaying those antigens.

Bacteria can serve as couriers for these anti-cancer vaccines. Using genetic engineering, the genetic instructions (or DNA) in bacteria that might make us unwell can be removed and replaced with DNA for immune-stimulating tumour antigens.

Listeria monocytogenes is the main character in more than 30 cancer vaccine clinical trials. Unfortunately, most of these trials did not show that these treatments work better than current ones.

The challenge is teaching the immune system to recognise cancer’s telltale antigens strongly enough to remember them, without pushing the body into dangerous overdrive.

Bacteria could boost existing cancer therapies

Nearly half of current clinical trials using bacteria in cancer therapies pair bacteria with immunotherapies or chemotherapy as part of personalised treatment plans to enhance the body’s attack on cancer.

Various approaches have finished phase 2 clinical trials. These include using immunotherapy combined with modified Listeria to activate the immune system for recurrent cervical cancer.

Another trial used modified Salmonella in people with advanced pancreatic cancer alongside chemotherapy to increase survival.

Josephine Wright , Author provided (no reuse)

Bacteria could be ‘bugs as drugs’

Arming bacteria with a drug means they could destroy the tumour from the inside, creating “bugs as drugs”.

For this, we need precise genetic control over how bacteria behave. Researchers can already reprogram bacteria to sense, compute and respond to molecular signals around the tumour.

Researchers can also engineer bacteria to self-destruct after delivering a drug, secrete immune-boosting molecules, or activate other therapies on command.

Researchers are building “multi-function” strains that combine several treatment strategies at once.

Probiotic species used in humans for many years are also candidates, including Escherichia coli Nissle, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These can be engineered to produce cancer-killing molecules or alter the environment around the tumour.

How close are we, really?

While early human trials have shown this approach is generally safe, finding the right dose remains a delicate balance.

Bacteria are also living entities that can evolve in unpredictable ways, and their use in humans demands strict safety controls. Even strains modified for safety can cause infection or trigger excessive inflammation.

So scientists are developing “biocontainment” strategies – engineered safeguards that prevent bacterial spread beyond tumours or triggers them to self-destruct after treatment.

If we can overcome these issues, such “living medicines” would still need to successfully complete clinical trials and receive regulatory approval before being commonly used in the clinic.

If so, this could mark a profound shift in how we treat cancer, from static drugs to adaptive biological systems.

[TITLE]Tenaya Therapeutics Presents Promising Interim Clinical Data from MYPEAK™-1 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial of TN-201 Gene Therapy for the Treatment of MYBPC3-Associated Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy:
[TEXT]
MyPEAK-1 Data Presented During Late-Breaking Session at AHA Scientific Sessions 2025 with Simultaneous Publication in Cardiovascular Research

TN-201 Has Been Generally Well Tolerated at Both Doses

Longer-term Follow Up of Cohort 1 Patients Showed Consistent, Deeper, and Durable Improvement in Measures of Hypertrophy

Initial Cohort 2 Data Demonstrated Early Dose Responsive Increases in TN-201 Transduction and MyBP-C Protein Expression

Tenaya Management to Host Webcast Call for Analysts and Investors on Monday, November 10 at 8:00 a.m. EST

NEW ORLEANS and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tenaya Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNYA) announced that new interim safety and efficacy data from the company’s MyPEAK™-1 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of TN-201 were presented today during the Late-Breaking Science: Main Event session at the American Heart Association’s (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2025 by Milind Desai, M.D., MBA, director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center at Cleveland Clinic and vice chair of Cleveland Clinic’s Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute. These data, which included longer-term follow-up results for three patients dosed with TN-201 gene therapy at a dose of 3E13vg/kg (Cohort 1) and initial results for three patients who received TN-201 at a dose of 6E13 vg/kg (Cohort 2) were simultaneously published in Cardiovascular Research.

TN-201 is being developed for the potential treatment of MYBPC3-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition caused by insufficient levels of myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). Single administration of TN-201 gene therapy was generally well-tolerated at both the 3E13 vg/kg and 6E13 vg/kg dose levels and immunogenicity was well managed through monitoring and individualized tapering of immunosuppressives. TN-201 achieved robust transduction and durable expression with early dose-dependent increase in both transduction and MyBP-C protein expression. Among Cohort 1 patients for whom there was greater than one year of follow up, decreases in circulating biomarkers and reductions in measures of left ventricular hypertrophy deepened over time.

“These initial results are promising for a patient population that too often live with difficult, even dangerous, symptoms,” said Dr. Desai, an investigator for the MyPeak-1 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial. “In the past decade, we've made great progress in understanding and treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and as our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of HCM increases, research into gene therapies such as TN-201 offer the opportunity to further advance and improve patient care.”

“Results of TN-201 treatment are in line with our expectations for this stage of trial, with a manageable safety profile and dose-dependent MyBP-C protein level increases over time. In particular, the durable changes in multiple parameters of disease – biomarkers, hypertrophy and heart failure symptoms – all moving with directional consistency toward normalization after a single dose are an encouraging early signal of TN-201’s activity,” said Whit Tingley, M.D., Ph.D., Tenaya’s Chief Medical Officer. “We look forward to building on these data with continued long-term follow-up of Cohort 1 and the maturation of early results for Cohort 2, which will inform our plans for TN-201’s late-stage development.”

Interim results from the MyPEAK-1 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial

Data reported today includes safety, biopsy and leading indicators of efficacy for the three patients enrolled in Cohort 1 with follow-up ranging from Week 52-78, and safety for the three patients in Cohort 2, Week 12 biopsy for Patient 6 and Week 26 assessments for Patient 4 as of the July 2025 data cut off. Patient 5 was lost to further follow-up after week 12. All patients other than Patient 5 have completed every visit and remain on study.

All patients enrolled in MyPEAK-1 had serious burden of disease at baseline. All six had objectively severe nonobstructive HCM with levels of hypertrophy significantly above average for people with HCM All six were at sufficiently high risk of sudden cardiac death to warrant an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) device All experienced mild-to-moderate symptoms of heart failure that interfered in activities of daily living (New York Heart Association, or NYHA, Class II-III) Four of the six have previously undergone surgical myectomy

Safety data for all six patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 showed that TN-201 was generally well tolerated at both the 3E13 vg/kg and 6E13 vg/kg doses. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and all patients have tapered off immunosuppressive medicines.

Reversible, asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations (Grade 1-3) were the most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reported There were no signs of cardiotoxicities, including no declines in left ventricular ejection fraction, clinical myocarditis or ventricular arrhythmias There were two treatment-related AEs classified as serious due to inpatient treatment or monitoring: a Cohort 1 patient with Grade 2 transaminase elevation that responded to steroids and a Cohort 2 patient with Grade 1 elevation of complement factors that resolved without additional intervention Adjustments to monitoring and immunosuppression during Cohort 1 resulted in faster tapers and lower cumulative corticosteroid doses in Cohort 2, despite the higher TN-201 dose

MyBP-C protein levels increased over time, with early evidence of a substantial increase commensurate with higher dose in Cohort 2. TN-201 DNA transduction and TN-201 mRNA expression following similar dose response.

Tenaya reported that TN-201 transduction and TN-201 mRNA expression were robust. All three patients in Cohort 1 demonstrated sustained presence of TN-201 DNA in the heart and mRNA expression that increased over time, supporting the observed increases in MyBP-C level changes. In Cohort 1 patients, protein levels increased by an average of 4% from the first biopsy taken to Week 52. In Patient 3, the first patient for whom baseline biopsies were available, MyBP-C protein was shown to increase by 5% at Week 52. The first evaluable patient in Cohort 2 (Patient 6) demonstrated a clear dose response, and early MyBP-C expression increased by 14% after only 12 weeks post-dose. Of note, Patient 6 had a greater than 2-fold increase in transduction and expression at Week 12 relative to the averages for these measures observed across Cohort 1.

Multiple parameters, including biomarkers, hypertrophy, heart failure symptoms, associated with increased risks of complications or reduced survival, have improved among a majority of patients with greater than 26 weeks of follow-up. Cardiac Troponin I levels declined significantly (48%-74%) to normal or near-normal levels in all Cohort 1 patients. Cardiac troponin I is a predictive risk factor of cardiac AEs such as ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and progression to end-stage heart failure. ( 1 ) NT-proBNP, a biomarker of cardiac muscle strain, improved or remained stable in two of three Cohort 1 patients Cardiac Troponin I remained within the normal range and NT-proBNP remained stable for Patient 4 from Cohort 2 at their 26-Week assessment All three patients in Cohort 1 now have evidence of significant improvement in one or more measures of hypertrophy at Week 52, including notable reductions in left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) of between 21% and 39%. LVPWT for Patient 4 in Cohort 2 was stable at Week 26. Greater LVPWT is an independent risk factor for reduced long-term survival after septal myectomy. (2 ) Two out of three Cohort 1 patients saw reductions in overall left ventricular mass index (LVMI) of between 12% and 22% at Week 52. LVMI for Patient 4 in Cohort 2 was stable at Week 26 NYHA classification, a measure of the impact of heart failure symptoms on activities of daily living, improved in all patients by at least one class by Week 26, and all Cohort 1 patients are now NYHA Class I (asymptomatic).

While the interim results from MyPEAK-1 are promising, longer-term follow-up for all patients is required to further inform Tenaya’s understanding of TN-201’s potential as a treatment for MYBPC3-associated HCM. Tenaya plans to periodically report additional results from longer-term follow-up. These interim data were presented during the “Forgotten No More: The Current Belle of the Ball? Breakthrough Evolutions in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy” Late-Breaking Science: Main Event session during AHA 2025 and were published simultaneously in an article titled “First-in-human study of AAV9:MYBPC3 gene replacement therapy (TN-201) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Initial safety, pharmacodynamic, and imaging results from MyPEAK-1” in Cardiovascular Research.

Conference Call and Webcast

Tenaya management will host a conference call on Monday, November 10, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. ET/5:00 a.m. PT to discuss the TN-201 data presented and published today and the status of the MyPEAK-1 clinical trial.

[TITLE]Jade Biosciences Presents New Data Demonstrating a Favorable Preclinical Safety Profile of JADE101 and a Translational Analysis of APRIL Mediated Biomarker Responses at the American Society of Nephrol:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jade Biosciences, Inc. (“the Company” or “Jade”), (Nasdaq: JBIO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing best-in-class therapies for autoimmune diseases, today presented two posters for JADE101, its investigational anti-A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025.

JADE101 is designed to selectively inhibit APRIL, a key driver of pathogenic IgA production in IgAN, a progressive autoimmune disease that frequently leads to end-stage kidney disease over a patient’s lifetime. Jade has engineered JADE101 with properties intended to capture the full efficacy of APRIL pathway inhibition while enabling patient-friendly subcutaneous dosing, supported by a differentiated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile demonstrated in non-human primates (NHPs). JADE101 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial, with interim data expected in the first half of 2026 that is anticipated to define the dose and dose interval for future studies in IgAN patients.

“We believe the selective anti-APRIL class will represent the foundational therapeutic approach for treatment of IgAN, and JADE101 has been specifically engineered to deliver the full potential of this mechanism,” said Andrew King, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and Head of R&D at Jade Biosciences. “These new preclinical data in NHPs demonstrate that JADE101 is highly selective, is well tolerated at toxicological doses, and is not broadly immunosuppressive. Additionally, our translational modeling builds further confidence that biomarker responses observed in healthy volunteers are expected to translate into meaningful outcomes for patients with IgAN. Interim biomarker data from our ongoing Phase 1 healthy volunteer study are anticipated to define the dose and dosing interval selection for JADE101, with the goal of supporting rapid advancement into IgAN patient trials with a potentially best-in-class therapy.”

Nonclinical Safety Profile of JADE101 (Poster #SA-PO0255)

New preclinical safety data highlight JADE101’s favorable safety profile and support its potential as a selective, disease-modifying treatment with low risk of toxicity:

JADE101 was well tolerated in NHPs at all doses tested preclinically, including the highest dose evaluated in GLP toxicology studies, which was established as the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). These results provide wide safety margins that support the first-in-human doses being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial.

Across studies, JADE101 showed no off-target binding in a panel of more than 6,000 human proteins, no human tissue cross-reactivity, and no cytokine release in human whole blood assays.

In NHPs, JADE101 treatment resulted in reversible reductions in serum immunoglobulins consistent with its mechanism of action, including IgA and IgM reductions of approximately 55–68% and 62–75%, respectively, and a more modest IgG reduction of 35–48%, all of which returned toward baseline following JADE101 clearance.

Despite reductions in circulating immunoglobulins, JADE101-treated NHPs generated antibody responses to a test immunization (KLH) that were comparable to untreated controls, consistent with the preserved vaccination response observed in healthy volunteers following administration of a previous anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody.

JADE101 administration in NHPs did not impact serum concentrations of BAFF or inflammatory cytokines, resulted in no histological changes in tissues, and had no effect on circulating immune cell populations, including B, T, or NK cells - supporting its potential as a well-tolerated treatment, devoid of broad immune suppression.

Translational Modeling of Biomarker Responses to APRIL Inhibition (Poster #SA-PO0272)

A second presentation described a translational assessment of the consistency of biomarker responses to APRIL inhibition across NHPs, healthy volunteers and IgAN patients, and the associations between these biomarkers and clinical responses in IgAN. Biomarker responses to JADE101 in the ongoing healthy volunteer study are anticipated to define dose and dose interval selection for future clinical trials in IgAN patients:

Analyses demonstrated that in vitro APRIL binding affinity is predictive of in vivo IgA-lowering potency across NHP and human data sets, supporting that high APRIL binding affinity results in potent IgA reduction in vivo in NHPs and humans.

Clinical observations from healthy volunteers further demonstrate that high APRIL binding affinity is a key determinant of the magnitude and duration of free APRIL and IgA reduction at a given anti-APRIL dose level.

Pharmacokinetic and free APRIL suppression profiles of anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies were consistent between healthy volunteers and patients with IgAN, supporting the use of healthy volunteer PK and biomarker results for dose selection in IgAN patients.

Trial level analyses indicate the kinetics and magnitude of IgA reduction is highly consistent between healthy volunteers and IgAN patients (r = 0.93), and that the reduction of Gd-IgA1 measured in IgAN patients is highly consistent with the reductions in total IgA (r = 0.96). Furthermore, the early IgA reduction observed in IgAN patients is predictive of subsequent proteinuria reduction (r = 0.89).

The largest reductions in proteinuria and the highest rates of clinical remission (proteinuria < 0.3 g/day) in IgAN patients were observed with the highest levels of APRIL suppression.

These analyses suggest that pharmacokinetic and biomarker responses observed in healthy volunteers are informative of anticipated therapeutic responses in IgAN patients. The analysis also highlights that the depth and duration of APRIL suppression can be linked to anticipated reductions in total IgA, Gd-IgA1, and proteinuria that are ultimately associated with preserving kidney function and delivering disease-modifying clinical outcomes for patients with IgAN. Based on JADE101’s differentiated NHP pharmacokinetic profile, the Company anticipates the potential for convenient, infrequent, subcutaneous dosing.

Cash, cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits of $225 million as of September 30, 20251 provides runway into H2 2027

NEW YORK, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis (the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS), a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies, today provided financial results for the third quarter 2025 ending September 30, 2025 and business updates.

“We are proud of the promising data from our core clinical product candidates. Our lasme-cel program for r/r B-ALL and eti-cel program for r/r NHL demonstrated their ability to induce deep and meaningful responses, underscoring their potential to improve outcomes in diseases with high unmet medical needs” said André Choulika, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis. “We look forward to sharing an additional development update on eti-cel at the ASH 2025 Annual Meeting and to provide the first interim analysis for the pivotal Phase 2 BALLI-01 trial in Q4 2026. Together, these milestones strengthen our leadership in allogeneic CAR-T innovation and position Cellectis for a transformative year ahead."

_______________

1 Cash, cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits include restricted cash of $4.4 million as of September 30, 2025 and fixed-term deposits of $168.2 million as of September 30, 2025, of which $137.6 million are classified as current financial assets and $30.6 million are classified as non-current financial assets (due to a fixed bank deposit investment maturing in October 2026, including accrued interest).

Pipeline Highlights

UCART Clinical Programs

BALLI-01 study evaluating lasme-cel (UCART22)

Clinical data from the Phase 1 BALLI-01 study with lasme-cel for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL), were presented at the Cellectis’ R&D Day that took place on October 16, 2025. The presented data position lasme-cel as a potentially game-changing therapy for patients with r/r B-ALL.

In the Phase 1 of BALLI-01 study, 40 transplant ineligible third line or beyond (3L+) patients were dosed with lasme-cel: 18 patients (n=18) were dosed with product manufactured by an external CDMO (Process 1, or P1) and 22 patients (n=22) were dosed with Cellectis-manufactured product (Process 2, or P2).

Highlights include:

Efficacy: lasme-cel demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 68% with Process 2 product (n=22), and an ORR of 83% at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D; n=12) and 100% in the target Phase 2 population (n=9)

Safety: in Phase 1 (n=40), lasme-cel was generally well tolerated; there was one case of grade 2 immune effector cell–associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS), which resolved.

Durability: among patients who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), median overall survival was 14.8 months.

Depth of response in target Phase 2 population: the CR/CRi rate was 56%, with approximately 80% of these patients achieving MRD-negative status.

Transplant eligibility in target Phase 2 population: all patients (100%) became eligible for transplant, and 78% proceeded to transplantation.

The survival curve for this study suggests a clear benefit: patients who proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after lasme-cel therapy showed a trend to longer overall survival than those who did not undergo transplant.

The Phase 1 data showed that lasme-cel maintained its efficacy regardless of the number or type of prior lines of treatments, including CAR-T (60% of subjects), transplant (50% of patients), and blinatumomab (80% of subjects).

Following successful End-of-Phase 1 meetings with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Cellectis provided a registration path for lasme-cel in r/r ALL. The first interim analysis for the Phase 2 of the BALLI-01 trial is expected in Q4 2026. Cellectis anticipates submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in 2028.

Commercial Opportunity for Lasme-cel

As part of the R&D Day presentation, the Company discussed the potential commercial opportunity for lasme-cel in r/r B-ALL.

If approved for commercialization, Cellectis estimates that lasme-cel could achieve up to approximately $700 million in potential peak gross sales across the U.S., EU4 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain) and UK in 2035, corresponding to an estimation of
