[TITLE]Halo Pharma Enhances Manufacturing Capabilities with Macro-Pactor® Investment:
[TEXT]
New addition enhances manufacturing continuity and supports seamless progression from early-phase development to late-stage production

Macro-Pactor® to be online in Q1 2026

WHIPPANY, N.J., Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Halo Pharma, a leading CDMO specializing in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, is expanding its manufacturing capabilities at its Whippany, New Jersey facility with the addition of a Gerteis Macro-Pactor®, a versatile roller compactor that enhances the company’s ability to manage complex formulations, improve process efficiency, and deliver consistent solid-dose pharmaceutical products. The investment reinforces Halo Pharma’s position as a reliable partner for both development and commercial manufacturing as it allows for seamless scale up from Halo Whippany’s Gerties Mini-Pactor® currently used for development, clinical and small scall commercial manufacturing.

The Macro-Pactor is expected to be online in the first quarter of 2026. Its high throughput, superior dry-granulation performance, improved powder flow, and reduced variability will significantly expand Halo Pharma’s dry-granulation capabilities. It will improve formulation flexibility, process predictability, and granule quality. This technology is especially beneficial for the development of moisture-sensitive APIs, high-drug-load formulations, poor-flowing powders, potent compounds, and modified-release products within Halo Pharma’s portfolio.

“One of the major advantages of adding the Macro-Pactor is that the process parameters established during early-phase development translates almost directly into larger batch sizes,” says Satish Shetty, Senior Director, Product Development & Technical Services at Halo Pharma. “Since the equipment is engineered for both development and commercial throughput, it eliminates the typical disconnect between small-scale R&D and large-scale manufacturing, reducing scale-up risk, timelines, and the need for reformulation.”

Shetty adds that the Macro-Pactor’s closed, dust-contained design reduces operator exposure, minimizes product loss, and supports secure, regulatory-compliant handling. With fewer open processing steps, the system provides safer, more controlled operation for potent APIs and controlled substances.

Beyond scale-up, the Macro-Pactor supports Halo Pharma’s tech-transfer process. Its precise, data-rich control of critical process parameters enables smooth, low-risk transitions from lab-scale development to commercial manufacturing, strengthening the company’s Quality by Design (QbD) efforts. Fully compatible with existing upstream and downstream equipment, the system ensures efficient end-to-end processing and strengthens collaboration across R&D, process development, manufacturing, and quality teams.

"Investing in the Macro-Pactor reinforces Halo Pharma’s commitment to delivering high-quality, scalable manufacturing solutions for our clients. It ensures that they can confidently advance their programs with predictable outcomes and faster timelines," says Lee Karras, Group Chief Executive for the Noramco Group, parent company of Halo Pharma.

of Singapore selected as NeuroSigma’s manufacturing partner Investment led by Checkmate Capital as part of strategic partnership with Armstrong Asia

First commercial units to be delivered in March 2026

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuroSigma, Inc., a Los Angeles-based bioelectronics company, today announced completion of an approximately $1 million investment into a high-volume manufacturing line for the second-generation Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS) device for treating pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NeuroSigma’s manufacturing partner for the project is Singapore-based Armstrong Asia , a leading manufacturer for the medical, automotive and consumer electronics industries, with operations across Asia and partnerships around the globe. The investment was led by Checkmate Capital, a strategic advisory and investment group headquartered in Pasadena, California. The investment and manufacturing project are part of a collaboration between Armstrong and Checkmate, stemming from their July 2025 strategic memorandum of understanding (MOU) focused on the development and manufacturing of new technologies, particularly in the medical device industry.

“This investment enables cost-efficient and scalable manufacturing of the second-generation Monarch eTNS device,” said Colin Kealey, M.D., President and CEO of NeuroSigma. "As we move into 2026, we look forward to working with Armstrong Asia to deliver this innovative product to patients and families throughout the world."

“We would like to thank NeuroSigma and Checkmate for selecting Armstrong as their manufacturing partner for the second-generation Monarch eTNS device,” added Phyllis Ong, CEO of Armstrong Asia. “Armstrong’s engineering team is highly inspired to co-design and manufacture advanced medical devices, and we look forward to producing the device at scale to serve the millions of patients suffering from ADHD.”

In November 2025, NeuroSigma announced successful completion of its pilot commercialization program for the first-generation Monarch eTNS device. During the pilot phase, the company dispensed over 1,000 Monarch devices and over 100,000 of the daily disposable patches. Based on strong market demand, NeuroSigma is preparing to launch the second-generation Monarch eTNS device in late Q1 2026.

“Completion of this investment marks a significant milestone for NeuroSigma, Armstrong, and Checkmate,” said Tom Paschall, CEO of Checkmate Capital and NeuroSigma Director. “Within the medical device industry, we see favorable conditions for the external neurostimulation sector and the central nervous system therapeutics market in general. The Monarch eTNS device is a groundbreaking neuro-electronic product that provides patients, families, and physicians with an alternative to stimulant medications and the negative side effects associated with them.”

[TITLE]Haier India readying ₹3,500-crore investment plan as it looks to set up third manufacturing facility in India:
[TEXT]
Consumer durables major Haier Appliance India is readying an investment plan of ₹3,500 crore as it is looking to set up its third manufacturing facility in the country. The company said it is in the process of exploring locations for the new facility and expects to finalise plans by next year. It is also eyeing revenues of ₹14,500 crore in CY2026.

The company on Friday unveiled its Gravity AI Series air conditioners at an event held at its Greater Noida facility.

NS Satish, President, Haier Appliances India told businessline, “We are looking at setting up our third manufacturing facility in India. We are looking at possible locations and it could be in the southern or western region. We expect to finalise the plans by next year and expect to make investments of ₹3,500 crore in phases in the third facility. This will be funded through internal accruals,” he added.

Asked about the overall revenue target for 2026, he added, “We expect to end 2025 with revenues of about ₹11,000 crore – up about 22 per cent over previous year. For CY2026, we have set our sights on revenues of ₹14,500 crore. This growth will be led by air conditioners and LED televisions categories, besides washing machines and refrigerators. We are among the top three brands now and have been able to grow strongly in 2025 despite challenges.”

Capacity expansion

The company also aims to ramp up its air conditioner manufacturing capacity in India. It expects its annual production capacity to rise to 4 million AC units by 2027.

”Air conditioners segment has very low penetration levels of just about 11 per cent and hence is a rapidly growing segment in the country. We are ramping up our manufacturing capacity aggressively. We believe this will enable us to grow our market share to 18 per cent from the current 7 per cent by 2030,” he added.

The company said it has also been strategically investing in its Greater Noida facility to strengthen component development and enhance production agility.

“We believe the Haier Gravity AI Series AC powered by AI-Atmos represents the next frontier in AI-driven home appliances and reinforces our deep commitment to understanding the needs of Indian consumers. With 90 per cent of our products now manufactured locally, we are reinforcing self-reliance, improving efficiency, and ensuring faster availability for households across India,” Satish said. The new Haier Gravity AI Series AC range starts at ₹49,990.

Currently, Haier India operates two manufacturing facilities in Greater Noida and Pune.

[TITLE]Businesses grow revenue on Stripe 27 percentage points faster after accepting financing through Stripe Capital:
[TEXT]
We hear consistently from our SMB customers that access to financing is a primary obstacle to growth, and that they’re not getting what they need from traditional lenders. We launched Stripe Capital to help fill this gap. Now, to quantify the impact, we completed a two-year randomized trial that directly compared Stripe businesses that accepted Capital financing to similar Stripe businesses that didn’t.

We found that businesses that accepted financing saw revenue on Stripe grow 27 percentage points faster than their peers, on average. We also found that for some businesses, the impact was even greater: the top decile of businesses, by growth rate improvement, saw a 211 percentage point average boost as a result of accepting financing.

Read on to learn how we proved the causal impact of financing on business growth, which kinds of businesses are most likely to see strong results, and how the emergence of nontraditional lenders is poised to increase global GDP.

Proving causation in two distinct time periods

Though it’s intuitive that accepting financing would spur growth, this causal relationship is difficult to prove: the same factors that make a business more likely to receive financing (good credit, high revenue, business longevity) also make it more likely to succeed, with or without an injection of capital. The scale of Capital—in 2025 alone, we provided financing to 76,000 businesses—made it possible to solve for these confounds. We designed a randomized control trial that compared the subsequent on-Stripe revenues of businesses that accepted financing to businesses on Stripe with similar credit, revenue, and longevity profiles that did not have access to Capital.

We ran the experiment twice to confirm that the growth effect was persistent. Our first trial ran from 2020–2021, and we found a striking outcome: an average boost of 114 percentage points to growth rates from financing. But it was likely that at least some of the divergence in growth trajectories was driven by COVID-19-era macroeconomic conditions: low inflation, large swings in GDP growth, and a trend to more ecommerce. Our more recent study—which ran from 2023–2025—took place in a very different economic climate, and found that the boost to growth rates remained strong at 27 percentage points on average.

An outsized impact on small businesses and those with forward-looking plans for their financing

Though we saw a strong average effect on growth rate, results varied greatly. Which characteristics made a business more likely to succeed with financing than others? Here’s what we found.

Financing drives significant growth for the smallest businesses on Stripe

For businesses processing between $3,000 and $76,000 annually on Stripe, Capital drove a 33 to 43 percentage point average boost to their growth rates compared to peers. Within this bucket, we could isolate an even stronger effect if we looked at businesses processing less than $52,000 annually on Stripe that also had top-tier business credit scores: they saw a 94 to 106 percentage point average boost to their growth rates.

These very small businesses are often the ones that struggle the most to secure timely financing from traditional banks. As one Capital recipient said, “Traditional banks just don’t understand how difficult they make the loan process” by requiring “days of completing endless application forms and providing extensive supporting documentation.” Many small business owners don’t have the time or resources to successfully complete these applications, and decline rates are nearly 50%—even for established businesses operating over 10 years.

With Capital, our more complete view of small businesses’ payment trends lets us speed up the process and reach a broader swath of SMBs. Stripe Capital can get financing to an SMB within 1 to 2 days on average, compared to 14 to 40 days at traditional banks. And our data shows that even for small businesses with low or unavailable credit scores, financing sparks growth. After accepting Capital offers, these Stripe businesses saw a boost of 11 to 18 percentage points to their growth rates on average compared to their peers.

Businesses that use financing for forward-looking projects saw higher growth rates

We complemented our experiment with a follow-up survey of around 900 Stripe businesses that participated, and we found that a business’s plans for using its new funding were strongly correlated with how much its growth rates improved.

Among SMBs with top-tier credit scores, those that reported using their financing for growth-oriented goals (selling new products, starting new projects, scaling up the business) saw boosts to their growth rates of 70 to 95 percentage points on average.

When we talk to businesses using Capital, we can see this effect in action: a new initiative, followed by significant growth. Luis Mayendia, the cofounder and CEO of the parking reservation company MyPark, shared that he used Capital to “scale the business by building and deploying additional machines, which started generating revenue immediately.” For Richard Blakely, the cofounder and CEO of Xirsys, financing through Capital allowed the TURN infrastructure company to expand to new markets: “We used the advance to set up servers in China, India, and Japan—allowing us to reach customers all over the world. Since then, we’ve seen our annual revenue more than double.”

Looking forward

The World Bank estimates that in developing economies, there is a $5.7 trillion gap between funding sought and obtained by SMBs. Our findings from Capital suggest that nontraditional lenders can play a significant role in growing the global GDP by closing this gap.

When financing programs are integrated with the tools SMB owners already use to run their operations, access broadens in ways that go beyond greater eligibility. Stripe Capital makes offers proactively, based on payment processing data, and this can encourage SMB owners to pursue growth opportunities they might not otherwise have considered. As one business owner told us, “I am being cautious

[TITLE]Reserve Bank makes it cheaper for banks to meet controversial capital rules:
[TEXT]
The changes will enable banks to replace some of the high-cost, high-quality capital they have to hold with larger amounts of lower-cost, lower-quality capital.

The Reserve Bank expected the switch to see the average bank’s funding costs reduce by 6 basis points (bps) compared to the status quo, and 12bps compared to when the current rules are meant to be ratcheted up and fully implemented by 2028.

The Reserve Bank said it would monitor the extent to which banks passed these savings onto customers versus shareholders.

Overall, it expected the interest rates banks charge to fall by between 7 and 19bps compared to what they could have been by 2028 under current settings.

However, because banks will have less high-quality capital to absorb losses in the event of a crisis under the new rules, depositors will be more exposed.

The Reserve Bank estimated the present value of the cost of a crisis would increase from 0.11% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 0.16%.

However, it believed the benefits of the change outweighed the potential costs, noting the new rules would still be conservative by international standards.

Reserve Bank Governor Dr Anna Breman told the Herald that even though she only began her job on December 1, she had input into the way the rules have been set.

“Our approach is simple, strong, proportionate, and efficient,” she said.

“Small and mid-sized deposit takers should see a proportionately larger reduction than the four large banks, which should allow them to grow and compete more effectively.”

The Reserve Bank has also changed the amount of capital it requires mid-sized and smaller banks to hold in relation to the different types of lending they do.

The idea is that having a more granular schedule will allow banks to more accurately price risk, which should see some borrowers pay less interest.

While the Reserve Bank previously defended its 2019 rules in the face of very strong criticism from the banking industry, as well as corners of the business and agricultural sectors, it said now was a good time to make a change.

It noted that in the middle of the year it stood up a massive depositor compensation scheme.

It is requiring banks to pay levies into a Government-backed fund that will be used to reimburse depositors up to $100,000 if their deposit-taker collapses.

People knowing the first $100,000 of their savings in a particular institution is safe should prevent the risk of them pulling their money out and causing a bank to collapse during a time of crisis.

The Reserve Bank is also regulating non-bank deposit takers more heavily under new legislation.

One of its acting Assistant Governors Angus McGregor said the outcome of the bank capital review was informed by more than 40 submissions, supplemented by independent external reports and advice.

“As a result of submissions, we made material changes to our proposals, including reducing some risk weights further to better reflect risk,” he said.

“These internationally-calibrated settings bring us closer to alignment with Australia, while still recognising the New Zealand context and higher risk profile.

“To ensure the benefits of these new settings are realised promptly, we will commence an accelerated implementation in the early new year, with full implementation under the new Deposit Takers Act in 2028.”

[TITLE]Ellomay Capital Announces Execution of an Agreement to Sell the Control Stake in the Company to O.Y. Nofar Energy Ltd.:
[TEXT]
Mr. Ran Fridrich will continue as Chief Executive Officer of the Company

Tel-Aviv, Israel, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and USA, today announced that S. Nechama Investments (2008) Ltd., Kanir Joint Investments (2005) LP and Anat Raphael, who together currently hold approximately 45.9% of the Company’s outstanding share capital (together, the “Sellers”), agreed to sell their holdings in the Company to O.Y. Nofar Energy Ltd. (“Nofar”), a public company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE: NOFR). As described below, the closing of the sale is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

Ran Fridrich, CEO and Board Member of Ellomay, said: “The transfer of control from the current controlling shareholders to Nofar is intended to ensure an orderly transition of ownership that will secure Ellomay’s future and continued growth. Ellomay will continue to operate in the ordinary course of business, while retaining its dedicated employees and management backbone, and will work to expand its activities in the future.”

Ofer Yannay, CEO and Board Member of Nofar, said: “The acquisition of the controlling stake in Ellomay constitutes a significant strategic milestone in the implementation of our growth strategy. This transaction represents not only an expansion of Nofar’s portfolio, but also the leveraging of three core principles: first, full strategic alignment with target markets in which we seek to deepen our activity; second, entry into the conventional energy sector through Ellomay’s holding in the Dorad power plant, which strengthens Nofar’s position by broadening its production mix; and third, the creation of operational synergies and asset-enhancement potential through the integration of the experience and expertise of Nofar and Ellomay. In particular, I would like to note my deep appreciation for Ellomay’s team, and especially for Rani Fridrich, who is expected to continue in his role as CEO of Ellomay.”

As noted in a report submitted to the Israel Securities Authority by Nofar (“Nofar’s Report”), the Sellers will be selling their shares based on a Company valuation of NIS 1 billion (approximately $310.4 million), subject to customary adjustments. Nofar further reports that the consummation of the sale is subject, inter alia, to receipt of regulatory approvals (including from the Israeli Electricity Authority and the Israeli Competition Commissioner) by no later than 90 days from the date of execution of the sale agreement, however, if Nofar acts in good faith to obtain the required approvals and such approvals are not received by the applicable deadline, and the Sellers receives written notice thereof, the final deadline may be extended in two stages of up to 45 days each. In addition, Nofar’s Report notes that Nofar has the right to terminate the sale agreement in the event that during the interim period until the consummation of the transaction: (i) the Company enters into a new material transaction that is not in the ordinary course of business with the Sellers or any of their related parties or any of the Company’s controlling shareholders or office holders, (ii) if the Company enters into a material new field of operations not included in the Company’s strategic plan and requires substantial investments, (iii) if the Company sells (or leases) a significant part of the Company’s real estate (owned or leased by the Company), or (iv) if the Company’s articles of association are amended, other than a technical amendment.

Based on Nofar’s Report, the sale agreement further provides that upon consummation of the transaction, and at Nofar’s discretion, up to four directors on behalf of Nofar may be appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors, and an equivalent number of directors (other than the Company’s external directors) will be replaced. Nofar’s Report notes that Mr. Ran Fridrich will continue to act as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

As noted above, the consummation of the sale transaction is subject to conditions to closing, that are not within the control of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot estimate, and there is currently no assurance as to, whether and when the transaction will be consummated. In addition, the value of the Company’s shares set forth in the Nofar Report may not be reflective of the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the NYSE American or the TASE.

[TITLE]Affinius Capital Provides $81M Construction Loan for Arizona State Student Housing – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Fields Holdings has secured $81.2 million to finance the construction of the Samuel, a 14-story student housing property that will boast 224 units on Arizona State University’s main campus in Tempe, Commercial Observer can first report.

Affinius Capital provided the construction financing, while CBRE’s Scott Williams arranged the transaction.

Affinius Capital Senior Vice President Tyler Figley described the Samuel in a statement as a “high-quality” student housing property that sits on a prime location within the sprawling Arizona State campus. Figley said the apartment complex will likely “capture demand” from the growing enrollment at ASU, which currently has roughly 56,000 students in Tempe.

“We look forward to working with Fields Holdings, which has the experience to execute on this caliber of project,” he added.

Located at 706 South College Avenue near Downtown Tempe, the Samuel will deliver 408 beds and also feature 8,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The units will be organized as studios to three-bedroom apartments, and the building will include a swimming pool, a basketball court, an outdoor courtyard, a fitness center, and several lounges with media spaces for students to access

Fields Holdings did not respond to requests for comment.

[TITLE]Bamburi Cement, Chinese Company Sign Ksh32 Billion Factory Construction Deal [Details]:
[TEXT]
Editor's Review Bamburi Cement has signed a Ksh32 billion Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with China-based Sinoma CBMI Construction Co., Ltd for the construction of a new clinkerisation factory in Matuga, Kwale County.

Bamburi Cement has signed a US$250 million (Ksh32 billion) Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with China-based Sinoma CBMI Construction Co., Ltd for the construction of a new clinkerisation factory in Matuga, Kwale County.

In a statement on Tuesday, December 16, the company said the project is part of Bamburi Cement’s strategy to expand its manufacturing operations, reduce reliance on imports, and support Kenya’s infrastructure development and economic transformation.

The clinkerisation plant will have a production capacity of 1.6 million tonnes per year and will incorporate advanced, carbon-neutral technologies aimed at reducing environmental impact.

Through the project, Bamburi Cement plans to more than double its clinker production from 1 million tonnes to 2.6 million tonnes, while cement production is expected to increase from 1.8 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes annually.

President William Ruto, who witnessed the signing of the agreement, said the government will support the Bamburi Cement project and other similar investments that promote value addition, job creation, and industrial growth.

"The Government of Kenya remains fully committed to supporting this project and similar investments that deepen value addition, create jobs, and strengthen our manufacturing base," he said.

Ruto stated that the cement industry plays a central role in Kenya’s economic development, noting that major infrastructure projects depend on a stable and competitive cement supply chain.

"The cement industry sits at the heart of our economic freedom agenda. Every road, power plant, dam, irrigation canal and factory depends on a reliable, competitive and sustainable cement value chain.

"Projects such as the Bamburi Clinker Line are not isolated investments, they are foundational catalysts for our national transformation," he added.

File image of President William Ruto speaking during the event

Ruto also highlighted the need for Kenya to reduce cement imports by utilizing its abundant local raw materials.

"It is not possible for us to continue importing cement, Kenya has an abundance of limestone and other raw materials for cement production," he further said.

The deal comes a year after Savannah Clinker Limited withdrew its offer to acquire Bamburi Cement.

In a statement on Wednesday, December 4, 2024, Capital Markets Authority (CMA) said it had approved the withdrawal of the offer, and gave Bamburi Cement shareholders, who had accepted the offer until Thursday to reconsider their decision.

"CMA would like to notify the shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc and the investing public that Savannah Clinker Limited has withdrawn its competing offer for the acquisition of the Bamburi Cement Plc shares today. CMA has also approved the withdrawal of the offer in line with the Capital Markets (Takeover and Mergers) Regulations, 2002.

"Following this development, shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc who had accepted the offer by Savannah Clinker Limited have until 5.00pm on Thursday, 5 December 2024 to reconsider their decision. Shareholders who do not change their decision will be deemed to have declined the offer by Amsons Industries (K) Limited and remain shareholders of Bamburi Cement Plc," the statement read in part.

CMA further noted the only valid offer is the one from Amsons Industries (K) Limited which has already been approved by the Authority.

"Shareholders who had accepted either of the offers are free to withdraw their acceptance before the closure of the offer period at 5.00 pm on Thursday, 5 December 2024. Trading of Bamburi Cement Plc shares will be suspended from 9.00 am on 06 December 2024 to facilitate reconciliation," the statement concluded.

Savannah Clinker Limited's move to withdraw its offer came days after its Chairman, Benson Sande Ndeta, was arrested and subsequently arraigned in court.

Ndeta was arrested on charges of defrauding Absa Bank of $35 million, allegedly acting on behalf of Savannah Cement Limited.

He faced eight counts, including conspiracy to commit a felony and obtaining credit by false pretenses, which he denied.

After spending the weekend in custody, the High Court ordered his unconditional release, halting further prosecution pending a hearing set for January 30, 2025.

[TITLE]Kennedy Wilson, Affinius Provide $384M Construction Financing Package for Jersey City Multifamily Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
New Jersey developer Panepinto Properties has landed a $384 million financing package to develop the first building in its two-tower multifamily project on the Jersey City waterfront, Commercial Observer can first report.

Kennedy Wilson provided a $306 million senior loan, while Affinius Capital supplied $78 million of preferred equity for the planned 678-unit Harborside 8 project.

“We are proud to play a role in bringing this high-impact multifamily project to fruition in Jersey City, which continues to experience low vacancy levels and consistent rent growth,” Thomas Whitesell, head of Kennedy Wilson’s debt investment group, said in a statement.

The property is scheduled for completion in 2028. Units in Harborside 8 will have views of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline, and amenities will include a rooftop terrace, a pool, a fitness center and coworking spaces.

“Harborside 8 will address the significant demand for premium multifamily housing in one of the region’s most dynamic and fastest-growing markets,” David Greenburg, Affinius Capital’s co-head of credit originations, said in a release. “Panepinto Properties brings proven execution capabilities and extensive New Jersey market knowledge, critical advantages for a development of this scale in Jersey City.”

Panepinto Properties, led by founder and CEO Joseph A. Panepinto Sr., acquired the development site that will be utilized for Penepinto’s Harborside 8 and Harborside 9 projects from Veris Residential — formerly Mack-Cali Realty — for $75 million, Real Estate NJ reported. Veris has been busy divesting properties, also recently selling The James in Park Ridge, according to NJ Biz.

The towers will have a combined 1,267 units. Harborside 8 will reach 65 stories and comprise 678 rental units, 8,578 square feet of retail space, a 350-space parking garage and a 40,000-square-foot public park along the Hudson River, according to Real Estate NJ.

JLL’s Tom Didio negotiated the financing.

[TITLE]New £150m funding package to protect jobs at Grangemouth:
[TEXT]
New £150m funding package to protect jobs at Grangemouth

8 hours ago Share Save David Henderson , Scotland news correspondent and Graeme Ogston , Tayside and central reporter Share Save

PA Media The UK government and Ineos are to invest a combined £150m in the plant

A £150m support package has been announced for the Grangemouth industrial complex. The UK government will invest £125m and owners Ineos will contribute £25m to support 500 jobs at the site. Scottish secretary Douglas Alexander told the BBC the joint deal was a "stark contrast" to the closure-hit Mossmoran chemical plant. He criticised ExxonMobil for lack of investment in the Fife site, which is due to close in February with the loss of up to 400 jobs.

Alexander said the funding was effectively "bridging finance", in the hopes that the plant would be profitable in five years after £100m was spent to keep it open in the past year. He added that Ineos were able to commit to "five years of ethylene production at the facility." Grangemouth is the UK's last ethylene plant, a key ingredient in plastics used in advanced manufacturing and the automotive and aerospace industries. In addition to ethylene, the plant's core products are propylene, polyethylene, and polypropylene.

PA Media Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander visited the plant following the announcement

These materials are used in a wide variety of products, including packaging, insulation, cables, construction materials, pharmaceuticals and healthcare products, including PPE and syringes. The complex uses shale gas brought in by ship from the United States to produce ethylene. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would protect jobs and ensure places like Grangemouth can develop into the future. He said: "Our commitment is clear; to back British industry, to stand by hardworking families, and to ensure places like Grangemouth can thrive for years to come."

The UK government said that it had underwritten £75m in finance provided by NatWest. The government said it was providing the remainder of the funding via a grant - to take the total to £125m - with Ineos providing equity to make up the remainder of the £150m total. Chancellor Rachel Reeves visited the plant following the announcement, along with Alexander and Business secretary Peter Kyle. Reeves said: "Building on the millions of pounds we've already invested in Grangemouth, this vital package protects our national resilience and secures the livelihoods of hundreds of people employed at the site way into the future."

The site stands next to the Grangemouth oil refinery. In April, it stopped processing crude oil and moved to being an import terminal for finished fuels, with the loss of 400 jobs. Ineos chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe had earlier warned the chemical industry was coming to an end in Britain due to high energy costs and carbon taxes. He said the new investment package demonstrated Ineos and the UK government's commitment to British manufacturing. "It protects 500 high-value jobs, secures supply chains, and preserves the industrial capacity the nation needs," he said. "The support of the UK government is welcome as we work to deliver competitive and efficient low-carbon manufacturing for the UK, long term."

PA Media Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the investment would protect 500 jobs

Grangemouth community councillor Steven Aitkenhead told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live that the news was a "glimmer of hope." He said: "Grangemouth itself is experiencing huge social difficulties at the moment and could be classed as a social emergency. "So this news that securing and safeguarding jobs in the town is very welcome. "We hope that all the opportunities that come to the town through the Just Transition improves the lives of people who live in Grangemouth and the local area."

Snack bar owner Brenda Bolton said most of her customers are employed at the plant

Brenda Bolton, owner of the Rumbling Tum snack van which has served workers at the site for more than 30 years, said her business had more than halved since the 400 oil refinery job losses. She said: "I took to social media to build up the business and keep my staff in jobs. "The news of new jobs being generated is great for us and everybody round about here. "A customer did say 'I've heard on the radio there's an announcement for new jobs in Ineos so I hope that's great for you guys.'" But Ms Bolton said she was cautious about the security of the area's long-term future. She added: "There's been things promised in the past that have never transpired, so we'll believe that when we see it. "Hopefully it does generate more business for myself and other businesses round about."

Earlier, the Scottish Secretary told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme that the UK government was "determined to protect chemical production in Grangemouth". Alexander said: "This petrochemical facility is of strategic significance, not just to Scotland, but to the whole of the UK. "It is a critical element of the supply chain to a whole range of industries."

In recent months there has been concern about the future of the UK petrochemical industry due to the rising cost of energy. Last month, ExxonMobil announced plans to close part of the Mossmorran chemical plant in Fife, impacting 179 directly employed jobs and 250 contractors. The company said the high cost of energy at the plant, which also produces ethylene for the plastics industry, was partly to blame for the decision. The UK government has warned that high energy costs have caused problems for the chemicals industry across Europe. It said about 40% of ethylene gas capacity has either closed recently or is at risk of closure.

Alexander criticised ExxonMobil's leadership and said there had been a "stark contrast in the dialogue and discussions" over the future of the Mossmoran site. He said: "When we sat down with Jim Ratcliffe it was pretty clear what was needed in order to be able to deliver a future for the chemical facility in Grangemouth. "There had been significant Ineos investment in the plant. "In contrast, the Mossmorran facility is now 40 years old, it was built to have a 20 year lifecycle. "Alas, there hasn't been the scale of investment that many of us would wished to see in Mossmorran over recent years. "The management were not able to give us a pathway to profitability."

parliamentlive.tv ExxonMobil chairman Paul Greenwood was asked about the Grangemouth investment during a session of the Scottish Affairs Committee

ExxonMobil chairman Paul Greenwood has previously partly blamed UK government policy for the decision and said there was no "competitive future" for the site. On Wednesday Mr Greenwood told the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster that the current environment was "very difficult" to operate in the UK at the moment. Douglas McAllister MP asked Mr Greenwood if the new investment announcement on Grangemouth "flew in the face" of that view and if Mr Ratcliffe and others were experiencing the same environment he described. Mr Greenwood agreed, but added: "If you stand back and you look at the facts, I think you turn around and you say, Prax refinery has shut. Grangemouth refinery has shut. Fife ethylene plant has shut. "The government has now effectively had to inject some money and capital into another chemical plant in order to keep it operating. "I think those are signs of an industry that's struggling, not signs of an industry that's thriving." Mr Greenwood said Exxon Mobil had invested £270m into the Mossmorran site over the previous five years, but had made a £300m loss over the same period. He said there had been both "formal and informal" discussions about a potential sale of the site, but there was no "viable" takeover offer.

PA Media Unite said governments in the UK and Scotland had done "too little too late" after the Grangemouth oil refinery announced its closure

Giving evidence to the same committee, Bob McGregor, industrial officer for the Unite union, disagreed that Mossmorran was not commercially viable and urged both governments to intervene. He said: "The plant is one of the youngest ethylene plants in Europe, it has a dedicated workforce. "Yes, it needs investment, but I'm sure that investment could come from a company who's making £25bn, the third best year in the history of their business." Mr McGregor said that there had been "a lot of kind words and soundbites", but said he had not seen "any real tangible evidence" of support from either government. Responding to the evidence, Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said the Scottish government's priority was to secure a sustainable future for the site at Mossmorran and workers at the plant. She said she had been working to secure new opportunities for the Fife plant and its workforce, but encouraged the UK government to intervene.

'Much-needed boost'

The UK and Scottish governments have been scrambling to reduce the impact of recent job losses in the chemicals sector. They made a joint commitment to supporting a green energy hub at Grangemouth, on part of the site left vacant by the refinery closure. The Scottish government welcomed the new investment. Climate and energy secretary Gillian Martin said: "The Scottish government has been calling upon UK government for months now to intervene to protect jobs at Grangemouth and Mossmorran at a scale seen in other parts of the UK."

New Delhi, The Centre has notified the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) with an outlay of Rs 7,280 crore.The initiative is targeting to reduce dependence on China for critical inputs and secure supply chains for EVs, electronics, aerospace and green energy The scheme, approved earlier by the Union Cabinet, aims to build a complete domestic value chain of converting rare earth oxide into sintered NdFeB , essential for India's strategic and industrial advancement.Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) is the alloy used to create the strongest type of permanent magnets "Through this scheme, the Government of India intends to incentivise setting up of 6,000 MTPA (Million Tonnes Per Annum) of integrated REO (rare earth oxides) to sintered NdFeB REPM's manufacturing facilities in the country," the Heavy Industries Ministry said in the notification.Indigenously produced sintered NdFeB REPMs from NdPr oxide will be eligible for sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy under the scheme.It will allocate up to 6,000 MTPA of integrated sintered NdFeB magnet manufacturing capacity to five applicants through a transparent bidding process -- Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) by issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP).The minimum allocation to a beneficiary will be 600 MTPA, going up to a maximum allocation of 1,200 MTPA, in multiples of 100 MTPA, as per the notification.The beneficiaries will receive sales-linked incentives on the sale of sintered NdFeB REPM and a capital subsidy for setting up the allocated manufacturing capacity.Further, three selected beneficiaries with the lowest bids would receive an assured limited supply of NdPr oxide from IREL (India) Ltd, a CPSE under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).The total duration of the scheme will be 7 years, which includes 2 years of gestation period for setting up the manufacturing facilities and 5 years for incentive disbursement on the sale of sintered NdFeB REPM.Further, in case the first sale of sintered NdFeB REPM commences prior to the completion of the gestation period, then this additional period will also be eligible for sales-linked incentive over and above the 5-year duration.India has one of the world's largest rare earth reserves, mostly located in coastal regions.IREL (India), a CPSE under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), is the only company in India that is engaged in the mining of rare earth ores and refining these into REOs.While India possesses upstream capabilities in mining, separation and oxide refining, there is a notable gap in the industrial-scale midstream capabilities needed for oxide-to-metal, metal-to-alloy and alloy-to-magnet conversion.Due to this, India currently imports all its sintered NdFeB REPM demand for downstream applications.

[TITLE]IATA projects $41bn global airline profit in 2026:
[TEXT]
Airlines are projected to post a combined net profit of $41bn in 2026, up from $39.5bn in 2025, according to industry forecasts by the International Air Transport Association.

Despite the record earnings, the global airline industry’s net profit margin is expected to remain unchanged at 3.9 per cent, while net profit per passenger transported is forecast at $7.90, below the 2023 peak of $8.50 and flat compared with 2025.

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9 per cent net margin and a $41bn profit in 2026,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director-General. “That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds that the industry faces, rising costs from bottlenecks in the aerospace supply chain, geopolitical conflict, sluggish global trade, and growing regulatory burdens, among others.

“Airlines have successfully built shock-absorbing resilience into their businesses that is delivering stable profitability,” he added.

Operating profit is expected to rise to $72.8bn in 2026 from $67.0bn in 2025, translating to a net operating margin of 6.9 per cent, compared with the 6.6 per cent projected for 2025.

Return on invested capital is forecast to remain at 6.8 per cent, unchanged from the previous year.

However, IATA noted that ROIC will still fall below the weighted average cost of capital, estimated at 8.2 per cent in 2026, despite improved operating performance and ongoing deleveraging.

“Industry-level margins are still a pittance considering the value that airlines create by connecting people and economies,” Walsh said.

“They stand at the core of a value chain that underpins nearly four per cent of the global economy and supports 87 million jobs. Yet Apple will earn more selling an iPhone cover than the $7.90 airlines will make transporting the average passenger.

“Imagine the additional power that airlines could bring to economies if we could rebalance value chain profitability, reduce regulatory and tax burdens, and alleviate infrastructure inefficiencies.”

Total industry revenues are projected to reach $1.053tn in 2026, representing a 4.5 per cent increase over the $1.008tn expected in 2025.

Load factors are also forecast to hit record highs, with airlines expected to fill 83.8 per cent of seats globally in 2026.

Passenger traffic is projected to climb to 5.2 billion in 2026, up 4.4 per cent year-on-year, while cargo volumes are expected to rise by 2.4 per cent to 71.6 million tonnes.

IATA said air cargo performance remains a key bright spot, having outperformed gloomy forecasts amid shifting global trade dynamics.

“As trade flows adapt to a protectionist US tariff regime, air cargo has been the hero of global trade, buoyed in part by robust e-commerce and semiconductor shipments to support the boom in AI investments,” Walsh added.

“Notably, air cargo enabled front-loading to deliver products ahead of tariff deadlines, and it flexibly accommodated demand surges as tariffed goods normally destined for the US found new markets. The critical role of air cargo is front and centre as the global economy adjusts to new realities.”
