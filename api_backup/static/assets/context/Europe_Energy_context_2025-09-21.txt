[TITLE]Oil Majors Rethink Green Projects Amid Anti-ESG Push:
[TEXT]
The re-election of Donald Trump as US President has further accelerated the anti-ESG momentum, leading to rollbacks of climate action policies and executive orders banning ESG investing.

The United States has become the global epicenter of the anti-ESG movement, with a significant increase in anti-ESG bills proposed across states since 2021.

Back in 2021, Texas passed two laws that restricted the state from doing business with companies deemed hostile to the fossil fuels and firearm industries. The Lone Star State barred pensions and other state entities from investing in approximately 350 funds that promote environmental, social and governance, aka ESG investing, claiming that ESG investing does not act in the best financial interests of their clients.

To wit, the Republican-leaning state banned Wall Street giants Citigroup Inc., BlackRock Inc., Barclays Plc and members of Net Zero Banking Alliance, saying ESG is “…just a hate factory.” The anti-ESG movement has since gained traction, mostly targeting financial services like banks, pension funds and asset managers, as well as the energy sector.

And now a new report by GlobalData reveals how the U.S. has become the epicenter of a rising tide of anti-ESG sentiment across the globe. The report points to a Pleiades Strategy tracker that reveals that a total of 370 anti-ESG bills were submitted to the legislatures of 40 U.S. states between 2021 and 2024.

GlobalData notes that, whereas few of those bills were signed into law, this does not signify that the anti-ESG movement has weakened. Indeed, an analysis by Ropes & Gray found that anti-ESG bills filed in 2024 enjoyed a significantly higher rate of success than those filed in prior years, indicating that the architects of these bills are becoming more effective at drafting legislative challenges.

Not surprisingly, the anti-ESG movement has gained massive momentum since the re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. President.

Trump has rolled back many climate action policies by the previous administration, taken aim at DEI policies and passed executive orders banning ESG investing. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) has rolled back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Whereas OBBBA did not outright cancel the Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits as earlier feared, it did accelerate the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for the credit, bringing the deadline forward to December 31, 2027, from January 1, 2033, as originally envisioned in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Trump’s anti-climate actions are similar to his stance in his first term when he unraveled more than 100 climate policies. There are estimates that nearly $28 billion-worth of wind, solar, EV and battery projects have been delayed or cancelled since Trump took office, with a potential 19,000 jobs chopped.

“Since President Trump’s re-election in November 2024, the efforts of the anti-ESG movement have ratcheted up, and all companies (not just those in the financial services industry) lie within the movement’s scope,” the GlobalData report states. “Trump has unravelled much of the previous administration’s climate action policies, passed executive orders banning ESG investing and taken aim at DEI policies.”

Meanwhile, efforts by the European Union to simplify its regulatory landscape have frequently seen the bloc slide towards anti-ESG, with growing right-wing populism bolstering climate skepticism across the globe. International markets have opposed advancing ESG standards through initiatives like the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and European Green Deal that enforce sustainability criteria by requiring disclosure of ESG-related risks. GlobalData has predicted that the anti-ESG movement will ultimately impact companies across all industries, including institutions and other entities previously considered to be fully independent.

Not surprisingly, Big Oil companies have been scaling back their clean energy investments. Last year, oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) announced that it will not move forward with one of the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen projects if the federal government failed to provide tax incentives for natural gas-fed facilities. Current guidelines provide incentives for projects that produce "green" hydrogen by using water and renewable energy, but Exxon wants them extended to"blue" hydrogen from gas by trapping carbon emissions. That’s an interesting take because Exxon CEO Darren Woods previously expressed his doubts

[TITLE]Truly clean hydrogen is desperately needed: Will an ISO Standard help or hinder its climate potential?:
[TEXT]
By Morgan Rote, Pete Budden and Joe Williams

The first international hydrogen standard is poised to shape national hydrogen policies, but in its current form it overlooks critical science on electricity sourcing, methane leakage and hydrogen’s own warming impacts — risking the credibility of clean hydrogen as a true climate solution.

To ensure hydrogen delivers real climate benefits and advances COP30’s clean energy transition goals, the hydrogen standard should include robust, science-based guardrails.

This November, policymakers from around the world will be gathering in Brazil to chart the course of global climate action for the next 10 years. First on the Action Agenda is “accelerating zero- and low-emission technologies in hard-to-abate sectors.” In other words: hydrogen and other clean fuels that could help the world transition away from fossil fuels. But the extent to which hydrogen actually helps achieve this key COP30 clean energy transition objective depends heavily on the greenhouse gas emissions standards put into place to ensure its climate benefits.

Truly clean hydrogen is a crucial climate solution for some of the trickiest polluting sectors. Steel, ships and planes, which rely on fossil fuels and have a hard time directly electrifying, could instead be fueled by clean hydrogen or its derivatives (ammonia, methanol, etc.). But the climate impact of hydrogen varies greatly depending on how it is produced and managed. If it is produced from fossil-fueled electricity or by diverting existing renewables it can end up being worse for the climate than the fossil fuels it is replacing. Failure to limit methane leakage and capture CO2 when producing hydrogen from fossil fuels is also a major problem, as is leakage of hydrogen itself.

Right now, the first international standards for hydrogen are being developed by the International Organization for Standardization. While the Draft International Standard on hydrogen production has made some real improvements relative to the starting point, it still falls short of what’s needed to provide a rigorous underpinning for the global clean hydrogen industry — and is unlikely to reach that mark by the time it’s presented ahead of COP30 in Belém.

What is the ISO standard and why does it matter?

ISO is a well-known federation made up of national standards bodies — organizations from different countries — established to create sets of global standards, which are then widely accepted as best practice in different industries, from occupational health and safety to medical device regulation. And for the last two years, ISO has been working on a new standard that sets the methodology for calculating GHG emissions associated with hydrogen production.

This standard matters for several reasons. It’s important to have a globally agreed-upon way of counting emissions — this allows, for example, Japan to know that it’s importing a clean form of hydrogen or ammonia from an American producer; an IMO member state to know it’s meeting clean fuel targets; and a country like Brazil to know whether hydrogen fits into its net-zero plans.

This particular standard will likely be influential for national policymaking around the world. While the U.S., UK and EU have already set their own standards, countries like India, Indonesia, Japan and Brazil have all referenced an intent to incorporate the ISO standard into their own national hydrogen policies.

However, widespread adoption of this standard in its current form would be problematic. It does not represent a comprehensive accounting of GHG impacts and ignores much of the latest scientific research on emissions. Policymakers cannot merely replicate it in their H2 standards – they will have to supplement it with their own set of science-based guardrails.

The missing science in the ISO hydrogen standard

The hydrogen standard still ignores the latest science on several fronts.

First, it overlooks the range of emissions impacts associated with electricity use

For electrolyzers claiming to be running on renewable power, three key factors greatly affect the level of emissions: where the electricity is sourced from, whether it was available during the hour of use, and whether or not it would have already served some other use. If these factors are not accounted for, renewable hydrogen could actually increase climate warming.

The impact of these three factors is widely acknowledged, and elements have been incorporated into U.S., EU and UK standards for hydrogen. For example, the EU requires renewable hydrogen — including imports from other countries — to meet guardrails on all three factors to meet its regulatory definition and be eligible for subsidies.

These factors are also under consideration for electricity accounting more widely in various highly impactful accountability frameworks, including the GHG Protocol, SBTi and even ISO’s own general carbon footprint standard working group.

Yet the ISO hydrogen standard fails to require such reporting or describe why such metrics matter for emissions. This means that products following the ISO standard wouldn’t have to declare whether or not they have complied with these metrics, making their carbon footprint declaration meaningless, particularly in markets like the EU.

Second, it permits undercounting of upstream methane emissions

Upstream methane leakage represents one of the largest contributors to the climate impact of fossil-based hydrogen, and leakage rates vary widely by geography and operator. High-quality data on emission rates is now available; the UN-run International Methane Observatory offers a platform for basin-specific methane emissions rates, and the 140 plus members of the Oil and Gas Membership Partnership 2.0 have committed to strong verification practices for company-specific estimates.

Yet the ISO standard maintains the option to revert to national average leak rates, which have been widely found to underestimate compared to real measurements.

Third, it ignores hydrogen’s indirect warming potential

If hydrogen is not properly managed, fugitive or operational emissions can create a significant indirect warming impact by increasing the concentration of other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This risk has been documented by the IPCC, along with multiple international teams of scientists and the IPHE. We now estimate that every 1% of hydrogen emitted can reduce hydrogen systems’ climate benefits by about 3% in the near term.

Some geographies are proactively tackling this issue — namely the EU and UK, which are both actively involved in this body of research, have tasked their pipeline regulators and hydrogen operators respectively with leak prevention and alluded to future emissions quantification. Yet the current ISO methodology still treats hydrogen loss as harmless waste, rather than the potent climate warmer that it is.

What needs to be done?

ISO has a responsibility to reflect the latest climate science and best practices for emissions accounting. As its working group members acknowledge, this standard is designed to be a comprehensive resource for countries, able to inform hydrogen policies regardless of their own capacity or level of expertise on the subject. By failing to document climate impacts or promote transparency, ISO will fail its members and the broader hydrogen economy.

It is time to correct course.

ISO should immediately open a revision process to correct these oversights. In the meantime, policymakers must recognize the shortcomings of this standard and supplement it with their own sets of science-based guardrails.

The integrity of the hydrogen industry — the extent to which it helps meet COP30 climate objectives — is what’s at stake.

If you will be in New York next week, we invite you to join us for our session on the emissions accounting standards needed to ensure real climate benefits. Click here

[TITLE]Trump administration moves to revoke permit for Massachusetts offshore wind project:

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has moved to block a Massachusetts offshore wind farm, its latest effort to hobble an industry and technology that President Donald Trump has attacked as “ugly” and unreliable compared to fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, filed a motion in federal court Thursday seeking to take back its approval of the SouthCoast Wind project’s “construction and operations plan.'' The plan is the last major federal permit the project needs before it can start putting turbines in the water.

SouthCoast Wind, to be built in federal waters about 23 miles south of Nantucket, is expected to construct as many as 141 turbines to power about 840,000 homes in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

The Interior Department action is the latest by the Trump administration in what critics call an "all-out assault” on the wind energy industry.

Trump's administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.

The moves are a complete reversal from the Biden administration, which approved construction of 11 large offshore wind projects to generate enough clean energy to power more than 6 million homes. The projects now face uncertain futures under Trump.

Last week, the Interior Department asked a federal judge in Baltimore to cancel a previous approval by BOEM to build an offshore wind project in Maryland. The ocean agency has concluded that its prior weighing of the project's impacts was “deficient” and intends to reconsider that analysis to make a new decision, the department said.

Developer U.S. Wind has not yet begun construction, but plans for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project call for up to 114 turbines to power more than 718,000 homes.

BOEM had approved SouthCoast’s operations plan on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before Trump’s second term began.

“Based on its review to date, BOEM has determined that the COP approval may not have fully complied with the law" and "may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause," Interior said in its legal filing. The agency asked a federal judge to allow reconsideration of the project.

In a statement, developer Ocean Winds said the company “intends to vigorously defend our permits in federal court.”

"Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States,'' the statement said.

Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups, said Trump “is threatening good jobs while he pursues his senseless vendetta against offshore wind."

Pulling energy project permits and canceling lease sales isn't new. Biden revoked the permit to build the long-disputed Keystone XL oil pipeline on his first day in office, halting construction. He canceled scheduled oil and gas lease sales.

But Trump's efforts to dismantle the offshore wind industry are much more extensive than the way Biden targeted fossil fuels, said Kristoffer Svendsen, assistant dean for energy law at the George Washington University Law School. He thinks offshore wind developers will now see the U.S. as too risky.

“They have plenty of options. They can invest in Europe and Asia. There are good markets to invest in offshore wind. It's just the U.S. is not a good market to invest in,” he said.

The Trump administration has stopped construction on two major offshore wind farms, so far. One of them, the Empire Wind project for New York, was allowed to resume construction. The Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut is paused, and both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts.

The Danish energy company Orsted is building Revolution Wind. The Danish government owns a majority stake in the company.

Besides SouthCoast, the Trump administration has said it is reconsidering approvals for another wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, New England Wind. It previously revoked a permit for the Atlantic Shores project in New Jersey.

While the Draft International Standard on hydrogen production has made some real improvements relative to the starting point, it still falls short of what’s needed to provide a rigorous underpinning for the global clean hydrogen industry — and is unlikely to reach that mark by the time it’s presented ahead of COP30 in Belém.

What is the ISO standard and why does it matter?

ISO is a well-known federation made up of national standards bodies — organizations from different countries — established to create sets of global standards, which are then widely accepted as best practice in different industries, from occupational health and safety to medical device regulation. And for the last two years, ISO has been working on a new standard that sets the methodology for calculating GHG emissions associated with hydrogen production.

This standard matters for several reasons. It’s important to have a globally agreed-upon way of counting emissions — this allows, for example, Japan to know that it’s importing a clean form of hydrogen or ammonia from an American producer; an IMO member state to know it’s meeting clean fuel targets; and a country like Brazil to know whether hydrogen fits into its net-zero plans.

This particular standard will likely be influential for national policymaking around the world. While the U.S., UK and EU have already set their own standards, countries like India, Indonesia, Japan and Brazil have all referenced an intent to incorporate the ISO standard into their own national hydrogen policies.

However, widespread adoption of this standard in its current form would be problematic. It does not represent a comprehensive accounting of GHG impacts and ignores much of the latest scientific research on emissions. Policymakers cannot merely replicate it in their H2 standards – they will have to supplement it with their own set of science-based guardrails.

The missing science in the ISO hydrogen standard

The hydrogen standard still ignores the latest science on several fronts.

First, it overlooks the range of emissions impacts associated with electricity use

For electrolyzers claiming to be running on renewable power, three key factors greatly affect the level of emissions: where the electricity is sourced from, whether it was available during the hour of use, and whether or not it would have already served some other use. If these factors are not accounted for, renewable hydrogen could actually increase climate warming.

The impact of these three factors is widely acknowledged, and elements have been incorporated into U.S., EU and UK standards for hydrogen. For example, the EU requires renewable hydrogen — including imports from other countries — to meet guardrails on all three factors to meet its regulatory definition and be eligible for subsidies.

These factors are also under consideration for electricity accounting more widely in various highly impactful accountability frameworks, including the GHG Protocol, SBTi and even ISO’s own general carbon footprint standard working group.

Yet the ISO hydrogen standard fails to require such reporting or describe why such metrics matter for emissions. This means that products following the ISO standard wouldn’t have to declare whether or not they have complied with these metrics, making their carbon footprint declaration meaningless, particularly in markets like the EU.

Second, it permits undercounting of upstream methane emissions

Upstream methane leakage represents one of the largest contributors to the climate impact of fossil-based hydrogen, and leakage rates vary widely by geography and operator. High-quality data on emission rates is now available; the UN-run International Methane Observatory offers a platform for basin-specific methane emissions rates, and the 140 plus members of the Oil and Gas Membership Partnership 2.0 have committed to strong verification practices for company-specific estimates.

Yet the ISO standard maintains the option to revert to national average leak rates, which have been widely found to underestimate compared to real measurements.

Third, it ignores hydrogen’s indirect warming potential

If hydrogen is not properly managed, fugitive or operational emissions can create a significant indirect warming impact by increasing the concentration of other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This risk has been documented by the IPCC, along with multiple international teams of scientists and the IPHE. We now estimate that every 1% of hydrogen emitted can reduce hydrogen systems’ climate benefits by about 3% in the near term.

Some geographies are proactively tackling this issue — namely the EU and UK, which are both actively involved in this body of research, have tasked their pipeline regulators and hydrogen operators respectively with leak prevention and alluded to future emissions quantification. Yet the current ISO methodology still treats hydrogen loss as harmless waste, rather than the potent climate warmer that it is.

What needs to be done?

ISO has a responsibility to reflect the latest climate science and best practices for emissions accounting. As its working group members acknowledge, this standard is designed to be a comprehensive resource for countries, able to inform hydrogen policies regardless of their own capacity or level of expertise on the subject. By failing to document climate impacts or promote transparency, ISO will fail its members and the broader hydrogen economy.

It is time to correct course.

ISO should immediately open a revision process to correct these oversights. In the meantime, policymakers must recognize the shortcomings of this standard and supplement it with their own sets of science-based guardrails.

The integrity of the hydrogen industry — the extent to which it helps meet COP30 climate objectives — is what’s at stake.

[TITLE]Oil Majors Rethink Green Projects Amid Anti-ESG Push:
[TEXT]
The re-election of Donald Trump as US President has further accelerated the anti-ESG momentum, leading to rollbacks of climate action policies and executive orders banning ESG investing.

The United States has become the global epicenter of the anti-ESG movement, with a significant increase in anti-ESG bills proposed across states since 2021.

Back in 2021, Texas passed two laws that restricted the state from doing business with companies deemed hostile to the fossil fuels and firearm industries. The Lone Star State barred pensions and other state entities from investing in approximately 350 funds that promote environmental, social and governance, aka ESG investing, claiming that ESG investing does not act in the best financial interests of their clients.

To wit, the Republican-leaning state banned Wall Street giants Citigroup Inc., BlackRock Inc., Barclays Plc and members of Net Zero Banking Alliance, saying ESG is “…just a hate factory.” The anti-ESG movement has since gained traction, mostly targeting financial services like banks, pension funds and asset managers, as well as the energy sector.

And now a new report by GlobalData reveals how the U.S. has become the epicenter of a rising tide of anti-ESG sentiment across the globe. The report points to a Pleiades Strategy tracker that reveals that a total of 370 anti-ESG bills were submitted to the legislatures of 40 U.S. states between 2021 and 2024.

GlobalData notes that, whereas few of those bills were signed into law, this does not signify that the anti-ESG movement has weakened. Indeed, an analysis by Ropes & Gray found that anti-ESG bills filed in 2024 enjoyed a significantly higher rate of success than those filed in prior years, indicating that the architects of these bills are becoming more effective at drafting legislative challenges.

Not surprisingly, the anti-ESG movement has gained massive momentum since the re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. President.

Trump has rolled back many climate action policies by the previous administration, taken aim at DEI policies and passed executive orders banning ESG investing. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) has rolled back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Whereas OBBBA did not outright cancel the Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits as earlier feared, it did accelerate the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for the credit, bringing the deadline forward to December 31, 2027, from January 1, 2033, as originally envisioned in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Trump’s anti-climate actions are similar to his stance in his first term when he unraveled more than 100 climate policies. There are estimates that nearly $28 billion-worth of wind, solar, EV and battery projects have been delayed or cancelled since Trump took office, with a potential 19,000 jobs chopped.

“Since President Trump’s re-election in November 2024, the efforts of the anti-ESG movement have ratcheted up, and all companies (not just those in the financial services industry) lie within the movement’s scope,” the GlobalData report states. “Trump has unravelled much of the previous administration’s climate action policies, passed executive orders banning ESG investing and taken aim at DEI policies.”

Meanwhile, efforts by the European Union to simplify its regulatory landscape have frequently seen the bloc slide towards anti-ESG, with growing right-wing populism bolstering climate skepticism across the globe. International markets have opposed advancing ESG standards through initiatives like the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and European Green Deal that enforce sustainability criteria by requiring disclosure of ESG-related risks. GlobalData has predicted that the anti-ESG movement will ultimately impact companies across all industries, including institutions and other entities previously considered to be fully independent.

Not surprisingly, Big Oil companies have been scaling back their clean energy investments. Last year, oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) announced that it will not move forward with one of the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen projects if the federal government failed to provide tax incentives for natural gas-fed facilities. Current guidelines provide incentives for projects that produce "green" hydrogen by using water and renewable energy, but Exxon wants them extended to"blue" hydrogen from gas by trapping carbon emissions. That’s an interesting take because Exxon CEO Darren Woods previously expressed his doubts
