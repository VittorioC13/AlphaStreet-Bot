HARMAN to Acquire ZF’s ADAS Business

Stamford, Conn.--(ANTARA/Business Wire)--HARMAN International, a global leader in automotive technology and lifestyle audio, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) business of ZF Group, comprising leading automotive compute solutions, smart cameras, radars and ADAS software functions. The transaction is valued at €1.5 billion.HARMAN’s “Consumer Experiences. Automotive Grade.” strategy focuses on bringing the speed, intelligence, and intuitive experiences consumers expect from leading technology brands into vehicles, while also meeting the highest standards for automotive safety, reliability, and long-term platform support. As automakers accelerate toward software-defined vehicles (SDV), this approach enables experiences that seamlessly connect safety and assisted driving functions with comfort, connectivity, and in-vehicle intelligence. With this acquisition, HARMAN has secured strategic inroads in the ADAS and central compute platforms markets, reinforcing a foundation that anchors and advances its role in the fast-growing SDV market.By integrating ZF’s ADAS capabilities with HARMAN's flagship Digital Cockpit offerings within a centralized compute design, the acquisition bolsters HARMAN’s roadmap for next-generation vehicle architectures. The combination creates a foundation for future central compute solutions that bring assisted and automated driving solutions, safety and user experiences on a shared platform. This approach streamlines system design, reduces integration complexity, and supports more efficient innovation cycles, allowing HARMAN to enable OEMs to scale differentiated, context-aware vehicle experiences.“The industry is at an inflection point where safety, intelligence, and in-cabin experience must come together through a unified computing architecture,” said Christian Sobottka, Chief Executive Officer and President, Automotive Division, HARMAN. “With this agreement, we take a strategic step to expand our portfolio with complementary ADAS capabilities that unlock a new class of cross-domain experiences ranging from perception-informed audio cues to more personalized, situation-aware driving. Combined with HARMAN’s long-standing automotive expertise and supported by Samsung’s broader technology leadership, this positions us to help OEMs design the next generation of intelligent, empathetic, and connected vehicles.”“With HARMAN, we have found the ideal partner to fully unlock the growth and innovation potential of our ADAS business,” said Mathias Miedreich, CEO of ZF Group. “At the same time, this deal makes an important contribution to reducing our company’s debt and allows us to focus our resources on the core technologies in which ZF is a global leader.”“Samsung has a successful record of strategic acquisitions that accelerate innovation and expand what’s possible for our customers,” said Young Sohn, Chairman of the Board of Directors, HARMAN and Senior Advisor, Samsung Electronics. “Since acquiring HARMAN in 2017, the company has scaled its automotive and audio business from $7 billion to more than $11 billion today. Adding ZF’s ADAS capabilities builds on that momentum. HARMAN will further expand its technology foundation to deliver safer, more intelligent, and more intuitive in-vehicle experiences. This acquisition reinforces HARMAN’s leadership in the industry’s transformation and underscores Samsung’s long term commitment to the future of mobility.”“This transaction marks a major milestone in the execution of HARMAN’s long-term strategy and further strengthens our portfolio,” said Carolin Reichert, Chief Strategy Officer of HARMAN. “Throughout the process, we worked in a very constructive collaboration with ZF and demonstrated our ability to successfully execute a highly complex carve-out.”As part of the agreement, approximately 3,750 ZF employees across Europe, the Americas and Asia are expected to transition to HARMAN upon closing of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to receiving necessary regulatory approvals.Upon closing, HARMAN will integrate ZF’s ADAS capabilities into its centralized compute and digital cockpit roadmap, enabling OEMs to deploy more scalable, safety-integrated vehicle architectures. The companies will maintain strong support for existing programs while aligning engineering, ADAS and compute teams to accelerate innovation for next-generation platforms.HARMAN is a global leader in Lifestyle Audio and Automotive technology.

Meta Prepares Mango and Avocado to Expand Its AI Arsenal

Meta is developing a new image and video generation model code-named Mango alongside a new text-focused model called Avocado, according to The Wall Street Journal. The effort reflects Meta’s push to diversify its AI stack beyond a single family of large language models and toward more specialized systems tuned for specific tasks and modalities.

Mango is designed to handle image and video creation and editing, positioning Meta to compete more directly in multimodal generation as visual content becomes central to social media, advertising and creator tools. Avocado, by contrast, focuses on text-based reasoning and coding tasks, reinforcing Meta’s ambition to control both the visual and linguistic layers of its platforms.

The strategy signals a broader shift inside Meta toward model specialization. Rather than relying on one general-purpose model to do everything, the company is increasingly building distinct systems optimized for creative production, performance and cost control, with plans to integrate them tightly across Facebook, Instagram and other products.

Netflix Brings Storytelling into Physical Spaces

Netflix is taking its intellectual property beyond the screen with Netflix House, a permanent physical venue designed to immerse fans inside the worlds of its most popular shows and films. The locations blend interactive environments, immersive technology and data-driven personalization to turn storytelling into a walk-through experience.

Unlike short-term pop-ups, Netflix House is intended to be a year-round destination. Visitors can move through themed spaces tied to franchises such as Stranger Things and Wednesday, participate in interactive games and engage with environments that adapt based on audience behavior. The company has framed the initiative as a way to deepen engagement while opening new revenue streams tied to merchandise, food and ticketed experiences.

[TITLE]HCLTech’s software arm to acquire Antwerp-based startup Wobby for $5.2 million:
[TEXT]
HCLSoftware, the software arm of IT titan HCLTech, said on Monday that it will acquire Wobby, an Antwerp-based startup specializing in AI data analyst agents. The $5.2 million (€4.5 million) all-cash deal marks HCL’s latest move to embed "Agentic AI" — autonomous systems capable of reasoning and executing tasks — directly into its enterprise data stack.

The startup provides AI data analyst ‘Agents’ that enable users to query complex datasets through a natural language interface and receive actionable insights instantly.

The acquisition, expected to close by February 2026, is designed to bolster HCL’s Actian Data Intelligence Platform by expanding capabilities around metadata management, data catalog and data governance solutions.

“Adding Agentic AI Data Analyst capabilities will further enable customers to interact with their raw data and get fast and accurate business insights on demand,” the company said in a statement.

“Wobby provides AI Data Analyst ‘Agents’ that enable users to query complex datasets through a natural language inteęace and receive actionable insights instantly. The solution is powered by a proprietary semantic layer and agentic architecture that interprets business context, automates complex workflows and delivers high-quality analytical output at scale, complementing the knowledge graph capabilities of the Actian Data Intelligence Platform,” the statement added.

Marc Potter, CEO Actian & Portfolio General Manager of HCLSoftware’s Data & AI division, said: “Customers want self-service analytics with AI-driven insights that they can trust.”

“With Wobby, Actian provides LLM-powered natural-language analytics on a unified, governed semantic layer, enabling self-service analytics that delivers context-rich, accurate insights and a foundation for scaling GenAI initiatives with confidence,” he added.

Amra Dorjbayar, CEO and Co-Founder, Wobby said: “Combining Wobby’s capabilities with Actian Data Intelligence platform will offer customers a differentiated approach to data management.”

HCLTech acquires Telco Solutions The Wobby acquisition follows just days after HCLTech’s massive $160 million buyout of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s (HPE) Telco Solutions business. While Wobby is a tactical "acqui-hire" targeting early-stage GenAI innovation, the HPE deal is a heavy-duty asset carve-out aimed at dominating the 5G and autonomous networking segments.

Following an earlier transaction with HPE in 2024, HCLTech will, through this new acquisition agreement, further gain industry-leading intellectual property (IP), product engineering and R&D talent, and client relationships with top global Communication Service Providers (CSPs), the company had said.

[TITLE]Britain’s Top CEOs Predict the Biggest Challenges of 2026:
[TEXT]
The bosses of some of Britain’s biggest companies predict a fresh wave of challenges next year, as they absorb the impact Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves’ tax-raising budget in November.

Chief executive officers in sectors including finance, housing, gambling and hospitality told Bloomberg they’re bracing for artificial intelligence trust issues, more cyberattacks and pressure to build on Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government. Cost cuts will also be on the agenda, according to one.

“The cyberattacks that crippled companies like Marks & Spencer Group Plc and Jaguar Land Rover in 2025 will ‘inspire cyber criminals to go even further in the coming year,'” according to Adrian Cox, CEO of Beazley Plc.

Having contended with a year of higher taxes, a stagnating domestic economy, US tariffs and fears of an AI bubble, here’s what they think 2026 has in store:

Richard Oldfield, Schroders Plc

Next year will be when people stop talking and start doing when it comes to adopting artificial intelligence to boost businesses, the asset management firm’s CEO said. “If we don’t see increasing productivity and increasing profits because of that change, then you’ve really got to question actually whether it’s enabling the transformation that everyone’s talking about.”

Oldfield called for the UK to invest in itself and support the stock exchange so it can attract more foreign capital. While more listings next year — following a disappointing 2025 — would be “phenomenal,” investors need to actively allocate in those initial public offerings.

“We can give up or we can come out fighting and we, great British companies, are going to come out fighting,” he said.

Tim Martin, JD Wetherspoon Plc

“Survival” will be a key theme next year, according to the pub chain’s chairman, as hospitality companies grapple with increased costs including from a rise in employer taxes. “Any hiccup in sales will lead to real problems,” said Martin, who is a regular critic of the government in his stock exchange statements.

Given “there is a lot of disenchantment” around the government’s approach to business, Martin predicted a push in 2026 to persuade Labour to “change tack and to understand the benefits of a pro-enterprise philosophy.”

Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group Plc

Next year will see AI make “real impacts to customer experience,” the telecommunications group’s CEO predicted. With chatbots becoming fully-fledged customer agents, human staff will then be left to resolve more complex or delicate issues.

“The most successful UK companies will be those that not only invest in high-quality AI technology, but at the same time focus on their ability to deliver excellent human, personalized care when it matters most,” she said.

Adrian Blair, Trustpilot Group Plc

Sticking with that theme, the rise of AI means “trust will be harder to earn” in 2026, the head of the reviews site predicted.

Still, after two decades working in the internet sector, he’s confident AI isn’t a bubble and will bring “far-reaching and generally positive consequences.”

“The elements of the AI jigsaw puzzle, they’re all going to get better at once: chips, data models, the tooling,” he said. “People underestimate how much impact it’s going to have if you put all of this together.”

Adrian Cox, Beazley Plc

The cyberattacks that crippled companies like Marks & Spencer Group Plc and Jaguar Land Rover in 2025 will “inspire cyber criminals to go even further in the coming year,” according to the boss of the insurer.

Businesses need a “mindset shift from panic to resilience,” making them better prepared to respond to what has morphed from a basic IT challenge to a “board-level imperative,” Cox said.

Stella David, Entain Plc

Less than a year into David’s role as boss of Ladbrokes’ parent company, betting companies were hit with higher taxes in Reeves’ budget.

This poses “real risks which threaten high-street jobs and investment, and create conditions where the black market will thrive at the expense of responsible operators,” she said. Operators have already warned of job cuts and store closures, while William Hill owner Evoke Plc is considering a potential sale.

Still, David is optimistic, in part because of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Gambling companies will likely reap benefits from the football tournament in Mexico, Canada and the US, where operators have grown in recent years.

Eduardo Landin, Hochschild Mining Plc

The CEO of the gold and silver miner expects a continued rally in precious metals prices, which was spurred by supply shortages and growing demand as investors sought safe-haven assets in a geopolitically turbulent year.

For the mining sector, companies will focus on boosting margins to capitalize on this as much as possible. “It’s very good in terms of prices, but it gives us a lot of pressure in terms of reducing costs,” Landin said. “Otherwise, you’re not taking the opportunity the prices are giving you.”

Richard Houston, Deloitte UK

Cost cuts will continue to dominate businesses’ attention in the new year, according to the UK CEO of the professional services company. The emergence of steady economic growth and policy stability should revive confidence in the second half of 2026, he said.

Volatility in global trade will however persist, Houston said. He urged the UK to forge stronger links with Europe to spur growth and create jobs, as the country marks a decade from its vote to exit the EU.

Jennie Daly, Taylor Wimpey Plc

The housebuilder’s boss predicted continued momentum in planning reform, kickstarted this year by Labour. But she’d like to see see better support for first-time buyers.

“The cumulative regulatory burden and the deposit barrier remain key blockers to housing delivery and demand,” Daly said.

The Big Four -- EY, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG -- are locked in an intensifying battle with global technology majors like Accenture and Capgemini, as well as Indian IT players, as leading companies rush to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) in their technology stacks, revving up growth in their technology consulting business that is expected to bring in more than $2.5 billion between the four firms in FY26 in India.The sharp uptick in the demand is driven by India Inc changing gears quickly from pilot projects to large, company-wide AI deployments.“Client engagement around AI has roughly doubled over the past year. Increasingly, companies are now looking at AI as something that must be embedded into their main strategy. It’s no longer a side initiative,” said Rajiv Memani, chairman and CEO, EY (India region).There is a similar high client engagement story unfolding at Deloitte.“In the first five months of the current year the firm booked Rs 6,000 crore in technology sales. Of this, 27%, or around $160 million, was ‘AI-influenced’ work. The pipeline is even stronger. Out of a $2.8 billion pipeline, roughly 30% now has a GenAI or agentic AI component, and we expect that to rise to close to 60% in the future,” said Romal Shetty, CEO of Deloitte South Asia.Deloitte India follows a June to May financial cycle.He added that for Deloitte, AI-influenced means the project includes a material decision-making or reasoning layer built using AI.Consultants said clients now don’t just want standalone AI pilots, but AI integrated into wider transformation work spanning ERP, supply-chain analytics, customer relationship management and compliance.“We have seen 250% growth in AI-led transformation services. If we include AI and deep-analytics work, we have generated revenues of over Rs 600 crore in the India practice last year,” said Sanjeev Krishan, chairman, PwC India. “Over the last two years, we have invested heavily in India and at the network level, and that has helped drive growth.”Today, consultants said even for a traditional ERP implementation, tech consulting clients don’t want the old model. “They ask three things: modernise my data, build GenAI, and build agentic layers,” said Deloitte’s Shetty.Suddenly, firms are finding that AI has been injected into almost every technology consulting engagement, as clients seek quick impact, a high degree of automation and measurable returns on digital investments. "AI is now digital transformation,” said Memani. “That is how clients are looking at it.”“At KPMG, more than 80% of our technology consulting partners are working on projects with some AI component,” said Hemant Jhajhria, partner and head of consulting at KPMG in India. “In the last 14–15 months, anything that touches AI has grown nearly 20 times for KPMG India. We already have more than 200 AI use cases with leading companies, and across every function, partners are working on AI-led projects.”Initially, companies started with a lot of POCs, then they tried enterprise transformation across the stack, and now the smart ones are saying let’s narrow the scope, go to market fast, let’s narrow the risk but take initiative, he added.And the ROI question is now beginning to crop up in all AI implementation conversations. “Deloitte is now steering clients away from “cute but unscalable” AI experiments. We ask two questions: Are you solving a business problem or a tech problem? And is this scalable? AI has token costs—it is not free. So, clients must know the ROI,” said Shetty.This demand for measurable outcomes marks a shift in tone among Indian company leaders.EY’s Memani said clients were asking for production-grade AI solutions and they want enterprise systems that are integrated, governed, and secure, and they are asking very clearly
