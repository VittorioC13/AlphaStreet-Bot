[TITLE]Diginex Announces Non-Binding MOU for the Acquisition of Kindred OS and entering the Edge AI Technology market:
[TEXT]
LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diginex Limited (“Diginex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DGNX), a recognized provider of Sustainability RegTech announces the execution of a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) to acquire Kindred OS (“Kindred”), an innovator in Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), a technology that enables AI models to run locally, securely, and independently of the cloud.

While much of the AI industry is racing toward large, cloud-based AI models, Diginex hopes to chart a different path, one centered on privacy, energy efficiency, and regulatory trust. Edge AI empowers organizations to perform complex data analysis within their own infrastructure, without transferring sensitive information externally. This privacy-first architecture is particularly relevant for regulated sectors such as financial services, healthcare, and the public sector, where data sovereignty, transparency, and auditability are critical.

“Compliance and reporting are evolving from static checklists into living and evolving intelligent systems” stated Miles Pelham, Founder and Executive Chairman of Diginex. “Edge AI allows us to place trusted intelligence within an organization’s own secure IT ecosystem, which is perfectly aligned with Diginex’s mission to make compliance transparent, efficient, and responsible.”

By integrating Kindred’s Edge AI framework into its platform, Diginex aims to enable clients to automate compliance and generate AI-driven insights directly within secure environments, minimizing data risk, cost, and latency.

“Edge AI bridges the gap between innovation and regulatory integrity,” stated Lorenzo Romano, Head of M&A and Strategic Development at Diginex. “By combining Diginex’s regulatory expertise with Kindred’s local AI architecture, we aim to set a new benchmark for how AI will enhance both performance and compliance in the years ahead.”

A Strategic Milestone in Diginex’s Growth Journey

The proposed acquisition of Kindred underscores Diginex’s vision to become the global platform for Regulatory Technology powered by responsible AI, helping organizations capture, verify, and act on any data with confidence.

Kindred’s “H1 Edge AI platform” , which is designed for predictive learning, healthcare, and industrial automation, will be integrated into Diginex’s product suite to create an intelligent, privacy-preserving operating layer across Diginex’s compliance and ESG solutions.

Once Kindred’s H1 Edge AI technology is integrated, the Diginex platform will empower organizations to:

Run AI models locally to analyze ESG, risk, and any operational data without exposing sensitive information to external third party platforms or data centers

Unlock real-time compliance intelligence that continuously evolves with changing regulations on data privacy

Advance sustainability goals by reducing dependence on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures.

Why it Matters

This proposed acquisition of Kindred will strengthen Diginex’s innovation capacity and broadens its access to new markets and customer segments. By incorporating Kindred H1 Edge AI technology into its platform, Diginex aims to enhance its ability to scale responsibly and deliver long-term value to clients and shareholders, while strengthening trust and transparency with regulators.

The global Edge AI market size was estimated at USD 20.78 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 66.47 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 21.7% from 2025 to 2030. Accordingly, we believe Diginex is positioning itself to capture future opportunities as regulated industries increasingly demand privacy-first, AI-enabled compliance and ESG solutions.

The transaction contemplated by the MOU reflects Diginex’s continued commitment to advancing responsible innovation and long-term value creation.

[TITLE]Yimutian Inc. Reaches Binding Acquisition Agreement to Acquire Ningbo Xunxi Technology Co., Ltd., Strategically Expanding into the "B2B2C" Business Ecosystem:
[TEXT]
BEIJING, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Yimutian Inc. (Nasdaq: YMT, hereinafter referred to as "Yimutian" or the “Company”), a leading agricultural digital service company in China, announced that it has reached a binding acquisition agreement with Ningbo Xunxi Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Xunxi Technology” or the “Target Company”). It plans to acquire 100% of Xunxi Technology’s equity through a combination of cash and stock, with the transaction consideration to be announced later. Upon the completion of this acquisition, it will help optimize the Company's strategic layout in B2C businesses, enhance its services such as channel development and digital supply chain management, and achieve the construction of an integrated industrial chain ecosystem from “B2B” to “B2B2C”.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. After the closing of the acquisition, it is anticipated to have a significantly positive impact on the Company's revenue and earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the Company’s IPO.

Founded in Ningbo, China, Xunxi Technology is a technology-driven comprehensive e-commerce operation service provider, co-founded by Qunhua Wan, a former senior executive of NetEase, and Lei Chen, a former senior executive of Alibaba and ex-president of Xianyu business. Meanwhile, Lei Chen, co-founder of Xunxi Technology, will join Yimutian Inc. as Vice President and General Manager of Retail Business. With over 20 years of operational experience in the e-commerce industry, Lei Chen joined Alibaba in 2001. He initiated the establishment of Juhuasuan, Taojinbi, and Taobao Live Streaming, and served as the first president of Xianyu. His industry insights and practical experience will provide crucial support for the rapid expansion of Yimutian’s B2C businesses.

As China’s largest digital service enterprise for agricultural product B2B transactions, Yimutian covers the entire industrial chain from agricultural production to bulk circulation, forming a sophisticated agricultural Industry internet service model. Xunxi Technology focuses on technology-driven channel e-commerce operations, providing core services such as corporate bulk purchasing, employee benefits, and marketing procurement for financial institutions as well as various enterprises and public institutions. It boasts distinct advantages in comprehensive supply chain resources, capabilities in developing various mall platforms, and expertise in integrated operation services and marketing planning.

Currently, Xunxi Technology has partnered with more than 1,300 brands and built a comprehensive supply chain, offering over 250,000 SKUs of products. It serves nearly 200 channel clients, including Bank of Ningbo, Hangzhou Customs, and Jiangnan University, covering high-value scenarios across multiple sectors such as finance, government services, and education, with a member base exceeding two million. Its strategic cooperation project with the Headquarters of Bank of Ningbo — the “Better Life Mall” tailored for the bank’s members — stands as a benchmark project in 2025. Within the first month of its launch, the mall recorded over 40,000 transactions with a total turnover exceeding US$1.4 million. The core corporate bulk purchasing business of the “Better Life B2B Welfare Mall” is expected to achieve a turnover of more than US$49 million in 2025.

Following the acquisition, Yimutian Inc. will deeply integrate Xunxi Technology’s core capabilities in full-category supply chain management, channel client development, and C-end consumer goods supply. This will enable the diversified expansion of its online business from a B2B platform to a “B2B2C” ecosystem, covering the entire chain from upstream agricultural cultivation and midstream circulation to downstream end consumption. The move will further diversify Yimutian’s revenue structure and consolidate its leading position in China’s agricultural digital economy sector.

Jinhong Deng, chief executive officer of Yimutian, commented that: “The integration of Xunxi Technology’s accumulated supply chain resources and channel advantages with Yimutian’s digital agricultural infrastructure will continuously create long-term value for shareholders. It will unlock more market opportunities in agricultural product distribution, corporate bulk purchasing, and digital marketing services, propelling Yimutian’s agricultural industrial internet towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and diversified development path.”

[TITLE]GUOYUAN SECURITIES: Harnessing Global Vision and Local Expertise to Navigate New Opportunities in China's Capital Markets:
[TEXT]
HEIFE, China, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amid profound shifts in the global economic landscape and ongoing reforms in China’s financial markets, GUOYUAN SECURITIES CO., LTD. (hereinafter referred to as “GUOYUAN SECURITIES”), a leading provider of integrated financial services in China, is strategically combining global vision with deep local insight to build a bridge that connects domestic and international investors to China’s new engines of growth.

As China accelerates the two-way opening of its capital markets, fundamental shifts are reshaping investment logic. GUOYUAN SECURITIES believes this presents a historic opportunity for forward-thinking institutions and investors.

“We are at a critical juncture, transitioning from reliance on ‘hard resources’ to a focus on ‘soft power,’” said a representative from GUOYUAN SECURITIES. “The key to future success lies in accurately anticipating policy directions, uncovering value along the industrial value chain, and managing risk effectively.”

In-Depth Research Drives Value Discovery

One of GUOYUAN SECURITIES’ core strengths lies in its deep research capabilities rooted in the Chinese market.

From equity investment during the incubation stage to investment banking services in the growth phase, and asset management and wealth planning in the maturity stage, GUOYUAN SECURITIES has built a comprehensive financial services ecosystem that supports enterprises throughout their entire lifecycle.

Its investment banking division stands out in facilitating the listing of technology-driven companies on platforms such as the STAR Market and ChiNext, helping specialized and sophisticated enterprises that produce new and unique products connect with capital markets.

Embracing Digital Transformation and Sustainable Development

In parallel, the firm has deeply integrated ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles into its investment decision-making and risk management processes. It is also proactively supporting China’s dual carbon goals by directing capital toward future-oriented industries.

Looking ahead, GUOYUAN SECURITIES will continue to leverage its strong local foundation and increasingly global network to serve as both a connector and a value discoverer—bridging global capital with high-quality Chinese assets. Together with its clients, the firm is committed to seizing the vast opportunities arising from China's high-quality development.

[TEXT]
Broadcom (AVGO) stock has appreciated considerably in 2025, driven by the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) demand. The semiconductor and software giant’s stock has climbed more than 50% year-to-date. This surge has already propelled Broadcom past the $1 trillion mark in 2025, with its market capitalization now hovering around an impressive $1.65 trillion.

[TITLE]Credo Technology Up 38% in Three Months: Can the Stock Climb Higher?:
[TEXT]
Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd (CRDO) has rallied 38% in the past three months, driven by accelerating business momentum as hyperscalers and data center operators aggressively invest in AI infrastructure. Fiscal first quarter revenues jumped 274% year over year while non-GAAP operating income was $96.2 million (compared with $2.2 million in the prior year).

The company ended the fiscal first quarter with a fortified balance sheet boasting a cash position of $479.6 million, giving it ample flexibility to invest in innovation and inorganic expansion.

The rally has outpaced the Electronic-Semiconductors and the broader Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 17.4% and 10.2%, respectively. The gains are also higher than some of its competitors, including Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Astera Labs (ALAB). AVGO and MRVL have gained 15% and 17.6%, respectively, over the same time frame, while ALAB has declined 7.8%.

The big question now: Can Credo stock continue to climb higher from here, or has it already priced in much of the near-term upside?

Let us take a closer look at CRDO’s fundamentals, growth drivers, competitive advantages and potential risks, and assess whether it is wise to stay invested.

Multiple Catalysts Reinforcing Momentum for CRDO

Credo’s business momentum is buoyed by its extensive clout in the Active Electrical Cables (AECs) space. AECs, which serve as power-efficient alternatives, have seen explosive adoption. These cables offer up to 1,000 times more reliability with 50% lower power consumption than optical solutions, added CRDO. In the last reported quarter, the AEC product line increased by healthy double digits sequentially. The adoption from intra-rack to rack-to-rack deployments is expected to boost further revenues from this product line.

Traction in the optical business and PCIe and Ethernet retimer businesses is another key catalyst. The company is investing heavily in both copper and optical solutions to diversify its market position. Its optical DSP segment maintained strong momentum, positioning the company to achieve a doubling of optical revenues again in the current fiscal year. CRDO added that recently launched PCIe retimer solutions were gaining “significant traction” and expects PCIe design wins in 2025 with production revenues in 2026. The PCIe-based solutions for AI scale-up networks expand CRDO’s addressable market.

Zacks Investment Research

Frequent product launches across segments are expected to drive top-line growth. Last week, CRDO unveiled a memory fanout gearbox called Weaver within its new product family, OmniConnect. This gearbox is designed to accelerate memory bandwidth and density, optimizing the computing efficiency of AI accelerators. The new ZeroFlap (“ZF”) optical transceiver product line is crafted to deliver superior reliability, energy efficiency and stability for AI backend networks. Supporting 400G, 800G and 1.6T speeds, the ZF optical portfolio addresses a key industry challenge, optical link flaps, where connections repeatedly drop and reconnect, disrupting network performance.

[TITLE]Multi-Tenant Data Centers Business Analysis Report 2025: Market to Reach $91 Billion by 2030, Driven by Growing Demand for Scalable IT Infrastructure and Rise in 5G Deployments:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Multi-Tenant Data Centers - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Multi-Tenant Data Centers was estimated at US$47.9 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$91.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Multi-tenant data centers (MTDCs) have become an essential part of the global digital infrastructure, providing a shared space for multiple organizations to house their data and IT assets. The rise of cloud computing and the rapid increase in data generation have created a strong demand for scalable and cost-effective data management solutions, driving the growth of MTDCs.

These centers allow companies to benefit from the latest data storage technology without the burden of high upfront capital expenditure and maintenance costs. MTDCs offer better flexibility, enhanced security features, and customizable options to meet individual business needs, making them a preferred choice over traditional on-premises data centers. Furthermore, the increased reliance on IT services across industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce means that MTDCs offer a solution that can effectively support these sectors` digital transformation needs.

What Factors Are Driving the Growth of the Multi-Tenant Data Centers Market?

The growth in the multi-tenant data centers market is driven by several factors, including the increasing adoption of cloud computing services, the expansion of digital economies, and the need for scalable and cost-effective IT infrastructure. One key driver is the growing demand for hybrid cloud solutions that require a reliable and secure physical backbone, which MTDCs provide. The rise of data-intensive technologies such as IoT, AI, and big data analytics has also led to an increased need for facilities capable of handling large volumes of data, pushing more organizations to adopt MTDC solutions.

Additionally, the emphasis on sustainability and green practices in data center operations has attracted enterprises that prioritize environmentally conscious partnerships. The proliferation of 5G technology and the resulting need for edge computing capabilities have further boosted the market, as MTDCs help reduce latency by providing strategically located data processing points. Lastly, regulatory requirements for data localization in various regions have pushed companies to leverage MTDCs to maintain compliance without the heavy investments needed for building standalone facilities.

How Is Cloud Adoption Revolutionizing the MTDC Landscape?

The cloud adoption trend is reshaping the MTDC market as enterprises seek hybrid cloud solutions that combine the benefits of public and private clouds with on-premises systems. MTDCs play a crucial role in this integration by providing a middle-ground that facilitates workload portability and seamless connectivity between different environments. This trend has spurred demand for MTDC services, especially from businesses focusing on disaster recovery and business continuity solutions.

The colocation model offered by MTDCs enables companies to access a high-performance, low-latency network infrastructure without the complexity of managing their own data centers. In addition, the rise of IoT (Internet of Things) devices has contributed to data volume growth, pushing the need for more data center space and capacity. MTDCs are thus at the forefront, providing the infrastructure needed to handle the immense data generated from interconnected smart devices.

What Role Does Sustainability Play in Shaping the Future of MTDCs?

Sustainability is increasingly becoming a focal point in the development of MTDCs. Data centers are known to consume vast amounts of energy, prompting significant environmental concerns. As a result, operators of MTDCs are investing heavily in renewable energy sources, energy-efficient cooling solutions, and green building designs to reduce their carbon footprints.

This focus on sustainability has not only improved the operational efficiency of data centers but has also become a critical factor for enterprises when choosing a data center partner. The trend toward carbon-neutral operations is motivated by both regulatory pressures and a growing preference among customers for eco-friendly IT solutions. To meet this demand, MTDC providers are integrating technologies like liquid cooling, waste heat recycling, and even partnerships with utility companies to ensure their operations contribute less to greenhouse gas emissions.

[TITLE]Wealthtech scouts for pros to go beyond metros:
[TEXT]
ETtech

As venture-funded wealthtech firms expand their operations beyond metro cities, targeting new customer segments, the competition to hire relationship managers (RMs) and private bankers is intensifying. This is straining the limited talent pool in the sector and driving up operating costs in the wealth management segment, according to industry executives.The demand for experienced professionals is far outpacing supply, with firms aggressively poaching from banks, brokerages and traditional wealth managers, they said.In addition, many of these RMs are starting up as mutual fund distributors or personal wealth managers, resulting in a further strain on the talent pool.In some cases, compensation packages for RMs have surged 50-100% over the past six months as competition sharpens between legacy players and well-funded entrants, including the likes of Dezerv , Ionic Wealth and Centricity Stockbroking firm Groww, in order to diversify from its core operations and enter the wealth management segment, recently acquired wealthtech platform Fisdom in a transaction valued at $140-160 million.“From conventional banks and NBFCs (non-banking finance companies) to stockbroking, fintech and wealthtech firms, and even large teams of experienced relationship managers who are now starting on their own, everyone is looking to hire people,” Srikanth Subramanian, CEO and cofounder of Ionic Wealth, told ET.“Since it was an industry which had a limited supply pool and limited players, it’s the same supply pool which is being attracted by all. Hence, it is giving this mirage of being a talent war and the price of recruitment has gone up. Once the dust settles, people will take position and recruit people who fit their bill,” he said.Ionic Wealth by Angel One currently employs

Enterprise AI Infrastructure

Fireworks AI raised $250 million in Series C funding at a $4 billion valuation to expand its enterprise-ready AI platform. The company helps organizations use and customize large language models more efficiently, cutting both costs and delays in deploying them.

Fireworks says its systems run open-source models up to 40 times faster and eight times cheaper than comparable commercial providers, processing over 10 trillion tokens a day for more than 10,000 clients. Its platform supports “compound AI systems,” which allow multiple models to work together to complete complex tasks. The round, co-led by Lightspeed and Index Ventures, signals growing investor interest in infrastructure that helps businesses scale AI in secure and affordable ways.

Growth in Vertical AI

Legora raised $150 million in Series C funding at a $1.8 billion valuation to modernize how law firms and corporate legal teams interact with clients. Its platform replaces email and shared drives with a secure online portal where clients can view documents, sign contracts and track updates in real time.

The system allows firms to automate templates and maintain privacy standards while creating a consistent, branded client experience. Legora now serves over 400 legal teams in 40 countries, more than doubling its customer base since mid-2025, showing that even conservative industries are adopting AI-driven workflow tools.

Beacon Software raised $250 million in Series B funding to expand its approach to upgrading older software used in everyday industries. Instead of building new products, Beacon acquires established software companies in sectors like logistics, education and recreation and integrates modern AI capabilities into their platforms.

The company describes itself as an “AI-first modernization firm” that combines engineering with investment capital to help traditional businesses catch up with digital transformation. The new funding will support acquisitions and the development of shared tools that automate operations and bring analytics to previously manual processes.

Metropolis Technologies secured $1.6 billion in a mix of equity and debt financing, including a $500 million Series D, valuing the company at about $5 billion. Metropolis uses AI and computer vision to automate payments in parking lots. Its system identifies vehicles and charges customers automatically, eliminating tickets and kiosks.

The company operates in more than 4,200 locations and serves 50 million users. The funding will help expand into drive-thru restaurants, gas stations and retail sites as part of what it calls the “Recognition Economy,” where identity and vehicle recognition replace checkout lines.

Healthcare Agentic AI and Neurotech

In healthcare, Hippocratic AI raised $126 million in Series C funding at a $3.5 billion valuation led by Avenir Growth. The company designs generative AI assistants that help healthcare organizations handle administrative and patient-facing tasks safely. These assistants can schedule appointments, answer coverage questions or provide follow-up guidance, all under clinical oversight.

Hippocratic AI reports more than 115 million patient interactions without a safety issue, a milestone that underscores its focus on reliability and compliance.

Neurotechnology firm Synchron raised $200 million in Series D funding to advance its Stentrode brain-computer interface. Unlike traditional implants that require open-brain surgery, Synchron’s device is inserted through blood vessels, making it less invasive and safer for patients.

The technology allows people with paralysis to control computers using their thoughts. The new capital will support large-scale production and clinical testing in New York and San Diego as the company moves toward commercial use.
