Avride said on Thursday it is scaling up the testing of its vehicles in Dallas, as the autonomous technology startup prepares to launch robotaxis on Uber.

Autonomous technology companies have been entering into partnerships with ride-hailing and delivery startups to commercialize robotic food deliveries.

Avride had announced a broader partnership with Uber in October last year and its delivery robots were launched on the Uber Eats platform in Austin in November which were later expanded to Dallas and Jersey City.

By the end of the year, Avride's autonomous vehicles will join the Uber platform as robotaxis, bringing both the startup's products to the same platform.

"Soon, Uber riders will have a new way to move around the city, marking another step toward making autonomous transportation part of everyday life," said Sarfraz Maredia, Uber's head of autonomous mobility & delivery.

The robotaxi fleet in Dallas will leverage Hyundai Motor's cutting-edge IONIQ 5 EV platform, integrated with Avride's autonomous driving technology.

Avride partnered with Hyundai to expand its fleet of robotaxis in March this year, and signed a deal with the South Korean automaker to jointly develop and operate self-driving vehicles.

The startup has also collaborated with food delivery company Grubhub to deploy its robots on college campuses across the United States.

[TITLE]Figure Technology targets $526M in IPO amid crypto listing wave:
[TEXT]
Figure aims to raise $526M in IPO, valuing the blockchain lender at $4.3B.

IPO momentum grows as Gemini, Kraken, and Bullish drive the crypto listing wave.

Figure shifts from lending roots to blockchain finance, boosting investor interest.

Blockchain-focused lender Figure Technology Solutions is preparing to raise $526 million through its upcoming initial public offering (IPO), according to regulatory filings submitted Tuesday and reported by Bloomberg Law.

The company intends to sell 21.5 million shares priced between $18 and $20 each, with 4.9 million shares expected to come from existing holders.

At the high end of the price range, the IPO would assign the company a valuation of roughly $4.3 billion.

Figure first signaled its public market ambitions last month when it filed confidentially with regulators, followed by a formal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on August 18.

The latest filings suggest the company is targeting September 10 for its IPO pricing date.

The firm’s valuation has steadily increased since its 2021 Series D funding round, when it raised $200 million in a deal led by 10T Holdings that valued the company at $3.2 billion.

More recently, Figure reported financial momentum, with revenues reaching $191 million in the first half of 2025.

From consumer lending to blockchain infrastructure

While Figure is now recognized for its blockchain-driven financial products built on the Provenance Blockchain, the company originally focused on consumer lending.

Its first offering was a digitized home equity line of credit for US homeowners, before expanding into blockchain infrastructure designed to streamline lending, securitization, and related processes.

By leveraging blockchain technology, Figure has positioned itself at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized systems, aiming to deliver faster, more transparent, and cost-effective financial solutions.

This pivot has helped the company differentiate itself from fintech rivals while attracting investor interest in its long-term growth prospects.

Crypto IPO momentum builds

Figure’s listing effort comes as more crypto and blockchain firms move toward the public markets during the ongoing bull market cycle.

On Tuesday, the crypto exchange Gemini also filed for an IPO, seeking to raise $317 million.

Rival exchange Kraken is rumored to be pursuing a $500 million raise at a valuation of around $15 billion, though reports suggest it may delay its public debut until 2026.

Meanwhile, several high-profile listings have already set a precedent this year.

In August, digital asset exchange operator Bullish launched its IPO with shares priced at $37, soaring as much as 218% on its first trading day.

Despite a pullback, Bullish still maintains a market capitalisation of roughly $9.6 billion, up from its IPO valuation of $4.8 billion.

Similarly, stablecoin issuer Circle completed an IPO that raised about $1.1 billion, with shares more than doubling on the first day of trading. The company now commands a market capitalization of approximately $30 billion.

Gemini, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ crypto exchange also readying for its public debut, with the firm aiming to raise $317 million at a valuation of $2.2 billion.

Beyond traditional IPOs, the industry is exploring alternative routes.

A group of crypto executives recently launched Bitcoin Infrastructure Acquisition Corp, a Cayman Islands-based special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) targeting a $200 million raise through an IPO.

[TITLE]Linde in advanced talks to set up Dholera plant:
[TEXT]
German industrial gases supplier Linde said it is in advanced stages of finalising the setting up of a new plant in Dholera and partnering with large electronics customers to serve the semiconductor ecosystem coming up in the region, the company's deputy business head – South Asia Milan Sadhukhan told ET.Linde has over 1,000 operating plants and delivers specialty gases and tailored support for semiconductor, solar, and display industries. The company said it is well placed to serve the fabs in India owing to its strong local presence as well as a robust global supply chain of electronics gases which are already quailed for fabs in Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and the US."We are investing early to be ready to meet the requirements of upcoming electronics projects in Dholera," Sadhukhan said. "We already have a strong footprint in Gujarat, with capacities in Dahej and Sanand. Our plan for capacity addition in Dholera is now in advanced stage, and we are looking forward to partnering with large electronics customers in that region."ET was the first to report on February 21 that Linde was looking to set up a facility to support semiconductor manufacturing in India.Sadhukhan explained that gas demand in electronics projects takes time to ramp up, and it is not economically feasible to meet the initial low demand from on-site gas plants which are designed for the full capacity. So, during that period, an industrial gases player is needed to bring in liquefied gas to meet the initial demand.He said the Dholera plant will deal with multiple gases. It will have all bulk gases - oxygen, nitrogen and argon. Nitrogen and argon are particularly important for semiconductors."It will also have speciality gases which are required in addition to a warehouse and capabilities for mixing of speciality gases where gases can come from different places, but the mixing, storing, testing, quality control, all will happen at one place. It'll be a large facility," he said.Linde already has two air separation plants in Gujarat, at Dahej. Another plant is currently being constructed in Dahej and will be ready sometime end of next year. These assets are to provide adequate back-up reliability and meet the initial demand ramp of upcoming electronics projects in Gujarat. Further, the company said they were also planning to add capacity around the electronics clusters to augment their footprint in Gujarat.

[TITLE]US senator wants to give Americans first dibs on AI silicon:
[TEXT]
+Comment US lawmakers are looking to apply Trump's America-First agenda to advanced semiconductors by giving US buyers first dibs while restricting the sale of most high-end chips needed for AI to the rest of the world.

"Artificial Intelligence is a transformative technology and United States policy should ensure that United States persons, including small businesses, startups, and universities are in the best position to innovate and harness the potential of artificial intelligence," the "Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence" or GAIN AI Act of 2025 reads.

If approved by Congress and signed into law by the president, the legislation, introduced as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act by Senator Jim Banks (R-IN), would require exporters seeking licenses to countries of concern to certify US buyers had the right-of-first-refusal on advanced silicon. It would also make vendors meet all domestic demand before they can flog their wares to foreign customers.

The rules would enact new trade restrictions mandating that exporters obtain approval from the US Commerce Department for any shipment of advanced semiconductors exceeding steep performance caps, which we've covered in depth previously.

"It should be the policy of the United States and the Department of Commerce to deny licenses for the export of the most powerful AI chips including such chips with total processing power of 4,800 or above and to restrict the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to foreign entities so long as United States entities are waiting and unable to acquire those same chips," the proposed legislation reads.

These performance caps, which were enacted in large part during the Biden administration, were designed to prevent the United States' most powerful chips from reaching countries of concern, most notably China.

As these rules are written, most high-end datacenter GPUs and some gaming cards, like Nvidia's RTX 5090, would be subject to license restrictions.

Unsurprisingly, Nvidia isn't a fan of the proposed rules, which we'll emphasize again have not been signed into law.

"The AI Diffusion Rule was a self-defeating policy, based on doomer science fiction, and should not be revived. Our sales to customers worldwide do not deprive U.S. customers of anything — and in fact expand the market for many U.S. businesses and industries," an Nvidia spokesperson told El Reg.

[TITLE]AI Data Centers Near Tax Break With $165 Billion of Phantom Debt:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- Doña Ana County in New Mexico is the furthest thing from a tech hub.

Located near the US Southern border in the Chihuahuan Desert, the region is known for its chile pepper farms and New Mexico State University. Now, county officials are trying to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom by considering a $165 billion debt package and a sweeping set of tax incentives to become home to a data center campus.

Doña Ana County commissioners voted four to one last week to advance a resolution that would provide tax breaks to the backer of a massive development dubbed Project Jupiter. The plan calls for four AI-oriented data centers as well as power generation, battery storage and micro-grid facilities near Santa Teresa, New Mexico.

The proposal isn’t a real obligation of the county. Instead, it’s a way for local governments in New Mexico to give tax subsidies to corporations. The bonds also wouldn’t be sold to debt investors, instead they would be purchased by an an affiliate or parent of the company, according to a county resolution. The projects will be self-funded, it noted.

BorderPlex Digital Assets, an Austin-based firm, is facilitating the development in partnership with STACK Infrastructure, a data-center operator owned by Blue Owl Capital, which is constructing the facilities. After the data centers are built, STACK typically leases out the capacity to technology companies.

Through the transaction, Doña Ana County will acquire the data-center campus, leasing it back to the company for the term of the bonds. The corporation will then acquire the project when the debt matures, which is a maximum of 30 years.

Because the county will own the land, it is exempt from property taxes, Christopher Muirhead, a lawyer on the deal, said during an Aug. 26 commission meeting.

The deal — known as an industrial revenue bond — also allows the purchase of data-center equipment to be free from state sales levies. The $165 billion represents the total amount of investment in the project and was calculated by the company in their bond application, Muirhead said in an interview.

“This is critical, it is not a debt of Doña Ana County,” Muirhead said. “This large number — $165 billion — is not a debt of the county, it is not money the county is providing the company, it is not an obligation the county will ever be asked to repay.”

Public hearings on the transaction are set for later this month, when commissioners will take final votes on the ordinances. If approved, construction is expected to begin this year.

In return for the break, the company will pay $300 million to the county in payments-in-lieu-of-taxes — known as PILOTs — over time. It’s estimated the project will create roughly 2,500 construction jobs and 750 permanent positions, according to BorderPlex’s presentation to the county.

BorderPlex projects $5 billion in construction spending over the next decade, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a February release.

The project will be privately financed with no risk to taxpayers, according to an Aug. 28 statement from STACK. A spokesperson for BorderPlex declined to comment, referring further comments to the STACK release. A spokesperson for STACK declined to comment.

A popular economic development tool, more than 100 series of such industrial revenue bonds have been issued in New Mexico since the 1980s to support companies including Meta Platforms, Inc., Intel Corp. and Walmart Inc., according to a 2018 report from a law firm based in Albuquerque.

The surge in demand for AI has touched off a expansion of data centers that house the semiconductors necessary to build, grow and run the systems. ChatGPT creator OpenAI alone is expecting to drop trillions of dollars on infrastructure in the coming years. Such a quick-growing industry caused a frenzy among states and local governments for the developments, shelling out tax incentives to lure new projects.

It also provoked a backlash over corporate subsidies and the enormous resources required to power and cool the sprawling facilities. Data centers typically employ fewer people than a factory, making the economic trade-off less rosy compared to the construction of a manufacturing plant.

In Doña Ana, residents pressed commissioners on how the project might strain already-limited water supplies and cut into revenues for schools and infrastructure. Project Jupiter’s data centers will be designed with a cooling system designed to minimize water use, STACK said.

Supporters of the deal contend that Project Jupiter will position the county as a leader in advanced computing.

“By securing digital infrastructure today, New Mexico is investing in its economy to build a more prosperous tomorrow,” Governor Lujan Grisham said in February.
