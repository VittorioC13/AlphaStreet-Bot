[TITLE]Oil Executives Brace For Another Tough Year Ahead:
[TEXT]
The oil markets are looking to finish the year on the back foot, with oil prices falling again amid expectations of a supply glut and Russia-Ukraine peace talks reviving. Nearly half of oil executives in the Dallas Fed’s latest survey have reported that their companies’ outlooks have worsened in the current year compared with last year as low oil prices take a toll.

“Decreasing oil prices are making many of our firm's wells noneconomic,” one executive said in the new survey.

“Natural gas is becoming an expense to operators. Last month, we paid our gas purchaser to take our gas because prices fell below contract price, and we paid the difference to the purchaser. Never in my 50 years in the oilfield has this ever happened. The result is, natural gas can be an expense to the production process with huge downsides to our predicted economics for profits on oil and gas developments,’’ lamented another executive.

Oil executives expect oil markets to remain depressed, with respondents projecting West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices to finish 2026 at $62 per barrel, lower than the average of $65.32 per barrel that the EIA has projected for 2025. For some context, the EIA projects Brent crude to average $55.08 per barrel in 2026 while WTI is expected to average $51.42 per barrel. Oil executives expect oil markets to be oversupplied in 2026 if the Trump administration succeeds in ending the Ukraine conflict and Russian sanctions are lifted; however, if Russian sanctions continue, along with reduced oil volumes from Iran and Venezuela, markets may approach a balanced position. The energy leaders are more bullish

[TITLE]AI-driven data centres to lift demand for gensets in India: Cummins:
[TEXT]
Engine and genset manufacturer Cummins Group is betting big on India’s data centre boom, with the 106-year-old US company expecting the country to emerge as one of the world’s fastest-growing data centre markets, on par with the US, China and Europe.Shveta Arya, Cummins Group's India region leader, said India was moving beyond data storage to power-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, increasing demand for reliable backup power.“By nature, data centres – whether they store data or process it – require 99.99% uptime. Backup power is critical, and that is where we come in,” Arya told ET.The AI boom remains favourable for Cummins and its generator sets, she added.Arya said India has a significant opportunity to convert data into digital assets. “We believe India is moving towards that phase, where both global and domestic players will train AI models locally and unlock the value of India’s data by digitising and analysing it.”Despite the strong demand outlook, Arya said challenges remain for data centre development in India. According to her, one of the biggest bottlenecks is site readiness. “Finding the right site, preparing it and securing the necessary approvals takes time,” she said, adding that the challenge is not technological in nature.In 2024-25, Cummins India sold over 25,000 generator sets and delivered more than 7,000 MW of power to customers across the country, according to its annual report.The company said demand is being driven by sectors that require uninterrupted, high-reliability power, with data centres, healthcare, commercial real estate, manufacturing and infrastructure emerging as key focus areas.Equipment manufactured in India is exported to markets across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, the company said.Beyond large data centres, Cummins is also targeting demand from quick commerce and commercial infrastructure.The company’s Indian operations, headquartered in Pune, recently launched an 82.5 kVA genset designed for quick commerce warehouses , commercial establishments, infrastructure projects, and construction sites.“When platforms such as Zepto, Swiggy or Zomato set up warehouses or cold storage facilities, they need reliable backup power. This genset is rightly sized for such warehouses,” Arya said.She added that in warehouse applications, return on investment is a key consideration. Customers want to maximise space for storage rather than allocate it to large gensets. “By reducing footprint and fuel consumption, we aim to lower operating costs for customers,” she said.Arya said hydrogen may be the fuel of the future, but felt the transition may not happen anytime soon. “It is not a light-switch transition. You cannot move from diesel to hydrogen overnight,” she said, adding that the shift could take 30 to 40 years.She said global research on hydrogen has also slowed due to limited collaboration. “When countries work together, progress is faster. Right now, that is not happening enough,” Arya said.Cummins already has a hydrogen internal combustion engine ready and expects it to be available commercially by around March 2027. “Customers were very interested a few years ago, but today they are cautious because hydrogen production in India has not scaled up,” she said.Arya said hydrogen has long-term potential for India as it can be produced locally and reduce dependence on imports. If made using renewable energy such as solar power, it can also be a zero-carbon fuel. However, hydrogen remains expensive and difficult to store and transport.Cummins India, a listed arm of Cummins Group, reported a strong performance for the September 2025 quarter with a 41.3% rise in net profit to Rs 637 crore. The company's shares closed at Rs 4,385 apiece on the NSE on Thursday.

[TITLE]Nigerian Petroleum Regulators Pledge Reforms to Boost Invest:
[TEXT]
President Bola Tinubu’s nominees for the leadership of Nigeria’s petroleum regulators on Thursday pledged sweeping reforms aimed at plugging value leakages, restoring discipline across the sector and unlocking fresh investments under the Petroleum Industry Act.

The nominee for the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Oritsemeyiwa Eyesan, and her counterpart at the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Saidu Mohammed, made the commitments during their screening by the Senate at Room 117 shortly after plenary.

Both nominees told lawmakers that digitisation, strict contract enforcement, credible data management and accelerated gas development would be central to their leadership, as Nigeria seeks to reposition its oil and gas industry amid declining revenues and global energy transition pressures.

Eyesan, who is slated to head the upstream regulator, said weak data integration and heavy reliance on manual processes were costing the country enormous value in an industry that is rapidly becoming digital worldwide.

“We are still largely manual, while the world is moving at jet speed. Without digitisation and real-time data, you cannot truly understand what you are regulating, and you will continue to lose money,” she said, stressing that effective oversight depends on accurate numbers, asset integrity monitoring and transparent systems.

She told the committee that collaboration between regulators, operators and policymakers would be key to addressing long-standing bottlenecks in the upstream sector. “We must collaborate with stakeholders, identify our pain points, and address them collectively. That is how we move the needle forward,” Eyesan added.

The NUPRC nominee assured senators that she would fully deploy the Petroleum Industry Act as a regulatory tool to attract fresh investments and ensure Nigeria remains competitive in the global energy market, describing the law as a “valuable document” whose gains depend on proper implementation.

A graduate of Economics from the University of Benin, Eyesan spent nearly 33 years at the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited and its subsidiaries, retiring as Executive Vice President, Upstream.

She highlighted her role in resolving disputes with international partners, restoring investor confidence during divestment threats, and facilitating multi-billion-dollar deep offshore investments.

She also recalled signing Nigeria’s first non-associated gas development contract and contributing to an increase in crude oil production from about 1.3 million barrels per day to 1.8 million barrels per day during her tenure.

“Having worked as an operator and participated in resource development, I believe I have the competence to regulate the industry and ensure we maximise the enormous opportunities before us,” she told the committee.

On his part, Mohammed, the nominee for the midstream and downstream regulator, placed emphasis on restoring discipline to Nigeria’s gas and petroleum supply systems through strict enforcement of contracts and quality standards.

“Gas is not a favour; it is a commodity. It must be sold based on enforceable contracts from the producer to the transporter and the end-user,” he said, arguing that weak contractual frameworks had contributed to persistent gas shortages, particularly in the power sector.

He noted that uninterrupted gas supply to some power plants was only possible where contracts existed, and obligations were clearly defined, adding that enforcing the Gas Network Code would help stabilise the system and rebuild investor confidence.

Mohammed also warned against neglecting domestic refining and processing capacity, cautioning that failure to protect local value could see the sector suffer the same fate as Nigeria’s once-thriving textile industry.

While backing exports, he said domestic needs must come first to guarantee energy security. The NMDPRA nominee pledged to revive pipeline transportation of petroleum products, attract billions of dollars in investments for gas processing infrastructure, and strengthen quality assurance through in-house laboratory facilities.

“You cannot enforce quality if you do not have the capacity to test and certify products yourself,” he said. Born in Gombe in 1957, Mohammed is a chemical engineering graduate of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, with decades of experience across the oil and gas value chain.

He has served as Managing Director of the Nigerian Gas Company and Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company, as well as Group Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, at NNPC.

Reacting, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream), Senator Sumaila Kawu, said the screening was taking place at a critical moment for the country, noting that boosting energy production and efficiency was central to Nigeria’s economic recovery.

He disclosed that further engagements with the nominees would continue into January to deepen legislative–regulatory collaboration. The Senate is expected to consider the committee’s report in the coming days and move towards confirming the nominees, a step that would mark a new phase in the regulation of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry under the Tinubu administration.

The nominations followed the resignation of the pioneer chief executives of both agencies, Gbenga Komolafe of the NUPRC and Farouk Ahmed of the NMDPRA, who were appointed in 2021 after the Petroleum Industry Act came into force.

[TITLE]11 House Democrats Help GOP Pass 'Disastrous' Pro-Polluter Permitting Bill:
[TEXT]
Eleven Democrats on Thursday voted with nearly all Republicans in the US House of Representatives to advance a permitting reform bill that climate and frontline organizations warn is a "disastrous" attack on a landmark environmental protection law.

Democratic Reps. Jim Costa (Calif.), Henry Cuellar (Texas), Don Davis (NC), Chris Deluzio (Pa.), Lizzie Fletcher (Texas), Jared Golden (Maine), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Adam Gray (Calif.), John Mannion (NY), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), and Marc Veasey (Texas) voted with all Republicans present expect Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.) to pass the bill.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, spearheaded by Golden and House Committee on Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), would amend the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which "is often called the 'Magna Carta' of federal environmental laws."

In a statement after the vote, Food & Water Watch legal director Tarah Heinzen said that "for decades, NEPA has ensured logical decision-making and community involvement when the federal government considers projects that could harm people and the environment. The SPEED Act would eviscerate NEPA's protections."

The group detailed key ways in which the SPEED Act attacks NEPA:

Drastically limiting NEPA's scope of review: Removes many actions from NEPA review altogether, potentially allowing factory farms and coal plants to build and expand without any environmental review or public input;

Drastically limiting NEPA's scope of review: Removes many actions from NEPA review altogether, potentially allowing factory farms and coal plants to build and expand without any environmental review or public input; Limiting agency accountability: Creates unreasonably short deadlines to challenge inadequate reviews, and limits courts’ ability to stop unlawful projects; and

Putting polluter profits above science and the environment: Turns NEPA on its head by requiring agencies to prioritize corporate interests over the public interest and limiting their ability to consider the best science.

"Today's absurd House vote is yet another handout to corporate polluters at the expense of everyday people who have to live with the real-world impacts of toxic pollution from dirty industries like fossil fuels and factory farms," Heinzen argued. "This nonsense must be dead on arrival in the Senate."

Other campaigners also looked to the upper chamber after the vote. Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, said that "renewable energy and climate advocates in the Senate must hold the line against the SPEED Act's evisceration of our bedrock environmental and community protection law."

Allie Rosenbluth, Oil Change International's US campaign manager, stressed that "our senators must stand up against the SPEED Act's attempts to undermine democratic decision-making, pollute our communities, and threaten our collective future."

For a Better Bayou's James Hiatt similarly said that "the SPEED Act protects corporate interests, not the public, and it should be rejected by any senator who claims to stand with the people."

Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright, co-coordinator of Black Alliance for Peace's Climate, Environment, and Militarism Initiative, warned that the bill "represents yet another assault on the health of frontline, Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor white communities that have been designated as sacrifice zones by big polluters who bribe lawmakers with big money to continue a culture of extract, slash, burn, and emit at the expense of oppressed and marginalized peoples."

"Rather than speeding up the approval of dirty projects, Congress should increase funding for federal agencies and grassroots organizations accountable to frontline communities to carry out legally defensible and accurate environmental analyses," he continued, pointing to the Environmental Justice for All Act, previously led by the late Democratic Congressmen Raúl Grijalva (Ariz.) and Donald McEachin (Va.).

Mar Zepeda Salazar, legislative director at Climate Justice Alliance, also pointed to that alternative: "The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for. Instead of pushing the SPEED Act—a bill that would strip away what few legal protections communities still have, weaken safeguards for clean air, land, and water near new industrial development, and sidestep meaningful consultation with federally recognized tribal nations—Congress should be advancing real, community-driven permitting reform."

"Examples include the Environmental Justice for All Act, which lays out meaningful public engagement, strong public health protections, respect for tribal sovereignty and consultation obligations, and serious investments in agencies and staff," she said.

Representatives from the Institute for Policy Studies, Sacred Places Institute for Indigenous Peoples, and Unitarian Universalists for Social Justice also spoke out against what David Watkins, director of government affairs for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, condemned as "a sizable holiday gift basket for Big Oil and Gas." He, too, urged the Senate to "reject this retrograde legislation and stand up to the deep-pocketed, polluting industries lobbying for it."

Lauren Pagel, policy director at Earthworks, pointed out that passing the SPEED Act wasn't the only way in which the House on Thursday "chose corporate interests over people, Indigenous Peoples' rights, and our environment." It also passed the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which "will remove already-scarce protections for natural resources and sacred cultural sites in US mining law."

"Today's House votes are a step backwards for our nation, but we continue to stand firm for the rights of the people and places on the frontlines of oil, gas, and mining," Pagel said. "Communities and ecosystems shouldn't pay the price while corporations rush to profit off extraction—with a helping hand from our elected officials."

Along with those two pieces of legislation, Public Citizen pointed to the House's approval of the Power Plant Reliability Act and Reliable Power Act earlier this week. David Arkush, director of the consumer advocacy group's Climate Program, said that the bills advancing through Congress "under the guise of 'bipartisan permitting reform' are blatant handouts to the fossil fuel and mining industries."

"We need real action to lower energy bills for American families and combat the climate crisis," Arkush asserted, calling on congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump "to fast-track a buildout of renewable energy, storage, and transmission—an approach that would not just make energy more affordable and sustainable, but create US jobs and bolster competitiveness with China, which is rapidly outpacing the US on the energy technologies of the future."

[TITLE]MTEF 2026-2028: Reps, Senate clash over oil benchmark:
[TEXT]

The House of Representatives on Thursday approved the 2026–2028 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper, endorsing a crude oil benchmark of $64.85 per barrel for the 2026 fiscal year, in contrast to the $60 benchmark adopted by the Senate.

The House also approved a total proposed federal expenditure of N54.46tn for 2026, comprising N31.83tn as Federal Government retained revenue and N20.38tn in new borrowings, covering both domestic and foreign loans.

The approval followed the adoption of the report of the joint Committees on Finance and National Planning during plenary, after the House dissolved into the Committee of Supply, chaired by Deputy Speaker Benjamin Kalu.

As contained in the framework, key fiscal parameters were sustained, including debt service estimated at N15.52tn; pensions, gratuities and retirees’ benefits of N1.376tn; and a fiscal deficit of N22.63tn. Also approved were capital expenditure (exclusive of transfers) of N20.13tn; statutory transfers of N3.152tn; and a sinking fund projected at N388.54bn.

In addition, the House sustained total recurrent (non-debt) expenditure of N15.27tn, alongside special interventions for recurrent and capital spending pegged at N200bn and N14bn respectively.

With the passage of the MTEF and FSP, all legislative requirements have been concluded, clearing the way for President Bola Tinubu to present the 2026 budget estimates to a joint session of the National Assembly on Friday.

Earlier, the Speaker Tajudeen Abbas read a letter from the President confirming his readiness to personally lay the budget before the lawmakers in line with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).

According to the communication, Tinubu, “In his capacity as President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, will present the proposed 2026 budget estimates at 2 pm on Friday.”

Speaking ahead of the consideration of the report, Kalu explained that the joint committees made 10 recommendations, all of which were adopted unanimously by the House.

The committees, in their report, stated, “In the light of the above findings, the Committees recommend that the projected crude oil benchmark prices of $64.85, $64.30 and $65.50 per barrel for 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively, be sustained.”

They also recommended sustaining domestic crude oil production projections of 1.84mbpd, 1.88mbpd and 1.92mbpd for 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively.

On exchange rate assumptions, the report read, “The projected exchange rates for 2026, 2027, and 2028 are N1,512, N1,432, and N1,383, respectively, and should be sustained in line with CBN’s policy to stabilise the naira and promote effective fiscal and monetary policy coordination.”

The committees further sustained inflation projections of 16.5 per cent, 13 per cent and 9 per cent for 2026, 2027 and 2028, noting the commitment of monetary authorities to curb inflationary pressures. On economic growth, the report stated, “The GDP growth rate is projected at 4.68 per cent, 5.96 per cent and 7.9 per cent for the years 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively.”

It added, “The real GDP growth rate projected at 4.68%, 5.96% and 7.9% for the years 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively, be sustained in anticipation of the gains of tax reforms.”

The committees also recommended the implementation of a National Scanning Policy within the National Single Window of the Nigeria Revenue Services, noting that the initiative would “enhance revenue assurance, improve trade facilitation, reduce leakages, and strengthen transparency and national security.”

Following the approval, Speaker Abbas announced that the House would reconvene on Tuesday, December 23, 2025, to consider the report of the House Committee on Appropriations on the repeal and re-enactment of the N43.56 2024 budget.

Meanwhile, President Tinubu has transmitted the 2025 statutory budget proposal of the Niger Delta Development Commission to the National Assembly, barely 13 days to the end of the year.

In a letter accompanying the proposal, the President said the budget was prepared in line with Section 121 of the 1999 Constitution, adding that it aligns with the Federal Government’s fiscal and developmental priorities under the Renewed Hope Agenda.

According to the letter, the proposal also reflects the 2024–2026 Economic Recovery Growth Plan and key assumptions of the 2025 Appropriation Act. Tinubu noted that the NDDC would prioritise youth employment and empowerment, energy and power supply, education, industrial and enterprise development, health security, and agricultural productivity, to lift more citizens out of poverty.

[TITLE]Unsold Nigerian Crude: A Sign of Global Oil Market Surplus:
[TEXT]
Nigerian crude oil sellers are struggling to find buyers on the global market, even as the Dangote Petroleum Refinery recently cried out over the low supply of the feedstock locally.

According to a Reuters report on Thursday, West African crude oil sellers are struggling to find buyers for up to December 26- and January-loading cargoes due to stiff competition from plentiful and cheaper alternative supplies.

[TITLE]Oil Holds Gains:
[TEXT]
Oil edged higher for a second day as geopolitical risks in Venezuela and Russia offered support to prices.

Oil edged higher for a second day as geopolitical risks in Venezuela and Russia offered support to prices that have been weighed down by a bearish oversupply outlook.

West Texas Intermediate rose 0.4% to settle above $56 on Thursday, a day before the January contract expires. The more-active February contract exhibited similar gains.

The prospect of US military action in oil-rich Venezuela, which currently accounts for less than 1% of world crude output, has boosted supply concerns. President Donald Trump this week ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers docking in the Latin American country but refrained from outlining his next moves during a televised address.

The US is also preparing a fresh round of sanctions on Russia’s energy sector over its war in Ukraine even as the US and Kyiv’s European allies have considered security guarantees to ensure any peace deal would hold.

“If no peace deal is reached, the attacks on Russia could escalate, quickly tightening supplies,” said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities Inc. “If you add in the blockade on Venezuelan oil, crude prices may very well be a bit underpriced here.”

Oil is still on track for the worst annual loss since 2018 as global supplies eclipse demand. Benchmark US crude futures dipped to a four year low in recent days before the spike in tensions pushed prices higher. Market metrics from the Middle East to the US have been flashing signs of underlying weakness.

In Venezuela, oil-storage facilities and tankers at terminals are quickly filling up, according to people familiar with the situation. If those facilities reach maximum capacity, state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela SA could be forced to shut in wells. Meanwhile, oil companies are telling the White House that they are uninterested in returning to Venezuela in the event that President Nicolás Maduro leaves, POLITICO reported.

If oil does make any sharp moves in the coming week, it will come as activity has thinned in the run-up to next week’s Christmas break. That could amplify price moves, lifting volatility.

Meanwhile, heating oil futures declined. On the US East Coast, where the distillate pool is burned in furnaces, weekly diesel output reached its highest since September 2019.

Engine and genset manufacturer Cummins Group is betting big on India’s data centre boom, with the 106-year-old US company expecting the country to emerge as one of the world’s fastest-growing data centre markets, on par with the US, China and Europe.Shveta Arya, Cummins Group's India region leader, said India was moving beyond data storage to power-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, increasing demand for reliable backup power.“By nature, data centres – whether they store data or process it – require 99.99% uptime. Backup power is critical, and that is where we come in,” Arya told ET.The AI boom remains favourable for Cummins and its generator sets, she added.Arya said India has a significant opportunity to convert data into digital assets. “We believe India is moving towards that phase, where both global and domestic players will train AI models locally and unlock the value of India’s data by digitising and analysing it.”Despite the strong demand outlook, Arya said challenges remain for data centre development in India. According to her, one of the biggest bottlenecks is site readiness. “Finding the right site, preparing it and securing the necessary approvals takes time,” she said, adding that the challenge is not technological in nature.In 2024-25, Cummins India sold over 25,000 generator sets and delivered more than 7,000 MW of power to customers across the country, according to its annual report.The company said demand is being driven by sectors that require uninterrupted, high-reliability power, with data centres, healthcare, commercial real estate, manufacturing and infrastructure emerging as key focus areas.Equipment manufactured in India is exported to markets across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, the company said.Beyond large data centres, Cummins is also targeting demand from quick commerce and commercial infrastructure.The company’s Indian operations, headquartered in Pune, recently launched an 82.5 kVA genset designed for quick commerce warehouses , commercial establishments, infrastructure projects, and construction sites.“When platforms such as Zepto, Swiggy or Zomato set up warehouses or cold storage facilities, they need reliable backup power. This genset is rightly sized for such warehouses,” Arya said.She added that in warehouse applications, return on investment is a key consideration. Customers want to maximise space for storage rather than allocate it to large gensets. “By reducing footprint and fuel consumption, we aim to lower operating costs for customers,” she said.Arya said hydrogen may be the fuel of the future, but felt the transition may not happen anytime soon. “It is not a light-switch transition. You cannot move from diesel to hydrogen overnight,” she said, adding that the shift could take 30 to 40 years.She said global research on hydrogen has also slowed due to limited collaboration. “When countries work together, progress is faster. Right now, that is not happening enough,” Arya said.Cummins already has a hydrogen internal combustion engine ready and expects it to be available commercially by around March 2027. “Customers were very interested a few years ago, but today they are cautious because hydrogen production in India has not scaled up,” she said.Arya said hydrogen has long-term potential for India as it can be produced locally and reduce dependence on imports. If made using renewable energy such as solar power, it can also be a zero-carbon fuel. However, hydrogen remains expensive and difficult to store and transport.Cummins India, a listed arm of Cummins Group, reported a strong performance for the September 2025 quarter with a 41.3% rise in net profit to Rs 637 crore. The company's shares closed at Rs 4,385 apiece on the NSE on Thursday.

[TITLE]11 House Democrats Help GOP Pass 'Disastrous' Pro-Polluter Permitting Bill:
[TEXT]
Eleven Democrats on Thursday voted with nearly all Republicans in the US House of Representatives to advance a permitting reform bill that climate and frontline organizations warn is a "disastrous" attack on a landmark environmental protection law.

Democratic Reps. Jim Costa (Calif.), Henry Cuellar (Texas), Don Davis (NC), Chris Deluzio (Pa.), Lizzie Fletcher (Texas), Jared Golden (Maine), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Adam Gray (Calif.), John Mannion (NY), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), and Marc Veasey (Texas) voted with all Republicans present expect Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.) to pass the bill.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, spearheaded by Golden and House Committee on Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), would amend the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which "is often called the 'Magna Carta' of federal environmental laws."

In a statement after the vote, Food & Water Watch legal director Tarah Heinzen said that "for decades, NEPA has ensured logical decision-making and community involvement when the federal government considers projects that could harm people and the environment. The SPEED Act would eviscerate NEPA's protections."

The group detailed key ways in which the SPEED Act attacks NEPA:

Drastically limiting NEPA's scope of review: Removes many actions from NEPA review altogether, potentially allowing factory farms and coal plants to build and expand without any environmental review or public input;

Drastically limiting NEPA's scope of review: Removes many actions from NEPA review altogether, potentially allowing factory farms and coal plants to build and expand without any environmental review or public input; Limiting agency accountability: Creates unreasonably short deadlines to challenge inadequate reviews, and limits courts’ ability to stop unlawful projects; and

Putting polluter profits above science and the environment: Turns NEPA on its head by requiring agencies to prioritize corporate interests over the public interest and limiting their ability to consider the best science.

"Today's absurd House vote is yet another handout to corporate polluters at the expense of everyday people who have to live with the real-world impacts of toxic pollution from dirty industries like fossil fuels and factory farms," Heinzen argued. "This nonsense must be dead on arrival in the Senate."

Other campaigners also looked to the upper chamber after the vote. Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, said that "renewable energy and climate advocates in the Senate must hold the line against the SPEED Act's evisceration of our bedrock environmental and community protection law."

Allie Rosenbluth, Oil Change International's US campaign manager, stressed that "our senators must stand up against the SPEED Act's attempts to undermine democratic decision-making, pollute our communities, and threaten our collective future."

For a Better Bayou's James Hiatt similarly said that "the SPEED Act protects corporate interests, not the public, and it should be rejected by any senator who claims to stand with the people."

Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright, co-coordinator of Black Alliance for Peace's Climate, Environment, and Militarism Initiative, warned that the bill "represents yet another assault on the health of frontline, Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor white communities that have been designated as sacrifice zones by big polluters who bribe lawmakers with big money to continue a culture of extract, slash, burn, and emit at the expense of oppressed and marginalized peoples."

"Rather than speeding up the approval of dirty projects, Congress should increase funding for federal agencies and grassroots organizations accountable to frontline communities to carry out legally defensible and accurate environmental analyses," he continued, pointing to the Environmental Justice for All Act, previously led by the late Democratic Congressmen Raúl Grijalva (Ariz.) and Donald McEachin (Va.).

Mar Zepeda Salazar, legislative director at Climate Justice Alliance, also pointed to that alternative: "The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for. Instead of pushing the SPEED Act—a bill that would strip away what few legal protections communities still have, weaken safeguards for clean air, land, and water near new industrial development, and sidestep meaningful consultation with federally recognized tribal nations—Congress should be advancing real, community-driven permitting reform."

"Examples include the Environmental Justice for All Act, which lays out meaningful public engagement, strong public health protections, respect for tribal sovereignty and consultation obligations, and serious investments in agencies and staff," she said.

Representatives from the Institute for Policy Studies, Sacred Places Institute for Indigenous Peoples, and Unitarian Universalists for Social Justice also spoke out against what David Watkins, director of government affairs for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, condemned as "a sizable holiday gift basket for Big Oil and Gas." He, too, urged the Senate to "reject this retrograde legislation and stand up to the deep-pocketed, polluting industries lobbying for it."

Lauren Pagel, policy director at Earthworks, pointed out that passing the SPEED Act wasn't the only way in which the House on Thursday "chose corporate interests over people, Indigenous Peoples' rights, and our environment." It also passed the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which "will remove already-scarce protections for natural resources and sacred cultural sites in US mining law."

"Today's House votes are a step backwards for our nation, but we continue to stand firm for the rights of the people and places on the frontlines of oil, gas, and mining," Pagel said. "Communities and ecosystems shouldn't pay the price while corporations rush to profit off extraction—with a helping hand from our elected officials."

Along with those two pieces of legislation, Public Citizen pointed to the House's approval of the Power Plant Reliability Act and Reliable Power Act earlier this week. David Arkush, director of the consumer advocacy group's Climate Program, said that the bills advancing through Congress "under the guise of 'bipartisan permitting reform' are blatant handouts to the fossil fuel and mining industries."

"We need real action to lower energy bills for American families and combat the climate crisis," Arkush asserted, calling on congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump "to fast-track a buildout of renewable energy, storage, and transmission—an approach that would not just make energy more affordable and sustainable, but create US jobs and bolster competitiveness with China, which is rapidly outpacing the US on the energy technologies of the future."

[TITLE]Munich Re Offers Geothermal Risk Insurance in State-Backed Drive:
[TEXT]
Insurer Munich Re and Germany’s KfW Development Bank are introducing a state-backed program to mitigate the financial risk of geothermal drilling and encourage exploration for the renewable heat and power source.

Geothermal power is an abundant energy source that can provide clean electricity and heat crucial for meeting net zero goals, and is expected to make up a sizable share of Germany’s future heating needs. But the big upfront costs needed for drilling can often exceed future returns if a project fails, something which has deterred investment.

To address that, the German government is working with private firms to ease geothermal financing challenges, in what Munich Re says is the first such insurance policy based on a public-private partnership in Europe.

Munich Re will insure 30% to 70% of a loan for a feasible project, and KfW will grant a partial debt waiver if unsuccessful exploration leads to a claim, according to a statement. Berlin will support that with €600 million ($705 million) in guarantees and €50 million in budget funds as part of efforts announced Thursday to attract private capital for various industries.

“We want to solve the problem that geothermal projects are not yet bankable because the outcome of a drilling operation is completely unclear,” said Matthias Tönnis, a geologist and underwriter at Munich Re.

While geothermal power has big potential, it made up just 0.5% of electricity generated from renewables in the European Union in 2024. Germany has recently taken steps to speed up the expansion of the sector. It aims to have at least 65 additional projects by 2030, which would raise the share of geothermal energy used for heating 10-fold compared to the current level.

The insurance is a positive signal that shows “the great potential of geothermal energy in Germany is being recognized politically,” said Herbert Pohl, chief executive officer of geothermal company Deutsche Erdwärme.

Munich Re previously pioneered geothermal insurance before scrapping it, and has returned because generating heat is technically less challenging than producing electricity, and because there are more projects.

Blackrock Monopolizes The Grid

InfoWars.com ^ | December 18th, 2025 1:10 PM | Bowne Report

Posted on by E. Pluribus Unum

In a move that’s raising alarms across the nation, BlackRock through its 2024 acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) has surged into direct ownership of U.S. energy infrastructure, shifting from passive investor to hands on controller of critical utilities and grids.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved a $6.2 billion takeover of Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, by a BlackRock led consortium with Canada Pension Plan in October 2025, granting private equity majority control over power serving 150,000 customers. Meanwhile, GIP is in advanced talks for a potential $38 billion acquisition of AES Corporation, a major player with renewable assets nationwide. In Texas, BlackRock’s footprint grows via GIP owned firms like Eolian, developing massive battery storage projects such as the 400 MW/1.8 GWh Padua Complex near San Antonio to stabilize ERCOT amid retiring fossil plants and exploding AI driven demand. After retreating from ESG commitments and exiting net zero alliances under political pressure, Texas removed BlackRock from its fossil fuel boycott list in June 2025, paving the way for deeper ties including Larry Fink co hosting energy investment summits with state leaders.

Summary of Video Transcript

The transcript from an InfoWars report by John Bowne criticizes BlackRock's expansion into U.S. energy infrastructure following its 2024 acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).It highlights BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's positive view of infrastructure investing as a "golden age," driven by decarbonization, AI demand, and capital needs.The report alleges BlackRock is shifting to direct ownership and control of critical utilities, potentially prioritizing profits over affordable rates.Specific claims include:

A BlackRock-led consortium (with Canada Pension Plan) gaining approval in October 2025 for a $6.2 billion takeover of ALLETE (parent of Minnesota Power), serving 150,000 customers, despite opposition from consumer advocates concerned about rate hikes and reduced accountability.

GIP in advanced talks for a potential $38 billion acquisition of AES Corporation, a major renewable energy player.

BlackRock's investments in Texas projects, such as battery storage via GIP-owned firms, to support grid stability amid AI growth and fossil plant retirements.

It mentions a Texas Attorney General lawsuit against BlackRock over ESG policies allegedly manipulating energy markets, and notes Blackstone's separate ongoing process to acquire the Texas-New Mexico grid operator (TXNM Energy).

The report expresses concerns that private equity firms, having exhausted retail sectors, are targeting infrastructure, potentially loading debt on utilities, subsidizing big tech, and eroding public oversight.

[TITLE]Fusion deal: Why Trump Media is merging with TAE Technologies:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump's social media company will provide the capital needed to bring TAE Technologies' first fusion power plant online in the United States by 2031, TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer told CNBC on Thursday.

Binderbauer spoke shortly after his privately held company and Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans for an all-stock merger valued at more than $6 billion.

The CEO said the deal would combine Trump Media's "fortress balance sheet" with TAE's technologies.

"We've got capability and technology to really scale this," Binderbauer told CNBC.

"We've got the engineering prowess to do that, but the last piece of the puzzle was the capital," he said. "Now, you're marrying capital with that underlying base of technical capability."

Fusion is a form of nuclear power that could one day generate enormous amounts of energy by fusing atoms. The process, which powers the Sun, does not produce the long-life radioactive waste that is the byproduct of fission, the process created in traditional nuclear reactors.

Despite decades of research, scientists and companies have so far been unable to commercialize fusion technology. Fusion ignition was only achieved for the first time in a laboratory setting in December 2022.

But Binderbauer said he is bullish on his company's prospects to reliably generate — and sell — fusion power, now that it can tap funding from Trump Media.

Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app, will invest up to $200 million in TAE with another $100 million coming after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binderbauer said.

Trump Media has meager revenue relative to its market capitalization, which was above $4 billion on Thursday, and to its balance sheet.

For the third quarter that ended on Sept. 30, Trump Media had financial assets of $3.1 billion, which included cash and digital assets, the company announced last month.

Trump Media for that quarter reported a net loss of $54.8 million, with sales of just under $973,000.

TAE and Trump Media said that their merged company in 2026 plans, subject to regulatory approval, to "site and begin construction on the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant," which would generate 50 megawatts of electrical power, an industry measurement.

TAE has plans to scale up future fusion power plants to generate between 350 to 500 megawatts of power, Binderbauer said. A traditional fission nuclear power plant can generate

[TITLE]Data centre expansion must align with energy security and wider social needs, review finds:
[TEXT]

Data centre growth must serve rather than “complicate” wider societal and economic needs, as well as electricity system security, a major review of Ireland’s energy system has found.

The report on Ireland’s energy security was developed by the Department of the Environment with the International Energy Agency.

It outlines that rapid growth in demand for electricity is a “defining characteristic” of the next decade, with demand from data centres projected to double by 2035, and total demand across the system also doubling between 2023 and 2035.

The IEA developed a model - the adapted transition pathway - to illustrate how economic, environmental and social goals are advanced through the electricity sector.

The paper outlines that data centre capacity is anticipated to consume at least 30 per cent of the country’s power supply in 2030, and by 2035 “it is the sector with the highest electricity consumption in the adapted transition pathway”.

The report will be launched by Minister for the Environment Darragh O’Brien at the IEA headquarters.

It notes that while there is an expectation that technological advancements will reduce the intensity of how data centres consume electricity, these effects remain uncertain while “accelerated growth poses system planning and security challenges”.

[ New data centres may need additional electricity supply close to Ireland’s peak demandOpens in new window ]

It outlines that data centres are a key contributor to economic growth in the State but that “rapidly rising power demand must be accommodated in a manner that serves - rather than complicates - both system security and wider societal and economic needs.”

Under new rules published this month by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, data centres will have to meet at least 80 per cent of their annual energy demand with additional renewable electricity projects generating in the Republic of Ireland.

The report also flags the impact of growth in demand for electricity in housing and transport - outlining that while data centre growth is significant, it also tends to take place in a few more centralised locations which allows for more effective planning.

But it says that switching to electric cars or residential heat systems powered by electricity is driven by more decisions from a greater number of individuals “involving less predictable personal preferences”.

While there should be clarity in the run-in to 2035, “uncertainty
