[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: India’s consumer and retail sector witnessed a decisive rebound in the Sept quarter, with deal volumes rising to 132 and values crossing $3.4 billion, nearly four times higher than previous quarter.The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel and accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce , Grant Thornton Bharat’s Q3 2025 Consumer and Retail Dealtracker report showed.A total of 97 PE/VC deals worth $1.3 billion were registered during the third quarter, more than doubling in value QoQ. Investors focused on festive-led categories — apparel, e-commerce, and consumer electronics — with notable rounds for VIP Industries, Zepto, Jumbotail, and Miko, it said.The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints. There were 24 M&A deals worth $955 million, led by domestic consolidation in food processing and apparel. Big-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue and Titan’s purchase of Damas Jewellery anchored the rebound, while outbound activity revived with five cross-border acquisitions.With policy tailwinds and festive demand, investor confidence remains strong across consumption-linked sectors. Six IPOs and five QIPs raised over $1.1 billion, led by Urban Company, Bluestone Jewellery, Tilaknagar, and Lenskart, reflecting renewed investor appetite for consumer names. Naveen Malpani, consumer industry leader Grant Thornton Bharat, said: “The festive quarter reaffirmed e-commerce’s role as a structural engine of consumption. Online festival sales have already crossed Rs 60,700 crore in the opening week, up about 29 % YoY, with more than half of the Rs 1.2 lakh crore projected festive GMV logged early.”

[TITLE]Consumer and retail sector recorded deal activity valued at $3.4 billion in September quarter:
[TEXT]
Consumer and retail sector witnessed robust deal momentum recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion in Q3 CY2025 marking a rebound.

According to Grant Thornton Bharat’s Consumer and Retail Dealtracker, the sector witnessed robust deal momentum in Q3 2025, recording a total of 132 transactions valued at $3.4 billion, up 6 per cent in volumes and 9 per cent in value compared to Q3 2024, including public market activity. Excluding public market deals, M&A and PE deal activity accounted for 121 deals worth $2.3 billion, marking a 168 per cent increase in value quarter on quarter, it added.

“The surge was driven by five high-value deals above $100 million and 26 deals above $10 million, together contributing $2 billion or 89 per cent of total deal value, signalling strong investor confidence in scale, brand strength, and growth-oriented consumer businesses,” it added.

Naveen Malpani, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat said, “Q3 marked a decisive rebound for India’s consumer and retail sector. The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel & accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce. These categories reflect the intersection of traditional strengths and digital disruption shaping India’s consumption story. The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints.”

Festive season

While textiles, apparel, and accessories remained a top focus, attracting significant M&A and private equity inflows, food processing and e-commerce segments benefited from festive season momentum, with online sales surging and quick commerce capturing growing consumer attention.

“The rise in average deal size to $18.8 million from $7.2 million in Q2 highlights a shift toward value-driven transactions, underpinned by larger, capital-intensive deals and selective strategic investments across the sector,” it added.

Meanwhile, food processing, FMCG and textile sector lead M&A deal activity. “These sectors drove deal activity, accounting for 67 per cent of volumes and nearly 94 per cent of values. Large-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue ($488 million) and Titan’s acquisition of Damas Jewellery ($283 million) anchored the rebound,” the report added.

[TITLE]5 GPO Buildings on Dublin’s Henry Street on sale for €2.7m:
[TEXT]
Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM) is seeking €2.7 million through agent Bannon for 5 GPO Buildings, on Henry Street in Dublin city centre. The sale of the retail investment property offers the prospective buyer an initial yield of 13.5 per cent.

Acquired by Irish Life in 2015 as part of its wider €154 million purchase of a collection of eight retail units and five office blocks known as the Sovereign portfolio from Royal London Asset Management, 5 GPO Buildings comprises a ground floor and basement “lock-up” retail unit extending to a total area of 165sq m (1,774sq ft). Located within the historic GPO building, the entire property is let to phone retailer Three Ireland and sublet to international jewellery brand Lovisa. There are three years remaining on the existing lease and the current rental income is €410,000 a year. Three Ireland have vacated the property, and it is sublet under licence to Lovisa Ireland Limited at an annual rent of €175,000, expiring one month before the Three Ireland lease. Should Lovisa decide to sign a new lease agreement at that point, the purchaser of the property could reasonably expect to secure at least the same annual rent, according to the selling agent.

Brian Morton of Bannon says: “Number 5 GPO Buildings offers the opportunity to acquire a high-yielding prime retail asset located within one of the country’s most historic buildings”.

[TITLE]With two months to Christmas, here's what retail leaders expect for holiday shopping:
[TEXT]
There's just two months until Christmas Eve, and retailers are meeting a more cautious shopper with earlier offerings.

Most retailers won't report third-quarter results or updated holiday expectations until just before Thanksgiving, largely considered the sector's most important week of the year. By then, many shoppers will have already started checking off holiday shopping lists.

Amazon's October Prime Day sales event and competitors' ever-earlier Black Friday deals grab some portion of the holiday wallet share. The unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season comes as executives point to a bifurcation in consumer spending, with lower-income consumers feeling the strain on their budgets, and as a government shutdown and tariff costs threaten purchasing power.

Kohl's is among the retailers chasing holiday shopping early with hopes of boosting the total haul.

"We want to make sure we're driving that early consideration knowing that they're shopping early," Kohl's Chief Marketing Officer Christie Raymond said at a media event earlier this month.

The off-mall department store is starting its holiday marketing campaign next week, a week earlier than last year, when it waited until after the election. In the coming days it will be breaking out the rest of the holiday merchandise not already set out in stores.

A key part of Kohl's holiday strategy is to capture shoppers not only early, but often.

Raymond said during the last holiday season, between November and January, shoppers made "15 plus trips" on average to stores across the industry, but checked out with smaller baskets. Those findings were based on a survey that Kohl's conducted with a third-party research firm.

"[Consumers are] doing the work to get what they want at the price they want to pay," she said.

While Academy Sports and Outdoors CEO Steve Lawrence agreed that shoppers are savvy when it comes to price monitoring, he said he expects customers "to aggregate their spending around those key shopping moments on the calendar where they know they can get the best deals."

Both Kohl's and Academy Sports cater largely to a middle-income shopper. Still, Lawrence said consumers are paying close attention to discount events.

"If we run the same promotion this year that we ran last year, there's higher take rate on it," he said. "I think that's a sign customers are really savvy, and they're figuring out when it's the right time to shop."

Over 1 million people in Massachusetts will probably be left without food because of the government shutdown in the United States, according to Gov. Maura Healey. If things do not get better before November 1, 2025, and federal money for food stamps remains frozen, more than a million people in the US state will end up bearing the brunt of the funding lapse.Besides Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, New York, and Texas are also on the verge of losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Massachusetts is one of the states across America that could lose the benefits starting next Saturday (November 1, 2025).SNAP provides benefits to low-income families so they can buy groceries. It includes benefits for adults who might otherwise face hunger and malnutrition. These benefits were earlier known as food stamps. SNAP benefits include monthly funds on an EBT card to buy food. More fruits and vegetables when you use your EBT card at participating HIP farms, SNAP Path to Work free education and training opportunities, Free nutrition education classes and resources, Connections to other kinds of help, like utility discounts, free school meals, and discounted admissions to many Commonwealth museums and cultural institutions via EBT Card to CultureThe US Department of Agriculture oversees the federal food stamps program. The department stated that the lapse in appropriations because of the shutdown will leave them with "insufficient funds" to pay full benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in November, according to CBS News.Both the USDA and the White House have refused to comment on the looming issue. According to the Greater Boston Food Bank, one in three residents in Massachusetts faced food insecurity in 2024.On normal days, SNAP beneficiaries receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use to buy produce, meat, dairy, and other household food staples, according to CBS News. Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP.While speaking on the prevailing situation, Governor Healey stated that Massachusetts doesn't have the ability to backfill those benefits. She said that it is because state funding can't match the amount of federal funding the state gets for SNAP."Two hundred forty million dollars a month is what the state receives, its residents receive from the federal government for these benefits, so you can't begin to make this up," said Healey, as quoted by CBS News.While speaking at a news conference on Friday (October 24, 2025) in Roxbury, Healey said her administration is partnering with local food banks and organizations, including Project Bread and the United Way, to help families. They announced the creation of the United Response Fund, hoping to generate donations."Those who have the means, this is the time to step up," Healey said. She further stated that she is planning to make a donation herself. The Massachusetts governor is also calling on President Trump to release contingency funds to keep SNAP going while the government is shut down. She asserted that children, the elderly, and the disabled will be impacted the greatest.

[TITLE]SNAP recipients told to buy shelf-stable food or go to food banks as funding deadline looms:
[TEXT]
Recipients of SNAP food assistance benefits across the country face a looming deadline: Come Nov. 1, their cards may not get refilled because of the government shutdown in Washington.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which serves nearly 42 million people each month, allocates money to states on a monthly basis. Benefits were largely uninterrupted over the past three weeks because funding for October was allocated to states before the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

But in a letter to SNAP state agency and regional directors on Oct. 10, the Department of Agriculture warned that there would not be enough funding to pay full SNAP benefits — also known as food stamps — in November if the shutdown persists.

Many states have announced that they plan to suspend SNAP benefits if the shutdown continues into next month. That could upend people’s ability to buy food on an unprecedented scale — the program has not lapsed during any government shutdown in recent history.

As Nov. 1 approaches, some state leaders are recommending that people turn to food banks or use their remaining benefits to buy non-perishable items.

“If you have accrued SNAP benefits from previous months on your account, use those funds now to buy shelf-stable foods that can last through November and beyond,” the Arkansas Department of Human Services says on its website.

But food banks say it will be impossible to fill the gap.

“There’s no way that our charitable food network or the system in this country can provide that much food overnight or quickly. It’s an impossible task,” said Catherine D’Amato, CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Her organization is already receiving calls from people asking where they can go to feed their families, she said. D’Amato estimated that suspending SNAP benefits would create a deficit of up to 56 million meals in Massachusetts in November.

At least one state, Pennsylvania, has already stopped issuing SNAP benefits. The state announced that “starting October 16, SNAP benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA.”

Texas, meanwhile, said next month’s SNAP benefits won’t be issued if the shutdown continues past Oct. 27. And in Wisconsin, SNAP recipients got a letter this week informing them that even their remaining funds from October may not carry over.

“Benefits may not be available in November,” the letter said. “This may include any funds remaining on your card at the end of October. You may want to use your benefits to stock up on food before the end of October.”

The state treasurers of Oregon and Massachusetts said Thursday on a press call that their states have no contingency plans for SNAP if the federal government doesn’t provide the funding. State budgets can’t afford to cover the full cost of people’s benefits, they added.

“At a time when the cost of groceries continues to go up, SNAP makes the difference between having enough and going hungry,” said Elizabeth Steiner, the Oregon state treasurer. “This decision on behalf of the federal government is an absolute abdication of its responsibility to families in Oregon and across the United States who are struggling to make ends meet.”

She added that “up until now, every administration, Republican or Democrat, has understood that feeding Americans is a fundamental responsibility of the federal government.”

[TITLE]Indian Motorcycle turns independent after Polaris sell-off:
[TEXT]
“Polaris and Indian Motorcycle both stand to benefit from this deal…” said Polaris Chief Executive Officer Mike Speetzen following the announcement that Polaris had sold a major portion of its stake in Indian Motorcycle to Carolwood LP, a multi-strategy private equity firm based in Los Angeles.

The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, with Indian then functioning as a stand-alone company. However, Polaris will retain a minority share in the company. Mike Kennedy, ex-Harley-Davidson exec, will assume the role of CEO of the newly independent organization.

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2025, Indian Motorcycle contributed more than US$478 million to Polaris’ revenue, which is roughly 7% of the company’s total earnings for that period. The sale of Indian will help increase Polaris' EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) by about $50 million, with profits per share anticipated to grow by around $1.

Indian Motorcycle will continue to offer dealers and consumers sales, service, and support Indian Motorcycle

Indian only achieved its first profitable fiscal year under Polaris in 2023, though sales slumped in 2024, broadly reflecting industry-wide trends.

With investments in restaurants, real estate, a real estate media company called Estate, and the creator-led sports outlet Jomboy Media, Carolwood doesn’t exactly have tons of motorcycling expertise. However, the firm specializes in helping large corporate subsidiaries transition into independent entities, suggesting that its focus will initially be on operational stability rather than sweeping change.

For now, Indian’s workforce and facilities will remain largely intact. More than 900 employees in engineering, design, and manufacturing will stay on, along with the company’s production sites in Spirit Lake, Iowa, and Monticello, Minnesota, and its industrial design and technology center in Burgdorf, Switzerland.

Indian will become a stand-alone company Indian Motorcycle

The most pressing question for riders, of course, is what changes customers can expect. The answer, at least for now, is none. Indian Motorcycle will continue to provide full sales, service, and support through its existing dealer network during and after the transition. Motorcycles, parts, accessories, and apparel will all remain available through current channels.

That said, some Indian loyalists aren’t thrilled by the move. Private equity firms are notorious for streamlining operations, maximizing margins, and reselling companies for profit, not for nurturing long-term brand legacies. Still, it’s too early to predict what lies ahead for Indian Motorcycle. For now, this marks the close of a storied chapter.

[TITLE]Is Sustainability Still Worth It? Fashion Industry, Supply Chain Say Resounding Yes:
[TEXT]
VENICE, Italy — As sustainability faces disruption and political backlash globally, fashion finds itself questioning how to move the needle forward after a decade of quantum leap efforts.

Against a dampened economy and geopolitical turmoil, the stakes are higher than ever.

Global supply chains, including Italy’s, are under pressure — and increasingly under scrutiny. Policymakers are navigating the complexity of dealing with a different world — and business views. The performance of the fashion sector is still iffy and the outlook hard to predict.

“The issue at hand concerns the models we want to champion for the future, the vision of the world we want to embrace,” said Vittorio Emanuele Parsi, international relations professor at Milan’s Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, at the fourth two-day edition of the Venice Sustainable Fashion Forum held here at the Fondazione Cini.

“This is the time to have the courage to face our era head-on,” echoed Carlo Cottarelli, director of the program for education in economic and social sciences and of the observatory on Italian public accounts at the same university.

Industry players at the forum recognized the importance of scaling up, rather than back, their efforts and of doing so collaboratively.

“Not only Made in Italy fashion is under attack. The reality is that it’s part of a much broader ecosystem, one we share with our European partners. This is a multifaceted attack,” said Luca Sburlati, president of Confindustria Moda, in reference to the many pressing issues faced by the sector.

“We are working within a model where ethics, economy and innovation are all evolving rapidly, so it’s crucial that we take center stage in this discussion and make decisions to bring to the attention of the policymakers,” he said.

The Italian association was among the organizers of the event alongside Confindustria Veneto Est and consultancy The European House Ambrosetti, or TEHA Group.

A study by the latter titled “Just Fashion Transition 2025,” provided a candid picture of where the fashion sector stands in its eco-journey.

Drawing from data by the European Environment Agency, the research said that the EU fashion sector has cut 37 percent of its carbon emissions since 1990.

An additional 18 percent is still required to comply with the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles for 2030, which the consultancy estimates would require at least 4.4 billion euros.

“The cost of waiting is higher than the cost of taking action,” said Carlo Cici, partner and head of sustainability practices at TEHA Group. “When it comes to sustainability, waiting is not a viable strategy for growth,” he added, sparking applause from the audience.

Making his point, Cici said that biodiversity and the health of natural ecosystems are crucial enablers of growth as

Longleaf Partners, managed by Southeastern Asset Management, released its “Partners Fund” third-quarter 2025 investor letter. The letter can be downloaded here. The fund returned -0.33% in the third quarter, compared to the S&P 500’s 8.12 % return and the Russell 1000 Value’s 5.33% return. The firm is not happy with the flat performance of the portfolio, emphasizing its investments in real assets and brands that generate growing free cash flow (FCF) per share. Despite facing market pressures from speculation and government uncertainty, it anticipates that the Fund's ~10x FCF multiple could rise to the mid-teens as management implements strategies to improve margins and increase share repurchases.
