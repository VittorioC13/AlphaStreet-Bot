[TITLE]Trump's Truth Social to Merge With Fusion Startup You've Probably Never Heard Of:
[TEXT]
A fusion-power startup revealed its own fusion experiment this week: A planned merger with a tech firm that seems to have little in common with its work, but which does bring access to ruling-family levels of influence.

TAE Technologies, a Foothill Ranch, California, company that has been developing a compact nuclear-fusion reactor design since 1998, announced that it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the Florida-based parent firm of President Trump's Truth Social.

The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion, a substantial increase from TMTG's $4.16 billion market cap as of Thursday, and a step up from 2021, when its financial struggles reportedly led Trump to ask Elon Musk to buy his social network.

The transaction calls for TMTG to kick in $200 million to TAE at the signing of the deal, with $100 million more available when it files Securities and Exchange Commission paperwork. The parties predict that the deal will close in the middle of 2026, pending shareholder signoff and regulatory approval, which does not seem like much of a risk in this case.

TAE plans to spend that money to accelerate its plans to build a 50-megawatt commercial fusion electric-power plant. A merger presentation predicts that it will pick a site and begin construction in 2026, start “pre-commercial operations” in 2029, and begin commercial operations in 2031.

Fusion power, in which atoms fuse together under immense pressure to generate heat that can be turned into electricity, promises safe, zero-emission energy without the radioactive waste that nuclear fission plants leave behind.

Creating conditions similar to what allows fusion to happen inside the sun and other stars has proved to be an immensely difficult exercise; it took until 2022 for a US facility’s fusion energy output to exceed the energy input required to initiate that reaction.

Meanwhile, solar panels offer a much cheaper and proven way to turn the sun’s fusion energy into electricity; on a lower-tech scale, a clothesline technically functions as a fusion-powered clothes dryer.

But fusion’s potential, combined with the growing power needs of AI data centers, has pushed interest in the concept to its highest ever level. The “AI Action Plan” that Trump unveiled in July sees a role for fusion, while essentially ruling out the solar and wind power that the president has repeatedly attacked. Fusion also figures in Microsoft’s data-center ambitions.

TAE's plant concept involves using what it calls an “advanced beam-driven Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC)” to confine its hydrogen-boron fuel inside a superhot plasma. Before 2025, it had pitched this as a key part of electrifying transportation; in 2022, it touted its attendance at a fusion-power summit hosted at the White House and approvingly quoted President Biden’s Office of Science & Technology Policy director Alondra Nelson as saying “the world is on fire.”

Building 'Uncancellable Infrastructure'

Global warming, however, did not come up in the brief conference call TAE and TMTG hosted on Thursday morning. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer—who will share chief-executive titles in the combined firm—gave brief statements and took no questions.

"TMTG has built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we're taking a big step toward a revolutionary technology that will cement Americans’ global energy dominance for generations,” Nunes said. “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s, an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, and revive America’s manufacturing base and bolster national defense.”

(Before joining TMTG in January 2022, Nunes served in the House as a Republican representing California and filed a lengthy series of defamation lawsuits—most since dismissed or withdrawn—against news organizations, journalists, Twitter, and such online critics as the unknown operator of a “DevinCow” parody account.)

“Today is a big milestone for TAE, fully recognizing the dedication and passion of our people who worked tirelessly over the last quarter century to advance our research to the point that capital is now becoming our biggest challenge,” Binderbauer said. “Fusion power is the answer, providing reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free electricity– and importantly, cost-competitive with conventional production.”

The merger announcements credit TAE with raising more than $1.3 billion in private capital to date. Truth Social may not have much of a market presence—a November report by the Pew Research Center found that only 3% of Americans had ever used it—but TMTG isn’t just another social-media or technology company.

Trump himself continues to use Truth Social far more than X, TMTG’s board of directors includes Trump’s oldest son Donald Trump, Jr., and the firm’s stock-ticker symbol is Trump’s initials: DJT.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) called for Congressional oversight of the deal in a post on Bluesky: “The merger between Trump Media and TAE raises significant concerns

[TITLE]FCMB Group gets shareholder approval for N400bn capital rais:
[TEXT]
The shareholders of FCMB Group Plc have approved the plan to increase the company’s fresh capital raise of up to N400bn.

The approval was given during an Extraordinary General Meeting recently.

Saturday PUNCH reports that FCMB Group, in its third-quarter report filed with the Nigerian Exchange Limited, affirmed that its banking subsidiary will be recapitalised ahead of the 2026 deadline, saying, “We have successfully concluded our public offer and are on track to complete the minority subsidiary sale by the end of December.

“Subject to CBN capital verification (currently ongoing), shareholder approval at the EGM, and the required regulatory consents, we are positioned to deliver the N500bn capital target ahead of the March 2026 deadline for our banking subsidiary, FCMB Limited.”

Speaking at the EGM, according to a statement, the Group Chief Executive Officer, Ladi Balogun, expressed profound gratitude to shareholders for their support and emphasised the strategic importance of the capital raise.

He said, “The additional capital will be deployed to strengthen our capital adequacy ratio and accelerate growth. We will invest in human capital and technology, support our international expansion, and reduce high-cost deposits. We project our earnings per share to grow by over 50 per cent on average over the next two years. This positions FCMB to outperform the market while delivering stronger dividends and shareholder returns.

“With the capital adequacy ratio projected above 20 per cent, our ability to pay dividends will improve significantly. Shareholders can expect a steady rise in dividends per share, reflecting the bank’s growth trajectory and enhanced returns.”

The shareholders of FCMB Group also passed other resolutions, including acceptance of oversubscription from the 2025 Public Offer of the Group’s shares, up to the limit prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and subject to regulatory approvals. This leverages the strong investor demand, reflecting confidence in the Group.

FCMB Group’s issued share capital is increased from N30,002,169,782.50 divided into 60,004,339,565 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each by the creation and addition of the number of ordinary shares that will be required to give effect to the capital raise. The new ordinary shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of the company.

With a diversified subsidiary portfolio and strong financial performance, FCMB has a forward-looking digital strategy and an impact-focused purpose. It is poised to make a significant contribution to Nigeria’s ambitious goal of achieving a $1tn economy.

[TITLE]Morgan Stanley favourite to lead SpaceX IPO:
[TEXT]
Morgan Stanley is emerging as a leading contender for a key role in SpaceX's blockbuster initial public offering, as the bank's close ties to CEO Elon Musk give it an edge in his decision, according to three people familiar with the matter.

A ⁠selection process, or "bake-off," for the IPO is still underway, with a select group of banks, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, vying for roles, four people familiar with the matter said.

Though there is no certainty Morgan Stanley will secure the coveted "lead left" underwriting position, the sources said.

Musk's ties to Morgan Stanley run deep, dating back at least 15 years, leaving it widely viewed as the leading contender to run the syndicate of underwriters, three of the people said, though no banks have ‍been selected yet and the discussions remain fluid.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment, while SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.

SpaceX is one of the world's largest private companies and its potential IPO would be highly complex. While Musk has not yet picked the lead banks, a decision could come before the end of the year, with the full syndicate likely to be finalised afterward, two of the people added.

The people cautioned that while plans are progressing, the IPO remains contingent on market conditions, and SpaceX could choose to delay or abandon the offering altogether.

Morgan Stanley, which has advised Musk for years, was among the banks that took Tesla public in 2010, alongside Goldman Sachs, the lead left, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank. Morgan Stanley later advised Musk and led the financing for his 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now X.

Musk recently tapped one of his Morgan Stanley bankers on that deal, Anthony Armstrong, to become chief financial officer of his artificial intelligence venture xAI. The connection runs even deeper through Musk’s family office in Austin, Texas. Another former Morgan Stanley banker who advised Musk on various Wall Street dealings over the years, Jared Birchall, built and runs Excession, which manages his personal assets, Reuters previously reported.

In a staff memo sent last week, SpaceX ⁠Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen informed staff that the company was preparing for a public offering in 2026.

"Whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain, but the thinking is that if we execute brilliantly and the markets cooperate, a public offering could raise a significant ⁠amount of capital," Johnsen wrote.

Reuters has previously reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise more than $25 billion in an IPO that could come next year, a sum that would make it one of the biggest public listings ever globally.

The decision to go public caught some by surprise, given SpaceX's status as one of the world's largest private companies. While ⁠Musk has ‍long expressed a preference ⁠for keeping SpaceX private, people familiar with his thinking indicated that the company’s growing valuation and the success of its Starlink satellite-internet service have prompted a shift in strategy.

SpaceX, long known for its dominant rocket launch business, has become the world's largest satellite operator through Starlink, a network of nearly 10,000 satellites beaming broadband ‍internet to consumers, governments and enterprise customers.

[TITLE]Wall Street banked on a flurry of deals under Trump in 2025. It wasn't that simple:
[TEXT]

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025.

[TITLE]Forman Capital Provides $37M Construction Financing for Houston-Area Retail Center – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Ferguson Family Partners has secured $37.1 million in construction financing to build The Oaks of District West, a 10-building mixed-use center outside of Houston, Texas, Commercial Observer can first report.

Forman Capital provided the construction loan, while Daniel Eidson of Concord Summit Capital arranged the transaction.

Scott Mehlman, chief investment officer and partner at Forman Capital, noted in a statement that the Richmond submarket of Houston, where The Oak of District West will be located, has experienced a surge in residential building in recent years, but retail has failed to keep pace.

“Our client is addressing a clear market gap, and the early leasing momentum speaks to both the strength of the location and the quality of the concept,” said Mehlman.

The open-air project is already 70 percent pre-leased in its 15 tenant spaces, even though construction is expected to last until the third quarter of 2027. Tenants include Pacific Coast Tacos, Virtual Golf Bar, Pecan Jack’s Ice Cream, and Picklr, a national indoor pickleball company.

Located at 21711 FM-1093 in Richmond, Texas, directly off the Westpark Tollway and South Peak Road, The Oaks of District West will span more than 87,000 square feet across 10 buildings on a site that sits 30 miles southwest of Downtown Houston.

Brett Forman, managing partner of Forman Capital, said in a statement that the new retail center will tap into the affluent residential community within the Richmond area.

“The Oaks of District West aligns directly with Forman Capital’s retail thesis of investing in necessity-driven centers in affluent residential markets,” he said.

[TITLE]Affinius Capital Provides $81M Construction Loan for Arizona State Student Housing – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Fields Holdings has secured $81.2 million to finance the construction of the Samuel, a 14-story student housing property that will boast 224 units on Arizona State University’s main campus in Tempe, Commercial Observer can first report.

Affinius Capital provided the construction financing, while CBRE’s Scott Williams arranged the transaction.

Affinius Capital Senior Vice President Tyler Figley described the Samuel in a statement as a “high-quality” student housing property that sits on a prime location within the sprawling Arizona State campus. Figley said the apartment complex will likely “capture demand” from the growing enrollment at ASU, which currently has roughly 56,000 students in Tempe.

“We look forward to working with Fields Holdings, which has the experience to execute on this caliber of project,” he added.

Located at 706 South College Avenue near Downtown Tempe, the Samuel will deliver 408 beds and also feature 8,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The units will be organized as studios to three-bedroom apartments, and the building will include a swimming pool, a basketball court, an outdoor courtyard, a fitness center, and several lounges with media spaces for students to access

Fields Holdings did not respond to requests for comment.

[TITLE]From Super Fibers to Super Deals: Science, Scale, and Strategic Capital Shape the Morning Tape:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- This morning’s market narrative spans futuristic materials, transformational biotech M&A, and creative capital restructuring, underscoring how innovation-driven companies are pairing long-term vision with near-term execution.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB): Spider Silk Moves From Legend to Industrial Reality

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories set a distinctive tone with a detailed Christmas shareholder letter that framed 2025 as the company’s inflection year, marking its transition from prolonged development into early commercialization of recombinant spider silk.

The operational message was concrete, as Kraig Labs highlighted major advances across genetics, production, and scale, culminating in the rollout of its BAM-1 ALPHA hybrid, a true production-ready, diapausing silkworm line. ALPHA delivers a 22% increase in silk yield, improved automated reeling efficiency, and identical strength and performance characteristics compared to earlier strains, an unusually meaningful gain in a materials business where incremental improvements can materially alter unit economics.

The importance of spider silk as a super fiber is central to the story. Natural spider silk is widely regarded as one of the strongest and toughest fibers known, combining tensile strength comparable to steel with elasticity exceeding Kevlar, while remaining lightweight, biodegradable, and biocompatible. These properties make recombinant spider silk a highly sought-after material across performance apparel, aerospace composites, medical sutures, defense applications, and luxury textiles, markets where durability, weight reduction, and sustainability command premium pricing. Historically, the inability to produce spider silk at scale has constrained commercialization. Kraig’s progress directly addresses that bottleneck.

Operationally, the company reported producing more than one million BAM-1 ALPHA eggs, parallel manufacturing facilities, multi-country operating licenses in Southeast Asia, and a strategic collaboration with a regional government agency have added redundancy, scale, and geopolitical resilience to production. Importantly, Kraig is signaling that customer engagement is now aligning with production readiness. As 2026 approaches, Kraig Labs appears positioned to test whether spider silk’s long-promised value can finally be realized at industrial scale.

BioMarin Pharmaceutical to Acquire Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ: FOLD): Rare Disease Consolidation at Scale

Large-cap biotech conviction was on full display as BioMarin Pharmaceutical announced a definitive agreement to acquire Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ: FOLD) for $14.50 per share in cash, valuing the transaction at approximately $4.8 billion. The deal adds two marketed, high-growth rare disease therapies, Galafold for Fabry disease and Pombiliti + Opfolda for Pompe disease, which together generated $599 million in revenue over the past four quarters.

Strategically, the acquisition immediately expands BioMarin’s enzyme therapy portfolio, accelerates revenue growth, and is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS within 12 months of closing, with substantial accretion projected by 2027. The resolution of U.S. Galafold patent litigation, extending exclusivity to 2037, removes a key overhang and strengthens long-term cash flow visibility. Financing is not contingent, with BioMarin planning to use cash on hand and approximately $3.7 billion in debt, while targeting deleveraging to below 2.5x gross leverage within two years.

Psyence BioMed (NASDAQ: PBM): Vertical Integration Advances Psychedelic Medicine

Psyence BioMed (NASDAQ: PBM) announced regulatory approval for the use of PsyLabs’ GMP-grade psilocybin product in its Phase IIb clinical trial for adjustment disorder in cancer patients. The approval marks a key milestone for Psyence’s vertically integrated model, spanning ethical sourcing, manufacturing, and clinical development.

With approximately $9.5 million in cash and no debt, Psyence enters the next trial phase with balance sheet flexibility and a differentiated supply-chain advantage in the emerging psychedelics space. Top-line results remain on track for 2026, keeping the company squarely in the clinical execution phase rather than speculative positioning.

ProPhase Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPH): Reverse Merger Framework Signals Value Reallocation

ProPhase Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPH) disclosed a non-binding letter of intent for a proposed reverse merger with Advanced Biological Laboratories S.A. (ABL), a European biotech and MedTech group. The contemplated structure would leave ABL shareholders with approximately 76% ownership of the combined entity, while carving out significant value for current ProPhase shareholders.

The framework includes a potential special cash dividend of up to $10 million and the exclusive benefit of Crown Medical Collections receivables, estimated at approximately $50 million net, independent of the merged operating company. Strategically, the transaction would align ProPhase’s genomics and diagnostic assets with ABL’s global infrastructure, while isolating legacy liabilities and delivering near-term liquidity to existing shareholders.

[TITLE]Wall Street banked on a flurry of deals under Trump in 2025. It wasn't that simple:

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025. Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull.

[TITLE]Hainan Free Trade Port’s Island-wide Customs Closure: Reshaping Global Supply Chains as a “China Hub”:
[TEXT]
On December 18, 2025, the Hainan Free Trade Port (FTP) officially commenced island-wide customs closure operations. This initiative is far more than a simple policy adjustment; it represents a comprehensive, systematic, and institutional upgrade, designed to transform Hainan into a new gateway of “the highest level of openness” that connects China with the world, particularly Southeast Asian markets.

Its impact will extend well beyond the island, affecting global manufacturing layouts, port competitiveness, and regional economic integration.

I. Definition and Core Policy Framework of Island-wide Customs Closure

“Island-wide customs closure” does not signify isolation but a greater degree of openness. Its core is the implementation of a special customs supervision system defined as “eased access at the first line, controlled access at the second line, and free flow within the island.”

“Eased access at the first line” refers to the boundary between Hainan and overseas. Except for goods explicitly prohibited or restricted by law, other commodities can move in and out freely with minimal customs procedures.

refers to the boundary between Hainan and overseas. Except for goods explicitly prohibited or restricted by law, other commodities can move in and out freely with minimal customs procedures. “Controlled access at the second line” refers to the boundary between Hainan and the Chinese mainland. Goods entering the mainland from Hainan are subject to standard import regulations, primarily for taxation and compliance, ensuring national tax revenue security and market order.

Goods entering the mainland from Hainan are subject to standard import regulations, primarily for taxation and compliance, ensuring national tax revenue security and market order. “Free flow within the island” means goods, capital, personnel, and other factors of production can circulate freely within Hainan.

The supporting policy framework delivers breakthroughs in key areas:
