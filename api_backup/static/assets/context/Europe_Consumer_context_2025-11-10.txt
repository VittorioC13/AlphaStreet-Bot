The telecoms billionaire Sir Charles Dunstone is seeking new investors to take a big stake in Five Guys Europe, the casual dining brand he launched in Britain more than a decade ago.

[TITLE]Penneys owner’s plan to split fashion from food fails to excite investing front row:

This week, investors channelled their best version of Vogue Magazine supremo Anna Wintour, as Associated British Foods (ABF) paraded a plan to split its fast-fashion Primark unit – Penneys in Ireland – from its food business down the London City runway.

Far from the usual share price bump that listed conglomerates typically get by unveiling plans to spin off a business, ABF’s stock had fallen as much as 5 per cent a little over 24 hours after the announcement, as the market digested the landmark proposal. They ended the week lower, too.

The initial critic reviews are in – and they’re not exactly gushing.

“[A] separation is unlikely to swing the valuation debate meaningfully as we struggle to see how the two individual component parts would individually command a higher [stock market valuation rating than] in their current shape,” concluded Jefferies analyst James Grinic in a note to clients.

Another front-row pundit, Deutsche Numis’s Adam Cochrane, concluded: “The lack of a significant share price reaction on the announcement suggests that there is not a material undervaluation of either business, at least in the short term.”

On the surface, ABF chief executive George Weston might understandably feel frustrated.

Haven’t investment banks been calling for years for Primark, which started off as a single store in 1969 in Dublin’s Mary Street by the late Arthur Ryan for the Canadian-Irish Weston family, to be spun off as a stand-alone business as it expanded at pace?

The logic was that the ragtag food businesses – which include Twinings tea, yeast, and other bakery ingredients, animal feed, and sugar – were holding back the overall valuation.

But rather than a demerger shining a spotlight on the powerhouse Primark has become, which now has 473 stores globally, Weston sees it as a chance for food – the hitherto Cinderella of the group – to finally step out from the shadows.

“Our unique and exceptional food business has historically been less well understood by the financial markets than Primark, yet it has a highly attractive portfolio, deep global expertise and much potential,” Weston said on Tuesday.

He has a point. Most of the questions Weston’s faced from the market in two decades at the helm have been from analysts that specialise in covering retail companies.

There’s one big snag with moving ahead with the plan right now. With the stock trading at a healthy 12.5 times next year’s earnings forecasts, the traditional “conglomerate discount” once attached to ABF’s shares had effectively already disappeared before the announcement.

Weston, whose wider family’s Wittington Investments vehicle plans to remain the majority owner of both businesses, still has good reasons to consider a split now. The plan is to come to a final decision by April.

A key one is governance. The board believes that Primark, now a large and complex business, may benefit from a more focused oversight model as an independent company.

First, Primark will need to find a full-time chief executive, after previous incumbent Paul Marchant resigned in March following an investigation into alleged inappropriate behaviour towards a woman. Irish man Eoin Tonge, who has held the fort as interim chief executive, is widely tipped as the credible internal candidate.

ABF also now has a market capitalisation of just over £16 billion (€18.2 billion). The two businesses are of sufficient scale that each would stand to remain in the key FTSE 100 index. That is important because the benchmark is tracked by a swathe of large funds.

Will Imagine’s big gamble double its customer base? Listen | 36:12

But the individual investment cases are cloudy and will require work before both businesses are sent off on their way.

Primark’s total sales only grew in its last financial year, to the middle of September – by 1 per cent to £9.49 billion – because of new store openings in the US and Europe. Stripping those out, like-for-like sales dipped 2.3 per cent.

The like-for-like performance improved somewhat in the second half of the year in the UK, helped by well-received marketing campaigns. But it was also driven by the final roll-out of its click-and-collect offering in that market. Primark has been way behind its peers on the ecommerce front. Extending click-and-collect elsewhere would be a start.

The wider group’s sales £19.4 billion of sales for the year missed consensus expectations by 1.1 per cent, even after ABF’s warning in September of “challenging” market conditions prompted analysts to revise down their estimates.

The food side has had its own issues.

“The problem has been that there are businesses within foods which are of less good quality in our opinion, such as agriculture, Australia grocery, UK bread, and Spanish Sugar, which seem to have tarred the entire non-Primark businesses,” according to Barclays analyst Warren Akerman.

While the group has finally taken action in some of these businesses – restructuring its Spanish sugar unit and closing a UK bioethanol plant within the wider sugar division – more steps may be needed to get investors excited about its stand-alone prospects.

The fundamental problem with the European sugar market is that there continues to be oversupply in the market, with too many players continuing to battle it out even as prices remain low – and are forecast to continue to decline in 2026.

The talk in the City is that Weston will likely remain in charge of the food division in the event of a demerger.

His aim is that the deal will thrust the food business into its rightful place in the spotlight.

But it could also expose it to the kind of scrutiny – and awkward questions on strategy – it escaped while overshadowed by Primark.

[TITLE]Can Primark stay relevant, or is Shein taking over?:
[TEXT]
Shoppers are turning to Shein - but some still can't leave Primark

2 days ago Share Save Grace Dean Share Save

BBC Martha says she'd rather spend more money on better-quality products

Primark has long been a staple of UK high streets, luring in shoppers with low-priced clothes, accessories and homeware. But in its UK and Ireland stores, like-for-like sales - a key metric in the retail industry - were down 3.1% in the year to September, which it attributed to a "weak" consumer environment and fewer people buying winter clothes during last year's mild autumn. As online stores like Shein and Vinted continue to attract young shoppers, does Primark face a fight to remain relevant - or is it just fine?

"While the UK clothing market is seeing subdued growth, Primark has significantly underperformed the overall market," says Tamara Sender-Ceron, an associate director at market-research agency Mintel, adding that it faces "increased competition". Some shoppers point out that online marketplaces like Shein and Temu have even lower prices, a huge range of products, and - crucially - home delivery, something Primark lacks. At Primark's biggest London store on Oxford Street, which BBC News visited this week, Serena Milius has just popped in with her 12-year-old daughter to look at pyjamas, socks and the new Stranger Things range. Serena used to do most of her shopping at Primark - until Shein took over. "Shein's our main thing," the 34-year-old finance manager from Tooting, south-west London, says. She says her wardrobe is now 90% Shein, and goes to Primark for "little bits and bobs" like flipflops, candles, socks and cosmetics dupes.

Serena Milius Serena says she's a Shein convert

Others tell the BBC they'd rather splash out on better-quality products. This includes Martha, a 23-year-old student in Leeds, who only shops at Primark for basics like T-shirts, socks, underwear and cotton buds. For other items, she turns to Weekday, Zara and independent shops. "I like to buy more expensive items that I'm going to wear over the years," she tells the BBC as she browses clothes in a Primark store with her mum. Primark repeatedly faces criticism for its "fast fashion" approach with shoppers saying products they buy from there aren't hard-wearing. "It's not always a lasting item," Martha adds. However Primark's product longevity lead, Vicki Swain, said that they have developed a Durability Framework that would help people get more wear from their purchases - no matter how much they can afford to spend. "We've been investing in making our clothes more durable and also making them with more sustainable materials," she told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme. The store was busy when the BBC visited on a late Wednesday afternoon, with mainly female shoppers browsing alone or in pairs. Some said they'd gone out of their way to visit, others popping in after finding themselves in the area. Some say they're deterred by Primark's huge, sprawling stores which can sometimes get very busy. "I do not enjoy shopping in a Primark," says Abbi Lily, a 24-year-old content creator from near Bournemouth. She describes the experience as "very overwhelming" and "overstimulating" and says it can be "impossible" to find things.

She used to buy most of her clothes from Primark, but feels it isn't as cheap as it used to be. "They just don't have the bargains as much anymore," she says, echoing comments some other shoppers made to the BBC. Though Abbi sometimes shops at Shein, she's trying to become more "intentional" with her shopping and buy more second-hand items, including through Vinted and Depop. A Primark spokesperson told BBC News that 85% of its products were £10 or under, and said it "continually benchmarks" its prices against competitors. Shein uses AI to identify trends and launch "thousands of new styles daily", says Ms Sender-Ceron at Mintel. According to a survey by Mintel in May, 46% of UK women aged 16 to 34 had bought fashion items from Shein in the last 12 months. It has held pop-up shops in London and this week opened its first permanent physical shop in a department store in Paris, with long queues of people waiting to get their hands on cut-price garments. "You can buy anything from Shein," said one shopper waiting in the French capital to visit on its opening day. "It's such a cool thing for people my age who are struggling in this economy."

But as shoppers queued to get into the store, protesters screamed "Shame!" at them. The critics were calling for a boycott of the brand because of the environmental impact of fast fashion and working conditions in its factories. Just over an hour after the new store opened, the French government also confirmed it was initiating proceedings to suspend Shein's website, after prosecutors said they were investigating the company over childlike sex dolls found on its website. Paris prosecutors are also investigating three other platforms - Temu, AliExpress and Wish. Allegations surrounding the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein first came to light from France's anti-fraud office. Shein has promised to co-operate fully. In a statement, the retailer said it had already temporarily suspended listings from independent third-party vendors.

Should Primark offer delivery?

With Shein specialising in delivering clothes to your door, Primark does offer click-and-collect services in its nearly 200 UK stores - but not deliveries. Some high-street retailers have been struggling in the UK, but Primark has largely bucked the trend - it's closing a store in Dartford, Kent, next year, which reports say will be its first store closure in a decade. It also opened dedicated Primark Home stores in Belfast and Manchester. Primark relies on its customers shopping in bulk, Mr Stevenson says. "You might be going in for one thing, but you end up buying seven things that you hadn't really thought about," he says. This doesn't happen as much with online shopping, he says. Would Primark's sales be boosted if it did offer delivery? Mr Stevenson is sceptical, saying "it doesn't feel like they're losing out by not doing that", but that it could be an option in future. "If you wanted to buy a couple of things from Primark for £5 each, are you going to pay 50% of that in delivery charge?" he asks. "Because buying £10 of stuff is going to cost me £5 to get it tomorrow." Primark's spokesperson said that its online model was a "deliberate choice to streamline operations and pass the savings directly to customers".

[TEXT]
The greater part of third quarter earnings reports is behind us, with the latest burst of reports this past week from tech and AI players, including Palantir (PLTR), AMD (AMD), and Supermicro (SMCI).

So far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start. As of Nov. 7, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts are expecting a 13.1% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year.

Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30.

[TITLE]Chalhoub Group Launches Makette, Its First Luxury Brand Venture:
[TEXT]
DUBAI — Chalhoub Group, the luxury retail group that has distributed more than 400 international labels across the Middle East for seven decades, is venturing into brand building with Makette, a modular handbag and leather goods line.

The debut marks a strategic pivot for the family-owned company, expanding beyond its traditional franchise model to create proprietary brands with global ambitions.

Ana Canadas, Chalhoub Group’s director of fashion innovation, pointed to an industry trend: luxury handbag prices have surged 60 to 90 percent since 2019, driven by rising raw material costs and supply chain pressures. Consumers want high quality and high functioning products that are within a more accessible price point, presenting an opportunity.

Architecture Meets Functionality

Study 01, Makette’s inaugural collection, presents three foundational styles: The Curve, The Patina and The Strata. Each is designed around what Canadas called “systems thinking,” rather than traditional modularity.

“It’s creating a system that you can add things to and that works across multiple times of day and activities.”

The Patina

The large Patina serves as a work tote that fits laptops and daily essentials. The medium Curve transitions from day to night with adjustable straps and detachable chains that can be worn as jewelry. The Strata takes a different approach entirely, comprising multiple pouches in varying sizes that can be worn individually as clutches or combined using chains and straps from other pieces in the collection.

“You can wear just one of them for coffee, or you can play around with combinations,” Canadas said. The design also accommodates tech accessories, with vertical pouch configurations suitable for tablets. A special neckpiece launching with the small leather goods collection will connect multiple Strata pouches, allowing wearers to create their own configurations without needing a traditional handbag base.

“The big one is your go-to work bag. Carry everything, your kids’ stuff, the diaper bag if you need to,” Canadas said. “You get to work and bring the medium one out for meetings or lunch. It’s

[TITLE]UK/EU food deal to ease Windsor problems could come at too high a price, says former British minister:

A European Union/UK agreement on food exports designed to resolve problems in existing trade between Britain and Northern Ireland could come at too high a price, a former British minister for trade has warned.

Former Conservative minister Greg Hands told The Irish Times said he was “opposed” to an agreement where London would agree to align with EU regulations on sanitary and phytosanitary rules.

“I don’t think that is the right strategy for the UK. It’s not really in the UK’s interests. A lot of the Brussels food and drink regulations are quite stifling on innovation,” he said.

Negotiations on an SPS agreement are underway, with supporters arguing that it would remove most of the difficulties affecting GB/NI trade, which have irritated many Unionists.

However, Mr Hands said: “Why would the UK voluntarily and dynamically align with rules over which we have no say? It would kill off a lot of nascent things in the UK, like some of work done on GM.”

Former British Minister for Trade, Greg Hands seen here speaking at a conference in Dublin today

Hands, who twice served as Minister for Trade between 2016 and 2018 and later from 2020 to 2024, was in Dublin to speak at a conference on international trade held by law firm Byrne Wallace Shields.

He had doubts that an SPS agreement would remove all of the GB/NI hurdles that are being claimed for it: “It’s an arguable thing. Would it increase the demand in NI for Tesco sausages? I’m not sure it would.

“An agreement would make it easier and reduce paperwork and checks, but I doubt if it would get a whole new volume of trade between GB and NI. It would ease bureaucracy on existing trade, that’s my guess.”

The SPS negotiations could take up to two years, though European Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce he thought they could finish in one.

Saying he did not understand why such negotiations should take even that long, Mr Hands said the European Commission was “treating this as a massive concession on their part”.

In reality, London is ceding ground: “The UK, the second largest economy in Europe, is aligning to your food rules. That is a bonus for the Commission, but it is treating this as a concession,” he added.

Following Brexit, South African citrus exporters have been able to ship oranges and lemons to the UK, including Northern Ireland, without a plant health certificate, or the need for an inspection.

Since 2022, however, EU rules demand that South African exporters cool fruits to limit the spread of pests and disease, such as false codling moth and citrus black spot, and supply a phytosanitary certificate.

Now, the Commission is arguing that it may “withhold” the SPS agreement unless it is satisfied, said Mr Hands, who said the Irish Government could play a useful role “to urge pragmatism”.

He was not “downplaying” the risk posed by citrus fungal disease, but doubted if imports to Britain and Northern Ireland “where neither are citrus producers” could “imperil” the Iberian citrus industry.

The Irish Government has frequently “smoothed things over” when difficulties have emerged between London and Brussels, said Mr Hands, who now works with a Czech-based industrial group.

[TITLE]CLAR Q3 Deep Dive: Outdoor Apparel Growth and Margin Actions Amid Tariff Pressure:
[TEXT]
Outdoor lifestyle and equipment company Clarus (NASDAQ:CLAR) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2025, with sales up 3.3% year on year to $69.35 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.05 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

Is now the time to buy CLAR? Find out in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).

Clarus (CLAR) Q3 CY2025 Highlights:

Revenue: $69.35 million vs analyst estimates of $66.51 million (3.3% year-on-year growth, 4.3% beat)

Adjusted EPS: $0.05 vs analyst estimates of $0.06 (in line)

Adjusted EBITDA: $2.80 million vs analyst estimates of $2.70 million (4% margin, relatively in line)

Operating Margin: -4.4%, up from -8% in the same quarter last year

Market Capitalization: $124.8 million

StockStory’s Take

Clarus’ third quarter results drew a positive market response, as the company’s revenue growth exceeded Wall Street expectations while profitability metrics held steady. Management credited the performance to strong demand for outdoor products in North American wholesale, notable success with the revamped Black Diamond apparel line, and the onboarding of new adventure customers in Australia. Executive Chairman Warren Kanders highlighted that the company’s shift toward a more focused product mix, as well as reductions in discontinued merchandise and operational expenses, were central to the quarter’s incremental improvements.

Looking forward, Clarus’ leadership remains cautious due to persistent macroeconomic headwinds, ongoing tariff and currency impacts, and uncertainty in consumer sentiment. President of Diamond Equipment Neil Fiske pointed to further tariff mitigation plans, ongoing supply chain rebalancing, and a renewed emphasis on product innovation as key to future margin improvement. Fiske stated, “Our outlook is more cautious. Consumer sentiment remains low. Promotional activity seems to be on the rise as the broader market struggles to balance cash and working capital requirements.”

Key Insights from Management’s Remarks

Management attributed the quarter’s performance to a healthier revenue mix, focused cost control, and improvements in product and channel strategy, even as tariffs and FX losses weighed on margins.

[TITLE]Disney Store Revs Up F1 Partnership With First-Ever Racing-Inspired Merch and Apparel Collection:
[TEXT]
If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.

Disney is going full throttle into Formula 1. As part of the newly announced multi-year “Fuel the Magic” collaboration between the two global powerhouses, Disney Store is debuting its first F1-themed capsule collection this week — a 25-piece drop that blends the prestige of the motorsport with the legacy characters of Mickey & Friends.

Launching Nov. 8 online at DisneyStore.com and in person at the F1 Las Vegas Hub inside the Venetian Resort, the line serves as the first consumer product expression of the Disney-F1 deal, which will roll out across content, experiences and merchandise through the 2027 season.

Designed by Disney Consumer Products’ in-house team and led by Bobby Kim — the former Hundreds co-founder who now serves as VP of Creative — the collection adopts a red, black and white palette shared by both Mickey Mouse and Formula 1. Apparel, accessories and collectibles lean into racing cues: checkerboard trims reinterpreted as fashion accents, track-shaped graphics, athletic silhouettes and an aerodynamic, slightly edgier version of Mickey built specifically for this universe. “He was meant to look fast,” Kim tells Variety. “Not retro, not nostalgic — more sleek, more premium, more in line with the F1 aesthetic.”

Popular on Variety

That balance of heritage and futurism also appealed to Formula 1’s Las Vegas team. “This isn’t just merch — it’s an F1 lifestyle line,” Collette Gangemi, VP of Consumer Products for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, said in a statement. “We wanted the adrenaline and prestige of the sport, the neon energy of Vegas and the universal charm of Disney, all in one collection.”

The launch is timed to the sport’s splashiest U.S. stop: the Las Vegas Grand Prix, where Mickey & Friends will make an appearance during a special pit-lane walk for select grandstand ticket-holders. It’s one of several activations planned under the “Fuel the Magic” banner, a campaign Disney and F1 say is designed to bring fans “closer to the magic” through race-week programming, premium product and crossover storytelling.

“I’ve always admired F1 from afar,” Kim says. “But once you’re inside it, you understand: it’s rock-star-driven, high-stakes, global, fast — literally and metaphorically. And Disney, at its best, moves just as fast.”

[TITLE]American Eagle's Denim Dominance Returns: Will Global Growth Follow?:
[TEXT]
American Eagle Outfitters Inc. AEO is firmly reclaiming its denim leadership. The company delivered an upbeat second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, driven by a powerful resurgence in its denim business. The company’s renewed marketing push and celebrity collaborations have reignited consumer enthusiasm. Its fall “Great Jean” campaign starring Sydney Sweeney broke company records for customer acquisition and brand engagement. This campaign generated more than 40 billion impressions, boosting traffic across stores and online channels. The company’s follow-up collaboration with Tru Kolors by Travis Kelce further sustained this denim momentum, reinforcing American Eagle’s position as a leading lifestyle denim brand.

American Eagle’s strength lies in its inclusive denim lineup, offering fits and styles that appeal across ages and body types. In the past six weeks, the company has seen positive consumer sentiment and a marked increase in purchase intent, suggesting that new shoppers can evolve into long-term loyal customers. The company’s balanced pricing strategy, featuring good, better and best tiers, has also struck the right chord, with selective price increases offset by strong perceived value.

Overall, American Eagle is focusing on denim as a key driver for growth, backed by solid demand and successful marketing strategies. While the company’s core focus is on strengthening its U.S. business, management is optimistic

Dublin, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Denim Jeans Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Denim Jeans Market was valued at USD 85.42 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 121.76 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 6.09%

The global denim jeans market continues to thrive, driven by changing fashion trends, rising disposable incomes, and a growing preference for casual and comfortable clothing. Denim remains a staple across demographics due to its durability, versatility, and evolving designs. Increasing urbanization and the influence of Western culture have boosted demand in emerging economies. Consumers are showing strong interest in eco-friendly jeans made from organic cotton and produced with sustainable practices. The rise of e-commerce has further expanded market access, offering diverse styles and personalized options.

Key Market Drivers

Shifting Consumer Preferences Toward Casual and Versatile Apparel

One of the most significant drivers of the global denim jeans market is the growing consumer inclination toward casual and versatile clothing. In today's fashion landscape, comfort and practicality have taken precedence, with denim jeans emerging as a preferred wardrobe staple for individuals across age groups and professions. Majority of Americans buy apparel primarily for daily wear rather than for vacations (only 29% of clothing purchases were vacation-related), underscoring a clear shift toward practical, durable, and multifunctional garments like jeans. As work-from-home culture and hybrid working models become increasingly common, especially post-pandemic, the demand for semi-formal yet comfortable attire has surged.

Denim jeans fulfill this need by offering a blend of style, durability, and comfort. The adaptability of jeans - easily paired with both casual and formal tops - has enhanced their popularity among urban youth and professionals alike. Additionally, the emergence of denim in new fits, finishes, and silhouettes has made it a year-round essential for both men and women. From slim and skinny fits to relaxed and baggy styles, evolving preferences in fashion have led brands to constantly innovate, making jeans not only relevant but integral to the modern wardrobe.

Key Market Challenges

High Environmental Impact and Sustainability Pressures

One of the most pressing challenges facing the global denim jeans market is its significant environmental footprint. Traditional denim production is resource-intensive, requiring large quantities of water, energy, and chemicals, particularly during the dyeing and finishing processes. A single pair of jeans can consume thousands of liters of water and generate chemical waste, contributing to water pollution and carbon emissions.

As consumer awareness of environmental issues grows, brands are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices, yet shifting to eco-friendly methods often involves high initial investments, changes in supply chain processes, and sourcing more expensive raw materials like organic cotton or recycled fibers. Smaller manufacturers and brands may struggle to meet these demands due to limited capital and technical expertise. Furthermore, "greenwashing" - the practice of making misleading environmental claims - has led to consumer skepticism, requiring brands to provide credible third-party certifications and transparency in their supply chains. Balancing the need for sustainable innovation with cost efficiency and scalability remains a complex and ongoing challenge for the denim industry.

Key Market Trends

Shift Toward Sustainable and Ethical Denim Production

Sustainability has emerged as a transformative trend in the global denim jeans market, driven by growing environmental awareness and increasing demand for ethical consumption. Consumers are no longer just buying jeans based on style or fit - they are actively seeking information
