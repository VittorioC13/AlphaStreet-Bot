Key Factors Driving the Growth of the Lyme Disease Market

Rising Case Numbers and Expanded Surveillance

The increasing number of reported cases and broader surveillance are driving demand for diagnostics, treatments, and prevention tools, thereby fueling the growth of the Lyme disease market across testing, therapeutics, and public health services.

Growing Diagnostics Market

Demand for more accurate, faster, and higher-volume testing (ELISA, modified two-tier algorithms, PCR, point-of-care assays) is pushing market expansion and investment in new platforms. Recent market analyses show multi-billion-dollar global testing markets and mid-single-digit to low-double-digit CAGRs.

Launch of Emerging Lyme Disease Therapies

Companies worldwide are diligently working to develop novel therapies, achieving considerable success over the years. Key players, such as Valneva/Pfizer (VLA15), Tarsus Pharmaceuticals (TP-05), Moderna (mRNA-1982 and mRNA-1975), and others, are developing therapies for the management of Lyme disease.

Lyme Disease Market Analysis

The approach to treating Lyme disease depends on the stage of the illness, as the underlying pathophysiology differs at each stage. Consequently, antibiotic therapy must be tailored to the specific clinical manifestations. Current guidelines and recommendations follow this stage-specific strategy to help select the most appropriate antibiotics for each situation.

In 1998, the FDA approved LYMERIX (GSK), a recombinant Osp-A–based vaccine designed to prevent Lyme disease in adults. The vaccine required three doses administered over two tick seasons and demonstrated approximately 76% efficacy in preventing Lyme disease after completion of the whole series. LYMERIX and other Osp-A vaccines work by producing antibodies that block the transmission of Borreliella spirochetes from infected ticks during feeding on humans. However, public acceptance was low due to several factors, and in 2002, Smith-Kline Beecham withdrew LYMERIX from the market. Subsequent attempts by companies such as MedImmune, Baxter, and Connaught Laboratories to develop Lyme vaccines were also discontinued, leading to a decline in industry interest.

Two decades after LYMERIX, renewed efforts are underway to create next-generation human vaccines for Lyme disease prevention. A significant challenge for these vaccines is addressing the genetic diversity of pathogenic Borreliella species and strains in different regions. To overcome this, current vaccine candidates are designed to include multiple immunogenic antigens or several serotypes of a single antigen to broaden protection.

Irish biotech start-up Aerska has raised $21 million (€18 million) in seed funding to help develop ribonucleic acid-based therapies for degenerative neurological diseases that could treat, delay and ultimately prevent their onset.

The round was led by Backed VC and Age1, with other investors including Blueyard, Lingotto, Kerna Ventures, Norrsken, and Speedinves also participating.

Aerska is developing drugs that use ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference, a targeted therapy to switch off harmful genes linked to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, aiming to cross the blood-brain barrier that can block many treatments from getting through. It is developing its antibody-oligo conjugate (AOC) platform that uses “brain shuttles” for systemic RNAi delivery.

“RNA medicine is a newer, more advanced kind of medicine that very specifically turns off misbehaving genes,” explained chief executive Jack O’Meara.

“So if there’s a gene that’s overactive and producing a protein that’s causing a disease, we have a system to very elegantly deliver our RNA to go into the cell, and turn off that misbehaving gene so that we can try to resolve the disease.”

The company, which was founded by Mr O’Meara, Dave Hardwicke and Stu Milstein, is planning to expand its operations in Dublin and London, with the funding also helping to accelerate its drug discovery timeline.

“The investor base is US and European investors, and I think there was some intentionality behind that, as we try to do something exciting on this side of the Atlantic,” said Mr Hardwicke.

“Biotech, traditionally, a lot of it happens in the US, but both of us coming from Ireland and having spent time in the US, wanted to bring some of that American entrepreneurial culture, but do something from Ireland and the UK.”

Aerska’s founders are aiming to build up home-grown biotech innovation, building a team of seasoned drug developers that is based in Dublin and a research team in London. It is also engaging with Ireland’s university and research ecosystem on potential collaborations.

“Ireland has the talent, the research strengths and the ambition to become a world leader in biotechnology”, said Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment, Peter Burke.

“Aerska’s growth is a perfect example of how Irish scientists and entrepreneurs are building solutions to some of the greatest health challenges of our time. Supporting this kind of home-grown innovation not only creates opportunities here, but also ensures Ireland is at the forefront of developing life-changing technologies and medicines.”
