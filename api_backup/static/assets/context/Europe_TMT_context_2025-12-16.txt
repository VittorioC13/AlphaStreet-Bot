[TEXT]
From a recent selloff in the shares of Nvidia Corp. to Oracle Corp.’s plunge after reporting mounting spending on AI, to souring sentiment around a network of companies exposed to OpenAI, signs of skepticism are increasing. Looking to 2026, the debate among investors is whether to rein in AI exposure ahead of a potential bubble popping or double down to capitalize on the game-changing technology.

[TITLE]China Prepares as Much as $70 Billion in Chip Sector Incentives:
[TEXT]
China is considering a package of incentives worth as much as $70 billion to bankroll and support its chipmaking industry, pouring more state money into a sector it deems pivotal to its technological conflict with the US.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Officials are deliberating proposals to earmark a package of subsidies and other financing support in the range of 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) to 500 billion yuan, people familiar with the matter said, asking to remain anonymous to discuss private talks. The final details of those incentives, exact amounts and target companies are still getting worked out, the people added.

The scale of the effort — which on the lower end begins to approach the amount of capital Washington set aside for the Chips Act — underscores Beijing’s resolve to reduce its reliance on foreign chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp. It suggests the government will continue to support the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. and Cambricon Technologies Corp. even after the Trump administration approved the sale of Nvidia chips such as the more powerful H200 into China.

At the maximum end, the proposal translates into the largest-ever state-backed semiconductor incentives program conceived, at a time nations from Europe to the Middle East are seeking to ensure local production and supply of a component considered critical to AI and national security.

Explainer: How World Powers Are Vying for Chip Supremacy

The Chinese program will function separately from existing government funding plans such as the $50 billion Big Fund III equity-investment vehicle, the people added. Representatives for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which oversees the Big Fund and helps administer support measures, didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment.

Data as of 2024.

China is pouring resources into the world’s largest semiconductor arena at a critical time, geopolitically.

President Xi Jinping has pledged to build up the country’s semiconductor capabilities with a “whole-nation” approach — harnessing the entire country’s resources. Beijing is concerned about the unpredictability of access to US technology given clampdowns on exports by three different administrations, starting with Donald Trump’s first term.

That mandate has manifested itself on several fronts over the years. And as Beijing prioritizes the development of semiconductors and AI, firms throughout the supply chain have enjoyed a surge in fortunes.

[TITLE]NCC moves to resolve Abuja telecom disruption:
[TEXT]
Telecommunications services in parts of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, were disrupted last week after a diesel supply shortage cut power to several mobile base stations, the country’s telecoms regulator said in an email.

The Nigerian Communications Commission stated the disruption stemmed from difficulties in delivering diesel to critical telecom infrastructure, degrading service quality for mobile subscribers in the affected areas.

The regulator said the crisis was triggered by actions of the National Oil and Gas Suppliers Association, which disrupted diesel supply to sites operated by IHS Nigeria Ltd., a tower company that provides power to base stations used by mobile operators including MTN Group Ltd. and Airtel Africa Plc. The emailed statement was signed by NCC Head of Public Affairs, Nnenna Ukoha.

“The NCC is actively engaging with relevant stakeholders to address the diesel supply issues and explore sustainable solutions,” the commission said.

“The Commission urges all parties to work together collaboratively to resolve these challenges swiftly by removing the diesel supply bottlenecks affecting critical telecommunications infrastructure, arising from NOGASA’s actions.”

The NCC urged all stakeholders to work together to resolve the crisis swiftly, assuring subscribers that it remains committed to fostering a conducive environment for the growth and sustainability of telecommunications services nationwide.

The regulator said it would continue to update the public on progress towards the full restoration of services in Abuja, while thanking subscribers for their understanding and patience during the period of disruption.

While diesel remains one of the major bottlenecks for telecoms companies, the sector has so far averted potential crises, particularly this year, that could have led to widespread service disruption.

In July, this publication reported that Nigeria’s telecoms industry grapples with mounting operational costs, spending over $350m annually on diesel-powered generators.

According to the State of Africa’s Infrastructure Report 2025 by the Africa Finance Corporation, telecoms operators in Nigeria consume more than 40 million litres of diesel every month.

This growing reliance on diesel generators adds significant financial pressure on telecoms operators, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

The report stated, “A growing number of tower sites going off-grid or relying on diesel generators is a cause for concern for several reasons. First, it increases CAPEX and OPEX costs for operators, making investments in rural and remote areas even more prohibitive.

“In fact, GSMA Intelligence estimates that the energy cost of a mobile base station in rural areas could be 37 per cent higher than in urban areas. In Nigeria, for instance, telecoms operators consume over 40 million litres of diesel per month, representing a yearly spending of over $350m.

“Mobile broadband costs are further exacerbated by the higher amount of energy required to power data traffic in Africa (0.24 kWh/GB compared to a global average of 0.17 kWh/GB), where lower traffic volumes and the use of older technologies like 3G are energy-inefficient.

“Second, tower sites that rely on generators and batteries report frequent theft of battery equipment and diesel.”

New Delhi: Commercial rollout of satellite internet services may take longer than expected, due to a standoff between the telecom regulator and the department of telecommunications (DoT) over spectrum pricing , industry executives said. The process could potentially take another 3-6 months amid upcoming personnel changes at the DoT and industry interference, they said."The current spectrum pricing proposals, including the disagreements between Trai Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ) and DoT regarding LEO (low earth orbit satellite) spectrum pricing must first be reviewed by a standing committee.The proposal then moves to the digital communications commission (DCC) for approval," Shivaji Chatterjee, CEO and managing director of Hughes Communications India, told ET.After the approval, the matter will go to the union cabinet or the telecom minister, depending on the scope of the issue, he said.Once it receives ministerial approval, the wireless planning and coordination wing (WPC) is tasked with creating specific rules, which will then be put out for public consultation for 30 days."This stage is critical as terrestrial telecom operators may attempt to impede the process during the feedback window," Chatterjee said. Elon Musk's Starlink had on Monday briefly displayed prices of its broadband service in India at ₹8,500 per month, with a ₹32,000 fee for the home equipment, on its website, but later retracted it, citing technical glitches. This prompted industry-wide expectation of an impending launch.So far, Starlink, Eutelsat OneWeb, and Jio Satellite have completed most of the licensing and space-regulatory steps, including obtaining the Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence, and approvals from space-regulatory body In-SPACe. Commercial launch, however, hinges on the spectrum allocation based on pricing rules, and compliance with security and capacity rules. Trai had initially proposed a flat rate of 4% of adjusted gross revenues to be charged for spectrum allocation to ensure a standardised approach, offering to impose an urban-usage disincentive to spur more rural coverage. The DoT, however, proposed to raise charges to 5% of AGR with a 1% discount if they meet specific rural rollout targets.The government's proposal to raise the spectrum charges from the initially recommended rates could be a gesture to pacify the telcos who have been demanding a level-playing field, an industry executive said. The executive, however, noted that the difference in revenues from changing the pricing to 5% from 4% would be financially insignificant for the government. "It was done primarily as a symbolic gesture to show the DoT was addressing telco concerns," the person added.Experts said telcos are not necessarily afraid of the immediate competition in broadband internet with the entry of satellite internet services. "The long-term fear is direct-to-mobile (D2M) technology," one of the executives cited above said. Telcos view low-earth orbit satellites as "potential mobile towers in the sky" that can serve handsets directly, bypassing terrestrial networks.

[TITLE]Connect Everyone Coalition enlists groups to modernize space development policy:
[TEXT]
Twenty organizations, working under the aegis of The Connect Everyone Coalition, have called on nine federal agencies to modernize and reduce bureaucracy in policy related to the commercial space industry.

While parts of the space development policy letter called for general changes and updates, the focus is on low-earth orbit (LEO) technology. The letter cited four current areas of redundancy and inefficiency: fragmented multi-agency approvals, redundant environmental reviews, redundant range safety determinations, and lack of transparency regarding scheduling and delays.

“New space-based innovations like low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have the potential to finally give every American access to reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband and the 21st-century opportunities that it unlocks,” CEC executive director Richard Cullen said in a
