Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) Power-run Nyambunde small hydropower (SHP) plant in Kisii County has been connected to the national grid, earning extra revenue from the sale of excess power.

Nyakwana Power Company, which owns the project, has signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Kenya Power, formally integrating the two megawatt (MW) plant into the national grid.

The plant, which was commissioned in December 2023, has been supplying power to Ogembo, Kiamokama, Itumbe and Nyankoba tea factories.

The three factories are among the shareholders (owners) of the plant in conjunction with Nyamache, Nyansiongo, Kebirigo, Sanganyi, Gianchore and Tombe tea factories, all being KTDA-managed tea factories in both Nyamira and Kisii counties.

KTDA Power Company Ltd, a subsidiary of KTDA Holdings Ltd, is also a shareholder.

The Nyambunde SHP on Gucha River is one of six operational power plants managed by KTDA Power. Another six projects are at advanced stages of construction.

The factories supplied power from SHPs are realising value through reduction of the cost of power, improved quality and reliability and promoting the use of green energy in the country and as a source of additional income to the tea farmers.

This not only contributes to sustainability goals but also enhances the overall competitiveness of their tea in global markets.

Electricity constitutes about 15 per cent of the tea production costs at the factory, and having its own power translates into more revenue for the farmers in future.

The power plants are developed using a mix of debt and equity, meaning that once the loans are fully serviced, even greater value will begin to flow directly to the growers.

The six operational power plants: Imenti, Gura, North Mathioya, Chania, Nyambunde and Lower Nyamindi all have a combined installed capacity of 17MW and are connected to 17 Tea Factories.

[TITLE]Workhorse Group and Motiv Electric Trucks Executed:
[TEXT]
Joins Workhorse’s proven vehicles, manufacturing capabilities and national dealer network with Motiv’s diverse product portfolio and top fleet relationships

Positions combined company to create value by offering broader portfolio of high performing commercial EVs at lower unit costs in the sizeable medium-duty truck market

Strengthens combined company’s financial profile through improved operational scale and

simplified capital structure

Workhorse closed today on $20M sale leaseback of Union City plant and $5M convertible note

CINCINNATI, Ohio and FOSTER CITY, Calif., Aug. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group Inc. (Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or the “Company”), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, and Motiv Electric Trucks (“Motiv”), a leading manufacturer of medium-duty electric trucks and buses, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to combine in a transaction that will create a leading North American medium-duty electric truck OEM.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, following the completion of the all-stock transaction, Motiv’s controlling investor will become the majority owner of the combined company and Workhorse shareholders will maintain a significant equity stake. In connection with the merger agreement, Workhorse has completed a sale leaseback (“SLB”) and obtained convertible note financing. The transactions value the combined company at approximately $105 million.1

The combination brings together two innovators in the medium-duty electric vehicle space to better serve a blue-chip customer base and enhance value for shareholders. Building on the companies’ complementary platforms, the combined business will be a leader in the $23 billion medium-duty truck segment2 with a full range of Class 4-6 trucks. The companies believe that together, they will benefit from increased scale, an expanded product portfolio and enhanced operational efficiencies to support lower unit costs while optimizing total cost of ownership (TCO) for customers.

The combined company is expected to have a strengthened financial profile with a simplified capital structure and the financial resources to capture anticipated demand from the ongoing transition to clean energy and better help customers decarbonize their fleets.

Following the closing of the transaction, Scott Griffith, Motiv CEO, is expected to serve as CEO of the combined company and Rick Dauch, Workhorse CEO, is expected to serve as an advisor to the combined company.

“Bringing together two leading OEMs in the medium-duty space strengthens our ability to reduce the cost of electric trucks and make the total cost of ownership even more compelling,” said Scott Griffith, CEO of Motiv. “We believe this is a coming-of-age moment—not just for Motiv and Workhorse, but for the industry as a whole, and that widespread adoption of medium-duty electric trucks will come from achieving cost parity vs. ICE and diesel trucks and offering compelling long-term value. That’s exactly what we’re focused on delivering with this merger, and with a combined more than 17 million miles under our belt, we believe the transaction will put us in a strong starting position to deliver on this vision. I’m excited by the opportunity to lead the combined company, work closely with the Motiv and Workhorse teams to capture the opportunities ahead, and deliver for our customers, our shareholders and the communities in which our trucks operate.”

“This transaction represents a significant milestone for Workhorse, our customers, our stakeholders and our shareholders,” said Rick Dauch, CEO of Workhorse. “By combining with Motiv and completing the related transactions, we are creating a broader product offering, strengthening our near- and long-term financial position and providing Workhorse shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the upside of a leader in the medium-duty EV commercial vehicle market. We believe Motiv is the right partner to support the advancement of our combined product roadmap and capture new growth opportunities. Together, we are confident we will be even better positioned to win the commercial EV transition and create value for shareholders.”

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits

Workhorse and Motiv believe that the investments made into their respective businesses position the combined company to have the sector’s most scalable manufacturing, most advanced and road-tested products, and most wide-reaching go-to-market networks. As a result, the companies believe the transaction will provide significant benefits to customers and shareholders by:

Creating a category leader positioned for rapid innovation and scalable growth. Joining Motiv’s diverse product portfolio and top fleet relationships with Workhorse’s proven vehicles, manufacturing capabilities and national dealer network is expected to create a platform for long-term growth. Workhorse’s Union City facility has the capacity to eventually produce up to 5,000 trucks per year.

Workhorse and Motiv believe that the combined company will compete more effectively with the industry’s pure-play electric and legacy OEMs. Workhorse and Motiv believe the combined company will capitalize on new opportunities to serve more customers with a more competitively advantaged electric offering than gas/diesel trucks and buses on a TCO basis.

Joining complementary customer bases. Workhorse and Motiv believe the next phase of large-scale adoption of medium-duty electric trucks in North America will be driven by national-scale commercial fleets with tested and piloted multi-depot EV truck operations. Together, Motiv and Workhorse have served 10 of the largest medium-duty fleets in North America 3 , positioning the combined company to expand adoption through these existing relationships with likely early scalers.

With a simplified capital structure, the combined company also expects to be better positioned to raise additional capital post-close. Presenting significant synergy opportunities. The companies believe there is the potential to achieve at least $20 million of cost synergies, including through R&D, G&A, and facility cost-reductions by the end of 2026. The combined companies also intend to utilize a product and engineering approach to maximize the use of common software, hardware, and IP across its Class 4-6 platforms to pursue additional cost savings, an enhanced technology baseline and a best-in-class customer experience with limited downtime and optimized TCO.

Transaction Details

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Motiv will be merged with a newly created subsidiary of Workhorse in exchange for newly issued shares of Workhorse common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, on a fully diluted basis, Motiv’s controlling investor initially will own approximately 62.5% of the combined company, Workhorse shareholders will own approximately 26.5% and Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender will have rights to receive common stock that represent approximately 11%, all of which are subject to certain potential adjustments and additional future dilution. Pursuant to the transaction, certain stockholders of Motiv, to the extent they are also holders of financial indebtedness of Motiv, agreed to cancel their financial indebtedness to Motiv in exchange for Workhorse common stock. Additional information regarding Workhorse’s agreement with its secured lender and select other parties will be available in the Company’s SEC filings.

In connection with the proposed merger transaction, Workhorse also completed two transactions with entities affiliated with Motiv’s controlling investor: the SLB transaction for Workhorse’s Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility for $20 million and the secured, convertible note financing for $5 million, each of which were consummated at the time of execution with the merger agreement. These transactions are expected to provide near-term liquidity to fund Workhorse’s operations through closing and to provide capital to pay down debt owed to Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender. At closing of the merger, all remaining indebtedness to such lender, including all warrants currently held by the lender, will be repaid and/or cancelled, with the only remaining secured indebtedness of the combined companies being the $5 million secured, convertible note held by Motiv’s controlling investor, which may convert to equity in connection with post-closing financing.

In addition, the merger agreement includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s controlling investor will provide $20 million in debt financing at the completion of the transaction, of which approximately $10 million is expected to be available in a revolving credit facility and an additional $10 million is expected to be available to fund manufacturing costs associated with confirmed purchase orders of the combined company in an ABL facility. The combined company also will seek to raise additional equity financing to fund its go forward strategic execution.

Timing and Approvals

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to Workhorse shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions, including the debt financing commitment noted above.

Letter to Workhorse Shareholders

Workhorse also issued a letter to its shareholders highlighting the strategic and financial benefits of the proposed transaction. The full letter from Rick Dauch, Workhorse CEO, can be accessed here.

[TITLE]Exxon Seals Massive Trinidad Oil and Gas Exploration Deal:
[TEXT]
Exxon has sealed a deal with the Trinidad and Tobago government for deepwater exploration that could involve investments of $21.7 billion, according to the Caribbean nation’s energy minister.

“What we are awarding today is larger than the surface area of the country,” Roodal Moonilat said as he broke the news of the new deal, saying the area that Exxon will explore was the size of seven normal offshore blocks.

Said area lies northwest of the Stabroek block—the offshore Guyana block that Exxon has been developing since 2005, with the first production well drilled in 2015. Since the start of exploration, Exxon has tapped an estimated 11 billion barrels in reserves and production has grown rapidly, turning Guyana into a rare hot spot in the world of oil. Plans are to pump 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2030. To date, production runs at 900,000 barrels daily.

Due to its proximity to the Guyana oil bounty, Trinidad and Tobago made a logical choice for Exxon. The supermajor had a presence in the Caribbean country until 2003, when it announced it would quit, following an unsuccessful exploration campaign.

Despite that failure, Trinidad and Tobago is the largest oil and gas producer in the Caribbean and the 17th largest in the world. Its oil and gas industry is seen growing at a compound annual rate of 4.4% over the decade to 2030, with companies involved in that growth including BP, Shell, and Spain’s Repsol—and now Exxon, which very much hopes to replicate its Guyana story in Trinidad.

The new exploration campaign will begin with an investment of $42 million and the drilling of two wells, the first of which could be drilled in six months, once the company finishes with its seismic survey of the area. If that is successful, development could be even faster than it was in Guyana, Reuters noted in a report on the news.

[TITLE]Centrica Signs 10 Year Deal for USA Natural Gas With Devon Energy:
[TEXT]
The deal expands Centrica's global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office.

Centrica Plc signed a 10-year agreement to buy natural gas from Devon Energy Corp. to help expand its activities across the Atlantic.

Centrica Energy, its trading arm, will receive 50,000 million British thermal units per day of natural gas from 2028, or the equivalent of five liquefied natural gas cargoes per year, according to a statement on Friday. The volumes will be indexed to TTF, the European benchmark price.

The deal expands Centrica’s global gas business after the recent announcement of a New York office. The agreement will also help the firm to manage the price risk in its liquefied natural gas portfolio by aligning feed gas rates with European futures. For Devon, the deal offers exposure to international markets, according to the statement.

“Gas remains an essential transition fuel and, through long-term agreements like this, Centrica ensures competitively-indexed gas supply,” said Centrica Chief Executive Officer Chris O’Shea.

US natural gas producers are increasingly seeking to lock in agreements with buyers overseas. Both the Asian and the European benchmarks for the heating and power-generation fuel trade at roughly four times the price at Henry Hub in Louisiana, the US benchmark.

In February, Centrica signed a 15-year agreement to supply American LNG to Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and last year it struck a deal with US-based Coterra Energy Inc. to secure more gas.
