[TITLE]FDA Explores New Contracting Approach to Advance Public Health Innovation:
[TEXT]
For Immediate Release: December 19, 2025

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking input from venture capital firms on developing a new contracting approach to strengthen collaboration between the agency and America’s most innovative companies.

The FDA recognizes that many breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions relevant to its public health mission — including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, medical devices, and regulatory technology — are being developed by firms within venture capital portfolios. However, longstanding challenges, have limited engagement with innovative companies. Many existing federal contracting mechanisms favor large systems integrators and intermediaries that focus on labor-based work rather than scalable technologies. In addition, small business set-aside programs can be difficult for early-stage companies to access and have faced concerns

[TITLE]Rezubio Announces $20 Million Series A Financing to Advance the Membrane-Anchored Therapeutics Platform and Company Pipeline, with Lead Program in Obesity and Diabetes:
[TEXT]
ZHUHAI, China, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rezubio, a China-based biotechnology company founded by former Merck scientists, today announced the closing of a $20 million Series A financing. Proceeds will be used to advance the company’s lead program into Phase 2 clinical development for obesity and diabetes, as well as other programs in IND-enabling stage and early preclinical stage.

The financing was led by Lapam Capital, with participation from Frees Fund and Riverhead Capital.

“This Series A represents an important inflection point for Rezubio,” said Yusheng Xiong, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Rezubio. “Membrane anchoring has the potential to reshape how targeted medicines are designed. Our MADD platform enables highly localized pharmacology for cell-surface targets, including GPCRs, while minimizing systemic exposure. Our gut-targeted GPCR agonist has entered clinical trials in Australia and is expected to provide a critical proof-of-concept for the platform. In parallel, an antagonist targeting a different GPCR for immune and inflammatory diseases will enter Phase 1 clinical development in early 2026.”

A Novel Approach to Tissue-Selective Delivery: Membrane-Anchored Drug Design (MADD)

Rezubio’s MADD platform uses a rationally engineered kinetophore to anchor pharmacophores to the epithelium of target tissues, enabling localized drug activity at the site of action. This approach is designed to deliver:

Minimal systemic exposure, reducing the risk of off-target and dose-limiting adverse effects

Enhanced efficacy through enrichment of active compounds around cell-surface target proteins

Prolonged tissue residence time, supporting less frequent dosing

By addressing limitations of conventional small-molecule and peptide therapeutics—such as the adverse effects and frequent administration—Rezubio aims to improve both therapeutic index and patient compliance.

[TITLE]ProPhase Labs Signs Non-Binding LOI for Proposed Reverse Merger with Advanced Biological Laboratories:
[TEXT]
Proposed transaction aims to deliver near-term value for ProPhase shareholders, long-term growth for ABL, and create a global, innovation-driven company.

Company to hold a virtual conference call today at 10:00 a.m. ET

UNIONDALE, NY, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProPhase Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPH) ("ProPhase") and Advanced Biological Laboratories S.A. ("ABL"), a European biotechnology and MedTech group, today announced that they have entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") regarding a proposed reverse merger transaction pursuant to which ABL would become the majority owner of the combined entity (the “Proposed Transaction”).

The LOI reflects preliminary understandings only and does not create any obligation to consummate a transaction, except with respect to customary confidentiality and expense provisions. The Proposed Transaction remains subject to completion of due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, regulatory approvals, Nasdaq listing requirements, and other customary closing conditions.

While subject to finalization in definitive agreements, the parties have discussed a preliminary, non-binding valuation framework for the legacy ProPhase business that may imply an enterprise value of up to approximately $30 million. Under the terms contemplated in the LOI, subject to applicable law, board approvals, and definitive documentation, ProPhase Labs may declare a special cash dividend of up to $10 million payable to shareholders of ProPhase Labs common stock as of a record date to be determined. Any such cash distribution would be separate from and not part of the merged operating company. Additionally, as described below, all Crown Medical Collections receivables are expected to be carved out for the exclusive benefit of current ProPhase shareholders.

This framework represents the preliminary structure, subject to definitive documentation, for the transaction, expressly excludes certain cash distributions, asset carve-outs, and retained liabilities described below, and is subject to change based on due diligence, capitalization adjustments, financing activity, market conditions and final transaction terms. The parties currently anticipate working toward execution of definitive documentation within approximately 60 to 90 days.

Strategic Rationale and Leadership Commentary

“This LOI represents what we believe is one of the most important strategic developments in ProPhase Labs’ history,” said Ted Karkus, Chief Executive Officer of ProPhase Labs. “The proposed transaction structure is designed to deliver meaningful near-term value to our existing shareholders, while aligning ProPhase within the ABL Group, a global leader in molecular analysis, clinical research, and healthcare innovation that can accelerate the development and long-term potential of our genomics and diagnostic programs.”

Transaction Structure and Operating Focus

The Proposed Transaction envisions that ABL shareholders would own approximately 76% of the combined company at closing. Following completion of the merger, a newly established U.S. subsidiary would hold and operate ProPhase’s Nebula Genomics platform, BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test program, and select consumer health businesses, enabling focused capital allocation and strategic execution.

ABL would contribute its global infrastructure, including advanced data processing systems, cloud computing for health data, and financing capabilities. The ABL Group operates successful businesses:

ABL Diagnostics (Euronext: ABLD, FR001400AHX6) delivers cutting-edge molecular testing solutions.

CDL Pharma provides clinical trial logistics and sample management services.

Humedics commercializes the LiMAx® liver function capacity test, a real-time breath test supporting liver surgery and transplantation.

These companies would become sister entities to the new U.S. subsidiary, which is expected to remain under ProPhase’s current management team.

“This proposed transaction represents a highly strategic opportunity for the ABL Group,” said Dr. Chalom B. Sayada, CEO of ABL. “By combining with a Nasdaq-listed U.S. platform, ABL will gain enhanced access to U.S. capital markets and accelerate commercialization of its portfolio in the United States. At the same time, ABL’s international distribution network and regulatory expertise will support global expansion of ProPhase’s BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test, Nebula Genomics, and consumer health businesses. This combination is intended to create meaningful, two-way strategic value and reinforces our commitment to innovation, global reach, and sustainable growth.”

Significant Value Carve-Outs for Current ProPhase Shareholders

Under the LOI, ProPhase Labs may declare a special cash dividend of up to $10 million payable to shareholders of record as of a date to be determined. This distribution would be separate from the merged operating company.

Additionally, all Crown Medical Collections receivables are expected to be carved out for the exclusive benefit of current ProPhase shareholders, with anticipated collections of approximately $50 million net. These estimates are forward-looking and subject to significant uncertainty, including collection risk and timing variability.

Together, these elements provide current ProPhase shareholders with a differentiated value pathway independent of the future performance of the combined company.

Allocation of Assets and Liabilities

The combined operating company would assume only those liabilities expressly agreed in definitive documentation, currently contemplated to include approximately $5 million of ProPhase Labs’ existing indebtedness. All other legacy liabilities would remain with ProPhase Labs and would not be obligations of the post-merger entity.

Transaction Status

The proposed transaction remains subject to due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, regulatory approvals, Nasdaq listing requirements, and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be reached or that the transaction will be consummated.

CEO to Present to Shareholders

ProPhase will present to shareholders today, December 19, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. ET during the Virtual Non-Deal Roadshow Series hosted by Renmark Financial Communications Inc.

[TITLE]Google lines up collaborations, pledges funding for AI push in healthcare, agriculture:
[TEXT]
Google on Tuesday announced funding support of $8 million to India's AI Centers of Excellence for health, agriculture, education, and sustainable cities, and committed $4,00,000 to support development of India's health foundation model.

Google - - the architect of AI models, including Gemini and Gemma that are integrated for search enhancements, cloud services, and enterprise tools - - is also supporting Gnani.AI, CoRover.AI, and BharatGen with $50,000 grants each for building models serving Indic language solutions.

Google said it is providing Wadhwani AI with $4.5 million in funding to support multilingual AI-powered applications for health and agriculture, according to a release.

The announcements mark a slew of new collaborations and funding commitments by Google to bolster India's AI ecosystem, the company said.

"Google announced funding of $4,00,000 to support new collaborations that will leverage 'MedGemma' to build India's Health Foundation Models," the company said in a release.

Such models aim to raise the efficiency of healthcare providers and improve patient outcomes across India.

Google said Ajna Lens will work with experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to build models that will support India-specific use cases in Dermatology and OPD Triaging.

The resulting models, it said, will contribute to India's Digital Public Infrastructure and their outcomes will be made accessible to the ecosystem.

Additionally, researchers, AI experts, and clinicians from IISc will explore using AI models for broader clinical applications.

To push its inclusive AI agenda, Google announced a $2 million founding contribution to establish the new Indic Language Technologies Research Hub at IIT Bombay. The initiative aims to ensure global advancements serve India's linguistic diversity, Google said.
