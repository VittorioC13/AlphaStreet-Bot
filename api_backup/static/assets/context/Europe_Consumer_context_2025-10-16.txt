AUBURN HILLS, Michigan, October 14, 2025 – Stellantis announced today plans to invest $13 billion over the next four years to grow its business in the critical United States market and to increase its domestic manufacturing footprint. The investment is the largest in the Company’s 100-year U.S. history and will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the brand portfolio in key segments; production of the all-new four-cylinder engine; and the addition of more than 5,000 jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

The new investment will further expand Stellantis’ already significant U.S. footprint, increasing annual finished vehicle production by 50% over current levels. The new product launches will be in addition to a regular cadence of 19 refreshed products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029.

“This investment in the U.S. – the single largest in the Company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America COO. “As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.”

“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” Filosa said.

Plant Investment Details1

The $13 billion investment plan includes research and development and supplier costs to execute the Company’s full product strategy over the next four years as well as investments in its manufacturing operations. The details of the plant-specific investments follow:

Illinois

Stellantis intends to invest more than $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant to expand production of the Jeep ® Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. With an initial production launch expected in 2027, these actions are anticipated to create around 3,300 new jobs.

Ohio

With an investment of nearly $400 million, assembly of an all-new midsize truck, previously allocated to the Belvidere plant, plans to move to the Toledo Assembly Complex, where it will join the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. The production shift could create more than 900 jobs. Launch timing is expected in 2028.

[TITLE]GM takes $1.6 billion hit as incentives for EVs slashed and emission rules eased:
[TEXT]
General Motors will record a negative impact of $1.6 billion in its next quarter after tax incentives for electric vehicles were slashed by the U.S. and rules governing emissions are relaxed.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.

WATCH: Why the red state of Utah is going green and embracing electric vehicles

EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China’s BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.

[TITLE]IMF upgrades U.S. economic outlook as tariffs cause less disruption, for now:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and global economies will grow a bit more this year than previously forecast as the Trump administration’s tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the agency also said the extensive duties still pose risks.

The United States’ economy will expand 2% in 2025, the IMF projected in its influential semi-annual forecast, the World Economic Outlook. That is slightly higher than the 1.9% forecast in the IMF’s last update in July and 1.8% in April. The U.S. should grow 2.1% next year, also just one-tenth of a percent faster than its previous projection, the IMF said.

The global economy, meanwhile, will grow 3.2% this year, up from a 3% estimate in July, the IMF forecast, and 3.1% in 2026, the same as its previous estimate.

The figures represent a bit of a round-trip for the IMF: In January, before President Donald Trump began imposing tariffs, it had forecast global growth of 3.3%, only slightly higher than its newest estimate. While the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it’s too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the IMF said, as Trump has continued to make tariff threats and it can take time for changes in international trade patterns to play out.

On Friday, for example, Trump threatened to slap 100% duties on all imports from China, which caused a sharp fall in the stock market.

IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a news conference that the import taxes and ongoing threats to impose more duties have created ongoing uncertainty for many businesses and it’s weighing on the world economy.

“The tariff shock is here, and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects,” he said.

Gourinchas also said that a burst of investment in artificial intelligence, in the form of huge data centers and extensive computing power, has helped offset the drag from trade and boosting the U.S. economy. Yet if a financial market bubble formed and then burst, it could sharply slow business investment and consumer spending, he said.

“There are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s,” he said. “It was the Internet then, it is AI now.”

Shares of two companies active in the AI sector, AMD and Oracle, which announced an expanding partnership Tuesday, have seen their shares rise 80% this year.

Gains in AI-related stock values have lifted Americans’ wealth and fueled consumer spending, Gourinchas said, just as companies are ramping up their investments in advanced computer chips and building data centers. Hotter spending and investment could push central banks to raise interest rates over time, he said.

Gourinchas also offered several reasons the U.S. and global economies have remained resilient after the widespread imposition of tariffs earlier this year.

“First and foremost, the tariff shock itself is smaller than initially feared, with many trade deals and exemptions,” he said. “Most countries also refrained from retaliation, keeping the trading system open. And the private sector also proved agile, front-loading imports and re-routing supply chains.”

By front-loading imports, many U.S. companies were able to stock up on goods before the duties took effect, enabling them to avoid or delay price increases.

Yet many of those factors only reflect “temporary relief, rather than underlying strength in economic fundamentals,” the IMF’s report said.

READ MORE: China refuses to give in to Trump’s tariff threat

The IMF also said that import price data in the U.S. shows that so far importers and retailers are paying most of the tariffs, not overseas companies, as many Trump administration officials have predicted. Over time, those firms are likely to pass on more of the price hikes to consumers, the report said.

There are signs that some downsides of the higher tariffs are starting to emerge, the IMF outlook said. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, has ticked up to 2.9%, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, up from 2.7% a year ago. Hiring has ground to nearly a halt, which could partly reflect a more cautious approach by many firms in the wake of the uncertainty created by the higher tariffs.

The IMF’s forecasts are modestly more optimistic than many private-sector economists’ expectations. The National Association for Business Economics, a group of academic and business economists, on Monday forecast that the U.S. would grow just 1.8% this year and 1.7% in 2026.

Nearly two-thirds of the economists surveyed by the NABE said they think the administration’s duties are nevertheless slowing growth, by up to a half-percentage point.

China, meanwhile, has weathered the hit from U.S. tariffs by sending more of its goods to Europe and Asia, rather than the United States, the IMF said. Its currency has depreciated, which has made its exports cheaper. The IMF is forecasting that China’s economy will expand 4.8% this year and 4.2% in 2026, the same as in July.

Gourinchas said that China’s economy has grown increasingly dependent on exports, while its real estate sector continues to struggle under heavy debt loads.

“It is increasingly hard to see how this could be sustained,” he added.

In Europe, Germany is bolstering growth by increasing government spending to build up its military, Gourinchas said. The IMF now expects the 20 countries that use the euro to grow 1.2% this year, up from a 1% forecast in July, and 1.1% next year, the same as three months ago.

The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.

[TITLE]Levi’s Q3 Profits Top Estimates as CEO Michelle Gass Grows More Bullish on the Year:
[TEXT]
Levi Strauss & Co. is riding the denim cycle higher — and continuing to bust out of its traditional role as a men’s jeans brand.

Adjusted third-quarter profits inched up 1.5 percent to $136 million, with earnings per share of 34 cents coming in 3 cents ahead of the 31 cents analysts forecast, according to Yahoo Finance.

Revenues for the three months ended Aug. 31 rose 7 percent to $1.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations and enough for chief executive officer Michelle Gass to boost Levi’s outlook for the year.

“Our strategies are working and this is giving us the confidence to raise our top- and bottom-line guidance,” Gass told WWD. “We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of high-single-digit organic growth. [Produced] record gross margin once again, despite the impact [of] the tariffs. This was now our 14th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth.”

Gass, who’s been CEO at Levi’s since January 2024, has been building on and sharpening the company’s efforts to expand its own direct-to-consumer business, which currently accounts for 46 percent of sales, and bring in more women shoppers.

It’s been a very step-wise approach-building quarter after quarter, but investors wanted something more at first blush and traded shares of the company down 5.8 percent to $23.10 in after-hours trading on Thursday, retrenching some after a 40 percent increase this year.

But Gass’ focus is clearly on the business.

“This pivot from being a jeans company to a head-to-toe denim lifestyle company is well underway and resonating,” Gass said. “We still have growth across genders — men’s up 5 percent, women’s up 9 percent. The brand has never been stronger.”

The company just wrapped up a yearlong marketing campaign with Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and is now featuring Grammy-nominated country artist Shaboozey in its ads, rounding out what’s been a year focused on Levi’s connection to music.

“We enter holiday with confidence,” Gass said. “It is an uncertain environment, but I will tell you that we are really focused on executing our strategy.”

That strategy has seen the company close the Levi’s footwear business, exit the lower-priced Denizen brand and sell Dockers in July.

The U.S. should grow 2.1% next year, also just one-tenth of a percent faster than its previous projection, the IMF said.

Its current forecasts are still down from a year ago, however, a sign that the international lending agency expects the tariffs to weaken the U.S. economy, in part by creating more uncertainty for businesses. Last October, the IMF forecast the U.S. would grow 2.2% this year.

All the projections also represent a slowing from 2024, when the U.S. economy expanded at a faster 2.8%.

The global economy, meanwhile, will grow 3.2% this year, up from a 3% estimate in July, the IMF forecast, and 3.1% in 2026, the same as its previous estimate.

[TITLE]Breitbart Business Digest: Six Months After Liberation Day, Every Economic Prediction About Trump’s Tariffs Was Wrong:
[TEXT]
How Economists’ Central Anti-Tariff Prediction Collapsed

In yesterday’s Breitbart Business Digest, we examined a new working paper from Jared Bernstein and Daniel Posthumus that documented the decline of U.S. manufacturing employment, particularly the devastating 2000-2010 “China Shock” period when 5.7 million factory jobs disappeared.

While the authors called this period “destructive” and urged preventing future shocks, they insisted that “sweeping” tariffs were not the right policy. Their reasoning was undermined by a significant contradiction: they claim tariffs would disrupt American manufacturing because we’re too dependent on foreign inputs, yet they simultaneously advocate for subsidies for sectors vulnerable to foreign export controls. They’ve essentially documented that our industrial base is dangerously hollowed out while arguing we’re too dependent to fix it.

As we explained, the real-world evidence further undermines their anti-tariff position. Despite President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs imposed in April 2025, the predicted “tarifflation” never materialized. Prices on tariffed imports haven’t risen as economists predicted. In fact, prices on non-tariffed domestic goods rose more than tariffed imports, while domestic goods competing with tariffed imports are actually down since Liberation Day. There certainly has not been any widespread inflation created by tariffs. The central economic case against tariffs—that they raise consumer prices—has collapsed in the face of actual data.

What we’re actually seeing is something economists have long theorized as “optimal tariff theory.“ A country with a globally dominant consumer market can employ tariffs to force foreign manufacturers to lower prices to maintain their exports. It can also successfully pressure other countries to reduce their own import barriers by threatening even higher tariffs. Finally, the household sector can force a redistribution from the corporate sector by refusing to accept the pass-through of tariff costs.

Today we look at the rest of the anti-tariff case and how it fares even worse under scrutiny. The paper warned that tariffs would spark devastating retaliation and trade wars. Six months into Trump’s tariff regime, that retaliation never materialized. Countries lined up to negotiate instead. We’ll examine why the paper’s preferred approach—targeted subsidies for “strategic sectors”—is actually more likely to provoke conflict than sweeping tariffs, and why the “strategic” label turns out to be little more than a cover for liberal policy preferences. Finally, we’ll see how the real-world evidence after Liberation Day contradicts every theoretical objection the authors raised.

The Retaliation That Didn’t Happen

The paper warns that tariffs “lower both imports and exports, through other countries’ retaliation.” This is a now-familiar trope of anti-tariff economics. Tariffs ignite trade wars and tit-for-tat escalation, the critics claim.

But six months into Trump’s tariff regime, where is the retaliation?

For the most part, it didn’t happen. Countries lined up to negotiate. The European Union cut a deal. Japan came to the table. South Korea made concessions. Rather than launching a trade war, our trading partners discovered they need the American market, often admitting that the status quo ante had been unfair to the U.S. and created unbalanced trade patterns.

This is the most important development in the entire debate. Many economists insisted that retaliation was inevitable. That never really made much sense. In the first place, many of the same economists insisted that tariffs were damaging to countries that imposed them, hurting their own consumers through higher prices and inefficient production. But if that were so, why would anyone retaliate? It would be like gouging out your own eye in retaliation for your rival gouging out his eye.

More importantly, the theory of retaliation had no basis in economics. It was a political theory that got smuggled into economics. It was

The IMF’s forecasts are modestly more optimistic than many private-sector economists’ expectations. The National Association for Business Economics, a group of academic and business economists, on Monday forecast that the U.S. would grow just 1.8% this year and 1.7% in 2026.

Nearly two-thirds of the economists surveyed by the NABE said they think the administration’s duties are nevertheless slowing growth, by up to a half-percentage point.

China, meanwhile, has weathered the hit from U.S. tariffs by sending more of its goods to Europe and Asia, rather than the United States, the IMF said. Its currency has depreciated, which has made its exports cheaper. The IMF is forecasting that China’s economy will expand 4.8% this year and 4.2% in 2026, the same as in July.

Gourinchas said that China’s economy has grown increasingly dependent on exports, while its real estate sector continues to struggle under heavy debt loads.

“It is increasingly hard to see how this could be sustained,” he added.

In Europe, Germany is bolstering growth by increasing government spending to build up its military, Gourinchas said. The IMF now expects the 20 countries that use the euro to grow 1.2% this year, up from a 1% forecast in July, and 1.1% next year, the same as three months ago.

The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.

[TITLE]‘It was the internet then, it is AI now’: IMF upgrades U.S. growth outlook but sees ‘echoes’ of late ’90s dot-com boom:
[TEXT]
The U.S. and global economies will grow a bit more this year than previously forecast as the Trump administration’s tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the agency also said the extensive duties still pose risks.

The United States’ economy will expand 2% in 2025, the IMF projected in its influential semiannual forecast, the World Economic Outlook. That is slightly higher than the 1.9% forecast in the IMF’s last update in July and 1.8% in April. The U.S. should grow 2.1% next year, also just one-tenth of a percent faster than its previous projection, the IMF said.

Its current forecasts are still down from a year ago, however, a sign that the international lending agency expects the tariffs to weaken the U.S. economy, in part by creating more uncertainty for businesses. Last October, the IMF forecast the U.S. would grow 2.2% this year.

All the projections also represent a slowing from 2024, when the U.S. economy expanded at a faster 2.8%.

The global economy, meanwhile, will grow 3.2% this year, up from a 3% estimate in July, the IMF forecast, and 3.1% in 2026, the same as its previous estimate.

While the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it’s too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the IMF said, as Trump has continued to make tariff threats and it can take time for changes in international trade patterns to play out.

On Friday, for example, Trump threatened to slap 100% duties on all imports from China, which caused a sharp fall in the stock market.

IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a news conference that the import taxes and ongoing threats to impose more duties have created ongoing uncertainty for many businesses and are weighing on the world economy.

“The tariff shock is here, and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects,” he said.

Gourinchas also said that a burst of investment in artificial intelligence, in the form of huge data centers and extensive computing power, has helped offset the drag from trade and boosting the U.S. economy. Yet if a financial market bubble formed and then burst, it could sharply slow business investment and consumer spending, he said.

“There are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s,” he said. “It was the internet then, it is AI now.”

Shares of two companies active in the AI sector, AMD and Oracle, which announced an expanding partnership Tuesday, have seen their shares rise 80% this year.

Gains in AI-related stock values have lifted Americans’ wealth and fueled consumer spending, Gourinchas said, just as companies are ramping up their investments in advanced computer chips and building data centers. Hotter spending and investment could push central banks to raise interest rates over time, he said.

Gourinchas also offered several reasons the U.S. and global economies have remained resilient after the widespread imposition of tariffs earlier this year.

“First and foremost, the tariff shock itself is smaller than initially feared, with many trade deals and exemptions,” he said. “Most countries also refrained from retaliation, keeping the trading system open. And the private sector also proved agile, front-loading imports and rerouting supply chains.”

By front-loading imports, many U.S. companies were able to stock up on goods before the duties took effect, enabling them to avoid or delay price increases.

Yet many of those factors only reflect “temporary relief, rather than underlying strength in economic fundamentals,” the IMF’s report said.

The IMF also said that import price data in the U.S. shows that so far importers and retailers are paying most of the tariffs, not overseas companies, as many Trump administration officials have predicted. Over time, those firms are likely to pass on more of the price hikes to consumers, the report said.

There are signs that some downsides of the higher tariffs are starting to emerge, the IMF outlook said. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, has ticked up to 2.9%, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, up from 2.7% a year ago. Hiring has ground to nearly a halt, which could partly reflect a more cautious approach by many firms in the wake of the uncertainty created by the higher tariffs.

The IMF’s forecasts are modestly more optimistic than many private-sector economists’ expectations. The National Association for Business Economics, a group of academic and business economists, on Monday forecast that the U.S. would grow just 1.8% this year and 1.7% in 2026.

Euratex joins several other European fashion industry associations as well as those representing other industries and businesses in declaring the EU-Mercosur Agreement will be a “critical element in ensuring the EU’s long-term competitiveness”.

The associations, which include the European Footwear Confederation (CEC), the European Branded Clothing Association (EBCA) and the Confederation of National Associations of Tanners and Dressers of the European Community (COTANCE), state: “In this unprecedented time when the rules-based global order is being critically undermined, this free trade agreement represents a beacon in the EU’s diversification strategy.”

Together, the associations’ members cover a significant portion of the total trade in goods and services of over €153bn ($176.86bn) in 2024 between the EU and the Mercosur region, as well as the approximately €380bn of mutual investment in the two regions in 2023.

By 2040, according to DG Trade’s calculations, the agreement is expected to add €77.6bn to the EU GDP and €9.4bn to the Mercosur GDP.

At the same time, the agreement will result in a 39% increase in EU exports to Mercosur and a 17% increase in Mercosur exports to the EU.

The associations describe the EU-Mercosur as a modern agreement that is driven by modern principles.

[TITLE]US tariffs severely hit India's textile exporters; industry seeks moratorium, raw material reforms: CITI survey:
[TEXT]
India's textile and apparel exporters are facing severe disruptions following the United States' imposition of a 50 per cent additional tariff, according to a nationwide survey conducted by the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI). The survey revealed that the US, which accounts for India's 28 per cent of total textile and apparel shipments, has become significantly less accessible due to the steep tariff structure, eroding India's export competitiveness.

Nearly one-third of the respondents reported a turnover decline of more than 50 per cent following the tariff increase. The major contributing factors included requests for price discounts from US buyers (30 per cent), order cancellations or postponements (25 per cent), and a reduction in order volumes (20 per cent). Around 85 per cent of the firms reported inventory build-up due to declining orders, while two-thirds were compelled to offer discounts, mostly around 25 per cent, to retain business in the US market.

Liquidity pressures have intensified sharply, with 82 per cent of respondents citing extended credit cycles, and more than half reporting an increase of three to six months. Around 40 per cent noted that their working capital requirements had risen by over 30 per cent, reflecting severe cash flow challenges across the value chain. More than half of the respondents urged the government to announce a moratorium on repayment of existing loans, while 42 per cent recommended collateral-free loans to ease the financial burden.

Europe maintains stronghold on the market due to its strong sustainability policies, circular economy initiatives, and stringent packaging waste directives. Major industries like food, beverages, and personal care are actively adopting sustainable packaging to enhance brand image and meet environmental goals.

What is meant by Sustainable Packaging?

Sustainable packaging refers to packaging that is designed, produced, and used in ways that have minimal environmental impact. It focuses on reducing waste, conserving resources, and promoting the use of renewable, recyclable, or biodegradable materials. In simple terms, it means eco-friendly packaging that protects products while being safe for people and the planet. Examples include paper-based packaging, compostable plastics, and reusable containers. The main goal is to lower carbon emissions, reduce pollution, and support a circular economy.

What are the Latest Trends Shaping the Sustainable Packaging Market in 2025?

Recycled & Mono-Material Packaging : Brands are increasingly using post-consumer recycled content (PCR), and shifting to simpler mono-materials (e.g. all-PE or PP films) so packaging becomes much easier to recycle.

What Potentiates the Growth of the Sustainable Packaging Market?

Consumer Awareness & Corporate Sustainability Goals and ESG

Consumer awareness and demand play a crucial role in driving the growth of the sustainable packaging market. As people become more conscious of environmental issues such as plastic pollution, climate change, and waste generation, they increasingly prefer products packaged in eco-friendly materials.

Corporate Sustainability Goals and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) commitments significantly drive the growth of the sustainable packaging market by integrating environmental responsibility into business strategies. Many global companies have pledged to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce plastic waste, pushing them to adopt eco-friendly packaging solutions. These commitments encourage the use of renewable, recyclable, and biodegradable materials to align with sustainability targets. Additionally, investors and stakeholders increasingly favour companies with strong ESG performance, motivating brands to innovate in packaging to enhance transparency and accountability. By meeting ESG standards, companies not only strengthen brand reputation but also attract environmentally conscious consumers and long-term investors.

For instance, in August 2025, Diageo revised its targets: by 2030, it aims for 50% recycled content in its packaging, with net-zero emissions by 2050. In 2025, it reported exceeding its earlier goal for recycled content in PET bottles (43% vs a 35% target).

Additionally, in May 2025, PepsiCo rewrote its packaging goals: it dropped its reuse targets and set a revised aim for 97% of its portfolio to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2030. The company is also pushing for 40% recycled content in its plastic packaging by 2035 .

. Furthermore, in August 2025, P&G (Procter & Gamble) announced that as of mid-2025, it has designed 80% of its packaging for recycling or reuse, exceeded its target for FSC-certified virgin paper, and is using more recycled content in items like refillable razor packs.
