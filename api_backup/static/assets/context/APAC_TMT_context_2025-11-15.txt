[TITLE]Tencent’s $280 Billion Rally May Extend as Games Boost Earnings:
[TEXT]
As fears grow over concentration in technology stocks amid a possible bubble in the artificial intelligence trade, investors are piling into Tencent Holdings Ltd. shares as a safer bet.

The company is expected to be one of the few China tech megacaps reporting positive profit growth in upcoming results, as bruising price wars drag down peers’ earnings. A strong showing in its online games business could help extend the rally that has added around $280 billion to Tencent’s market value this year.

The stock is up 4.5% this month reflecting that optimism, while rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. have fallen in Hong Kong. Bears have retreated on Tencent since earlier this year, with short interest at less than 0.1% of its free float, S&P Global data show.

“Tencent offers very defensive growth in this kind of environment because they have less competition,” and the stock is cheap, said Elinor Leung, managing director of Asia telecom & internet research at CLSA Ltd. She rates Tencent as her top pick.

The shares have surged 58% this year, but still trade at a substantial discount to global tech peers including Amazon.com Inc. and Nintendo Co. on earnings-based multiples.

Alibaba has seen larger stock gains as it grabbed bigger headlines on the AI front, but Tencent has been making progress with its Hunyuan model. It’s also utilizing generative technology in game creation and other areas of its business empire, while embedding AI features in long-running titles including .

Games based on such unique intellectual property draw strong player loyalty that boost price resiliency, in marked contrast to the steep discounting being employed by Chinese online food-delivery firms and electric-vehicle makers to attract customers.

Investors are less skeptical on the subsector as a result. Tencent, along with its music unit and game peer NetEase Inc., have the lowest level of short bets relative to their free floats on the Hang Seng Tech Index, according to S&P Global data.

In its report for the September-ended quarter due later Thursday, Tencent is expected to post earnings growth of 5% versus the previous year. That compares with declines of more than 60% estimated for peers like Alibaba and JD.com that are taking bigger hits from competition, tariffs and China’s economic slowdown. Meituan is seen falling to a loss.

[TITLE]Morning Bid: Markets rejoice potential end to US government shutdown:
[TEXT]
A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Rae Wee

Global markets are set to begin the week with an oomph as investors cheer the prospect of an imminent end to a ​historic U.S. government shutdown that has upended everything from air travel to key economic data releases.

In a ‌procedural vote, the U.S. Senate on Sunday advanced a House-passed bill that will be amended to fund the government until January 30 and ‌include a package of three full-year appropriations bills.

If the Senate eventually passes the amended bill, the package still must be approved by the House of Representatives and sent to President Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days.

Nonetheless, the positive stride was enough to send Nasdaq futures up 1.2% and S&P 500 futures up 0.⁠7% in Asia, with European futures ‌also clocking strong gains.

Asia stocks were upbeat, while U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar rose.

The shutdown has taken a growing toll on the U.S. economy, with federal workers ‍from airports to law enforcement and the military going unpaid while the Federal Reserve flies virtually blind with limited government reporting of economic data.

White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in an interview that the U.S. economy could contract in the fourth quarter if the shutdown ​drags on.

Data on Friday also showed U.S. consumer sentiment weakened to the lowest level in nearly 3-1/2 ‌years in early November amid worries

SY Holdings Invited to Attend 2025 Hong Kong FinTech Week, Leveraging AI to Boost the Development

Hong Kong (ANTARA/PRNewswire)- From November 3 to 4, 2025, "Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025" (hereinafter referred to as "Hong Kong FinTech Week") was grandly held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The event is organized by the Hong Kong Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Hong Kong Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, and Invest Hong Kong, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission, and the Insurance Authority. The opening ceremony was attended by several officials, including John KC Lee, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, and Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.This year's event, under the theme "Curating the New Fintech Era," brought together more than 37,000 participants from over 100 economies, over 800 speakers, and more than 700 exhibiting institutions to explore cutting-edge technological trends. As a partner of the Hong Kong FinTech Week, SY Holdings Group Limited ("SY Holdings", stock code: 6069.HK) was once again invited to attend. The Company participated in the "Digital Finance" forum alongside companies such as HSBC, Porrima, and FundPark, engaging in in-depth discussions and sharing insights on the topic of "How AI is Unlocking Lending for SMEs."SY Holdings is a partner of the Hong Kong FinTech WeekHong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive John KC Lee emphasized in his opening speech that Hong Kong's unique positioning as an international financial center has gained widespread international recognition. Currently, Hong Kong is home to over 1,200 financial technology enterprises, representing a 10% increase compared to last year. It is projected that by 2032, the revenue of Hong Kong's financial technology industry will exceed $600 billion. Additionally, John KC Lee stated that Hong Kong will assist Chinese Mainland enterprises in using the city as a springboard to expand their overseas operations. Through collaboration among various government departments of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, pathways will be paved for Chinese Mainland companies to access foreign markets and global capital, which signifies substantial opportunities for all parties involved.During the sharing session of the "Digital Finance" forum, Darrell Lua, Director of International Business at SY Holdings, addressed the topic of "AI and Data Empowering the Development of SMEs." He pointed out that enterprises naturally generate supply chain data—such as order processing, logistics and transportation, payment settlements, and performance evaluations—in their daily operations. Therefore, the key to addressing the financing challenges faced by SMEs lies not in the absence of data, but in the ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to transform this data into credible evidence for the financial sector. By applying AI technology to deeply correlate, cross-verify, and dynamically analyze fragmented data, SY Holdings accurately maps the operational trajectories and transaction profiles of SMEs. This differentiated "transaction-focused, entity-light" model, which prioritizes transactions over corporate entities, effectively overcomes the reliance of traditional financial services on corporate creditworthiness and collateral. Through the deep integration of AI and data, SY Holdings enables finance to "understand" the actual operational needs of SMEs and provides them with more precise and suitable working capital solutions.Regarding the working capital needs of emerging scenarios such as live-streaming e-commerce, Darrell Lua further shared SY Holdings' practical applications of AI. He emphasized that the integration of AI and finance should go beyond mere "speed" and achieve a synergy between "velocity" and "understanding"—specifically, a deep comprehension of industrial ecosystems and data. Rather than simply developing new AI agents and risk control models, SY Holdings empowers AI with the ability to "understand" multidimensional real-world information, covering logistics trajectories, tax and invoice records, and even external variables like weather forecasts. This extends the risk assessment model to "dynamic scenarios," as risks may lurk not only in static reports but also in delayed port shipments, supply chains disrupted by heavy rain, or suddenly adjusted policies. By focusing on "the transaction itself" as the core assessment criterion and leveraging cross-verified data from multiple supply chain nodes for dynamic control, SY Holdings ultimately provides "end-to-end, minute-level" working capital services for live-streaming e-commerce merchants. To date, the company has helped over 21,000 SMEs secure over RMB 300 billion in order acquisition and working capital turnover. The value of integrating AI with finance lies not in replacing humans but in enabling trust to transcend boundaries and continuously amplify.When discussing linkages and collaboration with financial institutions, Darrell Lua emphasized that SY Holdings consistently adheres to a platform-based strategy, committed to building a bridge for the intelligent matching of high-quality assets and diverse funding sources. Currently, the platform has connected with over 190 funding partners. He expressed SY Holdings' expectation to strengthen collaboration with financial institutions in two key areas: First, enhancing the supply of scalable, low-cost inclusive funding by leveraging the SY Cloud Platform's ability to accurately identify genuine corporate financing needs, thereby helping more SMEs efficiently access working capital services. Second, promoting the deep integration of risk control models and ecosystem resources by combining the mature credit assessment systems of financial institutions with SY Holdings' "transaction-focused, entity-light" risk control logic to jointly serve SMEs segments that are traditionally underserved by conventional finance. Additionally, SY Holdings aims to leverage financial institutions' extensive service networks, cross-border business experience, and diverse customer resources to further expand into domestic underserved markets and international markets such as Southeast Asia, extending the platform's technology services to broader domains.It is worth noting that SY Holdings has initiated its global layout this year, increasing R&D investments in innovative technologies such as AI agents to build a new "AI + International Supply Chain Technology Platform." This platform will focus on serving SMEs across global supply chain ecosystems, providing one-stop solutions encompassing supply chain services, financing, FX management, and digital operation empowerment, with the goal of becoming an integral component of the global supply chain.SY Holdings' reappearance at the Hong Kong FinTech Week attracted attention from financial institutions and technology enterprises worldwide. It not only demonstrated the company's comprehensive capabilities in digital finance and technology output but also reflected its strategic determination to use Hong Kong as a bridgehead to connect global innovation resources and expand into international markets. This further advances its mission to "empowering Chinese SMEs to reshape the global supply chain."SY Holdings Group Limited ("SY Holdings" or the "Group", stock code: 6069.HK) is the first "AI+Industrial Supply Chain" digital intelligence technology company listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The major institutional shareholders of SY Holdings include Temasek Holdings of Singapore, Wuxi Communications Group, XtalPi and Be Friends. The Group has been included in the MSCI series indices, Hang Seng Composite Index, FTSE Index, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs. It was recognized in 2023 as one of "CNBC's Top 200 Global Fintech Companies" and in 2024 as a "Forbes China Top 50 Fintech Influential Enterprise," demonstrating international market recognition of its development.While deepening its presence in national pillar industries such as infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, and commodities, SY Holdings is actively expanding into strategic emerging sectors including e-commerce, robotics. SY Holdings adopts the differentiated "transaction-focused, entity-light" model, uses AI Agent to link industrial ecosystem and conduct data analysis, and helps the growth of small and medium enterprises ("SMEs") through Platform technology science. Up to now, SY Holdings has helped over 21,000 SMEs secure over RMB 300 billion in order acquisition and working capital turnover.In August 2025, while intensifying its global expansion, SY Holdings positioned its Singapore international headquarters as the strategic bridgehead and formally launched its global strategy. The Group will build a new "International Supply Chain Technology Platform" powered by AI, which focuses on serving SMEs in the upstream and downstream of the global supply chain and provides one-stop solutions encompassing flexible supply chain services, cross-border working capital, exchange rate management and digital empowerment. The Group is committed to supporting SMEs in efficiently expanding into global markets, while fulfilling its mission of "Empowering Chinese SMEs to reshape the global supply chain" and jointly opening a new era of growth in resonance with global development.Source: SY Holdings

Asia-Pacific markets slid Friday, tracking losses on Wall Street, as technology stocks continued to come under pressure and Fed rate-cut doubts swirled. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.77% to close at 50,376.53, while the Topix slid 0.65% to end the trading day at 3,359.81. Japanese giant SoftBank plunged nearly 9% in early trading, marking its third consecutive day of decline after it said Tuesday it had sold its entire stake in Nvidia . Shares of the conglomerate closed 6.57% lower. South Korea's Kospi fell 3.81% to 4,011.57, and the small-cap Kosdaq was 2.23% lower at 897.9. Index heavyweight Samsung Electronics slipped more than 3%, while SK Hynix , which supplies memory chips to Nvidia, fell 5%. The South Korean strengthened 0.72% to 1,460.0 against the after the finance minister said Friday that the country's FX authorities will consult major market players, including the national pension fund and key exporters, on ways to stabilize the won, Reuters reported.

According to the report, Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol told senior economic officials that steps were needed to tackle the structural mismatch in U.S. dollar supply and demand, amid growing concerns over currency market volatility.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 1.79%, while mainland's CSI 300 dipped 1.57% to 4,628.14 after government data Friday showed China's slowdown worsened in October, dragged by soft consumer demand and a deepening property downturn.

[TITLE]Stocks stutter with focus on Fed, tech after US reopen vote:
[TEXT]
Focus is back on the yen as it continues to weaken against the US dollar - Copyright AFP Richard A. Brooks

Asian markets trod water Thursday as euphoria over the end of a record US government shutdown petered, with focus back on Federal Reserve interest rates and tech bubble worries.

Lawmakers in Washington voted Wednesday night to send Donald Trump legislation to end the 43-day stoppage that shuttered key services and suspended the release of data crucial to gauging the state of the world’s top economy.

However, even with the US president expected to sign the bill, the mood on trading floors was less upbeat than earlier in the week, when a deal was announced.

Investors will now be able to get a long-awaited glimpse of the reports that have been held up by the closure, particularly the Fed as it decides whether or not to meet expectations and cut rates next month.

Even then, the White House said figures on jobs and consumer prices for October were not likely to be released as statistics agencies were unable to collect the necessary data.

“Reopening also doesn’t mean an instant snap-back to normal for the real economy. When you starve a system of staffing and pay for six weeks, the backlog doesn’t vanish just because a bill passed at 8 pm,” wrote Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.

“The shutdown ends with a vote and a signature; the aftershocks show up in queues, call centres and cash-flow stress far away from the Capitol dome.”

Meanwhile, concerns continue to mount that this year’s AI-led market rally may have pushed valuations too high and led to a bubble in the tech sector that could burst at any time.

Some have warned that the hundreds of billions invested in artificial intelligence has been overdone and the return could take time to come through.

Observers suggested that the recent tepid performance in several high-flying firms may be a sign of that, with the Nasdaq dropping for two days.

The S&P 500 has also struggled of late, though the Dow on Wednesday ended at a record amid speculation that traders are shifting from tech into industrials.

The mixed showing on Wall Street was reflected in Asia, where Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Manila and Wellington fell.

Tokyo edged up while Jakarta and Shanghai were flat.

Oil prices extended losses after plunging around four percent Wednesday after OPEC’s monthly crude market report forecast an oversupply in the third quarter.

That came just a month after it had predicted a deficit in the period.

The commodity has come under pressure of late amid easing tensions in the Middle East and increasing output by OPEC and other key producers.

And the International Energy Agency earlier this year estimated a record surplus in 2026.

Attention is also on Tokyo after Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said Wednesday the government was keeping an eye on currency markets as the yen continued to weaken.

She told parliament that “the government is watching for any excessive and disorderly moves with a high sense of urgency”.

Since her remarks, the unit has weakened further to around 155 per dollar, prompting speculation that authorities could step in to provide support.

The currency has come under pressure following dovish comments from Japan’s central bank that tempered best on another interest rate hike and as the US moved towards reopening its government.
