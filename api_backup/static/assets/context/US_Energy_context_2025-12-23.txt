[TITLE]Guyana Is Using Its Oil Revenues to Spark a Renewable Energy Boom:
[TEXT]
Since the discovery of vast oil reserves in Guyana around a decade ago, the South American country’s oil industry has grown significantly following investment from several international oil majors and the beginning of offshore production. As Guyana begins to see the revenue from its black gold, the government is reinvesting some of the money in renewables to diversify the energy mix and strengthen the country’s energy security. Guyana’s government aims to achieve 80 percent renewable energy in the electricity grid by 2040.

In February, the United Nations (UN) in Guyana announced the launch of the Just Energy Transition (JET) Seed Funding Initiative with financing from the Joint Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Fund. The initiative will provide funding to help Guyana undergo a green transition by implementing its Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) 2030. Investments will be made in expanding Guyana’s renewable energy capacity and promoting sustainable mobility. The UN will also provide technical and policy support.

The initiative will support the development of three solar-powered EV charging stations in strategic locations and the delivery of a technical training programme to develop a Guyanese workforce in the renewable energy sector. The UN aims to use the initiative to empower youth, women, and marginalized groups and ensure equitable access to opportunities.

The UN Development Programme’s Officer-in-Charge, Nadira Balram, stated, “The anticipated impact of this initiative is far-reaching. This initiative will create jobs and new economic opportunities. By equipping a new generation of technicians with specialised skills, we are fostering a workforce that is prepared for the transition to a green economy.”

At the national level, the President of Guyana, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, said in a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine that Guyana is using its newfound oil revenues to drive a green transition.

“Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatonnes of carbon,” said Irfaan Ali. “We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, and wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.”

One of the renewable energy industries that Guyana is looking to advance is solar power. Several companies have shown interest in the country’s solar potential, with multiple new solar projects expected to launch in the coming years. The government has gradually been expanding its solar energy capacity, with around 4.8 MW of solar power having been installed under the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Home Energy Systems. The off-grid solar power project launched in 2023 and aims to expand clean electricity access in the hinterland and riverine communities of the country that do not have access to the national grid. The government aims to supply and deliver 30,000 solar PV home energy units as part of the scheme.

In August, the Guyana Energy Agency commissioned a 0.6 MW grid-forming solar farm on the island of Leguan, at a cost of $1.4 million. The project will include a 1.2 MWh battery energy storage system. This follows the installation of a similar solar power system on Wakenaam Island in 2023 and is aimed at providing rural populations with greater energy security.

In November, the Indian green energy firm Oriana Power Limited announced it had been approved by the Guyana Energy Agency to develop a solar energy project in Guyana consisting of the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of a 3 MW grid-tied solar PV system at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport. The contract is valued at almost $2.5 million, and it is expected to be completed within three years.

In July, the government commissioned a 1.5 MW hydropower project, the Kumu plant, in Lethem. This follows the development of the 0.7 MW Moco Moco Hydropower Plant. While Guyana’s hydropower projects are relatively small-scale, the gradual development of the industry demonstrates the government’s commitment to diversifying Guyana’s energy mix.

Prime Minister Mark Phillips stated, “From 2020 to now, we’ve delivered 14.5 megawatts of renewable energy through solar and hydro projects. Today’s commissioning of the 1.5 MW Kumu Hydropower Station builds on that foundation, expanding our renewable energy portfolio while improving quality of life for residents in Region Nine.”

Guyana has transformed from a little-known South American country that was highly dependent on fossil fuel imports less than a decade ago to a growing global oil power. The exploitation of its oil resources is allowing the government to increase spending on green energy to diversify the country’s energy mix from the outset, a feat that has not been possible in most oil-rich countries. Meanwhile, additional technical and funding support from the UN is expected to help Guyana diversify its energy mix and enhance its energy security in the coming years.

[TITLE]U.S. Snatches Venezuela Oil Tanker in Dark‑Hour Strike on Narco‑Terror Funding:
[TEXT]
In a stealth operation carried out before dawn on Dec. 20, the U.S. Coast Guard—working alongside the Department of War—seized an oil tanker last seen in the terrorist state of Venezuela. The United States accused the ship’s operators of moving sanctioned crude to fuel narco‑terror activity. Officials issued a stark warning to traffickers: “We will find you, and we will stop you.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem released a video on social media showing a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter landing on the deck of an oil tanker in international waters off the coast of Venezuela. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump declared the government of Venezuela to be a Foreign Terrorist Organization and ordered the complete naval blockade of the country.

“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” Noem posted on X. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”

DHS called the seizure a “lightning strike operation to seize the Motor Tanker Centuries. Officials stated the ship was carrying oil subject to U.S. sanctions.

U.S. and Venezuelan officials report that the seizure of the Panamanian-flagged “Centuries” tanker took place in international waters near the coast of Venezuela. The ship was reportedly bound for Asia, possibly China, reports indicate.

NBC News reported on the Venezuelan reaction, writing:

Venezuela’s minister of the interior, Diosdado Cabello, condemned the operation in a Saturday post on Instagram. “The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela denounces and rejects the theft and hijacking of a new private vessel transporting Venezuelan oil, as well as the forced disappearance of its crew, committed by military personnel of the United States of America in international waters,” Cabello said.

In a post on social media, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth added to the U.S. actions, writing, “President Trump has been clear: the blockade of sanctioned oil tankers departing from, or bound for, Venezuela will remain in full force until Maduro’s criminal enterprise returns every stolen American asset.”

Earlier this month, Breitbart’s John Hayward reported that the Trump administration ordered the seizure of another tanker carrying sanctioned Venezuelan oil. This vessel was reportedly headed to Cuba.

In a speech where he did not directly respond to the tanker’s seizure, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said, in a speech, that the Venezuelan military is “prepared to break the teeth of teh North American empire, if necessary.”

[TITLE]Deal to Export Oil from Kurdish Region to Continue with No Issues, Kurdish Rudaw Reports:

Oil Prices Rise as US Ramps up Action against Venezuela Tankers

Oil prices rose on Monday after the US intercepted ​an oil tanker in international waters off the coast of Venezuela and tensions in Russia's war against Ukraine remained high, with both developments raising fears of supply disruption.

Brent crude futures gained $1.31, or 2.17%, to $61.78 a barrel by 1316 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude rose by $1.25, or 2.2%, to $57.77.

Market participants now see a risk of disruption to Venezuelan oil exports because of the US ‌embargo, having previously ‌been complacent in that regard, said ‌UBS ⁠analyst Giovanni ​Staunovo.

Venezuelan crude ‌accounts for about 1% of global supply.

Growing supply from the US and the OPEC+ producer group have largely offset worries over supply disruption elsewhere to keep Brent futures around $65 a barrel in the second half of 2025, though prices have eased in the past month because of oversupply concerns.

Oil prices have been supported by developments off Venezuela while ⁠Russia-Ukraine tensions simmer in the background in an otherwise very bearish market, said June ‌Goh, analyst at Sparta Commodities.

The US Coast ‍Guard is pursuing an oil ‍tanker in international waters near Venezuela in what would be the ‍second such operation over the weekend and the third in less than two weeks if successful, officials told Reuters on Sunday.

A rebound in oil prices has been sparked by US President Donald Trump's announcement of a "total ​and complete" blockade of sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers and subsequent developments there, followed by reports of a Ukrainian drone strike ⁠on a Russian shadow fleet vessel in the Mediterranean, said IG analyst Tony Sycamore.

The Brent and WTI benchmarks fell by about 1% last week.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday that talks between US, European and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the past three days in an effort to end Russia's war in Ukraine had focused on aligning positions. Those meetings and separate talks with Russian negotiators had been productive, he said.

However, the top foreign policy aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin said that changes made by the Europeans ‌and Ukraine to US proposals had not improved prospects for peace.

[TITLE]DNO Agrees Oil Offtakes with ExxonMobil, Shell in Fund Raise:
[TEXT]
DNO signed offtake agreements with ExxonMobil and Shell for the entirety of its North Sea oil production and secured up to $410 million in 'related offtake financing facilities'.

DNO ASA said Thursday it had signed offtake agreements with Exxon Mobil Corp and Shell PLC for the entirety of its North Sea oil production and secured up to $410 million in "related offtake financing facilities".

"The agreement with ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, covering around half of DNO's North Sea oil output, has a tenor of two years and a related revolving credit facility of up to $185 million", the Norwegian oil and gas explorer and producer said in an online statement.

"The agreement with Shell Trading and Shipping Co Ltd, covering the other half of the output, has an initial tenor of one year and a related prepayment facility with a European bank of up to $225 million".

DNO executive chair Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani said, "The offtake agreements with ExxonMobil and Shell unlock considerable financing at very attractive rates, creating opportunities for continued growth in nervous markets".

DNO said it has now "put into place financing facilities of up to $910 million tied to its North Sea oil and gas production".

It earlier secured up to $500 million in financing from a United States bank related to an offtake agreement with French power and gas utility ENGIE SA for 100 percent of its Norwegian production.

"These three-way transactions are made possible because buyers are eager to lock in secure supplies of Norwegian oil and gas and U.S. banks, in particular, have significantly stepped up fossil fuel lending", Mossavar-Rahmani said in a statement July 2.

DNO said of the ENGIE-tied financing, "Proceeds from the offtake financing facility will be used to replace Sval Energi’s similar existing facilities as well as for general corporate purposes".

In the second quarter, DNO completed its $450 million acquisition of Sval Energi Group AS from HitecVision.

"The acquired portfolio comprises 16 producing fields in Norway, quadrupling DNO's North Sea production to 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day", DNO said June 12. "The company's North Sea proven and probable reserves swell to 189 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), also a fourfold increase. Contingent resources total 316 MMboe.

"Following the acquisition, Norway and the United Kingdom represent nearly 60 percent of the company’s global production and about 45 percent of its global reserves, with the balance predominantly in the Kurdistan region of Iraq".

DNO added, "Supported by ongoing field development projects with multiple discoveries currently being matured for project sanction, DNO is well placed to grow North Sea production organically in the years ahead. The combined North Sea 2P reserves and 2C resources equal 15 years of production at the current run rate".

[TITLE]Crude oil prices fall on Russia-Ukraine peace hopes, Venezuela supply cues:
[TEXT]
Crude oil futures traded lower on Friday morning following reports that raised hopes of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

At 9.59 am on Friday, February Brent oil futures were at $59.71, down by 0.18 per cent, and February crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $55.89, down by 0.20 per cent. January crude oil futures were trading at ₹5074 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Friday against the previous close of ₹5114, down by 0.78 per cent, and February futures were trading at ₹5098 against the previous close of ₹5134, down by 0.70 per cent.

Quoting US President Donald Trump, a Reuters report said he believes talks toward ending the war in Ukraine are ‘getting close to something’.

Citing a White House official, the report said the US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are set to meet a Russian delegation in Miami this weekend. Referring to the recent Russian gains on the battlefield, Trump said, “I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there.”

A peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will ease concerns over global crude oil supply disruptions. Russia is one of the world’s major crude oil producers.

Meanwhile, reports said that Venezuela has authorised two unsanctioned very large crude carriers to set sail for China.

Trump had recently announced that the US would impose a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country. This had put at risk around 600,000 barrels of oil per day in exports. China is the major buyer of this crude.

January natural gas futures were trading at ₹329.20 on MCX during the first hour of trading on Friday, down 1.99 per cent from the previous close of ₹335.90.

On the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), January guargum contracts traded at ₹9910 in the first hour of trading on Friday, up 0.22 per cent from the previous close of ₹9888.

January jeera futures were trading at ₹21035 on NCDEX in the initial hour of trading on Friday, down 0.47 per cent from the previous close of ₹21135.

Niskanen Center Analyst Examines American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP)’s Place In The US Transmission Grid

On December 5, 2025, American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)’s place in the US transmission grid was thoroughly examined by Rachel Levine, a Senior Transmission Policy Analyst for the Climate and Energy team at the Niskanen Center. The analyst claims that the U.S. grid is dominated by alternating current, with transmission voltages that range from 100 kV to 765 kV. While the grid has over 500,000 miles of HVAC lines, only roughly 10,000 miles run at 765 kV, accounting for less than 1% of total transmission mileage. The company has the largest network of 765 kV transmission lines in the United States, covering more miles than all of the other utilities combined.

According to analyst Rachel Levine, American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) assets are already present in the service territories of all four regional grid operators in the United States that are seeking 765 kV expansion. More than 400 miles of new 765 kV lines have been approved by PJM Interconnection. ERCOT decided against extending its 345 kV network in favor of a new 765 kV development. The Southwest Power Pool declared a 765 kV overlay throughout the Plains, whereas MISO selected 765 kV lines for its Tranche 2 expansion after considering several options.

Separately, on December 12, 2025, TheFly reported that JPMorgan had raised the price target for American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP). Jeremy Tonet, a JPMorgan analyst, boosted the company’s price objective from $121 to $125 and kept the shares’ Neutral rating. The modification is a result of new valuation models used by JPMorgan’s utilities coverage group in North America.

American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) is one of the major regulated utilities in the United States. It provides electricity generation, transmission, and distribution to over 5 million customers across 11 states.

While we acknowledge the potential of AEP as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

According to TheFly, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) submitted requests for updated rates at its two utilities in the state, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, to the North Carolina Utilities Commission on November 21.

In the submission, Duke Energy Carolinas requests a $1 billion yearly revenue boost, which would include $727 million in 2027 and $275 million in 2028.

Subject to regulatory approval, the demands depend on a 53% equity capital structure and a proposed 10.95% return on equity.

The expected advantages associated with nuclear production tax credits are also stated in the filing. Through 2032, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK)’s nuclear plants are anticipated to produce tax credits worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Customers of Duke Energy Carolinas receive $150 million in nuclear production tax credits in 2025–2026 at current rates. The fresh proposal would extend nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Progress customers while also introducing solar and hydro tax incentives for both utilities. Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) also stated that a proposed merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress will save customers over $1 billion in future expenses.

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is one of the largest utilities in the United States, having regulated utilities in the Carolinas, Indiana, Florida, Ohio, and Kentucky.
