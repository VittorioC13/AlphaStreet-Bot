[TITLE]The energy chessboard of Europe moves to Athens: Today the Summit with American and European ministers – The deals for LNG:
[TEXT]
Marianna Tzanne November 6 08:54

The 6th Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Summit (P-TEC), being held today November 6 and tomorrow November 7 in Athens, is evolving into a pivotal milestone for shaping the new energy landscape of the country and for the further upgrade of Greece’s geopolitical position in Southeastern Europe.

The event, which draws the interest of top American officials and representatives of energy giants, constitutes a strong message for the deepening US–Europe cooperation in the field of energy, but also a critical step for new strategic deals that will redefine the map of natural gas flows and investments in the region.

Since yesterday in our country, and meeting with the Prime Minister at the Maximos Mansion, are US Interior Secretary and “Energy Czar” Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Undersecretary of State for Management and Resources Michael Rigas, and Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment Jacob Helberg.

Their presence in the Greek capital, along with senior executives from Cheniere Energy, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Venture Global LNG, and also technology giants such as Amazon and Google, underscores Greece’s new geostrategic role in Europe’s energy architecture.

The deals

Transatlantic cooperation in natural gas supply opened yesterday with DEPA Commercial and Aktor announcing the establishment of a joint venture for the supply and export of American LNG. The new company is named ATLANTIC SEE LNG, with a shareholding structure of 60% DEPA Commercial and 40% AKTOR. According to sources, the new entity will have a purely export-oriented character, with exclusive activity the transport of liquefied natural gas to Southeastern Europe.

The same sources note that the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the US state development bank, is expected to play a role in the joint venture. It remains to be seen from the announcements whether its role in the energy scheme will be financial or also equity. In any case, the involvement of the DFC, which also participates in other infrastructures in the country, is perceived as a clear message of American confidence and strategic investment in the Greek energy corridor.

ExxonMobil’s research in Crete also appears to be entering a new phase, with information indicating that the American giant is heading to a decision for an exploratory drilling.

The Vertical Corridor

The new cooperation between DEPA Commercial and Aktor at the heart of the Vertical Corridor will allow the flow of American LNG from Greece to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Ukraine.

According to information, Aktor will contribute to the agreement long-term LNG supply contracts of up to 2 bcm annually or even more, which will be channeled to Ukrainian companies, including the state energy company and the private DTEK group. The natural gas will come from American Venture Global LNG, based on a 20-year contract that is in the final stage of negotiation.

The project is part of the full utilization of the Alexandroupolis FSRU and the creation of new regasification terminals, such as the second Gastrade FSRU in Thrace – which has already received a positive opinion for the Environmental Impact Study.

As Gastrade executives recently said, the final investment decision for the project is expected within 2026, so that the new FSRU unit will be operational in 2028.

Given the planned capacity of 6 bcm of natural gas, the total investment cost is estimated between 550 and 600 million euros. For comparison, the existing Alexandroupolis FSRU, with a capacity of 5.5 bcm, cost about 500 million euros.

Gastrade, whose shareholders – Elmina Kopelouzos, DEPA, DESFA, Gaslog and Bulgartransgaz – jointly support the project, aims at the timely signing of station usage contracts. In this way, it seeks to secure the commercial viability of the project without having to proceed to a market test process. It should be noted that in 2024 natural gas consumption in the countries of the Vertical Corridor was 51 bcm and the forecast for 2030 is 68 bcm. This means that there will be a 17 bcm gap while additionally the approximately 15-16 bcm coming from Russia will be missing from the system.

The DFC and the “locking in” of European agreements

The conclusion of long-term contracts with European companies is estimated to be the “key” for activating financing from the US development organization DFC.

Such a development would open the way for the implementation of upgrade projects for the Vertical Corridor, through which American LNG will be able to be channeled from Greece to Hungary and Slovakia.

Thus, the Vertical Corridor will emerge as a main energy artery of Europe, simultaneously consolidating the role of Greece as a strategic fuel entry gate to the continent.

Acceleration factors

The conference takes place at a critical juncture, as European suppliers are preparing for the period after the end of 2027, when the supply of Europe with Russian natural gas will be fully discontinued.

At the same time, the clock is ticking for the implementation of the EU–US agreement, which provides for energy imports worth 750 billion dollars within three years, redefining the energy balance of the continent.

[TITLE]Alaska’s Mega-Pipeline Gets a Second Chance in the Trump Energy Era:
[TEXT]
Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR) has taken a decisive role in reviving one of America’s most ambitious energy projects. The Houston-based oilfield services firm has signed definitive agreements with Glenfarne Alaska LNG LLC, a subsidiary of Glenfarne Energy Transition, to supply power generation equipment and main refrigerant compressors for the long-delayed Alaska LNG Project. The partnership positions Baker Hughes as both technology provider and investor in the $44 billion development, one of the largest single energy infrastructure undertakings in the United States. Reuters confirmed the signing of definitive agreements and noted that the project has entered advanced engineering and design phases.

For Alaska, the agreement revives a decades-old plan to monetize the state’s vast North Slope gas reserves, long stranded by distance and cost. The design involves two sequential phases: an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline from the Prudhoe Bay and Point Thomson fields to the Kenai Peninsula, followed by a liquefaction terminal capable of producing up to 20 million tonnes per year of LNG,

[TITLE]China Opens State Energy Projects to Private Investment:
[TEXT]
China is encouraging private investment in state-led major energy and infrastructure projects and could allow private investors to have more than 10% in certain projects, the government said in a landmark directive aimed at boosting investment and reinvigorating the economy.

The projects open to minority private shareholding will need state approval and can be in railways infrastructure, nuclear power, hydropower, inter-provincial and inter-regional transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, LNG import and storage facilities, and water supply projects, the cabinet said.

The authorities will conduct feasibility studies to assess the revenue potential and returns on investment for the projects.

Private capital participation is encouraged and supported, China says. The project's status will determine the specific stakes in each project, the willingness of private enterprises to participate, and relevant policy requirements.

For eligible projects, private capital shareholding may be 10% or higher, the cabinet said in the first explicit reference that it is open to raise the private capital ceiling above 10%.

“We will further strengthen policy support for attracting private capital into the energy sector,” Xu Xin, deputy head of the legal affairs department at the National Energy Administration, said at a media briefing, as carried by Reuters.

Guan Peng, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission, told a briefing on Tuesday that “The policy puts forward clear requirements on encouraging and supporting the participation of private capital in key areas and projects.”

“It sends a signal of promoting the development of private investment,” Peng said, as carried by Bloomberg.

Earlier this year, during the peak of the trade war with the United States in the spring, China adopted its first fundamental law, specifically focused on promoting the private economy. This is “a significant step in revitalizing a sector that is key to growth and greatly boosting entrepreneurs’ confidence and expectations,” China’s Ministry of Justice said in May.

[TITLE]Proposed rules for RE generators questionable:
[TEXT]
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has proposed a draft with significant changes to the Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM), which governs penalties when renewable generators deviate from their scheduled output. The reforms are aimed at strengthening grid stability or grid balancing, which is important looking at India’s main target to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based installed electricity capacity by 2030, a goal set at COP-26.

But, the proposed draft, on which CERC has sought industry feedback, is already creating concerns among the key players both in solar and wind energy categories. They argue that it could raise costs and risks for renewable energy developers, particularly wind projects. The Commission has invited stakeholder comments and industry bodies like Wind Independent Power Producers Association (WIPPA) have already appealed against the proposals.

So, what is grid balancing and why it is important? The textbook definition of grid balancing is the process of keeping electricity supply and demand equal at all times to maintain a stable power grid. The power plants do this by adjusting their output, while consumers adjust their usage to prevent blackouts or overloads. This has become increasingly important with the rise of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar. For balancing, services grid operators use mechanisms like battery energy storage, to quickly react to any imbalances and maintain a consistent grid frequency.

Key changes

What are these key changes that CERC proposes to bring into effective April 1, 2026? Under the current system deviations are measured against available capacity. Under the proposed system, a hybrid formula has been worked out based on both scheduled generation (expected supply to discoms) and available capacity, with more emphasis on the former with the passage of time. Deviation from scheduled generation is a factor in grid instability, as it disrupts discoms’ planning. This change will make deviation charges stricter and costlier for wind and solar projects.

It proposes tighter tolerance bands which would mean projects will be penalised for smaller deviations, raising compliance and forecasting pressures.

According to Aditya Pyassi, CEO of the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturer Association (IWTMA), “ The CERC endeavours of fostering greater grid discipline are welcome. However, we need to see and acknowledge the fact that India is on a historic path targeting the integration of 500 GW of renewable by 2030 and to maintain RE project viability, and it is very important to go

[TITLE]Turbo Energy to pilot tokenized financing for renewable energy projects on Stellar:
[TEXT]
Turbo Energy (Nasdaq: TURB) is launching a pilot project to tokenize financing for hybrid renewable energy systems, starting with an on-site solar and battery installation at a supermarket in Spain. The initiative aims to demonstrate how blockchain-based debt instruments can fund distributed energy projects.

The project is being developed in collaboration with digital asset infrastructure firm Taurus and the Stellar Development Foundation. According to an announcement, the pilot will test how tokenized financing can support liquidity and improve capital access to renewable energy funding.

Energy-as-a-Service is a model that allows customers to pay for energy use or performance without owning any equipment. It allows businesses to access clean energy through subscription-style contracts while providers handle installation, maintenance and operation.

The pilot will tokenize debt financing for on-site Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) using Turbo Energy’s SUNBOX solar storage systems. The model aims to create a scalable framework for financing commercial and industrial solar projects worldwide.

Taurus will issue and manage Turbo Energy’s renewable-energy tokens using the Stellar blockchain, which will enable fractional, onchain financing, allowing more investors to participate in funding clean-energy projects.

According to data from Grand View Research cited by Turbo Energy, the global EaaS sector was valued at $74.43 billion in 2024 and is expected to more than double to $145.18 billion by 2030.

Clean energy in blockchain

In Bitcoin’s early years, critics often claimed that its heavy energy use made it harmful to the environment. While it is true that Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains consume significant amounts of electricity to secure their networks, innovation within the crypto ecosystem is also driving eco-friendly solutions.

In January, Italian renewable energy company Enel Group teamed up with crypto wallet company Conio to let investors buy tokenized shares of solar panels on the Algorand blockchain. The offering allowed Italian investors to purchase fractional ownership in Enel’s solar farms and apply the generated energy to offset power consumption in their homes.

In October, Thopen, a Brazilian solar power company, announced it was considering a pivot into Bitcoin mining to “absorb local generated energy” from the country’s renewable sector.

In August, the UK-based publicly traded company Union Jack Oil, announced plans to use natural gas from undeveloped wells to generate electricity for Bitcoin mining.

[TITLE]Data Centers Devour Electricity. Private Equity Is Buying Utilities to Cash In.:
[TEXT]
The seizure of public utilities for the sake of profit may lead to a disaster for consumers — and the planet.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today!

Ratepayers across the U.S. are facing rising electric bills — a trend that could be turbocharged by Wall Street’s growing effort to capture the electric utilities we all depend on.

A critical turning point in this development occurred in October when Minnesota state regulators greenlit the acquisition of Allete by asset management behemoth BlackRock — set to become Allete’s majority stakeholder — and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Allete owns Minnesota Power, the main electric utility in northern Minnesota. The approval came against significant community opposition and, as Truthout previously reported, an administrative law judge’s report that strongly recommended against the deal.

With the acquisition, BlackRock will turn Allete from a publicly traded company into a private one. Moreover, BlackRock is now gunning for utility giant AES, which has utilities in Ohio and Indiana along with other extensive U.S. and international operations, while another private equity titan, Blackstone, is seeking approval to acquire TXNM Energy, with hundreds of thousands of customers in New Mexico and Texas. Private equity’s escalating run on utilities is largely driven by the boom in data centers — massive consumers of electricity — and the guaranteed rates of return that utilities offer.

Critics of the buyouts say this is a deeply alarming trend, as firms like BlackRock and Blackstone will likely impose a private equity model — opaque, extractive, laser-focused on profit — over basic services. Even well-intentioned state regulators, opponents contend, will be no match for these massively-resourced companies as they look to bulldoze through any obstacles toward enriching their wealthy investors.

Alissa Jean Schafer, climate director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said the Allete deal’s approval was “precedent-setting” for private equity’s growing incursion into utilities.

“The approval of this deal sends a signal that our critical infrastructure is now up for sale to the highest bidder,” said Schafer.

Victory for BlackRock

When BlackRock’s infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), announced a $6.2 billion deal in May 2024 to acquire Allete and take the company private, many local organizers, community members, and ratepayers in Northern Minnesota staunchly opposed the deal, which needed approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC).

Their fears that a private equity takeover of their electric utility could weaken transparency and raise rates seemed vindicated in July when, after months of comments from all sides, an administrative law judge unequivocally recommended the Minnesota PUC reject the deal. The report stated in stark terms that BlackRock would “do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

“That’s when the influence wielding and the political machinations really ramped up,” Maggie Schuppert, an organizer with CURE, a rural community advocacy group intervening against the acquisition, told Truthout.

Minnesota’s Department of Commerce, an important and influential party that participated in the review process of the acquisition, soon reversed its initial opposition to the deal after some concessions from Allete. Records obtained by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project indicate that Pete Wyckoff, the commerce department’s deputy commissioner of energy resources, had cozy communications with Allete as a deal was being worked out.

Reporting from The Lever showed that a former Minnesota PUC commissioner now working on behalf of BlackRock appears to have coordinated with building trades unions to back the deal, which a representative of the union denied, despite evidence showing the former commissioner’s digital footprint on filings from the union in favor of the takeover. Meanwhile, some “clean energy” groups came out in favor of the acquisition after developing relationships with private stakeholders and BlackRock attorneys. In one instance, a “clean energy” nonprofit held a benefit with Allete as a “VIP sponsor.”

At the PUC’s first meeting on the acquisition, Schuppert said it became clear that commissioners were intent on approving the deal, even as PUC staff warned

[TITLE]New U.S. nuclear power boom begins with old, still-unsolved problem: What to do with radioactive waste:

Nuclear power is back, largely due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, including big tech's hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers across the country and the reshoring of manufacturing. But it returns with an old and still-unsolved problem: storing all of the radioactive waste created as a byproduct of nuclear power generation. In May, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at quadrupling the current nuclear output over the next 25 years by accelerating construction of both large conventional reactors and next-gen small modular reactors. Last week, the U.S. signed a deal with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country that could result in Westinghouse attempting to spinoff and IPO a stand-alone nuclear power company with the federal government as a shareholder. There's a growing consensus among governments, businesses and the public that the time is right for a nuclear power renaissance, and even if the ambitious build-out could take a decade or more and cost hundreds of billion of dollars, it will be an eventual boon to legacy and start-up nuclear energy companies, the AI-fixated wing of the tech industry and investors banking on their success. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Only two nuclear power plants have been built since 1990 — more than $15 billion over budget and years behind schedule — and they went online in just the last two years.
