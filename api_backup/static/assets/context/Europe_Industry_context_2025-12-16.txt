[TITLE]Trump wants the U.S. shipbuilding industry to be great again. Here's what it will take, and what's at stake:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump has vowed to lead a revival in U.S. shipbuilding, but the success of this manufacturing renaissance in a key sector for national security will rely on the expertise from overseas. The administration's goal of a shipbuilding boom is a part of Trump's "Make America Great" policy agenda. Trump signed an executive order in April to bolster the shipbuilding industry, but many industry executives have warned it won't be easy given the current state of the domestic industry, and foreign investment and collaboration are key. The Trump administration's "Make American Shipyards Great Again" initiative is looking to build out liquified natural gas tankers, polar ice-breakers, and Navy vessels. "The American shipbuilding industry saw a boom twice in the past 110 years," Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Xeneta, tells CNBC. "The first boom was during World War I, the second, World War II," he said. China, which has roughly 232 times the shipbuilding capacity of the U.S., dominates the global commercial shipbuilding industry. The U.S. presently has eight active shipyards. China has over 300. The Trump administration's shipbuilding plan is an extension of an investigation into Chinese shipbuilding by the United States Trade Representative under the Biden and Trump administrations. The USTR 301 investigation found the Chinese government has bolstered its shipbuilding dominance through the use of significant subsidies and designating the industry as strategic. The investigation said the acts, policies, and practices were "unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce." The U.S. recently began to charge fees on ships built in China visiting U.S. ports, which led to retaliatory measures from China, but the two nations agreed to a one-year pause as part of a November trade truce. In 2008, China surpassed Japan in shipbuilding output. In 2010, China overtook South Korea to become the world's largest shipbuilder, both in production capacity and new orders. Since then, China's lead has continued to grow. Its global market share in shipbuilding stands at 53%, followed by South Korea and Japan. The 2025 order book for new vessels shows China accounts for 75 percent of orders, with South Korea at 19 percent, and the U.S. at 0.2 percent, according to data shared by Sand. "When you look at the orders, making American shipbuilding great again is a tall order. Foreign expertise needs to be brought in," Sand said.

Key foreign companies involved in U.S. shipbuilding To bolster the country's shipbuilding and training of U.S. workers, the Trump administration has inked deals with foreign shipbuilders. Three shipbuilding affiliates of South-Korean based Hanwha Group, the third-largest shipbuilder in the world, are playing a key part in this plan. During July trade negotiations, South Korea and the United States announced a $350 billion investment deal, with $150 billion of that money to be allocated to maritime investment. The overall trade deal was finalized in November, with auto tariffs on U.S. imports from Korea reduced to 15 percent (from 25 percent). "Why should you reinvent the wheel? There is a good reason for friends and allies to work together and capitalize on a company's expertise and experience," Sand said. South Korea began to increase its presence in the U.S. maritime industry in 2024, with the $100 million acquisition of Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia from Norwegian industrial investment group Aker ASA. The yard was then renamed Hanwha Philly Shipyard.

Vessel construction at Hanwha Philly Shipyard Shawn Baldwin

In August, Hanwha Group announced a $5 billion infrastructure plan, part of the $150 billion investment, for Hanwha Philly Shipyard to bring the site up to speed so it can expand its vessel-making capacity from 1-1.5 vessels a year, eventually to 20 vessels. Hanwha Philly Shipyard received its first order for a U.S.-built, export-ready LNG carrier from Hanwha Group's shipping arm, Hanwha Shipping, in July. It was the first order in nearly 50 years. A second order for an LNG vessel was made in August. Deliveries are expected around 2028 and are being made possible through a joint-build model with Hanwha Ocean's Geoje Shipyard in South Korea. The joint-build model is a necessity due to the the lack of vessel-building capacity at the shipyard in Philadelphia and staffing. Hanwha Ocean makes 50-60 vessels a year.

"One of the challenges the industry faces is the workforce," said David Kim, CEO of Hanwha Philly Shipyard. The biggest bottleneck in training that workforce, says Kim, is the lack of U.S. instructors. To remedy this, Hanwha will train employees by rotating the U.S. workforce from Philadelphia to the yard in South Korea. "It's our greatest advantage," said Kim. "The people who are good and you want to train U.S. workers are the people working in the yard," he added. The company is also looking to expand its apprenticeship program. "We have 1,700 workers to date," Kim said. "If you look at our aspirations to deliver those 20 ships a year, our staff down the road is going to be closer to 10,000 plus," he added. Oil, LNG, and creating demand for U.S. freight vessels The LNG vessel orders are not the only Hanwha company-generated orders on the books for the Philly shipyard. Hanwha Shipping has also ordered 10 medium-range tankers used for oil and chemical transport, the largest U.S. commercial vessel order in more than two decades. The first ship is expected to launch in 2029. "There are currently 55 Jones Act oil tankers in the world, and 7,500 oil tankers in the world," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. The Jones Act requires vessels that transport goods between U.S. ports to be U.S.-built, owned, crewed, and flagged. "In LNG, the U.S. shipbuilding industry for all intents and purposes is not participating," Lipow said. There are roughly 750 LNG tankers in the world, and there's only one LNG tanker that is flagged in the United States, "and it was built in France," he said. But the lack of U.S.-built tankers has not impacted the growth of U.S. LNG exports or crude. "The United States LNG market is not at a disadvantage. We're currently exporting nearly 30% of our crude oil production and not having any trouble finding tankers," Lipow said. Nuclear maritime ambitions During Trump's recent Asia tour, the president announced Hanwha would make its first nuclear-powered sub at the Philly Shipyard. Hanwha makes large naval submarines in South Korea. "The U.S. needs its own ability to make ships and submarines for its own security and resiliency," said Alex Wong, global chief strategy officer for Hanwha Group. "God forbid, in times of war, you need the ability to regenerate and make a naval vessel," Wong said. "That's the way you not only win a war, but you deter a war." In August, Trump ordered the movement of two nuclear submarines in response to threats from Russia. The timing of the submarine being built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard is dependent on the ongoing discussions between the South Korean and U.S. government. "Also important to the time is the availability of technology and the resources," Kim said. The U.S. Navy continues to build out its technological infrastructure. The Navy and Palantir Technologies recently announced "ShipOS," software that they said will help build and maintain American submarines. The software down the road might also be used for aircraft carriers and jets. Italian shipbuilder with Wisconsin ties also playing a role In addition to South Korea, Finnish and Italian companies are also being tapped to expand U.S. shipbuilding. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni reconfirmed in a joint statement with Trump the country's commitment to U.S. shipbuilding in an April meeting. The key Italian company in this initiative is Fincantieri Marinette Marine (FMM), which was founded in Wisconsin in 1942 as Marinette Marine to build naval vessels for World War II before later being acquired by the Italian company. President Trump toured the company's Wisconsin shipyard during his first term. The company recently laid off 93 employees,

[TITLE]EU Lawmakers to Weigh Easing Capital Rules on Safest Bank Bonds:

[TITLE]ECB to simplify bank capital rules but stick to buffer requirements:

The European Central Bank (ECB) outlined plans to simplify bank regulation and capital rules on Thursday, but is sticking to its pledge not to ease overall capital reserve requirements.

The authority said the capital proposals are focused on having fewer – rather than lower – types of capital buffers lenders must hold to protect their balance sheets against shock losses.

Irish woman Sharon Donnery, a member of the ECB banking supervisory board, was a key member of the taskforce set up earlier this year to ease the burden of banking supervision following more than a decade of tighter rules in the wake of the global financial crisis, which resulted in taxpayer-funded bailouts of European banks.

In a statement, the ECB said its aim was to “simplify the framework” without endangering the “resilience of the European banking system”.

The ECB’s top decision-making body, its governing council, backed the recommendations. They will now be sent to the European Commission for consideration as part of a wider push by Brussels to streamline policies and laws to make the European Union more competitive.*

The taskforce concluded that the bloc’s current capital rules are overly complex and risk backfiring as investors may not understand them. European banks are at present subject to a number of individual capital buffers, four of which the ECB wants to merge into two.

“The variety of capital elements in place in the EU may decrease transparency and increase uncertainty as market participants face more challenges in assessing the capital framework,” the report said.

It suggested combining several individual capital surcharges that the ECB at present applies to banks based on their individual risk profile.

The report did not explicitly state whether the combined amount of capital that banks would be required to hold would stay the same, but it said lenders should “sustain current levels of resilience” to absorb losses in a crisis.

The ECB also proposed exempting more small lenders from the international Basel standards, which are designed for large, risky lenders with cross-border business.

At present, all banks with more than €5 billion in assets need to meet those rules, which the taskforce said created “undue complexity” and costs for lenders that were too small to have repercussions on financial stability.

The ECB suggested raising the threshold and adding more exemptions for smaller banks.

Still, the three domestic Irish lenders, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB will remain subject to standards set for larger banks.

The European Banking Federation welcomed the ECB’s report but said “concrete ‌and determined steps must now follow to enhance the global competitiveness of the EU’s financial sector”. – Additional reporting: Reuters, Financial Times

The Woodlands, Texas--(ANTARA/Business Wire)--Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PPIH) announced today financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025.“For the three months ended October 31, 2025, net sales were $61.1 million, an increase of $19.5 million, or 46.9%, compared to $41.6 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Growth was driven by higher sales volumes in both the Middle East and North America. Gross profit was $21.0 million, up $6.9 million from $14.1 million last year, reflecting higher activity levels. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $8.3 million from $7.3 million, primarily due to higher payroll and professional fees, including approximately $0.5 million relating to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance in connection with our transition from a small reporting company to an accelerated filer. The Company’s effective tax rate (“ETR”) was 27%, compared to 32% in the prior-year quarter, reflecting the impact of product mix in various tax jurisdictions. As a result, net income attributable to common stock was $6.3 million, an increase of $3.8 million, or 152.0%, compared to $2.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024,” noted President and CEO Saleh Sagr.“For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, net sales were $155.8 million, an increase of $42.4 million, or 37.4%, compared to $113.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in both the Middle East and North America. Gross profit was $52.2 million, compared to $38.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting increased activity levels during the current year. General and administrative expenses were $26.1 million, up from $19.5 million, due to higher payroll and professional fees, including approximately $1.0 million relating to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance in connection with our transition from a small reporting company to an accelerated filer. This also includes a one-time compensation charge of approximately $2.0 million related to the departure of the previous CEO. The Company’s effective tax rate was 29%, compared to 28% in the prior-year period. The increase in the Company's tax rate was impacted due to product mix in various tax jurisdictions and as a result of a tax limitation relating to the one-time charge in connection with the previous CEO's departure. Net income attributable to common stock increased to $12.1 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 68.1%, compared to $7.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2024,” Mr. Sagr commented.President and CEO Saleh Sagr added: “As of October 31, 2025, our backlog totaled $148.9 million, representing an increase of $10.8 million, or 7.8%, compared with the $138.1 million reported as of January 31, 2025. Our current backlog levels continue to demonstrate substantial growth; in particular, backlog at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2025 reflects an increase of more than 30% over the backlog recorded at the end of the prior year’s third quarter. This expansion is evident across both North America and the MENA region, underscoring the sustained strength of demand for our solutions.”“As of October 31, 2025, our year-to-date revenues approximate the revenues reported for the full-year fiscal 2024. Current year-to-date net income attributable to common stock was $12.1 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 34.4%, compared to approximately $9.0 million in fiscal 2024. The fact that year-to-date net income has exceeded full-year fiscal 2024 results with one quarter remaining in fiscal 2025 reflects continued operational and financial improvement. In addition, net income attributable to common stock for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, represents the highest level of earnings since the Company's transition from MFRI to Perma-Pipe in 2017," Mr. Sagr continued.“We have continued to experience solid financial performance, supported by sustained activity in our core markets and improved operating leverage. Our operations in the Middle East and North America delivered strong results, further evidencing the ongoing strengthening of our global platform. This performance is reflected in our quarterly and year-to-date results as well as in the growth of our backlog. These results also align with our strategic initiatives, including our investment in the new Qatar facility, which has secured more than $5.0 million in awards scheduled for execution during the remainder of the year. We remain focused on driving profitable growth and enhancing our competitive position within the markets we serve,” Mr. Sagr concluded.Net sales were $61.1 million and $41.6 million in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase of $19.5 million was a result of increased sales volumes in the Middle East and in North America.Gross profit was $21.0 million and $14.1 million in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

The increase of $1.0 million was mainly due to higher payroll expenses and, to a lesser extent, professional fees in the quarter.Selling expenses were $1.3 million and $1.2 million in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase of $0.1 million was due to higher payroll expense in the quarter.Net interest expense remained consistent and was $0.5 million in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.The Company's ETR was 27% and 32% in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The lower ETR for the three months ended October 31, 2025 is due to the mix of income and loss in various jurisdictionsNet income attributable to common stock was $6.3 million and $2.5 million in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Transportation and storage leads FDI inflows in Türkiye

ISTANBUL

Transportation and storage became the top recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Türkiye in October, capturing 35 percent of all equity capital inflows with $199 million.

The wholesale and retail trade sector followed transportation and storage with an 18 percent share, and the electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning production and distribution sector with a 9 percent share, according to data from the International Investors Association (YASED).

In October alone, FDI inflows to Türkiye totaled $128 million.

Of the overall $567 million equity capital inflows, $240 million were through real estate sales to foreign nationals. “However, divestment and debt instruments decreased the overall FDI inflows by $606 million and $73 million, respectively,” the association said.

FDI inflows to Türkiye amounted to $11.6 billion in the first 10 months of the year. The figure rose 35 percent year-on-year in the first 10-month period of 2025, while the total FDI to Türkiye since 2002 exceeded $285 billion.

The EU countries, which had a 58 percent share in the total FDI into Türkiye in the 2002-2024 period, had an 82 percent share in October. In the same month, France had the largest share with 35 percent, followed by the Netherlands with 16 percent, Germany with 10 percent, Belgium with 9 percent, and Switzerland with 5 percent.

Over the 10-month period, the Netherlands invested the most in Türkiye at $2.8 billion, with Kazakhstan and Luxembourg following at $1.1 billion in investments each.

Wholesale and retail trade stood out with $2.8 billion in investments, followed by food manufacturing with $1.2 billion, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) with $1.2 billion.

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Minister of Industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita conveyed his confidence on the strengthened industrial cooperation between Indonesia and Russia.He made this statement while attending a bilateral meeting and opening the Indonesia-Russia Business Matching event organized by his office in early December 2025."Relations between the two countries have moved in a more substantive and comprehensive direction, particularly with the meeting between Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which strengthened bilateral coordination and offered a wider strategic cooperation," he said in a statement on Saturday (December 13).Kartasasmita then outlined the economic cooperation achievement between the two countries, where in 2024, total non-oil and gas bilateral trade reached US$3.9 billion, an increase of 18.69 percent since 2020. By October 2025, trade between the two countries had increased to US$4.04 billion.Russian investment in Indonesia has also shown consistent growth. In 2024, total investment reached US$262.7 million, while by September 2025, Russian investment had reached US$147.2 million."These figures show the high level of confidence from Russian industry players in the economic stability and potential for industrial development in Indonesia," the minister remarked.He added that the countries are exploring the finalization of two important industrial cooperation documents, namely the MoU on Cooperation in the Field of Shipbuilding and an MoU on Cooperation in the Field of Scientific Research on the Safe Use of Chrysotile Asbestos.One of the MoUs, concerning research on the safety of chrysotile asbestos, had been signed by Minister Kartasasmita and the Russian Minister of Industry and Trade, Anton Alikhanov, in Moscow on December 8, 2025."We hope the other MoU can be finalized soon to provide a clear framework for collaboration for large industries and SMEs in both countries," he continued.In addition, he emphasized that intensive dialogue to resolve various technical obstacles between industry players from both countries is a crucial factor in the trade and investment relations, including logistics costs due to the considerable geographical distance.Therefore, the minister welcomed the holding of the 6th Working Group on Trade, Investment, and Industry on March 11-12, 2025, as part of the Indonesia-Russia joint commission meeting held in April 2025 in Jakarta.The forum resulted in several technical agreements covering industrial issues, strengthening the halal supply chain, trade, logistics, standardization, certification, agriculture, and the financial sector.Indonesia also fully supports the accelerated completion and signing of the Indonesia Eurasian Economic Union Free Trade Agreement (IEAEU FTA). The agreement is expected to open broader market access for Indonesian industry players by increasing tariff competitiveness and reducing non-tariff barriers, Kartasasmita said.“We hope this agreement can be signed soon and serve as an important instrument for strengthening supply chain resilience and expanding the penetration of national industrial products in the Eurasian region,” he noted.In multilateral cooperation, Indonesia has also expressed its commitment to supporting programs under BRICS, particularly the BRICS Center for Industrial Competences (BCIC).The collaboration focuses on the development of various sectors, including industrial digitalization, new mobility technologies, unmanned transportation, industrial human resource development, empowerment of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), digital transformation, artificial intelligence, and the bioindustry.

Kavaratti: The Centre, in collaboration with the Lakshadweep administration, has organised a first-of-its-kind investors' meet in the union territory to boost the fisheries and aquaculture sector.The meet on "Investment Opportunities in Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector of Lakshadweep Islands" was organised at Bangaram Island on Saturday.The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries , Animal Husbandry and Dairying (MoFAHD), Government of India joined hands with the Lakshadweep administration to organise the event, according to an official statement."This was a first-of-its-kind investors' meet in the Island, wherein various Investors from across the country participated. So far, investments to the tune of approximately Rs 519 crore have been envisaged," the statement said.The event was attended by union ministers Rajiv Ranjan Singh, S P Singh Baghel and George Kurian, along with Praful Patel, the Administrator of Lakshadweep.An interactive session was held as part of the meet to provide investors with a platform to share experiences and highlight challenges.They outlined several issues, including transportation of the production to the mainland, cold storage requirements, ice plants, and development of chilled fish handling centres for post-harvest management.The Investors called for value-added facilities for sashimi-grade tuna, fish oil refining capacities, the requirement of skilled labour, and ornamental fish brood banks for the strategic utilisation of Lakshadweep's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEC) to drive sustainable growth.In his keynote address, Ranjan Singh said that the Centre issued fishing rules for the EEZ and hence, the fishermen operating there can now legally fish with an authorised "access pass," enabling them to export high-value tuna and other fish products to international markets.As per international law, fishery resources present in India's EEZ will now be recognised as "Indian origin," which would further facilitate the export of fish products, he added.The minister further said that the Centre issued the ' High Seas Fishing Guidelines ' granting fishing vessels flying the Indian flag the legal right to operate in these waters, it said. He also urged investors to come forward and seize the vast investment opportunities in the sector.Baghel, in his address, highlighted Lakshadweep's untapped fisheries potential and called for the need to bridge the gap between the archipelago's current production of 14,000 tonnes and its potential of 1 lakh tonnes.He emphasised that the islands are naturally suited for premium-quality tuna fishing using pole-and-line and handline methods are globally recognised for their clean and sustainable practices. With proper branding, certification, and modern value-chain development, Lakshadweep tuna can access high-end international markets.He urged exporters to explore newer markets and leverage existing government welfare schemes to strengthen the fisheries value chain.Minister Kurian focused on emerging investment domains such as seaweed farming and ornamental fisheries, which offer high returns and diversification opportunities.He emphasised that India must harness its vast EEZ to boost production, strengthen deep-sea fishing, and create value-added seafood products, driving the blue economy forward.Administrator Patel affirmed the collective commitment to realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of leading the blue revolution and urged stakeholders to share sector-wise and policy-related suggestions to help frame Lakshadweep's first fishing policy.Highlighting upcoming initiatives such as the Minicoy airport development and cooperative society strengthening, Patel assured full support to the investors, with plans for a follow-up meeting in Delhi to accelerate progress.The investors' meet brought together 22 key investors from various parts of the country. Over 200 participants joined in hybrid mode, the statement said.The event was attended by senior officials from the Department of Fisheries of the Centre and the UT along with local fishermen societies, the statement added.

[TITLE]Trump wants the U.S. shipbuilding industry to be great again. Here's what it will take, and what's at stake:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump has vowed to lead a revival in U.S. shipbuilding, but the success of this manufacturing renaissance in a key sector for national security will rely on the expertise from overseas. The administration's goal of a shipbuilding boom is a part of Trump's "Make America Great" policy agenda. Trump signed an executive order in April to bolster the shipbuilding industry, but many industry executives have warned it won't be easy given the current state of the domestic industry, and foreign investment and collaboration are key. The Trump administration's "Make American Shipyards Great Again" initiative is looking to build out liquified natural gas tankers, polar ice-breakers, and Navy vessels. "The American shipbuilding industry saw a boom twice in the past 110 years," Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Xeneta, tells CNBC. "The first boom was during World War I, the second, World War II," he said. China, which has roughly 232 times the shipbuilding capacity of the U.S., dominates the global commercial shipbuilding industry. The U.S. presently has eight active shipyards. China has over 300. The Trump administration's shipbuilding plan is an extension of an investigation into Chinese shipbuilding by the United States Trade Representative under the Biden and Trump administrations. The USTR 301 investigation found the Chinese government has bolstered its shipbuilding dominance through the use of significant subsidies and designating the industry as strategic. The investigation said the acts, policies, and practices were "unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce." The U.S. recently began to charge fees on ships built in China visiting U.S. ports, which led to retaliatory measures from China, but the two nations agreed to a one-year pause as part of a November trade truce. In 2008, China surpassed Japan in shipbuilding output. In 2010, China overtook South Korea to become the world's largest shipbuilder, both in production capacity and new orders. Since then, China's lead has continued to grow. Its global market share in shipbuilding stands at 53%, followed by South Korea and Japan. The 2025 order book for new vessels shows China accounts for 75 percent of orders, with South Korea at 19 percent, and the U.S. at 0.2 percent, according to data shared by Sand. "When you look at the orders, making American shipbuilding great again is a tall order. Foreign expertise needs to be brought in," Sand said.

Key foreign companies involved in U.S. shipbuilding To bolster the country's shipbuilding and training of U.S. workers, the Trump administration has inked deals with foreign shipbuilders. Three shipbuilding affiliates of South-Korean based Hanwha Group, the third-largest shipbuilder in the world, are playing a key part in this plan. During July trade negotiations, South Korea and the United States announced a $350 billion investment deal, with $150 billion of that money to be allocated to maritime investment. The overall trade deal was finalized in November, with auto tariffs on U.S. imports from Korea reduced to 15 percent (from 25 percent). "Why should you reinvent the wheel? There is a good reason for friends and allies to work together and capitalize on a company's expertise and experience," Sand said. South Korea began to increase its presence in the U.S. maritime industry in 2024, with the $100 million acquisition of Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia from Norwegian industrial investment group Aker ASA. The yard was then renamed Hanwha Philly Shipyard.

Vessel construction at Hanwha Philly Shipyard Shawn Baldwin

In August, Hanwha Group announced a $5 billion infrastructure plan, part of the $150 billion investment, for Hanwha Philly Shipyard to bring the site up to speed so it can expand its vessel-making capacity from 1-1.5 vessels a year, eventually to 20 vessels. Hanwha Philly Shipyard received its first order for a U.S.-built, export-ready LNG carrier from Hanwha Group's shipping arm, Hanwha Shipping, in July. It was the first order in nearly 50 years. A second order for an LNG vessel was made in August. Deliveries are expected around 2028 and are being made possible through a joint-build model with Hanwha Ocean's Geoje Shipyard in South Korea. The joint-build model is a necessity due to the the lack of vessel-building capacity at the shipyard in Philadelphia and staffing. Hanwha Ocean makes 50-60 vessels a year.

"One of the challenges the industry faces is the workforce," said David Kim, CEO of Hanwha Philly Shipyard. The biggest bottleneck in training that workforce, says Kim, is the lack of U.S. instructors. To remedy this, Hanwha will train employees by rotating the U.S. workforce from Philadelphia to the yard in South Korea. "It's our greatest advantage," said Kim. "The people who are good and you want to train U.S. workers are the people working in the yard," he added. The company is also looking to expand its apprenticeship program. "We have 1,700 workers to date," Kim said. "If you look at our aspirations to deliver those 20 ships a year, our staff down the road is going to be closer to 10,000 plus," he added. Oil, LNG, and creating demand for U.S. freight vessels The LNG vessel orders are not the only Hanwha company-generated orders on the books for the Philly shipyard. Hanwha Shipping has also ordered 10 medium-range tankers used for oil and chemical transport, the largest U.S. commercial vessel order in more than two decades. The first ship is expected to launch in 2029. "There are currently 55 Jones Act oil tankers in the world, and 7,500 oil tankers in the world," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. The Jones Act requires vessels that transport goods between U.S. ports to be U.S.-built, owned, crewed, and flagged. "In LNG, the U.S. shipbuilding industry for all intents and purposes is not participating," Lipow said. There are roughly 750 LNG tankers in the world, and there's only one LNG tanker that is flagged in the United States, "and it was built in France," he said. But the lack of U.S.-built tankers has not impacted the growth of U.S. LNG exports or crude. "The United States LNG market is not at a disadvantage. We're currently exporting nearly 30% of our crude oil production and not having any trouble finding tankers," Lipow said. Nuclear maritime ambitions During Trump's recent Asia tour, the president announced Hanwha would make its first nuclear-powered sub at the Philly Shipyard. Hanwha makes large naval submarines in South Korea. "The U.S. needs its own ability to make ships and submarines for its own security and resiliency," said Alex Wong, global chief strategy officer for Hanwha Group. "God forbid, in times of war, you need the ability to regenerate and make a naval vessel," Wong said. "That's the way you not only win a war, but you deter a war." In August, Trump ordered the movement of two nuclear submarines in response to threats from Russia. The timing of the submarine being built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard is dependent on the ongoing discussions between the South Korean and U.S. government. "Also important to the time is the availability of technology and the resources," Kim said. The U.S. Navy continues to build out its technological infrastructure. The Navy and Palantir Technologies recently announced "ShipOS," software that they said will help build and maintain American submarines. The software down the road might also be used for aircraft carriers and jets. Italian shipbuilder with Wisconsin ties also playing a role In addition to South Korea, Finnish and Italian companies are also being tapped to expand U.S. shipbuilding. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni reconfirmed in a joint statement with Trump the country's commitment to U.S. shipbuilding in an April meeting. The key Italian company in this initiative is Fincantieri Marinette Marine (FMM), which was founded in Wisconsin in 1942 as Marinette Marine to build naval vessels for World War II before later being acquired by the Italian company. President Trump toured the company's Wisconsin shipyard during his first term. The company recently laid off 93 employees,

[TITLE]Spain's commitment to renewable energy may be in doubt:

Spain's commitment to renewable energy may be in doubt

1 day ago Share Save Guy Hedgecoe Aragón, north-eastern Spain Share Save

Juan Antonio Domínguez Spain gets more than half of its electricity from wind and solar

On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby. It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms. Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles. Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as "one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen". Luis Bertol Moreno, mayor of the town, says the area was a logical choice for the project. "We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels," he says. "Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas."

Luis Bertol Moreno says the new battery factory will transform the town of Figueruelas

The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%. By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel "Dig, baby, dig" slogan. "Green, baby, green," said the Socialist, as he pointed to the benefits of renewable energy. However, in recent months, Spain's all-in commitment to renewables has come under scrutiny. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours. With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of "fanaticism" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident. Feijóo and others on the right advocated a rethink of the national energy model.

The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims. Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain. "We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system," says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. "Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment." Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an "unknown event" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations. However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. A cyber-attack has repeatedly been ruled out. Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads.

Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035. With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. That request is currently under consideration. Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible with the green energy transition. "It's prudent to have a mix of renewables and nuclear energy," he says. Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable. "How can you produce energy in those hours when the renewables are not producing?" he asks. The answer, he added, is "with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year". The political opposition is staunchly opposed to the nuclear shut-down. The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as "a crucial source of stability".

[TITLE]Mission Success: Rocket Lab Deploys First Dedicated Launch for Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA):
[TEXT]
MAHIA, New Zealand, Dec. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its first dedicated mission for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) – a pivotal marker of Electron’s global importance for regular, reliable, and dedicated access to space.

The “RAISE And Shine” mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on December 14, 2025 at 03:09 UTC / 16:09 NZDT to successfully deploy the agency’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft: a demonstration of eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan. The mission was the first of two dedicated missions for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program, an initiative by the agency to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities and technologies developed by Japan’s space economy.

Rocket Lab’s successful launch for JAXA reflects the growing integration of commercial companies into national space programs both domestically and internationally. As the established small launch leader in the United States, Electron is also the preferred choice for reliable small launch globally, with its second upcoming mission for JAXA scheduled for launch in Q1 2026. A dedicated Electron launch for the European Space Agency (ESA) is also planned for launch in the new year, further highlighting Electron’s international demand.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “This dedicated mission delivered precision and reliability for one of the world’s most respected space agencies, and we couldn’t be prouder of supporting JAXA with the dedicated access to space needed to support the growth of Japan’s aerospace economy. We’re proud to continue delivering the responsiveness and performance that Japan’s satellite operators have come to rely on.”

“RAISE And Shine” was Rocket Lab’s 19th launch of the year: an extension of the Company’s new Electron annual launch record established just last month with two back-to-back missions launched in 48 hours. Rocket Lab’s next launch of 2025 is scheduled to take place from Launch Complex 2 this month and will be announced in the coming days.

[TITLE]Goldman Sachs Is Bullish On The Boeing Company (BA):
[TEXT]
The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is among the 12 Best Performing Dow Stocks in 2025.

Goldman Sachs Is Bullish On The Boeing Company (BA)

On December 9, 2025, TheFly reported that Goldman Sachs kept a Buy rating and a $257 price target on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). This came after Goldman Sachs reviewed the company’s monthly delivery figures. The firm pointed out that The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s aircraft order inventory is still substantial in comparison to supply and that November gross orders were solid, extending year-to-date momentum. According to the company, a multi-year rise in deliveries across all aircraft platforms is supported by the backlog.

On the same day, Reuters reported that The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) had only delivered 44 in November, down from 53 in October, and was falling behind European rival Airbus, which delivered 72 planes. Deliveries included six 787s, two 777 freighters, four 767s, and 32 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, five of which were delivered to Southwest Airlines. In November, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported 164 new orders, 126 net new orders, and 38 cancellations. There were 74 orders for the 777X, including 65 from Emirates and 9 from China Airlines. Furthermore, the business received 30 orders from undisclosed customers for the 787 and 43 orders for the 737 MAX. Five 737 MAX orders from Comair, four 787 orders from Air Canada, and fifteen 777X orders from Etihad were cancelled. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) delivered 537 aircraft through November 30, booked 1,000 new orders, with 908 net after cancellations, and had a 6,019 order backlog at the conclusion of the month.

Jay Malave, the chief financial officer of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), stated last week that the business anticipates positive cash flow in 2026 as a result of growing jet deliveries.

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a key aerospace and defense company that operates in three segments: commercial aircraft; defense, space, and security; and global services.

While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Mexico’s aerospace sector is growing. Will it be undercut in USMCA review?:
[TEXT]
A North America trade deal helped Mexico get into aeroplane manufacturing. Now that is under threat with Trump.

Monterrey, Mexico – In April, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the country’s aerospace industry could see sustained annual growth of as much as 15 percent over the next four years, and attributed the sector’s expansion to a robust local manufacturing workforce, increasing exports, and a strong presence of foreign companies.

But with the review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) coming up – the free-trade treaty between the three countries that helped Mexico’s aerospace sector to grow and flourish – the industry’s future is no longer certain.

Stakeholders warn that ensuring investment stability and strengthening labour standards are essential to protecting the sector’s North American supply chain.

Mexico is striving to become one of the top 10 countries in aerospace production value, a goal outlined in Plan Mexico, the country’s strategic initiative to enhance global competitiveness in key sectors.

As the sixth-largest supplier of aerospace parts to the US, the industry has benefited significantly from the USMCA, which fostered regional supply chain integration, said Monica Lugo, director of institutional relations at the consulting firm PRODENSA.

However, the integration is no guarantee of business continuing to grow as the country is at an “unprecedented moment” with US President Donald Trump and his wide-ranging tariff policies.

Lugo, a former USMCA negotiator, said that recent tariffs on materials like steel and aluminium — critical to the aerospace sector— have eroded trust in the US as a reliable partner. She predicts that if current conditions continue, the sector risks losing capital, investments and jobs.

“Having this great uncertainty – one day it’s on, the next it’s off, who knows tomorrow – and based on no specific criteria, but rather on the president’s mood, creates chaos and severely damages the country and the economy,” she said.

On December 4, Trump suggested the US might let the USMCA expire next year, or negotiate a new deal. This follows comments by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to US news outlet Politico that the administration is considering separate deals with Canada and Mexico.

A booming aerospace sector

The Mexican aerospace market is valued at $11.2bn, and is expected to more than double to $22.7bn by 2029, Sheinbaum said, citing data from the Mexican Aerospace Industry Federation (FEMIA). Home to global companies like Bombardier, Safran, Airbus, and Honeywell, Mexico has established itself as a key player in the global aerospace market and is now the world’s twelfth-largest exporter of aerospace components.

Marco Antonio Del Prete, secretary of sustainable development in Queretaro, attributes this success in part to heavy investment in education and training. In 2005, the Queretaro government promised Canada’s Bombardier that it would invest in education and set up the Aeronautical University, which now offers programmes ranging from technical diplomas to master’s degrees in aerospace manufacturing and engineering.

“Since Bombardier’s arrival, an educational and training system was created that allows us to develop talent in a very efficient way, let’s say, fast track,” Del Prete told Al Jazeera.

Bombardier has served as an anchor, propelling Queretaro’s rise as a high-skilled manufacturing hub for parts and components.

While the Bombardier plant in Queretaro originally focused on wiring harnesses, it has evolved to specialise in complex aerostructures, including the rear fuselage for the Global 7500, Bombardier’s ultra-long-range business jet, and key components for the Challenger 3500, the mid-sized business jet.

Marco Antonio Carrillo, a research professor at the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ), pointed out that the area’s wide educational offerings have cultivated a powerful workforce, which has gained significant attention from aeroplane makers, mainly from the US, Canada and France.

“This development [of Queretaro] has been, if you look at it in terms of time, truly explosive,” Carrillo said.

Mexico also aims to join France and the US as the third country capable of fully assembling an engine for Safran.

But the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Union, which represents more than 600,000 workers in Canada and the US, is worried that progress could lead to more advanced manufacturing and assembly work to eventually shift to Mexico, given the local investment in aeronautical universities and training.

“Right now they’re [Mexican workers] doing more entry-level type things, but our concern is that later on, larger pieces of the aerospace operation will go to Mexico,” Peter Greenberg, the IAM’s international affairs director, told Al Jazeera.

High-skilled, low-cost workforce

Of the three countries in the USMCA agreement, Mexico’s biggest attraction has been its low-cost manufacturing.

Edgar Buendia and Mario Duran Bustamante, economics professors at the Rosario Castellanos National University, cite Mexico’s low labour costs and geographical proximity to the US as the country’s key advantages. This is partly why the US has intensified pressure on the Mexican government, including during the initial USMCA negotiations in 2017, to raise wages to level the playing field and reduce unfair competition.

“Most US companies have incentives to move their production here in Mexico, given the [low] wages and the geographic location. So, to prevent that from happening, the United States is pressuring Mexico to raise labour standards, ensure freedom of association, and improve working conditions,” Buendia told Al Jazeera, things that will benefit Mexican workers even as employer-dominated labour groups worry that they may lose their advantage.

The IAM originally opposed the USMCA’s predecessor, NAFTA. Greenberg said that while they acknowledge USMCA will continue, US and Canadian workers “would probably be perfectly happy” if the agreement ended as the NAFTA deal had led to plants being shuttered and workers being laid off as jobs moved from the US and Canada to low-cost Mexico.

“There is a need for stronger incentives to keep work in the United States and Canada. We want to see the wages in Mexico go up so that it doesn’t become automatically a place where companies go to because they know they will have lower wages and workers who do not have any bargaining power or strong units,” Greenberg added.

Under Sheinbaum’s Morena party, Mexico has raised the minimum wage from 88 pesos ($4.82) in 2018 to 278.8 pesos ($15.30) in 2025, with the rate in municipalities bordering the US reaching 419.88 pesos ($23). On December 4, Sheinbaum announced a 13 percent rise in the minimum wage — and 5 percent for the border zone— set to begin in January 2026.

Despite these increases and the competitiveness of wages in the aerospace sector, researchers agree that a significant wage gap persists between Mexican workers and their US and Canadian counterparts.

“The wage gap is definitely abysmal,” said Javier Salinas, a scholar at the UAQ Labor Center, specialising in labour relations in the aerospace industry. “The [aerospace] industry average is between 402 [Mexican pesos] and 606, with the highest daily wage being 815. [But] 815, converted to US dollars, is less than $40 for a single workday.”

By contrast, Salinas estimates that a worker in the US earns an average of
