[TITLE]“Niet” via Athens to Russian gas – Two Americans and 25 European ministers in Greece for the EU’s energy independence:
[TEXT]
Nikos Meletis November 3 10:17

The war in Ukraine, the strategic confrontation with Russia, the redesign of Europe’s defense and energy security architecture under the lens of the new “aggressive and unconventional” U.S. foreign policy, provide, after several decades, a favorable opportunity for Greece to emerge as an energy hub and a provider of security in the wider region.

This time, after the collapse of projects such as the Burgas–Alexandroupolis pipeline and EastMed, the Vertical Gas Corridor, as a pillar of Eastern Europe’s and Ukraine’s energy security, is no longer a mere plan—it has taken shape. This week, it will officially receive U.S. support.

As the Vertical Corridor can now serve as a major gateway for U.S.—and not only—LNG to Eastern Europe and Ukraine, it represents a significant step toward Europe’s energy independence from Russia.

This independence has not only economic but also major geopolitical significance, as it deprives Russia of enormous financial resources for its war machine and simultaneously removes from Moscow the leverage it has held for decades to impose its influence even on key European countries such as Germany, Italy, Austria, Poland, and others.

The timing is favorable, coinciding with the EU’s decision to gradually halt purchases of Russian natural gas by the end of 2027, thus opening the path to seek new energy sources, mainly LNG, originating from the U.S., Qatar, and other emerging producers.

Priority

However, priority will be given to U.S. LNG, as this option has been directly linked by U.S. President Donald Trump to the new strategic balances being formed, as well as to maintaining the Transatlantic Relationship and EU-U.S. security cooperation at a high level. The Vertical Corridor also bypasses the Straits and the Black Sea, at a time when Turkey fails to comply with President Trump’s “instructions” to halt energy supplies from Russia.

Turkey, in a goodwill move, has entered into two agreements for long-term U.S. LNG purchase contracts. However, fully cutting off from Moscow is not easy, as it continues to purchase up to two-thirds of its imported oil from Russia, with discounts of up to 15%, saving billions of dollars and curbing inflation.

At the same time, over 40% of Turkey’s natural gas imports come from Russia at competitive prices. This choice by the Turkish president generates suspicion and caution, prompting the search for safer and more reliable solutions for transporting U.S. LNG to Eastern Europe.

Greece’s role in supplying Eastern Europe and Ukraine, through LNG infrastructure at Revythoussa and Alexandroupolis—a market estimated to need 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas after the Russian gas tap closure—is crucial.

This role will be confirmed next Thursday and Friday at the Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Partnership (R-TEC) Summit, held in Greece with the participation of two top U.S. officials: Secretary of the Interior and Energy “Czar” Doug Bergman and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and possibly Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rega, while 24 Energy Ministers from the EU and the Balkans have been invited.

It is notable that the U.S. delegation will consist of nearly 50 people, including ministry officials and representatives of major U.S. companies, who will discuss cooperation and investment plans.

The Vertical Corridor will be the top agenda item. Holding this meeting in Athens is the result of choices made by the Trump team, as well as efforts by the Greek government, especially Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou and Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis.

At the meeting, the new U.S. ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle, is expected to make her first official appearance. She is expected to arrive in Athens over the weekend. On Tuesday, she will present her credentials to President Kosta Tasoulas, and on Wednesday she will host her first reception at the ambassadorial residence in honor of the two U.S. ministers, the accompanying businessmen, and the elite of the Greek business community, expected to attend in the residence’s garden on P. Kyriakou Street.

“Vote of confidence”

Beyond the obvious importance for Greece of this U.S. “vote of confidence,” it is extremely significant that the first major and substantive contact with the new U.S. administration is not for listing problems or requests, but for a dynamic, strategically important energy plan, which also has business significance for the United States.

Moreover, this plan involves individuals closely connected with President Trump, such as the three U.S. ministers and the new ambassador. During meetings with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, U.S. officials will review the full scope of bilateral relations, which are at an excellent point. Beyond energy issues, cooperation on defense and security remains a high priority.

For Athens, from the moment Trump assumed office, priority was given to identifying areas of convergence where bilateral relations could be repositioned compatibly with Trump’s view of transatlantic relations and the U.S. role in regional conflicts and confrontations.

The Middle East was a major test. However, due to Greece’s participation in the UN Security Council, there was an opportunity to develop a functional relationship with the U.S. on other regional issues.

Just last week, Gerapetritis communicated with U.S. Special Envoy for Africa Massad Boulos to discuss the Security Council resolution on the major Western Sahara crisis. Given the personal relationship that the U.S. president repeatedly claims to have with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Athens is attempting to build on-the-ground relations.

Consistent and reliable allied cooperation, spearheaded by the Souda naval base, military infrastructure facilitation, and the energy Vertical Corridor, which has economic but mainly geostrategic significance, creates a very positive foundation.

On this basis, daily discussions and major agreements are taking place, preparing for the supply of liquefied natural gas from the U.S. to Greece, targeting Eastern European countries via the Vertical Corridor.

In a few days, a commercial agreement is expected with a top U.S.-linked LNG production company for significant LNG supply, covering a period of more than 20 years.

The Greek government also awaits the new U.S. ambassador’s initiative, who has had phone communications with the Foreign Minister ahead of assuming her duties. Sources in Athens and Washington indicate she shows willingness for substantive work, arriving with specific proposals and aiming to deliver immediate results.

Cooperation

These proposals mainly concern energy sector cooperation, not limited to the Vertical Corridor. The goal is also to bring new U.S. companies to Greece, particularly in Renewable Energy, while cultural cooperation is also high on the agenda.

Those who met her during preparations for assuming her post describe Guilfoyle as sharp, active, and determined to contribute in her new role. On a personal level, she wants to prove she can meet the demands of her role and honor the choice made for her. She has already studied Greece’s dossier in depth before arriving in Athens and played a key role in organizing high-level contacts for Economy Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis in Washington.

Within the balances forming under Trump’s environment, special attention is paid to Guilfoyle’s relationship with Thomas Barrack, also a personal friend and Trump’s choice for U.S. ambassador to Ankara. Barrack is a strong, multifaceted personality, businessman with a wide network, but also a person with ideological biases regarding the region.

He has never hidden his admiration for Turkey and may attempt to overshadow other U.S. representatives in the region to impose his approaches and objectives. According to a U.S. source, despite some media reports, no initiative plans have emerged for regional issues.

5×5 Forum

Greece’s 5×5 forum initiative is being met with interest, as the U.S. has always favored multilateral cooperation frameworks in the region. For now, however, U.S. envoy Massad Boulos has focused on Libya, which also concerns Greece. Boulos had numerous contacts with all parties in Libya.

This week, he met with the President of Libya’s Presidential Council, Mohamed al-Menfi, while a post from the International Investment Conference in Saudi Arabia revealed that U.S. President Trump’s son Eric met with Khalifa Haftar’s son Belkacem, overseeing the Reconstruction Fund of Eastern Libya.

In Tripoli, a senior delegation from Chevron also held talks with the state company NOC and Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah to expand energy cooperation, which is particularly relevant given Chevron’s involvement in Greek offshore blocks south of Crete.

Starting point: Revythoussa

In the Vertical Corridor, an important first step was last week’s successful auction to secure LNG quantities that, starting from Revythoussa, will be sent via Bulgaria, Romania, and Moldova, with the final destination being Ukraine. Ukraine is making a titanic effort to ensure adequate energy reserves for the coming winter while critical energy infrastructure has suffered severe damage from Russian missiles.

This development is the result of coordinated action by Vertical Corridor operators: DESFA (Greece), Bulgartransgaz (Bulgaria), Transgaz (Romania), VestMoldTransgaz (Moldova), and GTSOU (Ukraine). These companies offered an attractive long-term program with lower transit fees, agreed upon in a meeting in Athens with Mr. Papastavrou.

This initiative comes at the right time, as Ukraine urgently needs gas imports. Estimates suggest import demand will increase by approximately 10% compared to initial plans. The Vertical Corridor will require additional major projects with significant investments, some of which will involve Greek energy and construction companies.

Beyond Revythoussa and the Alexandroupolis FSRU, a second FSRU is deemed necessary to meet demand, while back-to-back agreements for reselling gas to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Moldova, and Ukraine are being prepared. These plans are attractive for leading U.S. funds to participate through capital and guarantees, supporting the massive effort to rebuild Ukraine and reduce Eastern Europe’s dependency on Russian energy.

In Greek-U.S. cooperation, the involvement of major oil companies Chevron and ExxonMobil in blocks south and southwest of Crete is also important. These U.S. giants want to maintain a presence in the region, especially now that the hydrocarbon era is not ending as quickly as expected, particularly after Trump’s election, and amid doubts over rapid green transition plans.

For Greece, the presence of these U.S. giants in a sensitive region with unresolved maritime zones is extremely significant. Greece also plays a role in transporting Azeri gas via TANAP and TAP, as recent developments are expected to increase capacity to meet additional needs.

Alexandroupolis as key

Rapid developments in Europe’s energy independence from Russian gas now position Greece as an energy hub, with Alexandroupolis playing a decisive role.

The Vertical Corridor connecting Alexandroupolis with Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and through them Central European countries is no longer just a paper plan; with official U.S. support, it is entering the implementation phase.

The project aims to transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alexandroupolis to Europe. LNG will arrive by ship at the FSRU facilities in Alexandroupolis, where it will be regasified and sent into the vertical pipeline. The pipeline will also operate bidirectionally, able to receive natural gas from the Caspian via TAP.

Implementing this ambitious project ensures Europe’s energy security and independence from Russia. It creates the possibility of diversifying sources (suppliers) and gas routes. In the future, the bidirectional Vertical Corridor could also support the green transition, as the same network could transport environmentally friendly hydrogen.

The entire project is strategically significant for all of Europe, which is why the EU supports it, designating it a “project of common interest,” with the associated implications for financing and implementation support.

[TITLE]$50 Oil Could Crush American Shale Growth:
[TEXT]
Despite rising costs and international price fluctuations, US shale production has continued to grow due to efficiency improvements and an ample supply of drilled but uncompleted wells, though this inventory is now shrinking in some key basins.

The US shale industry is at risk if West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices fall to and remain at $50 per barrel, potentially leading to a 700,000-bpd drop in output by the end of 2026.

OPEC+ just agreed to boost oil production for another month. Luckily for U.S. shale, they also decided to pause the hikes, which would help the shale industry dodge the bullet of WTI of $50. This is good news for an impressively resilient industry, because its resilience seems to taper out around $50 per barrel.

This weekend, the OPEC+ group said it would add another 137,000 barrels daily to global supply. That was bearish news after an extended streak of monthly hikes. Yet the producer cartel also said it planned to suspend the hikes next year for three months. It is now time for investment bank commodity teams to revise their price assumptions and for shale operators to breathe a sigh of relief—they may have avoided having to see their output shrink by 700,000 barrels daily by the end of 2026.

It is no secret that shale oil in the United States has a higher breakeven price than conventional wells in Saudi Arabia. Yet, not all wells are created equal, and some can make money at less than $60 per barrel while others need $70 per barrel and more to break even. Not only this, but costs in the shale patch have been rising, as reported by the Dallas Fed in its quarterly energy survey. Even so, shale production continues growing, hitting another all-time high of 13.7 million barrels daily in August, according to new data from the Energy Information Administration.

A lot of this is thanks to efficiency improvements, energy market analytics firm Kpler said in a report on oil prices and their effect on the U.S. shale industry. The report noted the adverse effect of tariffs, OPEC+ output hikes, and President Trump’s ambition to keep prices at the pump low. It then went on to point out that despite these, U.S. shale production has continued growing even with a lower rig count, thanks to drilling efficiencies and an ample supply of drilled but uncompleted wells.

[TITLE]Kyiv Links Ukrainian Attacks on Russia To Surge in Western Oil Earnings:
[TEXT]
Ukraine’s defence agencies are claiming that their campaign of strikes on Russian oil infrastructure, combined with Western sanctions, are indirectly benefiting major Western oil companies. According to The Kyiv Independent, Ukraine’s military and energy officials attribute rising refining margins at ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and TotalEnergies to disruptions in Russian oil-product exports and constrained global fuel supply.

According to Ukrainian officials, nearly 160 successful strikes have been carried out this year against refineries, terminals, and storage depots, cutting Russian refining capacity by roughly one-fifth. Kyiv’s estimates, drawn from internal defence briefings and trade-tracking data from Kpler, suggest that Russia’s refined-product exports have fallen by

[TITLE]AltaGas to Retain MVP as Long-Term Investment; Announces $400 Million Bought Deal Financing:
[TEXT]
MVP Pipeline Set to Deliver Strong Growth Over Next Three Years

NOT FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE U.S. OR THROUGH U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES

BASE SHELF PROSPECTUS IS ACCESSIBLE, AND THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE WITHIN TWO BUSINESS DAYS, ON SEDAR+

CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

AltaGas Ltd. ("AltaGas" or the "Company") (TSX: ALA) today announced its decision to retain ownership in the Mountain Valley Pipeline (“MVP”) as a long-term investment. Concurrently, AltaGas has entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters, led by CIBC Capital Markets, TD Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank for a bought deal equity financing to issue $400 million of common equity. While not material on a consolidated level, these actions are expected to maximize value for AltaGas’ shareholders—driving modestly higher near- and medium-term normalized EPS accretion relative to a monetization of MVP. The equity issuance will be leverage neutral in the near-term, when compared to a monetization of MVP; and longer-term, post the two expansion projects coming online, will enhance AltaGas’ credit metrics and increase investment capacity to fund growth projects.

Bought Deal Financing

AltaGas has entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by CIBC Capital Markets, TD Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank (collectively, the "Underwriters") under which the Underwriters have agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 10,100,000 common shares of the Company ("Common Shares") for aggregate gross proceeds of $400 million at an offering price of $39.65 per Common Share (the "Offering").

AltaGas has granted the Underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase, on the same terms and exercisable not more than 30 days after the closing of the offering, up to an additional 1,515,000 common shares for additional gross proceeds of up to approximately $60 million. Closing of the offering is expected to occur on or

Rusty Hutson, Jr., CEO of Diversified, commented:

“I am very pleased to report that our year-to-date results have exceeded our plans and our teams have continued to perform with operational focus and excellence. Our growing portfolio of high-quality assets continued to deliver exceptional results this quarter, generating a year-over-year increase of approximately 105% in revenue(d) and 157% in free cash flow(c), demonstrating Diversified’s ability to generate substantial value in volatile markets. This performance reflects the strength of our business model, the disciplined approach to acquire assets, the commitment to our optimization strategy, the consistency of our operational execution, and our ability quickly and efficiently integrate acquisitions to capture synergies and enhance margins.

Importantly, we also delivered on our leverage target goal ahead of schedule, ending the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 2.4x. Significant strategic work over the last few years has built us into a company with higher growth prospects, a robust cash flow profile, and solid footing to deliver on our capital allocation framework. This progress has enabled us to strengthen our commitment to shareholders with a record year-to-date return of capital through dividends and share repurchases of approximately seven percent of our current shares outstanding.

The strength of our underlying business, our strategy, and our capabilities, coupled with our strategic partnership with the Carlyle Group, has allowed us to execute our disciplined inorganic growth through an accretive acquisition strategy with the recently announced agreement to purchase Canvas Energy. We believe the strong fit with our existing Oklahoma assets, our differentiated scale, and vertical integration will drive attractive financial returns. Our established acquisition integration playbook, the execution of which allowed us to complete both field-level and corporate-level integration of Maverick ahead of schedule, creates high confidence in our ability to execute the integration of Canvas. We remain well-positioned with strong liquidity and further balance sheet optionality for a robust funnel of potential high-quality opportunities.

Looking ahead, given our momentum on synergy capture, numerous portfolio optimization opportunities, and strong third-quarter performance, we are raising our financial guidance ranges for fiscal year 2025 for both adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. In addition, we continued to believe that our proposed redomestication to the United States and the change in our primary listing to the New York Stock Exchange, which includes full SEC reporting for domestic issuers beginning with year-end 2025 results, will offer several potential benefits that are in the best interest of all shareholders.

With outstanding performance across our platform, Diversified is well-positioned to thrive as a proven portfolio manager of cash generating energy assets in today’s evolving corporate landscape. We are proud to be the Right Company at the Right Time, delivering essential energy while creating long-term value for all stakeholders.”

[TITLE]India's green power pipeline had become clogged. A mega clean-up is on cards.:
[TEXT]
The Union power ministry has flagged off a major clean-up of India's massive green energy pipeline, ordering state-owned power procurers to scrap awarded renewable energy contracts where critical agreements have stalled.

The ministry has asked Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), NTPC Ltd, NHPC Ltd and SJVN Ltd to cancel awarded contracts by November end in cases where it's not feasible to sign power purchase agreements (PPAs) and power supply agreements (PSAs), according to two people aware of the development and a document reviewed by Mint.

These state-run firms, referred to as the Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies (REIA), are intermediaries in the renewable energy chain, signing PPAs with project developers on one end, and PSAs with power distribution companies (discoms) on the other. However, many discoms have chosen to wait for lower tariffs rather than sign PSAs straightaway, holding up the whole process.

A power ministry meeting on 17 October chaired by secretary Pankaj Agarwal decided to cancel the contracts, the people cited above said on the condition of anonymity.

“REIAs to close the legacy bids and close the LOAs (letter of awards) by 30th November 2025 in cases where signing of PPA/PSA is not feasible. Alternatively, REIAs may sign the PPAs themselves without PSA," the minutes of the meeting showed. “REIAs informed that due to low demand from states, especially for solar capacity, difficulties are faced in signing PPAs."

Out of the 93 gigawatts (GW) awarded by these state-run firms since the beginning of FY24, 42GW involving a proposed investment of around ₹2.1 trillion still do not have PPAs and PSAs in place, putting these contracts in limbo. The figure had reached a high of 55GW in November last year.

The decision, aimed at resolving the vexed issue that has plagued the sector for years, assumes importance given the impact of delays on India’s ambitious green energy targets. The cancellation will also help free up the transmission capacity that has been locked by these contracts. The decision also comes in the backdrop of Power Grid Corp.’s Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd cancelling grid connectivity for around 17GW of delayed renewable energy projects.

India has an installed renewable energy capacity of 245GW, of which solar and wind power account for 116GW and 52GW, respectively. India plans to add 50GW of green energy capacity annually to reach 500GW by 2030. Given the nation’s green energy transition trajectory and the net-zero target by 2070, the plan is to add 1,800 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2047 and 5,000GW by 2070.

“There has been low demand from states. This cancellation of awards will also help in freeing up transmission capacity," one of the two people cited above said.

These REIAs have also been given the option to sign the PPAs without a PSA. It was also decided that the “green shoe option" that had allowed additional capacity to be procured over and above the tendered capacity at the same bid price will be dropped.

Analysts have stated that such a move would help restore investor confidence.

“Slower tendering and focus on cleaning the old renewable auctions will ultimately restore investor confidence in RE sector, in our view. We calculate that India conducted more than 90GW of renewable energy auctions in the past two years, and a significant part remains unsigned into power purchase agreements (PPA). This creates uncertainty for developers and investors on the value that needs to be assigned to these award letters (LOAs)," HSBC Global Investment Research wrote in a 23 September report.

Cash-strapped discoms have been unwilling to buy power from projects awarded earlier at a comparatively higher tariff, instead shopping for lower tariffs.

“So far, tariffs have been falling. So, everybody (discoms) just keeps waiting for the subsequent tenders. So, we have also taken several steps to bring stability in this regard," New and Renewable Energy minister Pralhad Joshi said at the Mint Sustainability Summit on 3 September.

Queries emailed to the spokespersons of the ministries of power and new and renewable energy; and SECI, NTPC, NHPC, and SJVN on late Sunday night remained unanswered.

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), India’s apex power sector regulator, has also expressed reservations on the green shoe option.

“REIAs informed that CERC has raised objections to the inclusion of the green shoe option in RE bids, stating that the standard bidding guideline (SBG) does not provide for procurement of additional power through this mechanism," the minutes of the meeting said and added, “Secretary (Power) observed that, making provision for green shoe option is not reasonable considering even the base capacities itself are unsold."

“Green shoe option is a deviation from SBG and should not be incorporated in bids by REIAs," according to the minutes of the meeting.

Rules are in place that ensure that if any renewable energy project is not completed by the prescribed date of completion, then its bank guarantee should be encashed and the developer blacklisted. The meeting also decided that the SBG will be amended to mandate REIAs to transfer the penalty and damage recoveries from generators to end procurers—the discoms.

A successful bidder for a renewable energy project needs to submit performance bank guarantees to the REIAs, with the performance bank guarantee varying between ₹22 lakh per MW and ₹39 lakh per MW for some of the recent SECI tenders.

[TITLE]ConnectM Acquires Amperics, Expanding Keen Labs’ Portfolio and Advancing the Future of Virtual Power Plants & Energy-Intelligent AI Data Centers:
[TEXT]
MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectM Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTC: CNTM) (“ConnectM” or the “Company”), a high-growth technology company powering the modern energy economy, today announced the acquisition of Amperics, a developer of next-generation hybrid battery-supercapacitor technology.

The acquisition marks a major milestone in ConnectM’s evolution from an electrification services provider to an energy-asset owner and operator of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) that integrate seamlessly with commercial facilities and data centers.

As part of the transaction, Amperics will become a new product line under Keen Labs (www.keenlabs.ai), ConnectM’s AI and technology subsidiary. The addition expands Keen Labs’ growing portfolio of connected-energy platforms, which already includes AI-powered HVAC, Industrial Internet of Things modules and smart mobility software, last-mile logistics software, and distributed-energy management solutions.

Amperics’ proprietary TiO₂-based hybrid battery platform delivers a unique combination of high power, long cycle life, and enhanced safety — ideal for high-frequency use cases such as grid stabilization, data-center energy buffering, and electric-fleet charging.

By combining the instantaneous response of supercapacitors with the energy density of lithium-ion cells, Amperics’ technology enables batteries that last decades, charge in minutes, and operate safely in extreme environments.

Empowering the Grid and the Cloud

With this acquisition, ConnectM strengthens its position as a leader in distributed energy resources (DERs) and VPP operations. The Company plans to integrate Amperics’ technology into residential, commercial, and fleet applications through its Energy Intelligence Network (EIN) platform, creating a unified network of energy assets that generate recurring revenue through grid-service participation.

Within Keen Labs, Amperics will accelerate the development of the Company’s AI-driven Energy Intelligence and VPP software, enabling real-time control, dispatch, and monetization of distributed storage assets — from homes and fleets to next-generation AI and hyperscale data centers.

The hybrid battery’s ability to absorb and release massive power spikes instantaneously makes it ideal for managing computing surges, balancing renewable inputs, and improving uptime and efficiency at data-center campuses.

“The acquisition of Amperics represents a strategic leap forward for ConnectM,” said Bhaskar Panigrahi, CEO and Chairman of ConnectM. “We are now not only electrifying homes and fleets, but also powering the infrastructure that runs the world’s data and AI workloads. Through Keen Labs, Amperics’ technology becomes the backbone of our next-generation VPP and energy-intelligence stack — turning every distributed battery, whether in a home, truck depot, or data center, into a dynamic, revenue-generating asset that supports a more resilient, intelligent grid.”

A New Model for Energy Ownership

By uniting Amperics’ advanced energy-storage IP with Keen Lab’s energy intelligence software and ConnectM’s service provider ecosystem, the Company can deploy high-performance batteries rapidly and monetize them through energy-as-a-service offerings.

This model transforms traditional one-time equipment sales into recurring income streams, effectively creating distributed “digital power plants” that respond to real-time grid or data-center demand.

Amperics’ technology also aligns with ConnectM’s mission to decarbonize infrastructure while enhancing reliability. The TiO₂-based design eliminates rare or toxic metals and enables scalable, low-cost manufacturing using existing roll-to-roll processes — advancing ConnectM’s goal of sustainable, domestically manufacturable clean-energy technology.

[TITLE]Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. and Qymera Global EnergyAnnounce Strategic Collaboration to Advance DeepFyre™ Geothermal Power Systems Worldwide:
[TEXT]
IRVINE, CA, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETY) (“CETY”), a leader in clean energy and waste-heat recovery solutions & technologies, today announced a strategic collaboration with Qymera Global Energy Ltd. (QGE) to advance and commercialize the DeepFyre™ geothermal power system, designed to provide highly scalable, cost-efficient, zero-emission baseload power for island nations and emerging global markets.

The collaboration integrates CETY’s proprietary heat-to-power and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems, and its strategic alliance with Exergy International Srl heat to power solutions, with Qymera’s DeepFyre™ monobore geothermal platform — a next-generation well architecture utilizing advanced resin-based casings to enhance heat transfer and reduce drilling complexity. Together, the companies aim to redefine geothermal deployment through modular 5-MW to 50-MW units that reduce capital costs and accelerate time to power.

“Partnering with Qymera opens a new frontier for geothermal energy,” said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. By pairing our conversion technologies and Exergy’s advanced ORC systems with Qymera’s innovative well design, we can deliver clean, reliable baseload power in markets where energy resilience and independence matter most. Our objective is to achieve LCOE below $0.08 per kWh and scale rapidly across high-potential geothermal regions.”

Darrell Dous serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Qymera Global Energy Ltd. and added: “Our collaboration with CETY and its strategic alliance with Exergy gives us a complete, integrated solution from subsurface design to surface power generation.”DeepFyre’s monobore wells simplify drilling and reduce costs, while CETY’s ORC technology provides proven efficiency and scalability. Together, we’re positioned to deploy geothermal systems faster and more competitively than ever before.”

The global geothermal market, valued at approximately $8.75 billion in 2024, is expected to grow to over $12 billion by 2033 at a 4.2% CAGR. Yet geothermal still represents less than 0.5% of global electricity generation, leaving vast potential untapped. The Caribbean alone holds an estimated 55–70 GW of geothermal capacity but has deployed only around 15 MW to date.

The CETY–Qymera collaboration directly targets this gap, beginning with island-based pilot projects in the Caribbean and Central America, followed by larger installations across Southeast Asia and Africa. Each deployment will demonstrate how DeepFyre™ can reduce drilling costs by up to 30%, shorten project development time by nearly half, and deliver reliable, baseload renewable energy suited for both traditional grids and digital-energy infrastructures such as AI compute centers and sustainable data facilities.

[TITLE]Rondo Energy to deploy 100 MWh heat battery for HEINEKEN, powered by solar from EDP:
[TEXT]
Rondo Energy and EDP to install Heat-as-a-Service solution for HEINEKEN, powered by solar on-site and renewables through the grid, and supported by the European Investment Bank and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

LISBON, Portugal, Nov. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- HEINEKEN, Rondo Energy, and EDP have contracted to deploy a 100 MWh Rondo Heat Battery (RHB) at Central de Cervejas e Bebidas Brewery and Malting Plant, part of HEINEKEN Company in Portugal. The installation will be the largest heat battery in the beverage industry worldwide, providing continuous, renewable steam to HEINEKEN's local operation.

The Rondo Heat Battery charges with intermittent electricity, converts and stores that energy as high-temperature heat, and delivers safe, 24-hour, zero-carbon steam. It is designed to reduce or eliminate reliance on traditional fossil-fired boilers. At the Lisbon site, the heat battery will provide 7 MWs of steam for brewing processes, charged by renewable electricity supplied through the grid and by on-site solar. EDP will supply HEINEKEN with this steam under a Heat-as-a-Service model, with Rondo providing the battery and EDP supplying the solar installation and complementing electricity through the grid.

Slashing the brewery's emissions comes without changing HEINEKEN's operations: the Rondo-provided steam is identical to fossil-fired steam, but the carbon emissions are not.

"By combining our strengths with EDP and Rondo, we're unlocking new ways to power our brewery operations more efficiently," said Magne Setnes, Chief Supply Chain Officer at HEINEKEN. "This project not only helps us reduce our reliance on conventional energy, it shows how practical innovation and strong partnerships can deliver meaningful improvements across our supply chain."

HEINEKEN's Lisbon facility has already decided to use on-site solar for power, and electric heat pumps for its hot water needs. The heat battery opens a new path to deep decarbonization, by delivering what has been one of the hardest-to-decarbonize brewery needs: high-temperature steam.

This deployment supports HEINEKEN's "Brew a Better World" strategy, which includes a net zero ambition across its value chain by 2040 starting by decarbonizing all its production sites by 2030.

The project taps into the attractive solar resource in Portugal to help Portugal deliver on its ambitious decarbonization plans, including a 55% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

How The Rondo Battery Works

The Rondo Heat Battery charges with intermittent and low-cost electricity, stores electricity as heat in refractory brick, and delivers steam on-demand at any conditions up to over 100 bar, with no combustion and no emissions. It can deliver continuous 24-hour steam, heat and/or electricity, serving as a drop-in replacement for fossil fuel-fired boilers or cogeneration systems.

By pairing intermittent and low-cost electricity with the Rondo Heat Battery, industries can replace fossil fuels while maintaining round-the-clock operations. Globally, electrifying heat could reduce industrial emissions by gigatons and reshape the energy landscape.

European Investment Bank & Breakthrough Energy Catalyst Support

This project is backed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst as part of an EU–Catalyst partnership investment of €75 million announced in 2024 to scale Rondo's heat battery deployments across Europe.

"Boosting competitiveness and decarbonizing Europe's industry through affordable renewable energy is a key priority for the EIB Group," said EIB Vice President Karl Nehammer. "Through our new Climate Bank Roadmap, we are prioritizing innovative solutions such as Rondo's heat battery. This project is exactly the kind of public-private partnership we aim to support more of in the future."

"Rondo's heat batteries offer a unique pathway toward energy security for European industry, allowing companies like Heineken to implement a solution that is affordable, reliable, and clean," said Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. "Catalyst exists to accelerate the deployment of critical technologies, and we are thrilled to support a project, along with our European Partners, that can provide round-the-clock decarbonized heat for manufacturing in this moment of need."

Iberia's "Untapped" Industrial Advantage

Bloomberg New Energy Finance's Jenny Chase has pointed out that solar power is changing the world, observing that "by 2030, in most countries on a sunny day for a few hours, wholesale electricity will be free." The Rondo Heat Battery harvests this electricity with a cost of storage lower than any chemical battery, to supply energy low enough in cost to replace fossil fuel steam.

Charging during the cheapest 6 hours of electricity per day, the heat battery converts this low-cost, intermittent renewable electricity into low-cost, 24-hour heat and steam for industry. The system also offers highly flexible demand to the grid that not only soaks up electricity when solar is abundant, it also uses the network outside of peak demand, making better use of the existing electricity network.

"Iberia can be Europe's low-cost and low-carbon industrial manufacturing base," said Eric Trusiewicz, CEO of Rondo Energy. "We are thrilled to be installing our first Rondo Heat Battery in Iberia, and to support HEINEKEN to reach its goals. We look forward to helping industries across Iberia cut costs and carbon, and help Iberia capitalize on the opportunity."

This project will serve as a model for other industries – from dairies and food processing to pulp and paper, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. With many Iberian facilities having space for solar installations on-site or near-site, and growing access to inexpensive renewable electricity through the grid, the region can emerge as Europe's gateway to cost-competitive, clean energy for industry.

Rondo and EDP's Heat-as-a-Service Model to HEINEKEN

This project is delivered under a Heat-as-a-Service (HaaS) model. The heat battery is combined with EDP's own investments in on-site solar, electrical system upgrade and grid electricity supply, all to deliver steam directly to HEINEKEN. This turnkey package solution – combining heat storage, on-site renewable supply, and grid electricity optimization – allows companies like HEINEKEN to adopt advanced technology without operational complexity. The involvement of two of the world's leading companies – HEINEKEN in food and beverage and EDP in energy systems – is a testament to the breadth of benefits that heat batteries can bring to industrial facilities, renewable developers, and grid operators.

"At EDP, we believe the future of industry will be driven by partnerships and breakthrough ideas. Deploying the world's largest heat battery in the beverage sector – integrated into a brewery solution and powered by solar panels and a complementary green PPA – is not just

[TITLE]Green Investors Enjoy Huge Returns as Stock Market Powers Through Trump’s Attacks:
[TEXT]
So as world leaders prepare to gather at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, Shah says it’s important to acknowledge that even with this year’s green rebound, the planet is on track to miss not only the critical temperature threshold of 1.5C, but also 2C. “You have to keep both of those stories in your mind at the same time,” he said.

The new mood of euphoria among green investors also comes with a layer of irony, however. Electricity demand tied to AI is on track to quadruple within a decade, and though renewables will play a huge role in powering that development, fossil fuels will also be a big part of the mix, pumping up emissions in the process, according to BloombergNEF.

He points to a whole array of factors, including the stunning ascent of China’s green economy and its clean-tech exports to the developing world. And then there are the so-called hyperscalers driving AI, such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, all of which Shah says is “very much a sustainability story.”

Aniket Shah, global head of sustainability and transition strategy at Jefferies, says investors have been too distracted by Trump’s anti-green rhetoric in the US. Instead, they should look at the global level of capital piling into clean technologies: the $2 trillion dedicated to low-carbon spending last year is an “insane number” that indicates the green economy is enjoying a “wonderful moment,” according to Shah.

Analysts at Jefferies have seized on the moment to declare this the “glory days” for green investors, even dedicating an entire client event to the idea.

Much of that development is pegged to a near-insatiable demand for energy to power the data centers feeding artificial intelligence. It also reflects China’s relentless drive to build out its low-carbon economy. For investors, those factors have outweighed Trump’s attacks on what he often calls the “green scam.”

Those equities have significantly outpaced most other stock indexes. The S&P’s main gauge tracking clean energy is up

[TITLE]AI Energy Crunch: Hyperscalers Turn to Small Nuclear Reactors:
[TEXT]
Despite global momentum and policy support, the SMR revolution faces substantial execution risks, including cost control, supply chain maturity, regulatory bottlenecks, and the need for robust financing structures to ensure timely and on-budget delivery.

Key industry players such as NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy are moving SMRs from conceptual designs to billion-dollar commercial projects, with notable advancements in deployment programs, industrial heat applications, and corporate energy strategies.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are experiencing a significant comeback, driven by their scalability, siting flexibility, and ability to provide carbon-free baseload power, crucial for rising AI energy demands and industrial decarbonization.

After decades of stagnation, nuclear energy is staging a comeback — and it’s no longer the gigawatt-scale reactors of the past leading the charge. Small modular reactors, once dismissed as niche or speculative, have moved to the center of a global energy and geopolitical pivot. Their appeal lies in scalability, siting flexibility, and the promise of dedicated, carbon-free baseload power—a vital ingredient in an era defined by the AI energy demand surge and industrial decarbonization.

The shift from ambitious blueprints to billion-dollar commercial projects is officially underway, driven by key industry announcements throughout 2025. Some of the leading stakeholders include NuScale, Amazon, and Terrestrial Energy.

NuScale Power: From De-Risking To Gigawatt-Scale Deployment

NuScale Power has cemented its role as the bellwether of the SMR movement, but its commercial success will depend on disciplined financing. In early September 2025, the company announced a landmark collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority and ENTRA1 Energy to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of its SMR technology within the TVA service region — the largest SMR commitment in U.S. history.

The structure of this deal is as important as its scale. Rather than placing the full “first-of-a-kind” financial and regulatory burden on TVA, ENTRA1 will reportedly finance, own, and operate the facilities, selling power back to TVA through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement. This off-balance-sheet approach could prove pivotal, unlocking institutional investment and moving SMRs from demonstration projects into a bankable, utility-scale asset class.
