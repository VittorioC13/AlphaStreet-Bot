Stifel described the HUGO approval as an important and positive step for Medtronic, ending a long development phase and finally opening the door to competition in the US surgical robotics market. The firm pointed out that this allows Medtronic to challenge dominant players in minimally invasive procedures, where robotic systems are increasingly used. However, Stifel expects any meaningful added revenue from the HUGO launch to begin only in Medtronic’s fiscal year 2027.

Medtronic announced the approval on December 3, stating that the HUGO RAS system will be used in minimally invasive urologic surgical procedures. As a result, the system will operate in the US where it is now indicated for procedures such as prostatectomy (prostate removal), nephrectomy (kidney removal), and cystectomy (bladder removal).

The clearance followed positive results from the Expand URO investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical study. Medtronic described the study as the largest multi-center prospective IDE trial for multi-port robotic-assisted urologic surgery in the US. The company plans a phased launch focused on partnerships with leading hospitals.

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) develops and manufactures medical devices and therapies across cardiovascular, diabetes, surgical, and neurological care. The company’s AI-enabled portfolio includes GI Genius, Touch Surgery Enterprise for surgical video analysis, AiBLE for neurosurgery, and the MiniMed 780G insulin pump.

While we acknowledge the potential of MDT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

pill is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events* Novo Nordisk expects to launch Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026

Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 December 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Wegovy® pill (once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg) to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events*.

The Wegovy® pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial2. In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities1. The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy® 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial1. The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy® pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management.

“The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy® pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”.

Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025.

About the OASIS trial programme

OASIS was a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3 programme consisted of four trials, enrolling approximately 1,300 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.

OASIS 4 was a 64-week efficacy and safety phase 3b trial of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg versus placebo in 307 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.

About Wegovy®

Wegovy® is now approved as once-daily Wegovy® pill (semaglutide tablet 25 mg) and once-weekly Wegovy® injection (semaglutide injectable 2.4 mg) by the FDA. The approval of Wegovy® pill is based on a New Drug Application to reduce excess body weight in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical condition.

Wegovy® is approved as a once-weekly injection by the EMA and widely by other regulatory authorities. The Wegovy® pill is currently pending marketing approval from the EMA and other regulatory authorities.

Wegovy® is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults with obesity or overweight and in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, and approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Furthermore, Wegovy® injection is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older, and approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.

[TITLE]European Commission approves TREMFYA® (guselkumab) for the treatment of children with plaque psoriasis, marking the first paediatric indication for an IL-23 inhibitor:
[TEXT]
BEERSE, Belgium (19 December 2025) – Johnson & Johnson today announced that the European Commission (EC) has extended the marketing authorisation for TREMFYA® (guselkumab) as a subcutaneous treatment to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Pso) in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are candidates for systemic therapy.1,a This milestone makes guselkumab the first IL-23 inhibitor approved for any paediatric indication, building on EC approval in adults living with moderate to severe plaque Pso in 2017.1

Almost one-third of Pso cases begin in childhood, and the inflamed, scaly plaques caused by chronic disease may be itchy or painful and can be highly stressful for children, leading to a potential long-term impact on those affected.3 Paediatric Pso has been associated with certain comorbidities, such as obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and psoriatic arthritis, further impacting quality of life.3

“Despite progress in the treatment of paediatric Pso, there continues to be a significant gap in available therapies for children living with this debilitating immune-mediated disease, which can impact a child’s physical and mental wellbeing during critical years,” said Marieke Seyger, Associate Professor, Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Netherlands, and PROTOSTAR study investigator.b “The approval of guselkumab offers physicians, parents, and care givers a treatment option that can significantly improve the signs and symptoms of Pso in children living with this disease.”

The EC approval was based on results from the Phase 3 PROTOSTAR study in 120 paediatric patients with moderate to severe plaque Pso and bridging pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 3 VOYAGE 1 and 2 studies in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque Pso.2,4,5,6,b,c In the PROTOSTAR study, the co-primary endpoints of Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75 and Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 were achieved at Week 16.2,d,e Approximately 76% of 41 patients receiving guselkumab achieved PASI 75, compared to 20% of 25 patients receiving placebo (p<0.001).2 At Week 16, 66% of patients receiving guselkumab compared to 16% of patients receiving placebo (p<0.001) achieved high levels of skin clearance (IGA score of 0/1).2 Nearly 40% of patients receiving guselkumab achieved complete clearance (IGA 0) at Week 16, compared to 4% on placebo (p<0.01).2 The safety profile for guselkumab subcutaneous injection in paediatric patients 6 to 17 years was consistent with the safety profile reported in the adult plaque psoriasis studies.1

“Guselkumab is the first fully-human dual-acting IL-23 inhibitor approved for the treatment of moderate to severe paediatric plaque psoriasis,1 marking an important step forward not only for children, but also for the parents and care givers who support them every day,” commented Mark Graham, Senior Director, Therapeutic Area Head, Immunology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine EMEA. “We’re steadfast in our commitment to advancing research that supports the long-term efficacy and safety profile of guselkumab, and to meet the unmet needs of adult and paediatric patients.”

This EC approval is an important milestone for patients and is emblematic of Johnson & Johnson’s continuous commitment to innovating to improve the lives of people living with chronic immune-mediated diseases. Guselkumab first received approval in the EU in November 2017 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Pso in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.1,7 In November 2020, guselkumab received EU approval for active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy.1,8 In 2025, guselkumab received EC approval for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s Disease (CD) in adults, which includes both an intravenous (IV) and a subcutaneous (SC) induction dosing option followed by SC maintenance dosing.1,9

Editor’s Notes:

Systemic therapy is prescription medicines which are aimed at those with varying degrees of psoriasis and psoriatic disease severity and work throughout the body. 10

PROTOSTAR is a Phase 3, multi-centre, randomised, placebo- and active comparator-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered guselkumab for the treatment of chronic plaque Pso in paediatric patients six years of age and older. 4

Data extrapolation is the process of estimating future trends or effects based on previous observations. With limited paediatric patients available for clinical trial inclusion, 11 researchers can extrapolate data from adult patient trials to determine the potential efficacy and tolerability of a treatment for the paediatric population.

researchers can extrapolate data from adult patient trials to determine the potential efficacy and tolerability of a treatment for the paediatric population. The PASI score grades the amount of surface area on each body region that is covered by psoriasis plaques and the severity of plaques for their redness, thickness and scaliness. PASI 75 means a 75% reduction in baseline PASI score. 12

[TITLE]Press Release: Sanofi and Regeneron’s Dupixent approved in Japan for children aged 6 to 11 years with bronchial asthma:
[TEXT]
Sanofi and Regeneron’s Dupixent approved in Japan for children aged 6 to 11 years with bronchial asthma

Approval based on global phase 3 program in children demonstrating Dupixent significantly reduced exacerbations (by 54% to 65%) and improved lung function compared to placebo (by 4.68% to 5.32%)

Dupixent is the first and only biologic medicine to demonstrate improved lung function in this young patient group in a randomized phase 3 study, and inhibits IL-4 and IL-13, two key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation

Paris and Tarrytown, NY, December 23, 2025. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan has granted marketing and manufacturing authorization for Dupixent (dupilumab) for the treatment of bronchial asthma in children aged 6 to 11 years with severe or refractory disease whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with existing therapy. This expands the previous approval in Japan in this indication for patients aged 12 years and older.

The approval in Japan is based on data from the overall population and those with a type 2 inflammation phenotype (defined by raised blood eosinophils and/or fractional exhaled nitric oxide) in VOYAGE (NCT02948959), a global phase 3 study evaluating Dupixent in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Additionally, data from EXCURSION (NCT03560466), an open-label extension of VOYAGE that included a sub-study of exclusively Japanese pediatric patients supported the approval. In the VOYAGE study, Dupixent added to standard-of-care asthma therapy significantly reduced severe exacerbations (by 54% to 65%, p<0.0001) and improved lung function (by 4.68% to 5.32%, p=0.0012, p=0.0009 and p=0.0036, respectively) in the overall population, those with type 2 inflammation , and those with raised blood eosinophils, compared to placebo. In the sub-study of Japanese pediatric patients, Dupixent improved lung function from baseline at 12 weeks and resulted in a low rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year. The treatment-related adverse events most commonly reported with Dupixent were injection site reactions (erythema, edema, and induration) in VOYAGE and fever, oral herpes, eosinophilia, and injection site reactions (erythema and induration) in EXCURSION.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Additionally, impaired lung function in young children can have potentially long-lasting impacts such as reduced lung growth and persistent airway obstruction, if not addressed early. Patients also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks. Uncontrolled asthma can interfere with day-to-day activities, like sleeping, attending school, and playing sports.

In addition to asthma, Dupixent is approved in Japan in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dupixent has been approved in 50 countries around the world for the treatment of asthma in children aged 6 to 11 years.

[TITLE]U.S. FDA Approves Agios’ AQVESME™ (mitapivat) for the Treatment of Anemia in Adults with Alpha- or Beta-Thalassemia:
[TEXT]
AQVESME is the only FDA-approved medicine for anemia in both non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia

Marketed under AQVESME brand name in the U.S. for thalassemia indication; PYRUKYND® (mitapivat) remains the U.S. brand name for PK deficiency indication

AQVESME expected to be available in late January 2026, following AQVESME REMS program implementation

Company will host investor conference call and webcast tomorrow, December 24 at 8:00 a.m. ET

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGIO), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering innovative medicines for patients with rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved AQVESME™ (mitapivat), an oral pyruvate kinase (PK) activator, for the treatment of anemia in adults with alpha- or beta-thalassemia. With this approved indication, AQVESME becomes the only FDA-approved medicine for anemia in both non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia.

“Thalassemia is a debilitating disease that demands lifelong management and vigilant monitoring for many life-threatening complications, such as blood clots, heart disease, and liver disease. Despite its severity, treatments have historically been limited, leaving some patients without any options,” said Hanny Al-Samkari, M.D., Peggy S. Blitz Endowed Chair in Hematology/Oncology at Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute, Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, and an investigator for the mitapivat thalassemia Phase 3 clinical program. “The ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T Phase 3 trial results demonstrate that AQVESME can help address anemia, fatigue, and the need for regular transfusions – key challenges of the disease. Today’s FDA approval represents an important step forward for individuals with thalassemia.”

The FDA approval of AQVESME in thalassemia is based on results from the global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T Phase 3 trials in adults with non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia, respectively. A total of 452 patients who are representative of the real-world thalassemia population were enrolled in the trials. The ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T Phase 3 trials met all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, demonstrating that AQVESME improves hemolytic anemia and a key quality-of-life measure compared to placebo, including significant reductions in transfusion burden and significant improvements in hemoglobin and fatigue.

“Today is a landmark moment for the thalassemia community, bringing forward an innovative, disease-modifying oral medicine to address the urgent needs of people living with this devastating rare blood disorder,” said Brian Goff, Chief Executive Officer, Agios. “With this approval, AQVESME becomes the only medicine indicated for the treatment of anemia in both non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia. We are deeply grateful to the patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, and advocacy partners who participated in and supported our clinical trials and helped ensure that our efforts reflected their priorities. Our focus now is on ensuring a successful launch and delivering meaningful impact for the community.”

“This year marks 100 years since thalassemia was first described in medical literature, and the progress we’ve made as a community is truly extraordinary,” said Ralph Colasanti, National President, Cooley’s Anemia Foundation. “Innovative medicines like AQVESME help make this progress possible, offering new hope to patients like me by helping to address the complex needs and challenges of this disease. This approval provides an important new treatment option for the thousands of adults living with thalassemia in the U.S., including those with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia who previously had no approved alternatives.”

In the ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T Phase 3 trials, five patients receiving AQVESME experienced adverse reactions suggestive of hepatocellular injury (HCI), with two of these patients requiring hospitalization. These adverse reactions occurred within the first six months of exposure, and liver tests improved upon discontinuation of AQVESME. To mitigate the risk of HCI, AQVESME is available only through the AQVESME REMS, a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program approved by the FDA. The AQVESME REMS program requires liver tests prior to the first AQVESME dose, every four weeks thereafter for 24 weeks, and then as clinically indicated. It also includes education and certification requirements for patients, prescribing physicians, and pharmacists, which are common components of REMS programs.

Due to the AQVESME REMS program, mitapivat will be marketed under the brand name AQVESME in the U.S. for the thalassemia indication. Mitapivat will continue to be marketed as PYRUKYND® (mitapivat) in the U.S. for the PK deficiency indication, which does not require a REMS program. Outside the U.S., mitapivat will continue to be marketed as PYRUKYND for its PK deficiency and thalassemia indications in regions where it is approved, and will retain this name upon approval in regions currently under regulatory review.

Agios expects AQVESME to be available in the U.S. in late January 2026, following implementation of the AQVESME REMS program.

[TITLE]Press Release: Sanofi’s Wayrilz approved in the EU as the first BTK inhibitor to treat immune thrombocytopenia:
[TEXT]
Sanofi’s Wayrilz approved in the EU as the first BTK inhibitor to treat immune thrombocytopenia

Novel treatment targets BTK through multi-immune modulation to help address the underlying causes of ITP

Approval based on the LUNA 3 phase 3 study that demonstrated rapid and durable platelet response and improvements in other ITP symptoms

ITP is a rare disease of complex immune dysregulation leading to lower platelet counts, bleeding, and reduced quality of life

Paris, December 23, 2025 – The European Commission has approved Wayrilz (rilzabrutinib), a novel, oral, reversible, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, as a new treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. This follows the positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

Wayrilz can help address the underlying causes of ITP through multi-immune modulation, targeting different pathways across the immune system.

“ITP is caused by complex immune system dysregulation leading to low platelet counts, bleeding and other often overlooked symptoms that can affect both physical and mental health, significantly impacting quality of life,” said Waleed Ghanima, MD, Head of Research and a Consultant Hematologist at Østfold Hospital, Norway. “The traditional approach to disease management focuses on restoring platelet counts and reducing bleeding risk, but patients may still experience other symptoms. Wayrilz offers a new approach, targeting the underlying cause of ITP through multi-immune modulation to help address the multi-faceted burden of this disease.”

“The approval of Wayrilz in the EU for the treatment of ITP underscores Sanofi’s commitment to leveraging our knowledge of the immune system to develop innovative treatments that make a meaningful impact on people living with rare and inflammatory diseases,” said Brian Foard, Executive Vice President, Head of Specialty Care at Sanofi. “Wayrilz has a differentiated mechanism of action, enabling multi-immune modulation to address the underlying pathology of ITP, allowing patients to benefit from an advanced treatment to help manage their disease.”

The EU approval of Wayrilz is based on the pivotal LUNA 3 phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04562766), in which Wayrilz met the primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating a positive impact on sustained platelet counts as well as other ITP symptoms.

The LUNA 3 phase 3 study, presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, and also published in Blood, evaluated the efficacy and safety of Wayrilz compared to placebo in adults (n=202) with persistent or chronic ITP. Patients who achieved platelet count response at 12 weeks were eligible to continue the full 24-week double-blind period (64% of patients in the Wayrilz arm and 32% of patients in the placebo arm). Patients receiving Wayrilz experienced the following compared to patients receiving placebo:

Statistically significant durable platelet response at week 25 (23% of patients in Wayrilz arm vs. 0% in placebo arm; p<0.0001)

Faster time to first platelet response (36 days in Wayrilz arm vs. not reached in placebo arm; p<0.0001)

Longer duration of platelet response (least square mean of 7 weeks in Wayrilz arm vs. 0.7 weeks in placebo arm)

Patients receiving Wayrilz reported an overall 10.6-point improvement in the overall quality of life domain compared to a 2.3-point increase in the placebo arm, based on The Immune Thrombocytopenia Patient Assessment Questionnaire, a clinical tool designed to measure ITP symptoms and impacts. The results of this analysis are descriptive and were not powered for statistical significance.

The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) are diarrhea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, and COVID-19.

Wayrilz has already been approved in the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and it is currently under regulatory review for ITP in Japan and China. It received fast track and orphan drug designations (ODD) in the US for ITP, with similar orphan designations in the EU and Japan. In other indications under investigation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Wayrilz ODD for three additional rare diseases, including warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA), IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), and sickle cell disease (SCD). Wayrilz also received FDA fast track designation and EU orphan designation in IgG4-RD.

Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 December 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Wegovy® pill (once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg) to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events*.

The Wegovy® pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial2. In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities1. The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy® 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial1. The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy® pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management.

“The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy® pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”.

Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025.

About the OASIS trial programme

OASIS was a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3 programme consisted of four trials, enrolling approximately 1,300 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.

OASIS 4 was a 64-week efficacy and safety phase 3b trial of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg versus placebo in 307 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.

About Wegovy®

Wegovy® is now approved as once-daily Wegovy® pill (semaglutide tablet 25 mg) and once-weekly Wegovy® injection (semaglutide injectable 2.4 mg) by the FDA. The approval of Wegovy® pill is based on a New Drug Application to reduce excess body weight in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical condition.

Wegovy® is approved as a once-weekly injection by the EMA and widely by other regulatory authorities. The Wegovy® pill is currently pending marketing approval from the EMA and other regulatory authorities.

Wegovy® is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults with obesity or overweight and in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, and approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Furthermore, Wegovy® injection is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older, and approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.

[TITLE]U.S. FDA Approves Agios’ AQVESME™ (mitapivat) for the Treatment of Anemia in Adults with Alpha- or Beta-Thalassemia:
[TEXT]
AQVESME is the only FDA-approved medicine for anemia in both non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia

Marketed under AQVESME brand name in the U.S. for thalassemia indication; PYRUKYND® (mitapivat) remains the U.S. brand name for PK deficiency indication

AQVESME expected to be available in late January 2026, following AQVESME REMS program implementation

Company will host investor conference call and webcast tomorrow, December 24 at 8:00 a.m. ET

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AGIO), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering innovative medicines for patients with rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved AQVESME™ (mitapivat), an oral pyruvate kinase (PK) activator, for the treatment of anemia in adults with alpha- or beta-thalassemia. With this approved indication, AQVESME becomes the only FDA-approved medicine for anemia in both non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia.

“Thalassemia is a debilitating disease that demands lifelong management and vigilant monitoring for many life-threatening complications, such as blood clots, heart disease, and liver disease. Despite its severity, treatments have historically been limited, leaving some patients without any options,” said Hanny Al-Samkari, M.D., Peggy S. Blitz Endowed Chair in Hematology/Oncology at Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute, Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, and an investigator for the mitapivat thalassemia Phase 3 clinical program. “The ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T Phase 3 trial results demonstrate that AQVESME can help address anemia, fatigue, and the need for regular transfusions – key challenges of the disease. Today’s FDA approval represents an important step forward for individuals with thalassemia.”

The FDA approval of AQVESME in thalassemia is based on results from the global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T Phase 3 trials in adults with non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia, respectively. A total of 452 patients who are representative of the real-world thalassemia population were enrolled in the trials. The ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T Phase 3 trials met all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, demonstrating that AQVESME improves hemolytic anemia and a key quality-of-life measure compared to placebo, including significant reductions in transfusion burden and significant improvements in hemoglobin and fatigue.

“Today is a landmark moment for the thalassemia community, bringing forward an innovative, disease-modifying oral medicine to address the urgent needs of people living with this devastating rare blood disorder,” said Brian Goff, Chief Executive Officer, Agios. “With this approval, AQVESME becomes the only medicine indicated for the treatment of anemia in both non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia. We are deeply grateful to the patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, and advocacy partners who participated in and supported our clinical trials and helped ensure that our efforts reflected their priorities. Our focus now is on ensuring a successful launch and delivering meaningful impact for the community.”

“This year marks 100 years since thalassemia was first described in medical literature, and the progress we’ve made as a community is truly extraordinary,” said Ralph Colasanti, National President, Cooley’s Anemia Foundation. “Innovative medicines like AQVESME help make this progress possible, offering new hope to patients like me by helping to address the complex needs and challenges of this disease. This approval provides an important new treatment option for the thousands of adults living with thalassemia in the U.S., including those with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia who previously had no approved alternatives.”

In the ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T Phase 3 trials, five patients receiving AQVESME experienced adverse reactions suggestive of hepatocellular injury (HCI), with two of these patients requiring hospitalization. These adverse reactions occurred within the first six months of exposure, and liver tests improved upon discontinuation of AQVESME. To mitigate the risk of HCI, AQVESME is available only through the AQVESME REMS, a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program approved by the FDA. The AQVESME REMS program requires liver tests prior to the first AQVESME dose, every four weeks thereafter for 24 weeks, and then as clinically indicated. It also includes education and certification requirements for patients, prescribing physicians, and pharmacists, which are common components of REMS programs.

Due to the AQVESME REMS program, mitapivat will be marketed under the brand name AQVESME in the U.S. for the thalassemia indication. Mitapivat will continue to be marketed as PYRUKYND® (mitapivat) in the U.S. for the PK deficiency indication, which does not require a REMS program. Outside the U.S., mitapivat will continue to be marketed as PYRUKYND for its PK deficiency and thalassemia indications in regions where it is approved, and will retain this name upon approval in regions currently under regulatory review.

Agios expects AQVESME to be available in the U.S. in late January 2026, following implementation of the AQVESME REMS program.

[TITLE]Press Release: Sanofi’s Wayrilz approved in the EU as the first BTK inhibitor to treat immune thrombocytopenia:
[TEXT]
Sanofi’s Wayrilz approved in the EU as the first BTK inhibitor to treat immune thrombocytopenia

Novel treatment targets BTK through multi-immune modulation to help address the underlying causes of ITP

Approval based on the LUNA 3 phase 3 study that demonstrated rapid and durable platelet response and improvements in other ITP symptoms

ITP is a rare disease of complex immune dysregulation leading to lower platelet counts, bleeding, and reduced quality of life

Paris, December 23, 2025 – The European Commission has approved Wayrilz (rilzabrutinib), a novel, oral, reversible, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, as a new treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. This follows the positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

Wayrilz can help address the underlying causes of ITP through multi-immune modulation, targeting different pathways across the immune system.

“ITP is caused by complex immune system dysregulation leading to low platelet counts, bleeding and other often overlooked symptoms that can affect both physical and mental health, significantly impacting quality of life,” said Waleed Ghanima, MD, Head of Research and a Consultant Hematologist at Østfold Hospital, Norway. “The traditional approach to disease management focuses on restoring platelet counts and reducing bleeding risk, but patients may still experience other symptoms. Wayrilz offers a new approach, targeting the underlying cause of ITP through multi-immune modulation to help address the multi-faceted burden of this disease.”

“The approval of Wayrilz in the EU for the treatment of ITP underscores Sanofi’s commitment to leveraging our knowledge of the immune system to develop innovative treatments that make a meaningful impact on people living with rare and inflammatory diseases,” said Brian Foard, Executive Vice President, Head of Specialty Care at Sanofi. “Wayrilz has a differentiated mechanism of action, enabling multi-immune modulation to address the underlying pathology of ITP, allowing patients to benefit from an advanced treatment to help manage their disease.”

The EU approval of Wayrilz is based on the pivotal LUNA 3 phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04562766), in which Wayrilz met the primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating a positive impact on sustained platelet counts as well as other ITP symptoms.

The LUNA 3 phase 3 study, presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, and also published in Blood, evaluated the efficacy and safety of Wayrilz compared to placebo in adults (n=202) with persistent or chronic ITP. Patients who achieved platelet count response at 12 weeks were eligible to continue the full 24-week double-blind period (64% of patients in the Wayrilz arm and 32% of patients in the placebo arm). Patients receiving Wayrilz experienced the following compared to patients receiving placebo:

Statistically significant durable platelet response at week 25 (23% of patients in Wayrilz arm vs. 0% in placebo arm; p<0.0001)

Faster time to first platelet response (36 days in Wayrilz arm vs. not reached in placebo arm; p<0.0001)

Longer duration of platelet response (least square mean of 7 weeks in Wayrilz arm vs. 0.7 weeks in placebo arm)

Patients receiving Wayrilz reported an overall 10.6-point improvement in the overall quality of life domain compared to a 2.3-point increase in the placebo arm, based on The Immune Thrombocytopenia Patient Assessment Questionnaire, a clinical tool designed to measure ITP symptoms and impacts. The results of this analysis are descriptive and were not powered for statistical significance.

The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) are diarrhea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, and COVID-19.

Wayrilz has already been approved in the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and it is currently under regulatory review for ITP in Japan and China. It received fast track and orphan drug designations (ODD) in the US for ITP, with similar orphan designations in the EU and Japan. In other indications under investigation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Wayrilz ODD for three additional rare diseases, including warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA), IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), and sickle cell disease (SCD). Wayrilz also received FDA fast track designation and EU orphan designation in IgG4-RD.
