[TITLE]Federal Realty Buys Maryland Retail Plaza for $187M:
[TEXT]
One of the nation’s oldest real estate investment trusts has acquired an open-air retail plaza in eastern Maryland, the latest firm to snag a substantial property amid the retail’s resurgence.

North Bethesda, Md.-based Federal Realty Investment Trust, founded in 1962, has paid $187 million for the retail portion of the mixed-use Annapolis Town Center, a 480,000-square-foot shopping center in Annapolis. PGIM Real Estate sold the complex, which is anchored by Whole Foods alongside fellow tenants such as Anthropologie, Sephora, Restoration Hardware, and Williams Sonoma.

“This is exactly the kind of opportunity we target: a dominant asset with strong fundamentals, competitive positioning, and the potential to unlock further value under our ownership,” Don Wood, Federal Realty president and CEO, said in a statement.

Federal Realty’s new property is just a portion of the 2 million-square-foot Annapolis Town Center, developed in 2008 at 1906 Towne Centre Boulevard by Greenberg Gibbons. PGIM acquired the mixed-use complex in 2018, though earlier this year it opted to sell the property’s multifamily component — two buildings totaling more than 400 units — to Peterson Companies for $160 million.

Federal Realty joins other investment firms acquiring Maryland malls in the past 12 months, though under widely varying circumstances.

In November, Spinoso Real Estate Group paid $190 million for the 1.2 million-square-foot White Marsh Mall near Baltimore. Spinoso had been the mall’s court-appointed receiver for about a year at the time, owing to financial distress from former owner Brookfield.

European mall giant Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW) meanwhile has faced its own distress with Westfield Wheaton, a 1.7 million-square-foot plaza on the northern outskirts of Washington, D.C. The mall was transferred to special servicing in April after URW failed to meet its March debt maturity, and the company has reportedly opted to sell following a meager $166 million appraisal in August, Bisnow reported at the time.

[TITLE]U.S. Semaglutide Market Trends and Investment Strategies 2025-2033: Retail Pharmacies Play Key Role in Distribution Amid Growing Demand:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "United States Semaglutide Market Report by Product, Application, Distribution Channel, States and Company Analysis, 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The United States Semaglutide Market is expected to expand from US$ 8.17 Billion in 2024 to US$ 17.29 Billion in 2033 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.68% during 2025-2033. The growth is fueled by rising awareness regarding obesity control, increasing incidence of diabetes, and expanded use of novel therapies. Expansion of the market signifies a high demand for successful weight loss and diabetic control treatments.

Growth Drivers in United States Semaglutide Market

Increased Incidence of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes

The United States has witnessed a shocking increase in obesity and type 2 diabetes, making semaglutide therapies essential for disease management. Almost half of the American adults are obese, and diabetes strikes millions of people across the country. Semaglutide, under the brands Ozempic and Wegovy, treats both conditions by enhancing glycemic control as well as causing substantial weight loss. Its dual therapeutic value has made it a physician and patient favorite. The growing load of chronic diseases also taxes the health expenditure, necessitating efficient interventions to keep long-term complications at bay.

As lifestyle disorders gain traction, semaglutide use is gaining momentum in the U.S. healthcare system. Its increasing disease prevalence guarantees long-term demand and ranks it as one of the key drivers of growth in the market. The rampant health care and economic expenditures will be just as widespread, with more than 260 million individuals in the USA, more than a third of all children and adolescents, projected to be living with overweight or obesity by 2050. United action and swift investments must be made to change these ominous trajectories and provide an improved future for existing as well as future generations.

Increasing Applications in Weight Management

Though semaglutide was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, its ability to aid in weight loss has expanded its use. Clinical trials have confirmed significant weight loss in patients taking semaglutide, and thus, it has been widely used to treat obesity. The FDA approval of Wegovy to treat chronic weight also opened up the drug's potential market to not just diabetic patients but to those with obesity-related illnesses. Increased education on obesity as a medical condition that needs treatment has further fueled demand. Insurers and employers are also realizing the economic benefits of providing weight-loss treatments, increasing semaglutide access.

Strong Physician and Patient Acceptance

Physician and patient acceptance has been a primary driver of semaglutide growth in the U.S. Physicians prefer to prescribe semaglutide because of its better clinical outcomes over older GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients gain from both enhanced glycemic control and significant weight loss, promoting increased adherence and satisfaction. The weekly injection regimen also increases convenience, lessening treatment fatigue and improving compliance.

Extensive media exposure to semaglutide as a "game-changer" medication has also driven consumer demand, especially for weight management. The strong brand reputation of drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy has fostered intense brand loyalty in the market. As more patients and healthcare providers recognize its clinical effectiveness and lifestyle benefits, semaglutide continues to see rapid adoption. This positive reception across stakeholders strongly contributes to its ongoing market growth in the U.S.

Challenges in the United States Semaglutide Market

High Cost and Limited Insurance Coverage

Despite its clinical success, the high cost of semaglutide remains a barrier to widespread adoption. Monthly treatment costs are substantial, sometimes several hundred dollars without insurance. Though numerous insurance programs cover semaglutide for the treatment of diabetes, obesity coverage is not consistent. Patients trying Wegovy for weight control frequently must pay out of pocket, which restricts accessibility. The cost detours long-term use, especially for lower-income groups.

Employers and insurers are starting to consider coverage because of the long-term healthcare cost savings that come with treating obesity, but take-up is sluggish. Without wider insurance coverage, affordability continues to be an issue for patients and a stumbling block to increasing market penetration. Price sensitivity in the U.S. healthcare system continues to limit semaglutide's potential despite the high level of demand.

Supply Shortages and Manufacturing Constraints

Another significant issue in the U.S. semaglutide market is chronic supply shortages due to excessive demand and manufacturing constraints. Soaring prescriptions for diabetes and obesity therapy have taxed manufacturing capacities, resulting in periodic stockouts. Patients usually find it difficult to receive regular supplies, interrupting treatment continuity and reducing satisfaction. Production of intricate biologics such as semaglutide is sophisticated and increasing production to match increasing demand is capital-intensive.

These supply concerns also impact healthcare providers, who experience challenges in managing patient expectation and treatment timelines. Although manufacturers are undertaking capacity additions, demand remains ahead of supply, leading to market volatility. Addressing the supply chain difficulties will be essential to providing stable access and achieving long-run market growth in the United States.

[TITLE]Can the Golden Age of Costco Last?:
[TEXT]
Growing up involves learning that certain things are specific to your family, and certain things are more like general conditions; Costco clearly falls into the latter category. Still, being a child of California in the eighties and nineties offered a front-row seat to the rise of a retail juggernaut. Costco opened its first location in Seattle in 1983; five years later, it had some fifty stores, concentrated on the West Coast; today, there are more than nine hundred Costco warehouses around the world. (Seventy-one per cent of the population of Iceland are members, according to one survey.) Worldwide, in terms of revenue, only Amazon and Walmart are larger retailers. The Kirkland label, introduced in 1995, now generates more revenue than Nike.

But what exactly makes Costco Costco? This is a question that interests Maggie Perkins, a corporate trainer at the company who travels the country to instruct employees in its ways. Perkins posts about her job on TikTok, and she has noticed something in people’s replies: “They say ‘my Costco.’ ” The loyalty of Costco’s following—at latest count, it had a hundred and forty-five million members globally—is an existential matter for the company. “The most important item we sell is the membership card,” Ron Vachris, the current C.E.O., has said. The company’s low prices are possible because membership fees account for much of the profits. “For Costco, culture is a business strategy,” Perkins told me. Its success requires being a place where people want to belong—and, for all Costco’s hard-nosed pursuit of low prices and high quality, such a desire has rested on an elusive sense of the company as a force for good in the world. But that world and its values seem more fragile than they used to. “As the global landscape changes,” Perkins said, “as retailers change, as the way that people do business changes, if Costco’s culture changes in a way that consumers do not appreciate, then Costco could lose who it is.”

Costco as we know it would not exist without Sol Price, the prickly, brilliant lawyer turned businessman behind the pioneering retail chains FedMart and Price Club. FedMart, founded in 1954, helped to establish discount shopping as a pillar of American retail, and in 1976 Price Club invented the warehouse wholesale club. Walmart’s co-founder Sam Walton has written, “I guess I’ve stolen—I actually prefer the word ‘borrowed’—as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business.” Price, who died in 2009, was once asked how it felt to be the father of an industry. He replied that he should have worn a condom.

Sinegal, Costco’s co-founder, tells this story in his foreword to “Sol Price: Retail Revolutionary and Social Innovator,” a 2012 biography written by Price’s eldest son, Robert. Price was born in 1916 to labor-socialist Russian Jewish immigrants in the Bronx. After his father received a diagnosis of tuberculosis, the family ended up in San Diego. When Price arrived there, in 1929, he was a thirteen-year-old tenth grader (he’d skipped two grades) who had decided to become a lawyer after following the Scopes trial. He attended law school at the University of Southern California and started practicing in San Diego. Then, in the early fifties, one of his clients told him about an interesting new store in Los Angeles called Fedco. A nonprofit, it was open only to federal employees, who paid a small fee to become members—an arrangement that circumvented laws at the time which allowed manufacturers to set minimum retail prices for their goods. Drawn by the low prices, some five thousand people from San Diego, the client had heard, were making the more than two-hundred-mile round trip to L.A. to shop.

Price and a few associates thought that San Diego could use a Fedco of its own. The Second World War had transformed the city from a quiet coastal town into a major military hub; the population was booming with federal employees. Fedco declined to participate, so Price’s group proceeded on its own, under the name FedMart. Its first store, situated in an industrial building near San Diego’s tuna canneries, opened in November of 1954 and sold, among other things, appliances, clothing, and liquor. Any military or government employee could pay two dollars for a lifetime membership. FedMart was an immediate hit, and Price became the company’s president. Soon, the store began offering gas, prescription drugs, and groceries, starting with Planters peanuts.

[TITLE]Why L’Oréal’s Deal With Kering Beauty Is a Category Game-changer:
[TEXT]
Kering and L’Oréal have made it official: The two French giants announced that they are forming a long-term strategic partnership in beauty and wellness.

In a joint announcement, the companies said the binding agreement encompasses the acquisition of the House of Creed by L’Oréal, and gives L’Oréal the rights to enter into a 50-year exclusive license for the creation, development and distribution of fragrance and beauty products for Gucci, commencing after the expiration of Kering’s current license with Coty for that business.

Kering acquired Creed, the oldest existing high-end niche fragrance house, in June 2023 in a blockbuster deal estimated at between high 2 billion euros to 3.5 billion euros.

The partnership will also include 50-year exclusive licenses for Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, which will start at the close of the transaction. These will join other designer fragrance brands already in the L’Oréal Luxe division, which includes Yves Saint Laurent (a Kering brand), Armani, Valentino, Prada, Miu Miu, Jacquemus, Mugler, Azzaro, Maison Margiela, Viktor & Rolf, Ralph Lauren, Diesel and Cacharel.

The 50/50 joint venture agreement is valued at 4 billion euros, payable in cash at the closing, which is expected to take place in the first half of 2026. L’Oréal will also pay royalties to Kering for the use of its licensed brands.

Beyond beauty, the companies said they are joining forces to explore business opportunities at the intersection of luxury, wellness and longevity.

“This strategic alliance marks a decisive step for Kering,” said chief executive officer Luca de Meo in a statement. “Joining forces with the global leader in beauty, we will accelerate the development of fragrance and cosmetics for our major houses, allowing them to achieve scale in this category and unlock their immense long-term potential.”

For his part L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said, “I am delighted to forge this long-term alliance with one of the world’s most prestigious, creative and visionary luxury groups. The addition of these brands significantly expands our reach into new, dynamic segments of luxury beauty. Through Creed, we will establish ourselves as one of the leading players in the fast-growing niche market.”

“This is a real game-changer. It is earth-shattering,” said an industry expert of the L’Oréal-Kering Beauty deal. “It has implications for everyone.”

For Kering, it will provide a much-needed injection of cash to reinvest in its struggling brands, and is a bold move by de Meo, who took the reins in September and has wasted no time in making changes. In addition to a deal for the beauty, industry sources indicate he is also looking to shed the company’s eyewear business. Both were key pillars of the strategy implemented by former CEO François-Henri Pinault, who seems to be abiding by his pledge to give de Meo free rein in executing his own vision even as Pinault remains company chairman.

“To build a beauty company takes a lot of time, and it’s very different from fashion, even though there are synergies on the brand side,” said Laurent Droin, a partner and investor in Felix Capital.

“For L’Oréal, it makes a lot of sense, because it’s a unique opportunity to acquire a real luxury beauty portfolio,” he added. “This makes sense for both parties.”

Many insiders predict the deal could reshape not only the market’s landscape, but also force some company and brand marriages that were not on the horizon otherwise.

A deal could be pivotal for midsize beauty brands held by private equity concerns, which had been banking on L’Oréal to acquire them as other major beauty groups struggle to find their footing.

With this deal, L’Oréal is significantly bolstering its position in perfumes — the beauty market’s largest category driver over the past six years, since the coronavirus pandemic began. Within that, niche fragrances are the strongest segment.

Overall, the worldwide fragrance market is highly fragmented and large — expected to generate sales of $62.11 billion this year, according to Statista. The category’s growth might be mitigating currently, but its outlook remains strong. This in part is due to fragrances’ expanding scope that is morphing, moving into new geographies such as Asia and the well-being sector with functional attributes.

Fashion fragrances, which sell particularly well in the West, are increasingly serving as launchpads for fashion-branded makeup, an increasingly hot category in the East.

Many industry analysts weren’t surprised that Kering is abandoning its efforts to build a beauty business on its own. “Kering spent 3 billion euros on Creed and they are selling everything for 4 billion — the value destruction is incredible,” said one insider. “It’s very tough for these firms to take beauty in-house. Burberry tried it a few years ago and Coty picked up the beauty business because they realized they couldn’t do it. Kering is the same.”

As it is, the deal will almost certainly have implications for the major players in the category, including Coty Inc., the Estée Lauder Cos., Puig and Interparfums.

“It puts more pressure on everyone,” Droin said.

The move comes at a time of great change in beauty. As first reported by WWD in June, Coty’s future remains uncertain as the company explores potential sell-offs of its luxury and consumer divisions, according to industry sources.

Coty’s Luxury division includes fragrance brands such as Gucci, Burberry, Jil Sander and Hugo Boss. If L’Oréal acquires Kering Beauty and Coty does look to divest its prestige fragrance holdings ultimately, it could intensify the scramble to take over those brands.

Meanwhile, the Estée Lauder Cos. is increasingly leaning into its perfume activity. Last week, its CEO Stéphane de La Faverie said fragrance is the future of the group, as it inaugurated La Maison des Parfums, a prospective innovation arm for perfume, in central Paris. That is meant to accelerate its fragrance business around the world.

Puig was in the running to acquire Kering Beauty, according to an industry source. A Puig spokeswoman could not be reached for comment Sunday.

Already a number of fragrance licenses held by Puig — such as Valentino, Prada and Miu Miu — have migrated to L’Oréal.

Questions remain

[TITLE]Singles Day: China's biggest shopping event starts five weeks early to revive spending:
[TEXT]
China's biggest shopping event starts five weeks early to revive spending

5 days ago Share Save Osmond Chia Business reporter Share Save

Getty Images Chinese consumers have adopted more cautious spending habits in recent years

It's known to be China's biggest online shopping event - taking place on 11 November each year. But this year, Single's Day sales have already begun in mid-October, as part of efforts by Chinese retailers to boost spending in a sluggish market. China has been plagued with issues like growing youth unemployment , a prolonged property crisis, steep government debt and an ongoing trade war with the US - all of which is making the country's consumers cut back on spending. The Chinese government has been spending billions - through family subsidies, more wages and discounts for consumer goods in a bid to counter this, but retail sales growth is still failing to meet expectations.

Originally created by Alibaba as a Chinese shopping festival, Singles' Day is akin to Amazon's Prime Day or Black Friday promotions elsewhere in the world. A major revenue driver in the final quarter of the year, the event is marked with deep discounts online and in stores, with most retailers in the country competing for sales. Over the years, the sales window has evolved from a single day to one of the year's biggest shopping events, often ushered in with extravagant opening events featuring popstars like Jessie J. But this year, retailers launched their sales campaigns in October, coinciding with the end of China's Golden Week holiday. Platforms like Taobao, JD.com and Douyin are actively promoting "11.11" sales, with banners on their apps showing discounts and vouchers. Alibaba, which runs e-commerce platforms Taobao, Tmall and AliExpress, said in its newshub that it is kicking off this year's "11.11 Global Shopping Festival" on 15 October. The firm is also tapping artificial intelligence in its search and recommendation tools to make it easier for shoppers to navigate its sprawling sites and suggest relevant products.

[TITLE]Global hunger crisis deepens as UN food agency hit with severe funding cuts:
[TEXT]
Close to 14 million people risk extreme hunger as a result of deep funding cuts from top donors, warned the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) on Wednesday (Oct 15).

Funding at WFP – traditionally the UN’s most funded agency – is set to fall 40 per cent this year, cutting its budget to US$6.4 billion.

While the United States remains WFP’s largest donor, it has slashed contributions by nearly US$3 billion as part of a slew of foreign aid cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration. Other major nations have also pulled back.

WFP’s report warned that cuts to its food assistance could push 13.7 million people in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan from "crisis" to "emergency" levels of hunger – one step away from famine in a five-level international hunger scale.

Food aid is reaching less than 10 per cent of those in need in Afghanistan as winter approaches, said the agency.

It also said famine has already been declared in Sudan and Gaza, where wars have raged for over two years.

The global agency’s report comes ahead of next month’s COP30 climate conference in Brazil’s Belem city, close to the Amazon rainforest, where leaders are expected to make food systems central to climate action.

WHY ARE ASIA’S TOP EXPORTERS STRUGGLING?

Asia’s top food exporters, including Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, are also struggling with hunger and malnutrition at home.

For example, India – one of the largest food exporters on the planet – is also home to about 172 million undernourished people. Child malnutrition rates there are among the highest in the world.

[TITLE]Gold glitters online as festive shoppers turn to e-commerce, quick commerce platforms for auspicious buys:
[TEXT]
Luxury and prosperity are shining bright this festive season, with online platforms like Amazon and BigBasket witnessing record demand for gold, silver, and fine jewellery purchases ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras.

Premium fashion on Amazon Fashion and Beauty has seen a sharp uptick, led by fine jewellery and luxury watches.

“This festive season, premium fashion is seeing remarkable growth, with luxury watches and gold and diamond jewellery — including lab-grown diamonds — driving demand,” said Siddharth Bhagat, Director, Amazon Fashion and Beauty, India.

Amazon reported a 96% year-on-year surge in gold jewellery sales, driven by brands such as CaratLane, PN Gadgil Jewellers, Joyalukkas, PC Chandra, KISNA, and Malabar Gold & Diamonds. The platform now offers more than five lakh styles across silver, gold, and diamond jewellery, making it the largest fine jewellery destination among online marketplaces.

Bhagat said the company is also seeing strong traction in affordable fine jewellery — with customers buying pieces starting at ₹2,000 for silver and up to ₹40,000 for gold and diamond. Demand for 14K daily-wear jewellery has grown 50 per cent year-on-year, while 18K styles are also gaining popularity.

In line with global trends, Amazon has expanded into lab-grown diamonds, offering jewellery starting at ₹1,699 across more than 50,000 styles. “Amazon is the first and only online marketplace focusing on this whitespace,” Bhagat said.

Gold coins remain a festive favourite, with the most purchased denomination being 2 grams. “Customers continue to prefer Amazon for their auspicious purchases of gold and silver coins during Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras and more,” Bhagat added.

Complementing this, Tata-owned bigbasket also recorded a strong Dhanteras, with gold coin sales rising 146 per cent and silver coins up 234 per cent from last year. Demand for pooja essentials — including diyas, flowers, and festive décor — grew 54 per cent year-on-year.

“Dhanteras is a time for prosperity, devotion, and togetherness. This year, bigbasket ensured our customers could celebrate without compromise, whether it was purchasing auspicious coins or getting the perfect gifts and pooja items in minutes,” said Seshu Kumar, Chief Buying and Merchandising Officer, bigbasket.

With 10-minute delivery and curated festive assortments, bigbasket blended technology and tradition, meeting last-minute festive needs — from auspicious buys to celebratory gifting.

Both platforms are capitalising on India’s accelerating shift toward online festive shopping, where authenticity, convenience, and trust are emerging as the new hallmarks of prosperity.
