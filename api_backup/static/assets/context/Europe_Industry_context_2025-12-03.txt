[TITLE]Lead-Acid Battery Scrap Market to Witness 10.21% CAGR Through 2025-2030 Led by Johnson Controls, Exide Technologies, East Penn Manufacturing, GS Yuasa International, and Battery Solutions:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Lead-Acid Battery Scrap Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Lead-Acid Battery Scrap Market, valued at USD 16.52 Billion in 2024, is projected to experience a CAGR of 10.21% to reach USD 29.60 Billion by 2030. Market expansion is primarily driven by increasing environmental regulations mandating responsible disposal and recycling practices.

Key Market Drivers

The Global Lead-Acid Battery Scrap Market is significantly propelled by two primary factors: increased environmental regulations and sustainability mandates, alongside the high economic value and recyclability of lead. Heightened governmental and industry-specific regulations globally enforce responsible disposal and recycling practices for lead-acid batteries, thereby stimulating the scrap market.

This regulatory pressure ensures a consistent flow of end-of-life batteries into the recycling stream. For example, according to Battery Council International's National Recycling Rate Study, released in July 2023, the U.S. lead battery industry achieved an outstanding recycling rate of 99%, the highest of any consumer product in the United States, largely sustained by its robust closed-loop system.

Key Market Challenges

A significant challenge impeding the growth of the Global Lead-Acid Battery Scrap Market is the considerable capital expenditure required for establishing and maintaining advanced recycling facilities.

This financial barrier directly restricts investment in state-of-the-art processing technologies and robust collection infrastructure. Such substantial upfront costs deter potential new market entrants and slow the expansion plans of existing recycling operations. Consequently, the ability to scale up efficient and environmentally compliant lead-acid battery recycling capacity worldwide is constrained.

According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, global refined lead production was forecast to increase by 2.7% to 12.8 million tons in 2023, with consumption also projected to rise by 1.1% to 12.8 million tons. This modest growth in production, despite ongoing demand, underscores the impact of high investment costs in limiting the development of new recycling plants and upgrading existing ones to meet stringent environmental standards and increasing volumes of end-of-life batteries. This sustained requirement for substantial capital outlays slows the overall development of a comprehensive and efficient global recycling ecosystem.

Key Market Trends

The adoption of advanced recycling technologies represents a pivotal trend enhancing material recovery and environmental performance. These innovations move beyond conventional methods to extract valuable components with greater precision and reduced ecological impact.

According to the European Commission's Batteries Regulation, which became effective in 2023, ambitious recycling efficiency targets for lead-acid batteries are set at 75% by December 2025 and 80% by December 2030, necessitating continuous technological upgrades to meet these benchmarks. The industry continues to pursue new techniques for processing battery scrap, minimizing waste, and improving the purity of recovered lead and other materials.

In brief A Bonk ETP has begun trading on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, issued by Bitcoin Capital.

The product lets retail and institutional investors access Solana-based meme coin BONK through standard brokerage platforms.

BONK is currently the seventh-largest meme coin by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Solana-based meme coin Bonk (BONK) has begun trading on Switzerland's third-largest stock exchange, through a newly launched exchange traded product, adding another regulated crypto offering to Europe's expanding digital asset market.

Swiss-based crypto ETP issuer Bitcoin Capital issued the BONK ETP on SIX Swiss Exchange, allowing investors to gain exposure to the token through traditional brokerage accounts, according to an announcement shared with Decrypt.

As a subsidiary of Swiss asset-management boutique FiCAS AG, Bitcoin Capital launched the world's first actively managed Bitcoin ETP in 2020.

Switzerland's regulatory framework and market infrastructure for admitting crypto ETPs made it the “preferred venue for the launching a BONK ETP,” Marcel Niederberger, Chief Executive Officer at Bitcoin Capital & FiCAS told Decrypt.

"Europe, and specifically the SIX Swiss Exchange offers a highly developed regulatory environment with consistent supervisory practices," he said.

“The product will reach both institutional and retail investors through established broker platforms,” Niederberger said, noting that regulated ETP access tends to boost investor confidence and liquidity, with most inflows across Bitcoin Capital’s existing products still coming from institutional desks.

He anticipates “continued expansion of regulated products referencing BONK” next year, as maturing European infrastructure and rising appetite for thematic digital assets open the door to “additional ETPs and structured notes.”

BONK sits near $0.0599, up 3.5% on the day, ranking as the seventh-largest meme coin by market value per CoinGecko data.

﻿

Dogecoin leads activity

The Bonk listing follows a surge of meme coin products entering regulated markets mainly in the United States, dominated by Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market cap.

In September, the Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF became the first U.S. fund to hold DOGE, while asset manager Grayscale launched its spot GDOG product last week, generating approximately $1.4 million in first-day trading volume.

REX Shares also filed for a BONK ETF in January, alongside other meme coin products.

Meanwhile, 21Shares unveiled a 2x leveraged Dogecoin ETF on the Nasdaq last week, while Bitwise's Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, received approval from NYSE Arca on Tuesday for listing and registration.

[TITLE]Republican Socialism: Trump Is Taking Federal Stakes in Private Companies:
[TEXT]
One danger of nationalism, Friedrich Hayek warned in 1960, was the "bridge" it provides "from conservatism to collectivism."

"To think in terms of 'our' industry or resource," he wrote, "is only a short step away from demanding that these national assets be directed in the national interest."

That's a short step that President Donald Trump has eagerly taken. In the first nine months of his second term in office, the president has overseen a giant government leap into the boardrooms of strategically important businesses.

In June, Trump demanded (and the federal government received) a so-called golden share in U.S. Steel, which effectively gives the White House veto power over much of the company's future. Two months later, the Trump administration purchased a 10 percent equity stake in Intel, the once-dominant and recently struggling American chipmaker. Similar stakes in at least four other companies followed, including ones that produce nuclear power or mine metals such as lithium and copper that are necessary for building high-tech chips and advanced batteries.

Even in light of the administration's other intrusions into the free market—hiking tariffs on nearly all imports, applying ideological conditions on media companies' proposed mergers, and the like—this has been a breathtaking turn of events. Trump and his top officials have signaled that they are only getting started. In August he told reporters "I want to try and get as much as I can."

What makes these maneuvers stand out from other federal efforts at subsidizing, regulating, and controlling corporate decision making is the administration's unmistakable nationalist tone and the lack of any major crisis as an inciting incident. Unlike, say, the auto bailouts during the Obama administration, the Trump White House is not framing these corporate invasions as temporary or unusual. The Intel deal is

[TITLE]Biomass Gasification Industry Report 2025: A $145.75+ Billion Market by 2030, Driven by Carbon-Reduction Regulations, Abundant Feedstock Availability, and Rising Energy-Security Demand:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Biomass Gasification Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Biomass Gasification Market, valued at USD 90.75 Billion in 2024, is projected to experience a CAGR of 8.22% to reach USD 145.78 Billion by 2030. Biomass gasification is a thermochemical conversion process that transforms organic materials, such as agricultural residues and forestry waste, into a combustible synthetic gas known as syngas, utilized for energy generation and chemical production.

The market's expansion is fundamentally driven by global efforts to reduce carbon emissions through stringent regulations, the abundant availability of diverse biomass feedstocks, and increasing demand for energy security.

Key Market Drivers

Stringent environmental regulations and ambitious decarbonization goals represent a primary catalyst for the Global Biomass Gasification Market. Governments worldwide are implementing policies designed to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition towards cleaner energy sources. For instance, according to Directive (EU) 2023/2413 of the European Parliament and of the Council, published in October 2023, the European Union established a binding target of at least 42.5% for renewable energy in its gross final consumption by 2030, replacing the prior 32% objective. This regulatory push directly incentivizes the adoption of biomass gasification as a viable technology for generating low-carbon energy and contributing to national and international environmental commitments.

Key Market Challenges

The substantial initial capital investment required for the construction and maintenance of biomass gasification facilities presents a significant impediment to market growth. This high financial outlay directly impacts the market by deterring potential investors who perceive elevated financial risks and extended payback periods. Consequently, it limits the scalability of new projects and restricts broader market penetration, particularly in regions where access to large-scale financing is challenging. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, total installed costs for bioenergy increased by 16% between 2023 and 2024, exacerbating this investment hurdle.

Key Market Trends

Technological advancements in gasifier efficiency and cost reduction represent a significant trend enhancing the economic competitiveness of biomass gasification. These innovations improve design, materials, and operational controls to optimize syngas yield and reduce both capital and operational expenditures. Research published in the MDPI journal in May 2023 indicated that specific investments in liquid biofuel production plants employing gasification technologies demonstrated the highest decreasing trend over time.

This directly mitigates the challenge of high initial investment. Illustrating this commitment, Valmet Corporation announced a EUR 45 million investment in November 2024 for advanced gasification technology development, targeting improved tar reduction and enhanced synthetic gas quality for chemical synthesis applications. This investment underscores the industry's drive for performance optimization and reduced processing costs.

[TITLE]Private Equity Pours $1.45 Billion Into UK Renewable Energy:
[TEXT]
UK energy company Low Carbon has raised as much as $1.45 billion (£1.1 billion) from CVC Capital Partners and other investors as private equity firms are increasingly backing renewables operations.

CVC Capital Partners and Low Carbon’s existing shareholder Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company participated in the funding, which will see CVC Capital Partners become the majority owner of Low Carbon, a company developing and operating solar, wind, and energy storage projects in the UK and Europe.

“As a private markets company, we’re clearly looking for attractive risk returns through cycles,” Caine Bouwmeester, partner and head of renewable energy at CVC DIF, told Bloomberg in an interview published on Monday.

“From our perspective, it’s quite an attractive entry point in the market,” said the head of renewable energy at CVC’s infrastructure arm.

The CVC deal with Low Carbon is the latest in a series of major deals that private equity has struck with renewable project developers in recent months.

In early November, Apollo-managed funds agreed to invest $6.5 billion to buy a 50% stake in the Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm of Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer. The $6.5 billion investment includes the acquisition price for a 50% interest in the joint venture holding Hornsea 3, the world’s largest offshore wind project, and a commitment to fund 50% of the project’s remaining construction costs.

Hornsea 3 is Ørsted’s third gigawatt-scale project in the North Sea’s Hornsea zone and upon completion it will have a capacity of 2.9 GW – enough power to generate low-cost, renewable electricity for more than 3 million UK households.

Ørsted has embarked on a partnership and divestment program, a cornerstone of its business plan, as it seeks to turn around its offshore wind business that has been hit by regulatory changes, cost inflation, and high interest rates. Ørsted earlier this year turned to its existing shareholders to raise capital to cover immediate financing needs, manage risks from regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., and strengthen its capital structure.

[TITLE]Rare earth magnet sops to lift India’s EV, chip plans: Industry:
[TEXT]
The Union Cabinet’s approval of a Rs 7,280 crore scheme to promote manufacturing of sintered rare earth permanent magnets ( REPM ) will help address a crucial missing link in India’s electric vehicle (EV) and chip supply chains, electronics and semiconductor industry executives said.The programme aims to create 6,000 metric tonnes per annum of integrated REPM capacity through five globally bid projects, backed by sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy over a seven-year period.Under the scheme, India will, for the first time, support end-to-end REPM manufacturing, from rare earth oxides to metals, alloys and finished magnets, in order to cut import dependence and serve fast-growing demand from EVs, renewables, industrial electronics and defence.The government has earmarked Rs 6,450 crore for sales-linked incentives over five years and Rs 750 crore as capital support to set up the targeted 6,000 metric tonnes per annum capacity, with each of the five selected players expected to get up to 1,200 metric tonnes per annum.Officials expect India’s REPM consumption to roughly double between 2025 and 2030, driven primarily by EVs and clean energy, making domestic capacity critical to supply chain security and the country’s Net Zero 2070 roadmap.The scheme’s seven-year timeline includes a two-year gestation period for plants to come up, followed by five years of incentive disbursal linked to magnet sales.The REPM scheme complements ongoing semiconductor and electronics initiatives by addressing a core upstream vulnerability in India’s EV and chip ecosystem, said industry executives.Mayank Shrivastava, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and cofounder of AGNIT Semiconductors that specialises in gallium nitride semiconductor technology, said the programme is “as critical as building fabs”. This is because advanced electronics depends on magnetic materials as much as on silicon, and the initiative shores up a key weak link in the country’s electronics supply chain.Rajoo Goel, secretary-general of the Electronic Industries Association of India , called the government scheme a first of its kind initiative focused on the core of the supply chain for electronics. Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet available, making them critical for emerging technology applications like electric motors for vehicles, defence and aerospace, renewable energy, computer hard drives and smaller electronics such as smartphones, he said.These magnets are efficient, long-lasting, and have higher resistance to corrosion and high temperatures, he explained. With rapidly growing demand for electronic products and technology, magnets and inputs made of rare earth materials have become critical, he added.The electronics industry is becoming increasingly dependent on the same and the countries which control their supply chain and technology have a geopolitical advantage and can dictate terms to the rest of the world, Goel said. Vivek Tyagi , executive council member at the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, said the scheme could quickly reduce import dependence for two- and three-wheeler manufacturers while also benefiting four-wheeler players over time.Several executives view the move as a logical follow-on to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's India Semiconductor Mission, aligning magnet manufacturing incentives with policies to attract chip fabs and advanced packaging units.The policy push comes as Andhra Pradesh emerges as a hub for downstream electronics and semiconductor manufacturing linked to EVs and industrial applications.Advanced System in Package (ASIP) Technologies is setting up an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility in the state in partnership with South Korea’s APACT, with an initial investment of Rs 468 crore.Chennai-based Syrma SGS, through its unit Syrma Strategic Electronics, is also building a Rs 765 crore multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) plant in Andhra Pradesh under the Centre’s electronic component manufacturing scheme, strengthening local PCB availability for automotive and industrial original equipment manufacturers.ASIP Technologies chief executive Venkata Simhadri said the rapid transition to EV two-wheelers and four-wheelers makes it “very important for India to create the local ecosystem and supply chain”, pointing to both semiconductors and REPMs as key components in the new mobility stack.He highlighted that the REPM scheme, along with ISM incentives for fabs and advanced packaging, addresses crucial elements of the EV supply chain, from permanent magnet motors on the mechanical side to compound semiconductor-based motor control and battery charging systems on the electronics side.While many electronics manufacturing services (EMS) players do not directly process rare earth materials, they expect second-order benefits from improved magnet availability.Syrma SGS managing director Jasbir Singh Gujral said REPMs are critical inputs for EV and semiconductor industries, and a domestic magnet ecosystem will indirectly help EMS companies by making the supply of magnet-based components more predictable and reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions.Syrma’s own operations rely on components made using REPMs, rather than raw magnets themselves, so greater upstream resilience should translate into smoother sourcing for finished parts, he said."It's a very well curated scheme that is coming at the apt time. It's going to take some time for these capacities to get created but the reactions I'm getting from my peers are quite positive," an EMS company executive said on the condition of anonymity."There is a belief that the investments are going to come in. And this is again de-risking from the borderland country which is absolutely prudent," he said.For fabless firms such as BigEndian Semiconductors, which designs custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions from its Bengaluru base while partnering with a foundry in Taiwan, the scheme stresses India’s intent to build deeper hardware value chains.Cofounder and chief executive Sunil Kumar cautioned that gestation-heavy incentive schemes tend to favour already established large organisations. However, innovation often comes from smaller challengers, making it important for policy to be calibrated to company size, he argued.Academia and skill-development experts expect the REPM scheme to catalyse new electronics manufacturing clusters, particularly for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and startups in advanced materials and magnet-based components.T Senthil Siva Subramanian, who heads the Institute Industry Interface programme at Hindustan College of Science and Technology in Mathura, said the scheme can help create MSME-focused electronics clusters that bridge lab-to-market gaps, generate new job roles through skilling, and encourage startups in REPM and related applications.He added that such clusters can feed into broader initiatives like “Vocal for Local” and “One District One Product” by nurturing “swadeshi” proof-of-concepts, while also advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals related to industry, innovation, infrastructure and climate action.Experts argue that domestic REPM capacity carries strategic weight beyond EVs, given its applications in defence, medical devices, nuclear research reactors and precision agriculture equipment.Subramanian pointed out that magnets such as samarium-cobalt and neodymium-iron-boron are critical across defence security systems, electronic traction motors, therapeutic medical equipment, nuclear research reactors and electronic farm machinery, and that local design and production capabilities can enhance India’s strategic autonomy and global ranking in high-tech manufacturing.He also expects the scheme to spur intangible investments in design tools, miniaturised products, software and intellectual property around rare earth magnets, boosting India’s standing in global innovation indices and helping domestic products progress across technology, customer, manufacturing and investment readiness levels.For policymakers and industry, the REPM push is increasingly seen as a foundational layer that strengthens everything from chip packaging and compound semiconductors to EVs, robotics and flexible electronics.(With inputs from Dia Rekhi in Chennai)
