[TITLE]NTB secures approval to acquire HSBC Sri Lanka operations:

Nations Trust Bank (NTB) has received the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) approval for its previously announced acquisition of the Retail Banking operations of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Sri Lanka (HSBC Sri Lanka).

In September this year, HSBC Sri Lanka signed a binding agreement to transfer its Retail Banking operations to NTB.

The acquisition would provide NTB with around 200,000 HSBC Sri Lanka customer accounts, including premium banking clients, retail loans and credit cards.

It is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

Upon closing, HSBC’s corporate and institutional banking operations in Sri Lanka will remain unchanged, continuing to serve international corporate clients and offering cross-border trade and investment services.

NTB said that the acquisition would strengthen its position in the premium retail banking segment and support its long-term growth objectives.

Nations Trust Bank director and CEO Hemantha Gunetilleke said “The approval from CBSL gives us the go-ahead to move forward with the acquisition process, which is currently progressing very well. We are now able to move into the next phase of the project with confidence.”

The sale of its retail banking business is part of HSBC Group’s simplification plan announced in October last year.

The decision follows a strategic review that determined divestment of the retail unit was the preferred course for the group and its stakeholders.

HSBC, at that time, said the reorganisation allows it to concentrate on areas where it has a competitive focus and growth prospects.

HSBC Sri Lanka CEO Mark Surgenor said: “Our priority during this period is to uphold the highest service levels for our customers and ensure that our colleagues are well supported during the transition into NTB.

“We are working closely with NTB towards a seamless transfer of banking services upon completion of the transaction.”

[TITLE]CEO TALKS: Galeries Lafayette’s Nicolas Houzé Talks Big Investment Bets as ‘Boring Retail Is Dead’:
[TEXT]
PARIS — Retail runs in Nicolas Houzé’s blood.

A fifth-generation member of the French family behind Galeries Lafayette, Houzé joined the business in 2006, led the department store as chief executive officer for more than a decade, then followed his father’s footsteps into the role of chair of the group’s executive board last year.

In addition to steering the Galeries Lafayette Group, he chairs France’s strategic committee for fashion and luxury and presides over the union of city-center retailers. On Dec. 1, he was also named president of the International Association of Department Stores, taking the helm as global retail continues to seek recovery.

Last month, Houzé marked a milestone for the group by opening Galeries Lafayette’s first store in India, which is the country’s first stand-alone high-street department store. He has been central to leading the company’s post-pandemic recovery while expanding its international footprint and navigating the shifting trends in fashion, e-commerce and rapidly-changing consumer habits.

In a wide-ranging interview in his office with sweeping views of the Sacré-Cœur, Houzé said the group is doubling down on its department-store model even as much of the industry pulls back, and gaining traction from a growing demand for watches, jewelry and beauty, following the overall rebound at its Paris flagship.

Early acquisitions of multibrand retailers Louis Pion and Royal Quartz, and later the Mauboussin jewelry brand, helped secure the group’s position in the watch and jewelry segment and reinforced relationships with brands such as Rolex — all of which were aimed at strengthening Galeries Lafayette’s core business.

While many were sounding the death knell for brick-and-mortar retail during the pandemic, the group took a counterintuitive bet with a 400 million euro investment to renovate its flagship on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris over four years. The move paid off, with sales returning to 2019 levels by 2024.

A further 400 million euros is now earmarked for upgrades in Paris — including a full overhaul of the stand-alone men’s building to be completed by the end of 2027 — and across its regional network, positioning the family-owned retailer for a new phase of growth.

Galeries Lafayette is still pursuing measured international expansion and strengthening its brand globally. It is reexamining its China strategy, and has an eye on opportunities in the Middle East, including Riyadh.

Houzé spoke to WWD

[TITLE]The 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Before 2026:
[TEXT]
This post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them.

Investors love S&P 500 dividend stocks, especially those with dependable, high yields, because they provide a substantial passive income stream and offer significant total return potential. Total return includes interest, capital gains, dividends, and distributions realized over time. In other words, the total return on an investment or a portfolio consists of income and stock appreciation. At 24/7 Wall St., we consistently emphasize the potential of total return to our readers. It is one of the most effective ways to enhance the prospects of overall investing success. Once again, total return refers to the collective increase in a stock’s value, including dividends. With the potential for a sizable sell-off, we think it makes sense to move to some of the best S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat stocks now.

Investors seeking defensive companies that pay substantial dividends are drawn to the Dividend Aristocrats, and with good reason. The 66 companies that made the cut for the 2025 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats list have increased their dividends (not just maintained them) for 25 consecutive years. But the requirements go even further, with the following attributes also mandatory for membership on the aristocrats list:

Companies must be worth at least $3 billion for each quarterly rebalancing.

Average daily volume of at least $5 million transactions for every trailing three-month period at every quarterly rebalancing date.

They must be a member of the S&P 500.

We screened the list for safe, reliable stocks that make sense as we approach the start of the fourth year of the long-running stock market rally. The S&P 500 is up a stunning 41% from its lows in April, so it makes sense to shift to a safer investing posture in case a big sell-off comes. As usual, it’s not a question of if, but when.

Why do we cover the Dividend Aristocrats?

S&P 500 companies that have paid and raised their dividends for 25 years or longer are the types that growth and income investors want to buy and hold in their stock portfolios for the long term. These stocks are mostly conservative, and should we see a dramatic market correction, they will likely keep their ground much better than volatile technology names.

Consolidated Edison

Consolidated Edison Inc. (NYSE: ED) is one of the largest investor-owned energy companies in the United States. This old-school utility stock offers income investors the stability and track record many seek today, and it pays a strong 3.38% dividend. The company, through its subsidiaries, Consolidated Edison Company of New York (CECONY), Orange and Rockland Utilities (O&R), and Con Edison Transmission, provides a range of energy-related products and services to its customers.

CECONY is a regulated utility providing electric service in New York City and New York’s Westchester County, gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens, and parts of Westchester, and steam service in Manhattan.

O&R and its utility subsidiary, Rockland Electric, provide electric service to customers in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey, a 1,300-square-mile service area.

O&R delivers gas to customers in southeastern New York.

Con Edison Transmission primarily falls under the oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and, through joint ventures, manages both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects.

Mizuho has an Outperform rating with a $112 target price.

Exxon Mobil

Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) manages an industry-leading portfolio of resources and is one of the world’s largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies. The decline in oil prices presents investors with an excellent entry point, and they will likely seize the opportunity to secure a strong 3.41% dividend yield. Exxon is the world’s largest international integrated oil and gas company, exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada/South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia/Oceania.

The energy giant also manufactures and markets commodity petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics, as well as specialty products. Additionally, the company transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products.

Top Wall Street analysts expect the company to remain a key beneficiary in a stable oil price environment. Most remain very optimistic

[TITLE]Indian arms of MNCs find place in the sun:
[TEXT]
ITC accounts for over a fourth of its parent BAT Plc’s revenue; Hindustan Unilever contributes 10-11 per cent to Unilever’s annual turnover; Whirlpool of India around 5 per cent to Whirlpool Corp, and Colgate India accounts for 4-5 per cent of its parent’s global revenue.

At the same time, many Indian arms of consumer multinational corporations command higher valuations compared to their parents. The Indian subsidiaries’ PEs are at a significant premium to that of their parents ranging from 2 to 4 times. Also compared to their revenue contributions, the markets caps of the Indian companies as a percentage to that of their parents are higher. Recently-listed consumer electronics giant LG Corp’s India arm has a higher market capitalisation compared to its parent.

India as a market is finding prominent mention in commentaries by global companies in their earnings calls.

“Over the past decade, India has become the third largest contributor to consumer products (CP) growth among emerging markets – and it has significant headroom for expansion,” Bain and Company said in a report, just a few month ago.

It noted that Indian affiliates of CP multinational corporations (MNCs) have delivered superior shareholder returns and strategic value to their parent in terms of innovation and shared services talent.

A quick glance at the accompanying chart shows that stock performance of the Indian subsidiaries – a good metric for shareholder returns – have outpaced that of their principals over a 10-year period.

The appreciation in stock price has also prompted many of the global MNCs to take some money off the table to pursue their objectives such as paying down debt.

Stake sales

Just over a week ago, Whirlpool Corporation sold 11 per cent stake in its Indian arm for ₹1,490 crore to reduce debt. Earlier, in February 2024, it had sold a 24 per cent stake for ₹4,039 crore. A couple of days ago, BAT sold its stake in ITC Hotels (a part of ITC) for ₹3,800 crore; earlier, it had sold stake in ITC to generate funds for its share buyback programme.

The growth in India has been propelled by three factors – a youthful and growing working-age population; consistent real income increases, and swift urbanisation that is formalising consumption patterns, says Hiten Mistry, Sector Lead – Consumer, Equirus Capital.

With real disposable income per capita rising at around 6 per cent, India is projected to experience the highest per capita income growth among the leading CP market in the next five years, “providing significant opportunities for premiumisation and deeper category penetration. India is expected to maintain a growth rate that is considerably faster than that of most developed markets, even as the exceptionally high rebound rates following COVID-19 begin to stabilise,” explains Mistry.

In mature markets like the US and UK, demand has reached saturation and the MNCs are also not innovating. “The lagging performance of MNCs in their home countries is closely tied to the growth rates there and the overall performance. Reduced innovation has also played in tapering growth. For example, in tech or pharmaceuticals truly innovative moves continue to witness robust growth and valuations in their home countries,” says Divy Malik, Partner, McKinsey & Company.

The home markets for the MNCs exhibit flat to low single-digit volume growth, an ageing population and high levels of category penetration with very little scope for topline growth, notes Equirus’ Mistry.

“The growth in these markets is increasingly driven by a mix of product offerings and pricing strategies, and even significant innovations tend to result in shifts in market share rather than true market expansion. Consequently, the overall growth rates appear weaker when compared to rapidly growing profit pools such as India or other emerging economies,” he says.

This situation is primarily a structural issue of demand saturation, with innovation aimed at maintaining profitability rather than fostering substantial volume growth. In contrast, India continues to present opportunities for both increased penetration and premiumisation, says Mistry.

India was once a difficult market for consumer multinationals to crack. Though MNCs operated in India and even listed here, navigating the regulatory maze and controls imposed posed restrictions to growth, resulting in underperformance and lower-than-expected growth. The low single-digit economic growth, low per capita incomes were impediments.

Opening up of economy

However, progressive liberalisation, reforms, opening up of the economy and increasingly investor-friendly policies have made it easier for global companies to operate in India.

Liberalisation in foreign direct investment regulations for single brand retail and multi-brand trading, along with reforms aimed at improving the ease of doing business, the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), and the digitisation of compliance processes, have facilitated the expansion of multinational corporations’ operations in India.

Additionally, the introduction of simplified tax structures, expedited approval processes, and enhanced infrastructure and minimised obstacles in establishing manufacturing, distribution, and direct-to-consumer channels, has enabled global consumer product companies to adapt their products, pricing strategies, and supply chains more effectively to the local market.

The growing consumer class with big aspirations is the primary engine of growth for consumer-focused companies. India is a dynamic market, brimming with exciting opportunities. Over the past five years, India’s volume growth contribution outpaced its volume share by 2–8 times across several categories, said Bain & Company.

It adds that India is showing disproportionate contribution to volume growth among emerging markets. India’s share of global incremental growth, which ranged between 5 and 10 per cent across categories such as consumer appliances, apparel and footwear, hot beverages and snacks during 2019-24, has risen two to over eight times in 2024.

The emergence of digital channels like quick commerce and e-commerce has played a big role in accelerating the growth narrative of CP MNCs in India. Q-comm platforms account for around 35 per cent of FMCG e-commerce sales and for several large FMCG companies it is

[TITLE]Meet the branding agency behind the buzzy TBPN podcast:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

How can a new media company make a big splash in the tech world?

One answer: call Day Job, a Los Angeles-headquartered creative agency.

That's what the hosts of the "Technology Business Programming Network" — better known as TBPN — did when they wanted help nailing the podcast's branding and style.

Day Job cofounder Rion Harmon described the vision: a "cacophony of logos" slapped all over the screen (a nod to Formula 1 racecars), a "country club" forest green, and a VHS visual effect.

It'd be somewhere between a news station and a sports-casting channel — hence the rebranding from the "Technology Brothers Podcast" to TBPN.

"They're doing something new," Harmon told me. "It doesn't feel like a stuffy, sort of normal sort of journalism thing. It feels more alive. It feels vibrant. We were trying to capture their energy, right? It's funny to just be overly sponsored."

TBPN has had a big year. The podcast, which launched in 2024, has become a new center stage for a rotation of headline-making Big Tech guests like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Palantir's Alex Karp, and Anduril's Palmer Luckey. Both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal profiled the hosts, John Coogan and Jordi Hays, reporting that the media company expects $5 million in revenue this year.

That, in turn, has helped make Day Job a hot commodity in the tech world, as startups and VCs seek to stand out with their branding. The growing attention from Silicon Valley is paying off. Harmon said that this year, Day Job has doubled its revenue and head count.

"With Day Job, what separates them is they will make four or five different brand directions that are all viable and all justifiable in different ways," Hays said.

From CPG brands to tech startups

Founded in 2018 by Harmon and Spen Madsen, Day Job is a bootstrapped and has a team of

[TITLE]Salesforce Is One of the Dogs of the Dow. Should You Buy the Dip in CRM Stock Now?:
[TEXT]
The prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DOWI), home to 30 blue-chip leaders across tech, finance, healthcare, and consumer goods, remains a key pulse check on corporate America's performance. And while it hasn’t matched the stronger gains of the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) or the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ($NASX) this year, the Dow is far from struggling. In fact, the index is still up a modest 12.78% in 2025, proving it’s doing just fine despite the comparisons.

Still, the strength of the index doesn’t mean every Dow component is enjoying the ride. Twenty-two of its 30 members are in the green this year, yet software giant Salesforce (CRM) has tumbled into double-digit losses as questions swirl around the slow adoption of its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings and intensifying competition. That makes it the second-worst performer in the entire Dow, trailing only UnitedHealth (UNH).

With Salesforce shares stuck deep in the red this year, does this pullback present an opportunity for investors, or a warning sign?
