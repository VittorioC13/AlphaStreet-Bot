Tilray stock soars on 3 major cannabis triggers today

Cannabis company rides triple wave of Trump policy buzz, reverse split effects and new vape product launch

Tilray Brands is riding a perfect storm of cannabis industry catalysts that sent the stock climbing on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. The company finds itself at the intersection of Washington policy speculation, corporate restructuring and fresh product launches—a combination that’s turning heads across the investment community.

The cannabis sector extended Friday’s explosive rally as global trading opened, with investors scrambling to understand what a potential shift in federal marijuana policy could mean for companies like Tilray. But the story goes deeper than just regulatory headlines.

Trump Schedule III expectations electrify the sector

The biggest driver behind Monday’s cannabis stock surge came from growing expectations that President Donald Trump could direct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug. Reports first surfaced late last week suggesting the administration is prepared to pursue this reclassification through executive action, moving cannabis away from its current Schedule I status.

The Washington Post described the discussions as an effort to dramatically loosen federal restrictions, though the move would not legalize or decriminalize marijuana nationwide. That distinction matters for everyday consumers, but for publicly traded cannabis companies, Schedule III represents a potential transformation of their business landscape.

The reclassification could ease the burden of federal tax rules that have historically prevented cannabis businesses from taking standard deductions—one of the biggest reasons profitability has remained elusive across the sector. Lower federal restrictions could also make banks, payment processors and institutional investors more willing to work with cannabis-linked businesses, addressing one of the industry’s most persistent challenges.

Reuters reported broad strength across cannabis equities in early European trading, with Canopy Growth leading the charge and Tilray among the prominent movers extending Friday’s momentum. The rally reflects investor optimism

Mexico’s move to raise import tariffs on cars to as high as 50% is likely to hit roughly $1bn in vehicle exports from India, reported Reuters, citing sources and a letter from an industry group.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration has authorised a hike in import duties, starting next year, on hundreds of products originating from countries that lack trade agreements with Mexico, a list that includes India and China.

The car import tariff is due to rise to 50% from 20%, impacting exporters including Volkswagen, Hyundai, Nissan and Maruti Suzuki.

While, the stated aim is to safeguard domestic jobs and manufacturing, the move also comes amid pressure from the US on Mexico to reduce business links with China.

Some Mexican business groups have argued that higher tariffs will push up costs.

India exported goods worth $5.3bn to Mexico in the last fiscal year, with vehicles making up close to $1bn, according to a letter and customs data cited by the news agency.

The same data shows Skoda Auto accounts for nearly half of India’s car exports to Mexico.

[TITLE]‘Dynamic pricing’ used to raise costs of everything from food and Uber rides to museum visits:
[TEXT]
If you feel like you’re being nickel-and-dimed everywhere you shop – you probably are.

Instacart has been using a shady AI algorithm that charges different prices to different customers on the same grocery items in the same stores without telling them, according to an explosive study released by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative earlier this week.

At a Target store in North Canton, Ohio, for example, the popular grocery app charged one customer $2.99 for Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter – while other Instacart users paid as much as $3.59 for the same jar picked up from the same location, the study found.

But it’s not just Instacart using cutting-edge tech to set higher prices. So-called “dynamic pricing” practices have been used by rideshares Uber and Lyft; Las Vegas convenience stores; children’s museums and zoos; and even your local grocery stores.

4 One customer at Caesars Palace noted that his wife was charged $10 for a Snickers bar and Gatorade and the next day, he was charged $14 for the same items Tam Nguyen / NYPost Design

Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and Kroger have already rolled out electronic price tags that allow workers to raise shelf prices in a matter of minutes. Walmart has said it’s planning to add the tags to thousands of stores by 2026.

Variable pricing is nothing new, but artificial intelligence has made it easier for companies of all sizes to leverage dynamic pricing – and “when something is easier to use, it becomes easy also to take advantage of,” said Pascal Yammine, CEO at Zilliant, an AI-driven pricing optimization firm.

Wendy’s faced heated backlash last year over its plans to invest $20 million in digital menu boards that could change the price of a Dave’s burger in real time – but it quickly walked back the comments, saying it “will not implement surge pricing … We didn’t use that phrase.”

While businesses have always adjusted prices to find the highest amount a customer will fork over, now artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms and massive troves of user data are allowing companies to be more exacting than ever.

“The problem isn’t that companies across multiple industries are using AI for dynamic pricing or even surge pricing,” Yammine said. “The problem is more around transparency and trust.”

Variable pricing, after all, can benefit consumers in some ways – offering discounts when they bulk-buy at Costco, allowing them to compare Amazon prices to other retailers online, and saving them money on plane tickets and vacations when they book during off-seasons, he noted.

The problem arises when data collection and algorithms are used without customers’ knowledge, experts said.

Just last month, the Justice Department settled its case against real estate tech firm RealPage, which allegedly used “completely sensitive information” to jack up rents for tenants.

Around the same time, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul made New York the first state to prohibit the use of algorithmic tools in setting rent prices.

Furious New Yorkers have blasted “slime balls” Uber and Lyft for hiking prices when subway lines are shut down during rainstorms – reportedly charging $80 for a 10-minute ride to work.

People have also reported being charged higher Uber fares when using a personal credit card instead of a corporate one. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog suggested in a report that Uber might charge more on users with low phone batteries — the idea seeming to be that customers are more likely to pay higher prices when they’re desperate — though the company denied this.
