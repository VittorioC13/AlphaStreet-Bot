Catalio Capital Management is adding to its team.

The $2.3 billion healthcare investor has hired Ajay Mantha as a partner within its hedge fund, Catalio Public Equities, according to a note to investors seen by Business Insider.

Mantha previously had been an executive at Zimmer Partners, a New York-based stockpicking hedge fund where Mantha built and then ran the healthcare group. He spent nine years in Bain Capital's public equities division as the head of its healthcare sector group. Prior to that, he worked as an analyst at D.E. Shaw and a consultant for McKinsey.

The note states he will start next year and report to Ben Snedeker, the firm's head of public equities.

Catalio declined to comment on the hire.

The hedge fund, which now runs roughly $900 million following an infusion of capital from Brevan Howard, is up nearly 16% this year, a person close to the manager says, besting the average fund's gains of 9.9%.

The hedge fund has returned roughly 55% since rebranding with the Catalio name at the start of 2023, this person added.

The firm, founded by George Petrocheilos and Jacob Vogelstein, originally focused on private market investments in the healthcare and biotech sectors before acquiring longtime stockpicking hedge fund HealthCor Management at the end of 2022.

HealthCor, founded in 2005 by SAC Capital alums Art Cohen and Joe Healey, was merged into Catalio but is still led by Snedeker, who invested for HealthCor for four years before the sale of the fund.

Catalio counts plenty of big names as backers, including private equity giant KKR. Brevan gave the hedge fund $200 million in a separately managed account earlier this month, Reuters reported.

Wealthy financiers such as Thoma Bravo founder Orlando Bravo and Highbridge Capital founder Glenn Dubin are also investors in Catalio.

[TITLE]Fisher and Paykel Healthcare raises full-year guidance after strong first half:
[TEXT]
FPH managing director and chief executive Lewis Gradon said it had continued to work closely with clinicians, progressed work on new products, and delivered a range of efficiency improvements across the business.

“This is a strong result against the backdrop of robust growth in the first half of last year. We saw broad-based strength across the hospital consumables portfolio during a period of lower seasonal respiratory hospitalisations, and in homecare, our latest range of masks for treating obstructive sleep apnea has performed well.”

In the hospital product group, first half revenue grew to $692.2m, up 17% compared to the same period last year, or 15% in constant currency. This group includes humidification products used in respiratory, acute and surgical care.

Sales of hardware grew by 21%, and hospital new applications consumables revenue lifted by 16%.

In the homecare product group, first half revenue lifted 10% to $395.9m, or up 8%. This group includes products used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and respiratory support in the home.

Gradon said the turnoff of 3G networks had supported hardware sales of its sleep apnoea machines.

The company said its team efforts, together with other efficiency gains, helped to offset the 32 basis-point impact of US tariffs on its hospital products sourced from New Zealand.

Investment in research and development equated to 10% of revenue, or $114.1m.

The company directors have approved an interim dividend of 19c per share, up from 18.5c per share in the first half of the prior year, set to be paid on December 16, 2025.

The share price sat at $36.70 prior to the market open, and lifted by 4.8% to $38.47 by mid morning.

Outlook

FPH also updated its full-year guidance for the financial year, lifting its expected operating revenue to be in the range of approximately $2.17b to $2.27b, up from $2.15b to $2.25b in August’s guidance.

Net profit is also expected to be higher, with the company expecting full-year net profit to be in the range of approximately $410m to $460m, up from $390m to $440m.

“Our second-half hospital consumables growth can be influenced by year-on-year variations in the Northern Hemisphere winter respiratory season, and we don’t have any additional insights into that impact at present,” Gradon added.

“Available data indicates that last winter was a historically strong season, and so a similar season this year would be pushing our result towards the top end of guidance.”

The outlook continues to estimate a 75 basis point impact to gross margin due to US tariffs. It also assumes current global tariff rates, policies and applications for the remainder of the financial year.

The board also approved a discretionary profit-sharing payment of $9m million to be shared among employees who have worked for the company for a qualifying period.

Reaction

Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie said the business exceeded the guidance it provided in August, with the result strong across the board.

“Where they saw particular strengths relative to our expectations was in the hospital hardware business, and particularly I think that is the ongoing mix shift within the business towards the products that they’ve launched in the last couple of years. That’s the Airvo 3 and the 950 system which are higher priced products,” Montgomerie said.

“It reflects hospitals moving on from one generation of product to the other. It was very strong growth and outside of that, pretty much in line with what we were expecting.”

Montgomerie said new apps and consumables had a strong half as the high growth category of the business, reflecting ongoing clinical practice change. Homecare was more or less in line with expectations.

He expects that if the business can maintain its momentum into the second half of the financial year, it should finish closer to the top end of its guidance range.

“I think the result is ongoing evidence of execution and delivery, which they’ve shown for a long period of time now.

“It’s one of those results where it’s very hard to pick any holes in it, to be honest.”

[TITLE]Obamacare deadlock drags on, but 1 healthcare fix could slash medical costs nationwide * WorldNetDaily * by Melissa O'Rourke, Daily Caller News Foundation:
[TEXT]
The debate over expiring Obamacare subsidies has dominated national political discourse, but some experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation that Republicans could capitalize on growing momentum around price transparency to help lower healthcare costs for Americans.

The record-setting government shutdown was driven by Democrats’ refusal to budge on the expiring Obamacare premium subsidies, which they passed in 2021 without GOP support and set to expire at the end of 2025. Republicans are still debating their healthcare proposal, including whether to back a limited extension of those subsidies.

Even without a resolution on the subsidies in sight, some experts note that more can be done to build on the healthcare-related measures already taken. That includes President Donald Trump’s February executive order directing agencies to fulfill “radical price transparency” and require the disclosure of the actual prices of healthcare services.

Proponents of the executive order say that further measures could drive down costs by increasing competition and giving Americans more control over their healthcare spending.

“When Americans can see what they’re actually paying for in health care, competition works. Costs fall, middlemen lose their grip, and Americans get control over this critical part of their lives,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in a statement to the DCNF.

“With President Trump’s transparency platform already in motion, now is the perfect time for his administration and Congress to deliver real affordability through ‘radical transparency,’” he said.

Trump’s executive order builds on an earlier order he signed in 2019, which required hospitals and health plans to provide price estimates for certain services. Shortly before leaving office in 2021, the president also signed the No Surprises Act, which bans surprise medical bills, requires providers to offer good-faith estimates of expected charges, and directs insurers to send patients an advanced explanation of benefits (AEOB).

If fully implemented, price transparency regulations could yield as much as $80 billion in annual healthcare savings, according to some estimates.

“Price transparency will reveal prices that vary 10x within a hospital depending on a patient’s plan, drive competition, protect from overcharges and lower costs,” Cynthia Fisher, founder and chair of PatientRightsAdvocate.org, told the DCNF. “Real prices will transform healthcare for the benefit of all patients, employers, workers, unions, and taxpayers.”

However, enforcement of the No Surprises Act stalled during the Biden administration, and the AEOB requirements have yet to be implemented nearly five years after the law’s passage.

Fisher on Tuesday wrote to the president, urging him to direct the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to issue and enforce the AEOB rule, begin delivering pricing information in 2026, and ensure employers have access to data needed to negotiate lower costs for employees, among other recommendations.

“By doing this, you will deliver a system in which patients, employees and unions — not the insurance and healthcare industry fat cats — hold the power,” Fisher wrote.

Lawmakers have also proposed codifying price transparency rules. The bipartisan Patients Deserve Price Tags Act, introduced by Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas and Democrat Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, would codify Trump’s 2025 executive order and require machine-readable files of all negotiated rates and cash prices between plans and providers, and mandate that hospitals post actual prices for all services starting in 2026.

Healthcare will be a critical issue in the upcoming midterms, according to a September Echelon Insights poll.

By a nine-point margin, voters said they trust Democrats more than Republicans on healthcare. However, the poll found that if in 2026 Trump requires providers to give patients actual prices before care, 62% of respondents said they would support the president’s healthcare agenda.

Moreover, half of the respondents said they would be more likely to back a midterm candidate who “helped Donald Trump deliver actual prices before care to patients.”

At the same time, Republicans in Congress are developing proposals to redirect Obamacare subsidies away from insurers and toward consumers purchasing their own coverage. The GOP argues such a shift would give individuals more control over their plans. The concept appears to have the backing of the president, who earlier in November called on Republicans in Congress to send dollars directly to Americans.

“The insurance companies are making a fortune. Their stock is up over 1,000% over a short period of time … Why don’t we just pay this money directly to the people of our country and let them buy their own health insurance?” the president said on Nov. 16.

“For decades, politicians have failed to stand up to medical industry executives who refuse to provide upfront prices to patients. Thankfully, those days are ending,” Trent England, executive director of Save Our States, told the DCNF. “President Trump is pushing for transparency and accountability in health care. He has the power today to deliver real results for the American people.”

But with less than a month until the expiration of the subsidies, no official proposal has been endorsed by either the president or Republican leadership.

Meanwhile, Democrats have made the impending expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies, along with broader Republican healthcare reforms, a top midterm attack line. They warn that without an extension, premiums will surge for millions of Americans and thousands will die, framing any Republican opposition as an attempt to gut Obamacare.

[TITLE]Eisai Submits New Drug Application for Subcutaneous Formulation of “LEQEMBI®” for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer’s Disease in Japan:
[TEXT]
TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, “Biogen”) announced today that Eisai has filed a new drug application for “LEQEMBI®” (brand name, generic name: lecanemab) seeking approval for a subcutaneous formulation (subcutaneous autoinjector: SC-AI) as a new route of administration to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA).

The application is based on data from multiple subcutaneous (SC) administration sub-studies of lecanemab conducted as part of the Phase 3 Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE), following the 18-month core study in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) or mild stage of AD dementia (collectively referred to as early AD). It was confirmed that the once-weekly administration of SC-AI 500mg resulted in equivalent exposure to once every two weeks intravenous (IV) administration and similar clinical and biomarker benefits. Subcutaneous administration demonstrated a safety profile similar to IV administration, with less than 2% incidence of systemic injection/infusion-related reactions.

If approved, the SC-AI of 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) could be used to administer a once-weekly dose at home from the initiation of treatment, as an alternative to the current IV administration every two weeks dose in the hospital setting. The potential approval of SC-AI would expand the option for patients and care partners to receive LEQEMBI treatment at home. The injection time for each autoinjector (250mg injection) is approximately 15 seconds. The SC formulation also has the potential to reduce healthcare resources associated with IV dosing, such as preparation for infusion and nurse monitoring, while streamlining the overall AD treatment care pathway.

AD is a progressive, relentless disease with amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau as hallmarks that is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process driven by protofibrils* that begins before amyloid plaque accumulation and continues after plaque removal.1,2,3 Only LEQEMBI fights AD in two ways – targeting both protofibrils and amyloid plaque, which can impact tau downstream.

LEQEMBI is currently approved in 51 countries and regions and is under regulatory review in 9 countries.

Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab’s development and regulatory submissions globally with Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority.

*Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction.2

Segmental Insights

By drug type analysis

Which Drug Type Led the U.S. CAR T-Cell Therapies Market in 2024?

The axicabtagene ciloleucel segment accounted for a dominant share of the market in 2024. Its widespread adoption is driven by its greater efficacy in treating particular, often previously intractable, types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), specifically in patients whose cancer has relapsed or is refractory to other treatments. In October 2024, the FDA authorised RMAT designation for axicabtagene ciloleucel as an efficient first-line treatment for adults with newly diagnosed, high-risk large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL).

Moreover, the tisagenlecleucel segment is anticipated to witness rapid expansion. It is mainly approved for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and certain B-cell lymphomas. Currently, the US scientists are continuing analysis of real-world data for both its approved indications (pediatric/young adult B-ALL and adult DLBCL/HGBCL), and persistent research into new CAR-T technologies, including site-specific integration and probably wider applications.

By indication analysis

Why did the Lymphoma Segment Dominate the Market in 2024?

By capturing the biggest share, the lymphoma segment led the U.S. CAR T-cell therapies market in 2024. A prominent driver is a rise in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Recent studies are leveraging improvements in delivery methods, such as direct intrathecal administration is being promoted for lymphomas affecting the central nervous system. In May 2025, a study demonstrated that an "armored" CAR T-cell therapy (huCART19-IL18) that secretes the cytokine IL-18 gained a 52% complete remission rate in heavily pre-treated lymphoma patients. By 2030, there will be a rise in nearly 108,000 new NHL cases in the U.S. is predicted.

Whereas the acute lymphocytic leukemia segment will expand rapidly. In 2024, the American Cancer Society anticipated that

[TITLE]Obamacare deadlock drags on, but 1 healthcare fix could slash medical costs nationwide * WorldNetDaily * by Melissa O'Rourke, Daily Caller News Foundation:
[TEXT]
The debate over expiring Obamacare subsidies has dominated national political discourse, but some experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation that Republicans could capitalize on growing momentum around price transparency to help lower healthcare costs for Americans.

The record-setting government shutdown was driven by Democrats’ refusal to budge on the expiring Obamacare premium subsidies, which they passed in 2021 without GOP support and set to expire at the end of 2025. Republicans are still debating their healthcare proposal, including whether to back a limited extension of those subsidies.

Even without a resolution on the subsidies in sight, some experts note that more can be done to build on the healthcare-related measures already taken. That includes President Donald Trump’s February executive order directing agencies to fulfill “radical price transparency” and require the disclosure of the actual prices of healthcare services.

Proponents of the executive order say that further measures could drive down costs by increasing competition and giving Americans more control over their healthcare spending.

“When Americans can see what they’re actually paying for in health care, competition works. Costs fall, middlemen lose their grip, and Americans get control over this critical part of their lives,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in a statement to the DCNF.

“With President Trump’s transparency platform already in motion, now is the perfect time for his administration and Congress to deliver real affordability through ‘radical transparency,’” he said.

Trump’s executive order builds on an earlier order he signed in 2019, which required hospitals and health plans to provide price estimates for certain services. Shortly before leaving office in 2021, the president also signed the No Surprises Act, which bans surprise medical bills, requires providers to offer good-faith estimates of expected charges, and directs insurers to send patients an advanced explanation of benefits (AEOB).

If fully implemented, price transparency regulations could yield as much as $80 billion in annual healthcare savings, according to some estimates.

“Price transparency will reveal prices that vary 10x within a hospital depending on a patient’s plan, drive competition, protect from overcharges and lower costs,” Cynthia Fisher, founder and chair of PatientRightsAdvocate.org, told the DCNF. “Real prices will transform healthcare for the benefit of all patients, employers, workers, unions, and taxpayers.”

However, enforcement of the No Surprises Act stalled during the Biden administration, and the AEOB requirements have yet to be implemented nearly five years after the law’s passage.

Fisher on Tuesday wrote to the president, urging him to direct the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to issue and enforce the AEOB rule, begin delivering pricing information in 2026, and ensure employers have access to data needed to negotiate lower costs for employees, among other recommendations.

“By doing this, you will deliver a system in which patients, employees and unions — not the insurance and healthcare industry fat cats — hold the power,” Fisher wrote.

Lawmakers have also proposed codifying price transparency rules. The bipartisan Patients Deserve Price Tags Act, introduced by Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas and Democrat Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, would codify Trump’s 2025 executive order and require machine-readable files of all negotiated rates and cash prices between plans and providers, and mandate that hospitals post actual prices for all services starting in 2026.

Healthcare will be a critical issue in the upcoming midterms, according to a September Echelon Insights poll.

By a nine-point margin, voters said they trust Democrats more than Republicans on healthcare. However, the poll found that if in 2026 Trump requires providers to give patients actual prices before care, 62% of respondents said they would support the president’s healthcare agenda.

Moreover, half of the respondents said they would be more likely to back a midterm candidate who “helped Donald Trump deliver actual prices before care to patients.”

At the same time, Republicans in Congress are developing proposals to redirect Obamacare subsidies away from insurers and toward consumers purchasing their own coverage. The GOP argues such a shift would give individuals more control over their plans. The concept appears to have the backing of the president, who earlier in November called on Republicans in Congress to send dollars directly to Americans.

“The insurance companies are making a fortune. Their stock is up over 1,000% over a short period of time … Why don’t we just pay this money directly to the people of our country and let them buy their own health insurance?” the president said on Nov. 16.

“For decades, politicians have failed to stand up to medical industry executives who refuse to provide upfront prices to patients. Thankfully, those days are ending,” Trent England, executive director of Save Our States, told the DCNF. “President Trump is pushing for transparency and accountability in health care. He has the power today to deliver real results for the American people.”

But with less than a month until the expiration of the subsidies, no official proposal has been endorsed by either the president or Republican leadership.

Meanwhile, Democrats have made the impending expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies, along with broader Republican healthcare reforms, a top midterm attack line. They warn that without an extension, premiums will surge for millions of Americans and thousands will die, framing any Republican opposition as an attempt to gut Obamacare.

[TITLE]Freya Pharma Solutions Rebrands as Arletta Pharma Solutions, Marking New Phase in Women’s Healthcare Innovation:
[TEXT]
New name reflects company’s transformation as it advances toward the final phase of Lybrido™’s clinical development

The Arletta butterfly symbolism underscores commitment to women’s health and lifecycle transitions

CDU Phase II study ongoing with preliminary data expected near-term; ALETTA pivotal study positioned for launch pending financing completion

Company leverages fifteen years of research in Female Sexual Disorders

Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 27 November 2025 - Freya Pharma Solutions , Freya Pharma Solutions, a pharmaceutical company specializing in innovative therapies for women diagnosed with Female Sexual Disorders (FSD), today announced it will rebrand as Arletta Pharma Solutions, effective December 1, 2025. The new name, derived from a rare butterfly species, symbolizes the company’s transformation as it progresses toward pivotal clinical milestones and its strategic objectives of securing regulatory approval.

“Like a caterpillar emerging as a butterfly, this name change marks the beginning of our company’s final phase,” said CEO Nicole Hijnen, Chief Executive Officer of Arletta Pharma Solutions. “This rebranding comes at the optimal moment in our evolution—as we advance our clinical programs and prepare to deliver on our founding mission to address a significant unmet medical need affecting millions of women worldwide.”

The Butterfly: A Universal Symbol in Women’s Healthcare

The name Arletta, inspired by a rare butterfly species, carries profound significance for women’s medical care. The butterfly symbolizes transformation, change, beauty, and freedom—concepts that resonate deeply throughout women’s healthcare. Internationally, the term “butterfly” appears frequently in medical contexts related to women’s health, from anatomical structures to diagnostic indicators, reflecting the transformative nature of women’s life stages.

Throughout their lives, women undergo remarkable transformations—puberty, reproductive years, perimenopause, and postmenopause—each representing a metamorphosis that requires specialized medical attention and understanding. Arletta Pharma’s focus on developing innovative therapies for Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (FSIAD) acknowledges these unique transitions and the need for targeted therapeutic solutions that respect the complexity of female sexual health.

Clinical Programs Advancing

Arletta Pharma’s Clitoral Doppler Duplex Ultrasonography (CDU) Phase II study is currently ongoing at Chaim Sheba Medical Center, evaluating two testosterone-sildenafil dose-combinations in 16 premenopausal women with acquired generalized FSIAD. Led by Prof. Cobi Reisman and Dr. Anna Padoa, the study utilizes clitoral doppler duplex ultrasound imaging to quantify clitoral blood flow parameters, with preliminary data expected in the near term. Additionally, the company is finalizing preparations for the ALETTA pivotal study across 20 European research sites in five countries, with enrollment positioned to commence in the foreseeable future pending completion of financing arrangements—a critical milestone toward regulatory approval in Europe.

Building on Fifteen Years of Scientific Foundation

Arletta Pharma Solutions (formerly Freya Pharma Solutions) is developing Lybrido™, an innovative on-demand dual-action therapy for FSIAD and Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD), building upon fifteen years of research. Lybrido™ features a novel dual-route, dual-release tablet with a testosterone coating for sublingual administration and a sildenafil (PDE-5 inhibitor) inner core. The delayed-immediate-release matrix synchronizes peak plasma concentration of sildenafil with the testosterone-induced window of increased sexual motivation, enhancing genital arousal through increased responsivity to sexual stimuli. Effects last 3 to 6 hours after intake. To date, Lybrido™ has been investigated in 20 Phase I and Phase IIa trials, plus large-scale Phase IIb trials across 17 US research sites.

About Female Sexual Disorders

Low sexual desire is the most common female sexual disorder (FSD), often causing clinically significant distress, dissatisfaction in intimate relationships, and profoundly impacting emotional well-being. Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (FSIAD), as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), combines persistent reductions in sexual interest and/or arousal lasting six months while causing clinically significant distress. FSIAD represents the clustering of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder and Female Sexual Arousal Disorder, listed in the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) under Code HA00/HA01.0.

About Arletta Pharma Solutions

Arletta Pharma Solutions (formerly Freya Pharma Solutions) is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing effective pharmaceutical therapies for FSIAD/HSDD, building upon fifteen years of solid research.
