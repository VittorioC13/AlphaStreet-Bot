[TEXT]
Chandan Healthcare, one of the leading diagnostics companies in North India, will raise ₹104 crore through a preferential issue of warrants and an exclusive nationwide diagnostic partnership with Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited.

The Board of Directors of Chandan Healthcare has approved the issuance of up to 44.50 lakh fully convertible equity warrants on a preferential basis at ₹234 per warrant, aggregating to approximately ₹104 crore.

Each warrant will be convertible into one fully paid-up equity share.

The issue has been structured to include both promoter group participation and strategic institutional investors.

The company will issue 4.75 lakh warrants to the promoters while 39.75 lakh warrants will be issued to non-promoters.

Chandan Healthcare has also entered into an exclusive strategic partnership with Jeena Sikho Lifecare, one of the leading Ayurvedic healthcare providers, to establish diagnostic centres across all existing and upcoming Jeena Sikho hospitals and clinics across India.

Chandan will act as the exclusive diagnostic partner for all Jeena Sikho hospitals and clinics across 23 states and over 100 cities.

The company will provide end-to-end pathology and radiology solutions for patients.

The initiative aims to expand access to high-quality, affordable and tech-enabled diagnostic services across India, aligning with both organisations.

Amar Singh, Promoter and Managing Director of Chandan Healthcare, said the strong response from investors reflects deep confidence in the business model and growth strategy of the company.

A major part of the funds raised will be deployed towards expansion, including setting up new diagnostic laboratories, upgrading infrastructure, and strengthening working capital to support fast-growing operations, he said.

The collaboration with Jeena Sikho Lifecare represents a strong synergy between Chandan’s advanced diagnostic expertise and Jeena Sikho’s presence in Ayurvedic healthcare.

Jeena Sikho Lifecare operates a nationwide network of 55 hospitals and 74 clinics/daycare centres across 21 states and over 100 cities, offering more than 1,500 operational beds.

Chandan Healthcare said it has 40 diagnostic centres and over 360 collection centres.

Shares of the company were up 5 per cent at ₹302 crore.

Romi Gubes knew her idea sounded outlandish: a small audio-only device that could sit in a senior's home and detect everything from falls to early signs of cognitive decline.

"It was like science fiction," she told Business Insider. "When we came up with this idea, everyone thought we were crazy."

But what seemed far-fetched in 2019 is now a multimillion-dollar reality. Gubes's startup Sensi.AI just raised $45 million in Series C funding, BI learned exclusively.

Qumra Capital led the round, joined by existing investors including Insight Partners. The raise brings Sensi.AI's total funding to $98 million.

Gubes, a former software engineer, cofounded Sensi.AI following a crisis in her own family. She learned her daughter was being abused at day care, a discovery she made only because another child's parents had placed a recording device in their backpack. The experience led her to a larger, more difficult question: how can we keep the most vulnerable people safe when their primary caregivers aren't around?

She saw a massive opportunity in elder care. By 2050, one in six people will be 60 or older, according to the World Health Organization. And most Americans want to stay in their homes as they age, according to the AARP, a demand that's far outpacing caregiver supply.

Gubes thinks those trends are pushing the healthcare market toward a breaking point.

"If nothing were to happen, our parents and grandparents won't be able to get the proper amount of care that they need," she said.

For years, the elder care industry has relied on systems like emergency buttons or wearable monitors, devices that many older adults don't like wearing out of embarrassment or fear of stigmatization. Newer monitoring systems incorporate in-home cameras, but some older adults balk at the idea of constant surveillance. Detecting early signs of illness and dementia remains largely out of reach for any of these tools.

Sensi.AI's discreet audio pods aim to break from tradition. Its ambient listening devices passively capture sound in the home that's then analyzed using a mix of large language models and Sensi's proprietary acoustic models. The startup's predictive AI technology, primarily sold to home care agencies that help people to "age in place," flags potential issues like confusion, agitation, or changes in daily routine to give caregivers deeper insight into their patients' health and well-being.

While staff in independent living facilities can keep a much closer eye on senior patients, home care agencies, which may only see a patient for a few hours each week, have far less visibility into that patient's daily routines, Gubes said.

"These providers are blind to their point of care," Gubes said. "They're fully dependent on the senior, who is not always capable of speaking to their quality of care, and the caregiver who may not always share everything you want and need to know."

Gubes said the startup now works with tens of thousands of home care agencies. Sensi.AI's emergency alerts are sent to home care agencies in real time, while other patterns the startup detects are rolled up in a care feed that providers can review daily to further tailor their care.

The home healthcare tech market is booming. Sensi.AI is competing with other startups building in-home senior care devices, like Cherish Health, and alongside startups helping home health agencies automate administrative tasks and coordinate care logistics, like Zingage and Axle Health.

Sensi.AI's annual recurring revenue has grown nearly fourfold in the past year, and Gubes says the startup is aiming to accelerate its growth even further, including by investing in its technology. The company wants to create an agentic layer to autonomously handle some tasks on behalf of providers, like automatically calling seniors or their families when Sensi.AI detects an emergency.

Aside from its technology, Gubes said Sensi.AI plans to use the new funding to grow its network of provider and payer partners to reach more patients, including through insurers' home care networks and independent living communities.

"We want to get to every senior from the minute they start their aging journey, as fast as possible," Gubes said.

[TITLE]Quoin Pharmaceuticals Announces Private Placement Financing of Up to $104.5 Million:
[TEXT]
ASHBURN, Va., Oct. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNRX) (the “Company” or “Quoin”), a late clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on rare and orphan diseases, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with new healthcare focused institutional investors with the potential to raise up to $104.5 million in gross proceeds, including initial upfront funding of $16.5 million and up to an additional $88.0 million upon the potential cash exercise of accompanying warrants at the election of the investors. The private placement was priced at a premium to the Company’s prior day’s closing stock price.

The financing includes participation from new healthcare-focused investors, including AIGH Capital Management, Soleus Capital, Nantahala Capital, Diadema Partners, Stonepine Capital Management, ADAR1 Capital Management, and Velan Capital, among others.

Maxim Group LLC is acting as sole placement agent for the private placement.

Pursuant to terms of the securities purchase agreement, Quoin will issue an aggregate of 1,993,940 American Depository Shares (“ADSs”) (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,975,760 ADSs, at a combined purchase price of $8.25 per ADS and accompanying warrants, in accordance with the "Minimum Price" requirement as defined in the Nasdaq rules. The accompanying warrants will consist of four tranches:

Series H warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $9.075 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $18.1 million. The Series H warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the Company has received Type C meeting minutes from the FDA indicating openness to baseline-controlled pivotal studies for QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

Series I warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $10.3125 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $20.6 million. The Series I warrants are immediately exercisable and expire as follows: 50% of the Series I warrants will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the primary endpoint has been met in the monotherapy pivotal trial of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance; and the remaining 50% of Series I warrants will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Company’s public announcement that the primary endpoint has been met in the adjuvant pivotal trial of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

Series J warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $12.375 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $24.7 million. The Series J warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the public announcement of the receipt of either accelerated or traditional approval by the FDA of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

Series K warrants to purchase up to 1,993,940 ADSs at an exercise price of $12.375 per ADS for an aggregate exercise price of up to $24.7 million. The Series K warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the public announcement of the Company’s sale of a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) and (ii) five years from the date of issuance.

In lieu of ADSs, certain investors are purchasing pre-funded warrants at a combined purchase price of $8.2499 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrants, which equals the purchase price per ADS and accompanying warrants less $0.0001, which is in turn equal to the exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. The private placement is expected to close on or

Romi Gubes knew her idea sounded outlandish: a small audio-only device that could sit in a senior's home and detect everything from falls to early signs of cognitive decline.

"It was like science fiction," she told Business Insider. "When we came up with this idea, everyone thought we were crazy."

But what seemed far-fetched in 2019 is now a multimillion-dollar reality. Gubes's startup Sensi.AI just raised $45 million in Series C funding, BI learned exclusively.

Qumra Capital led the round, joined by existing investors including Insight Partners. The raise brings Sensi.AI's total funding to $98 million.

Gubes, a former software engineer, cofounded Sensi.AI following a crisis in her own family. She learned her daughter was being abused at day care, a discovery she made only because another child's parents had placed a recording device in their backpack. The experience led her to a larger, more difficult question: how can we keep the most vulnerable people safe when their primary caregivers aren't around?

She saw a massive opportunity in elder care. By 2050, one in six people will be 60 or older, according to the World Health Organization. And most Americans want to stay in their homes as they age, according to the AARP, a demand that's far outpacing caregiver supply.

Gubes thinks those trends are pushing the healthcare market toward a breaking point.

"If nothing were to happen, our parents and grandparents won't be able to get the proper amount of care that they need," she said.

Newer monitoring systems incorporate in-home cameras, but some older adults balk at the idea of constant surveillance. Detecting early signs of illness and dementia remains largely out of reach for any of these tools.

Sensi.AI's discreet audio pods aim to break from tradition.
