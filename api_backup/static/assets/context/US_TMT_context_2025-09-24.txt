[TITLE]Oracle stock rises as White House names software giant in TikTok deal; company announces CEO shake-up:
[TEXT]
Oracle (ORCL) stock rose more than 6% Monday as the White House confirmed that the software giant is part of a consortium of investors that will control TikTok's US operations. The company also separately announced a CEO shake-up.

A senior White House official on Monday morning confirmed the details of the TikTok deal, which will move the social media app's US operations into a new joint venture based in the United States and controlled by American investors, who will have a majority of the new company's ownership stake and of its board seats.

Oracle and Venture Private Equity firm Silver Lake are set to lead the new venture, with China-based tech giant ByteDance holding a less than 20% equity stake.

The venture will receive a copy of TikTok's valuable content recommendation algorithm, which will be "fully inspected" and "retrained" by Oracle — the group's security provider — on US user data. The algorithm will be regularly inspected by US government officials.

"We feel [this] meets every security requirement that we need for the algorithm to make sure it's behaving appropriately," a senior White House official said.

Trump is set to sign an executive order later this week declaring that the terms of the new TikTok agreement meet America's national security needs. The president has touted the deal repeatedly and said Sunday that the final list of investors would be "really great people, very prominent people."

TikTok, the short-form video app owned by ByteDance, faced a US ban due to national security concerns unless it divested its ownership to a US- or US-allied country by Dec. 16. Congress passed a law effectively banning TikTok in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, and Trump promised to "save" the app on his campaign trail despite originally trying to ban TikTok in his first term. The US president extended the deadline for TikTok to divest its ownership multiple times as the app featured in high-stakes trade talks between the US and China.

The White House official said the US government has no plans to take equity, a "golden share," or a board seat — as it has with US Steel and Intel — though it might charge a fee for facilitating the deal.

Multiple outlets had reported previously that Oracle would be part of a consortium of investors that would control TikTok's US operations.

Analysts have told Yahoo Finance that Oracle's involvement in such a deal is seen as a positive for the software company because it would expand its partnership with TikTok. Oracle has worked with TikTok to store the app's American user data since 2022, and that ongoing deal accounted for 5% of the revenue seen by its booming cloud business, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), in its 2025 fiscal year, Morningstar analyst Luke Yang estimated.

[TITLE]3 Must-Buy Non-Tech Stocks for the Long Term Amid AI Data Center Boom:
[TEXT]
The artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to unfold fully. The demand for data center capacity surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.

The AI infrastructure space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. Research firm McKinsey & Co. estimated that global AI-powered data center infrastructure capex will reach around $7 trillion by 2030.

In order to reap the benefit of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three non-technology U.S. bigwigs at this stage and hold for the long term. These companies are set to immensely benefit from an AI-induced data center boom.

These companies are: MasTec Inc. MTZ, Comfort Systems USA Inc. FIX and Talen Energy Corp. TLN. Each of our picks currently carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Comfort Systems USA Inc.

Zacks Rank #1 Comfort Systems USA is a national provider of comprehensive heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) installation, maintenance, repair and replacement services. FIX operates primarily in the commercial and industrial HVAC markets, and performs most of its services within manufacturing plants, office buildings, retail centers, apartment complexes, and healthcare, education and government facilities.

The data center boom, driven by AI, cloud computing, and high-performance computing, is fueling demand for the specialized HVAC solutions of FIX. Cooling systems for these facilities should deliver precise and reliable performance, prompting investments in advanced technologies such as liquid cooling and modular units.

This segment is becoming a significant growth driver for FIX, offering high-margin opportunities and attracting M&A activity. HVAC firms with capabilities in precision cooling and energy-efficient infrastructure are well-positioned to capture share in this fast-expanding niche.

Comfort Systems USA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.5% and 52.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% in the last seven days.

Talen Energy Corp.

Zacks Rank #2 Talen Energy is an independent power producer and infrastructure company that produces and sells electricity, capacity, and ancillary services into wholesale power markets in the United States. TLN operates nuclear, fossil, solar, and coal power plants. TLN is also developing battery storage projects.

[TITLE]Is Artificial Intelligence Worth the Investment?:

[TITLE]“Earthquake” in Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia invests $5 billion in Intel, shaking up the balance:
[TEXT]
Newsroom September 18 03:34

Nvidia and Intel have entered into a “mega-deal,” with Nvidia announcing a $5 billion investment in Intel. Both companies will collaborate on developing microchips for computers and data centers, in a surprising move since it strengthens a key competitor.

Nvidia will purchase Intel shares at $23.28 each. Intel will integrate Nvidia’s graphics technology into upcoming PC chips and will supply its processors for data center products based on Nvidia hardware.

The two companies have not provided a timeline for the release of the first products and clarified that this announcement does not affect their future plans.

Intel’s stock “soared” as much as 26% in pre-market trading.

This new funding for Intel follows an approximately 10% investment by the U.S. government in August, with Donald Trump taking on a role as “backer.” In addition, Japan’s SoftBank made an emergency $2 billion investment last month, while Intel has also been raising capital through asset sales. Intel’s current operations are struggling from market share losses and cannot bear the costs of producing advanced chips.

This collaboration highlights the shifting power dynamics in the computer and artificial intelligence industries. Intel gains financial backing and access to top-tier technology from a company it once considered “second-rate.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the partnership links Nvidia’s AI ecosystem with Intel’s x86 architecture, creating “a foundation for the next era of computing.”

Intel will provide PC microchips that combine general processing with Nvidia’s powerful graphics in order to compete with AMD, Nvidia’s main graphics rival. In data centers, Intel will supply processors for products incorporating Nvidia’s AI units.

Nvidia continues to design its own processors using Arm Holdings technology, with no changes to its corporate roadmap. With a market cap exceeding $4 trillion, Nvidia’s investment in Intel represents less than 5% of its value.

Nvidia is largely defining the industry’s future through its dominance in AI computing. The demand for new chips to power services such as ChatGPT was anticipated and executed by Nvidia before its competitors. In 2025, Nvidia is projected to generate about $200 billion in revenue, gradually surpassing Intel’s annual performance.

Intel, which once dominated the industry through its advanced manufacturing technology, has failed to develop competitive AI accelerators and now relies on TSMC for producing its top products. Under the leadership of Lip Boo Tan, Intel is moving toward a more open strategy, seeking partnerships and offering third parties access to its manufacturing facilities.
