[TITLE]Trump SBA Delivers Record Capital to Small Businesses in FY25:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) announced that it will close Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 with the most capital ever delivered to small businesses thanks to a surge in demand and confidence under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump. In total, the agency has guaranteed 84,400 7(a) and 504 small business loans for $44.8 billion. This includes 6,750 504 loans for $7.8 billion and 77,600 7(a) loans for $37 billion. The majority of SBA’s FY25 small business loans were approved after President Trump took office in January 2025.

On average, the agency guarantees 1,600 small business loans per week worth over $860 million – or 320 loans per workday for $170 million.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, small business investment and confidence is soaring – and Main Streets across the country are making an unprecedented comeback,” said SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler. “With record loan volume, both borrowers and lenders are sending a clear signal that America First means America is growing again. Our revitalized SBA is meeting the mission, and new highs in small business optimism are a direct result of this Administration’s historic tax relief, fair-trade policies, and massive deregulation. The data is clear: the Trump agenda is powering the confidence – and the capital - to start hiring, investing, and growing again.”

Since President Trump took office, SBA has approved over 58,000 7(a) and 504 loans, representing more than $32 billion in capital delivered to America’s small businesses. This includes more than 3,500 loans to small manufacturers for $2.6 billion and 8,900 loans to small business startups for $5.6 billion. By statute, these lending programs are designed to operate at zero-subsidy to taxpayers. The agency has also approved over 27,000 disaster loans for more than $4 billion since Inauguration Day.

This major milestone is just the latest evidence of how President Trump’s policies are delivering growth and opportunity across the U.S. economy, which is anchored by small businesses. Since January, this Administration has created over 500,000 private sector jobs, increased real wages month after month, and boosted small business optimism above its 52-year average to a six-month high. A recent poll by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce likewise found that small business confidence has reached its highest level since 2017.

The surge in loan approvals at SBA comes even after the agency reduced its workforce by 43% earlier this year and implemented stricter underwriting standards to crack down on massive defaults and delinquencies that occurred under the Biden Administration in FY 2024. With a more efficient workforce – and more stringent underwriting guardrails – the agency is delivering near-record capital across America’s small business economy.

[TITLE]States scramble to plug transportation funding holes:
[TEXT]
By Erika Bolstad, Stateline.org

States are scrambling for the money to fill potholes, plow roads, maintain bridges and pay bus drivers as they confront inflation- and tariff-driven cost increases and declining gas tax revenues.

States also face uncertain federal funding as the Trump administration reduces the size of government and zeroes out some Biden-era transportation programs. As the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act expires next year and Congress considers its next transportation funding bill, cities are clamoring for the federal government to bypass states and give cities a larger share of federal infrastructure money distributed by formula.

Drivers will have to pay higher vehicle registration fees and gas taxes to make up for the shortfalls. Long-planned construction projects and safety improvements will be delayed. And bus riders may see fewer routes and longer wait times.

The chaos in a pair of state legislatures on either side of the country illustrates the dire state of highways and transit systems – and might foretell a bumpy road ahead.

In Oregon, nearly 500 transportation employees,

[TITLE]Low-Carbon Construction Materials Industry Analysis Report 2025: Global Market to Reach $79.2 Billion by 2030 - Net-Zero Targets, Green Building Standards and Sustainable Investment Drive Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Low-Carbon Construction Materials - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Low-Carbon Construction Materials was estimated at US$66.2 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$79.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.0% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Low-carbon construction materials are gaining rapid importance in the global effort to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable urban growth. As cities expand and infrastructure demands grow, the construction sector is under intense scrutiny for its role in greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 40 percent of global CO2 output when combined with building operations. Traditional materials such as cement, steel, and conventional concrete have particularly high carbon footprints due to energy-intensive manufacturing processes. Low-carbon alternatives are now being adopted to reduce this environmental burden without compromising performance or durability. These materials include fly ash-based cement, recycled steel, engineered timber, geopolymer concrete, and carbon-capturing bricks. They are engineered to produce fewer emissions throughout their lifecycle, from production and transport to installation and demolition.

Governments and regulatory bodies are encouraging the use of such materials through green building codes, tax incentives, and climate pledges, while international organizations advocate for net-zero construction practices. Urban planners and developers are responding by integrating low-carbon materials into the design of schools, hospitals, commercial centers, and residential buildings. These products not only reduce carbon output but also often offer benefits such as thermal insulation, moisture control, and resistance to wear and corrosion. As sustainable architecture gains cultural and economic momentum, low-carbon materials are becoming not just an environmental choice but a strategic necessity in the future of responsible construction.

What Factors Are Driving the Global Growth of the Low-Carbon Construction Materials Market?

The growth in the global low-carbon construction materials market is driven by a convergence of regulatory mandates, climate imperatives, technological readiness, and changing stakeholder priorities. One of the most significant drivers is the commitment by governments and international bodies to reach net-zero emissions targets, many of which hinge on reducing carbon in the construction sector. Legislative action in the form of stricter emissions regulations, embodied carbon reporting requirements, and green building standards is creating a policy environment that strongly favors low-carbon materials. Investment in infrastructure, particularly in regions undergoing rapid urbanization such as Asia-Pacific and Africa, is providing opportunities for the widespread adoption of new, sustainable building technologies.

Additionally, rising energy costs and material scarcity are prompting builders to consider alternatives that offer long-term economic advantages through reduced maintenance, operational efficiency, and lower lifecycle emissions. Financial institutions and investors are increasingly directing capital toward projects that meet environmental criteria, reinforcing market growth through green bonds and sustainability-linked loans. Strategic collaborations between construction firms, technology startups, and academic institutions are accelerating research and market readiness for scalable low-carbon materials.

Digital transformation in the construction industry is further enabling the integration of these materials through tools that measure, validate, and optimize carbon performance. Public awareness and advocacy are also exerting pressure on brands and developers to disclose environmental practices and adopt greener supply chains. These interlocking drivers are building a robust foundation for the expansion of the low-carbon construction materials market, ensuring it will remain a central pillar of the global transition toward a more sustainable built environment.

How Are Innovations in Material Science Transforming the Performance of Low-Carbon Alternatives?

Material science advancements are at the heart of the ongoing transformation in low-carbon construction, enabling new formulations and composites that outperform traditional materials in both sustainability and engineering terms. Researchers and manufacturers are focusing on alternative binders and aggregates that dramatically reduce the need for carbon-intensive components like Portland cement. Innovations such as alkali-activated materials, bio-cement derived from bacterial processes, and nanomaterial-enhanced concrete are emerging as high-performance, eco-conscious options. These materials can be customized for specific structural or environmental requirements, whether it`s enhancing compressive strength, improving water resistance, or increasing thermal performance.

Technologies that integrate carbon capture and utilization (CCU) directly into the production process are also being commercialized, turning construction materials into carbon sinks rather than sources. 3D printing in construction is allowing for the precise use of low-carbon material mixtures, significantly reducing waste while maintaining structural integrity. Prefabrication and modular construction methods are also gaining popularity, as they often use advanced low-carbon composites and promote resource efficiency. In addition, recycled content is being more effectively integrated into new materials, including reclaimed aggregates, crushed glass, plastic waste, and industrial byproducts like slag or fly ash. These innovations are making it possible for architects and engineers to meet strict building codes and performance standards while drastically cutting emissions. As data-driven design tools and lifecycle assessment software become more accessible, stakeholders can make informed decisions

[TITLE]Firehawk Aerospace secures $60 million investment from Presto Tech Horizons:
[TEXT]
Firehawk Aerospace has secured an oversubscribed $60 million investment round led by 1789 Capital. The venture capital firm’s partnership group includes Donald Trump Jr. Presto Tech Horizons (PTH), a defense and resilience tech fund created through a partnership between European venture capital firm Presto Ventures and Czechoslovak Group, also contributed to the round.

Firehawk is using 3D printing technology to produce propellant and solid rocket motors. The company aims to make the manufacture of advanced energetics faster, safer, and more flexible. Their approach can also be used for artillery charges, allowing ammunition production to be rapid, reliable, and scalable.

Firehawk’s method uses commercial-off-the-shelf equipment and new additive manufacturing processes to greatly reduce production times. This transforms the energetics supply chain. With this latest funding, Firehawk plans to improve Europe’s ability to locally source critical munitions supply chain elements.

Firehawk’s defense mission gains traction

This will boost resilience and ensure sustained defense readiness for NATO and allied forces. Will Edwards, CEO of Firehawk, said, “The conflict in Ukraine proves that while drones give warfighters a decisive edge, munitions like missiles and rockets are the core of combat power.

A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and propellant and energetics production are currently the biggest constraints on missile, rocket, and artillery manufacturing. Enabling the European defense industry to produce these weapons quickly and at scale is the core of Firehawk’s mission. We’re proud to partner with Presto Tech Horizons and CSG to bolster the European energetics supply chain.”

Michal Strnad, Chairman of the Board and owner of Czechoslovak Group, stressed the importance of investing in innovative defense technologies given the current geopolitical climate.

“Firehawk can play a crucial role in the future of not only rocket propulsion but also ammunition production. This innovative project can strengthen cooperation between leaders of the American and European defense industries.”

The involved parties are already looking at opportunities for industrial application of Firehawk’s technologies. Matej Luhovy, newly appointed Partner at Presto Tech Horizons, said, “Since the early 2010s, scientists and engineers have explored 3D printing to unlock faster, safer, and more flexible solid propellant production.

Firehawk is the first to truly deliver on that promise. Their technology doesn’t just speed up propellant manufacture—it fundamentally reshapes the supply chain for missiles and rockets.”

This investment marks a major milestone for Firehawk Aerospace and its mission to revolutionize the energetics supply chain for defense industries.
