[TEXT]
Agreement creates runway for Profound’s incision-free and radiation-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue, to penetrate the largest healthcare market in the Middle East

All required regulatory approvals to import and sell Profound’s two advanced ablative technologies in Saudi Arabia are already in place

TORONTO and RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Profound Medical Corp. (NASDAQ:PROF; TSX:PRN) (“Profound” or the “Company”), a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets artificial intelligence (“AI”)-powered, MRI-guided, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue, is pleased to announce that it has entered into an exclusive distribution and supply agreement for its TULSA-PRO® and Sonalleve® technologies in Saudi Arabia with Al Faisaliah Medical Systems Co. (“FMS”), a subsidiary of one of the Kingdom’s most prominent business conglomerates, Al Faisaliah Group (“AFG”).

Profound is the only company that combines the real-time imaging and thermography capabilities of magnetic resonance (“MR”) with AI-driven treatment designs to allow physicians to precisely and gently address diseased tissue without any incision, associated tissue boiling or charring, blood loss, severe/prolonged pain, or need for overnight hospital stay.

U.S. commercialization of TULSA-PRO, designed specifically for the treatment of prostate disease (prostate cancer and/or benign prostatic hyperplasia, “BPH”), remains the top priority for the Company’s direct sales team. The TULSA Procedure ™, performed using Profound’s TULSA-PRO system, is a significant advancement in prostate care. Instead of surgery or radiation, the TULSA procedure is performed inside an MRI suite to precisely and gently heat prostate tissue to ‘kill temperature’ (55-57°C) with directional ultrasound, while protecting surrounding nerves and anatomy. By intention-to-treat, while TULSA-PRO has the flexibility to be used for all ablations, including focal and hemi-gland, the majority of TULSA Procedures are either whole-gland or near-whole-gland ablations. In late 2024, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued its outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) final rule (“Final Rule”) for the three new CPT® Category 1 codes and their descriptors covering the TULSA procedure, which became effective on January 1, 2025. With the Final Rule, TULSA reimbursement was established at Urology Level 7 Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC). To-date, more than 4,000 men have undergone the TULSA Procedure, and as of last report (October 2025), Profound’s TULSA-PRO installed base stood at 67 systems.

Profound’s second product, Sonalleve, which is offered primarily as a one-time capital sale, is also gaining increasing commercial interest, particularly outside of the United States. Sonalleve uses the same MR imaging and thermographic technology as TULSA-PRO, and combines that with focused ultrasound from outside the body to treat disease. There are currently ten Sonalleve devices operational in parts of Europe, China and Southeast Asia – where over 4,000 women have already been treated with the technology for adenomyosis and uterine fibroids, diseases of the uterus that can cause chronic pain and heavy and/or prolonged menstruations. Treatment with Sonalleve has demonstrated pain and symptom relief without affecting the ovarian reserve, and with reports of women preserving their fertility. Sonalleve is also now being used in research and clinical trials in Europe for the ablation of pancreatic cancer tissue and other oncological disease. Over the last five years, approximately $10 million has been granted by research organizations in Europe and Canada to further conduct clinical research using Sonalleve for multiple, often life-threatening, diseases.

As user interest in Profound’s technologies continues to build, the Company is deploying its own direct sales team in North America, while partnering with select strategic distribution partners to support the business potential and the customer base in other parts of the world.

“We’re honored to partner for the distribution of both TULSA-PRO and Sonalleve with FMS, one of the leading medical device distributors in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” commented Profound’s CEO and Chairman, Arun Menawat. “Successfully marketing and distributing our incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue requires a deep understanding of regional market dynamics and the specific needs of local clinicians and patients. With its proven track record in introducing advanced oncological procedures and other medical technologies in the Kingdom, we’re confident that FMS is the ideal partner for us.”

FMS’ GM, Mr. Abdullah Al Melik, said, “As Saudi Arabia moves toward economic diversification under Vision 2030 , both FMS and our parent company, AFG, are committed to playing a crucial role in shaping the country’s future. The group is a major provider of equipment and services to existing hospitals, and also actively owns and operates its own specialized medical facilities. With our partnership with Profound, we're extremely excited to bring its unique, incision- and radiation-free ablative technologies to Saudi hospitals and treatment centers that aim to be worldwide leaders in patient outcomes. We look forward to working closely with the Profound team.”

[TITLE]T-Therapeutics announces Series A extension to $91 million to advance first-in-class bispecifics towards the clinic:
[TEXT]
$32 million new equity injection adds to previously announced $59 million

New investors Tencent and BGF joined by all existing major shareholders

Funds will advance pipeline of novel TCR-CD3 bispecifics in cancer and autoimmune disease

13 November 2025; Cambridge, England – T-Therapeutics, a biotechnology company developing next-generation T cell receptor (TCR) therapeutics for cancer and autoimmune disease, today announces the successful expansion of its Series A financing, raising a further $32 million. Following the initial $59 million raised, this brings the Series A total to date to $91 million.

New investors Tencent and BGF joined the Series A syndicate, alongside all existing major shareholders Sofinnova Partners, F-Prime, Digitalis Ventures, Cambridge Innovation Capital, Sanofi Ventures and the University of Cambridge Venture Fund.

T-Therapeutics will use the additional proceeds to drive its pipeline of first-in-class TCR-CD3 bispecifics across oncology and autoimmune diseases towards the clinic, including the further exploration of new therapeutic strategies such as T cell subset depletion. T-Therapeutics’ lead asset in oncology exploits a pan-tumour driver target, applicable across multiple different solid tumour types. Its lead immunology programme is a pan-autoimmune bispecific designed for precision immune reset, achieved by the selective depletion of pathogenic immune cells.

Theodora Harold, Chief Executive Officer of T-Therapeutics, said: “Our transformative medicines tackle upstream disease-drivers that can have pan-indication impact. We are delighted to have significantly added to our Series A financing, which we see as a strong validation of both our technology and our progress to date. I would like to thank Tencent and BGF for their belief in our potential, as well as all our existing investors for their continued support.”

T-Therapeutics’ TCR platform, OpTiMus®, can generate an almost unlimited repertoire of high specificity, fully human TCRs, enabling access to validated, but previously undruggable, intracellular targets. The Company also leverages its proprietary next-generation CD3 T cell engagers (TCEs), which have been engineered for high potency, superior safety and favourable pharmacokinetics. OpTiMus-derived TCRs are combined with the proprietary TCEs to form first-in-class bispecific drug candidates. T-Therapeutics’ pipeline is focused on upstream disease-drivers with pan-indication potential to deliver significant clinical benefit for patients.

Graziano Seghezzi, Managing Partner at Sofinnova Partners, said: “The existing investors co-founded T-Therapeutics to push the boundaries of bispecific technology. This additional capital enables us to expand into T cell subset depletion, one of the most exciting areas in immunology, while continuing to advance oncology programmes. We are now ideally positioned to address both cancer and autoimmune disease, two broad disease areas with critical unmet medical needs, with a platform that unlocks targets previously considered undruggable.”

Luke Rajah, Partner at BGF, added: "This is a leadership team with an outstanding track record of building successful drug discovery businesses and translating science into medicines. Backed by a syndicate of world-class life sciences investors, T-Therapeutics is uniquely positioned to unlock previously undruggable targets with its first-in-class bispecifics. We are proud to support the team and help catalyse their programmes towards the clinic.”

[TITLE]Novartis Phase III trial for next-generation malaria treatment KLU156 (GanLum) meets primary endpoint, with potential to combat antimalarial resistance:
[TEXT]
Phase III trial for KLU156 (ganaplacide/lumefantrine, or GanLum), meets primary endpoint of non-inferiority to standard of care Coartem® (artemether-lumefantrine)

Demonstrates PCR-corrected cure rate of 97.4% based on estimand method, equating to 99.2% under conventional per protocol analysis

If approved, GanLum would represent first major innovation in malaria treatment since 1999, with potential to kill drug-resistant parasites and block transmission

Novel ingredient in GanLum, ganaplacide, has entirely new mechanism of action, discovered after screening 2.3 million molecules

Highlights Novartis long-term commitment to combating malaria, with more than 1.1 billion treatment courses of Coartem provided largely at no profit, and multiple novel antimalarial compounds in development

Basel, November 12, 2025 – Novartis today announced positive results from KALUMA, a Phase III study for new malaria treatment KLU156 (ganaplacide/lumefantrine, or GanLum). The novel non-artemisinin antimalarial, which was developed with Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), met the study’s primary endpoint of non-inferiority to the current standard of care. The treatment achieved a 97.4% PCR-corrected cure rate using an estimand framework, compared to 94.0% with standard of care. This equates to cure rates of 99.2% and 96.7% respectively based on conventional per protocol analysis.

The trial studied 1,688 adults and children across 34 sites in 12 African countries, with GanLum given as a sachet of granules once a day for three days. Additional analysis indicated the treatment was highly effective against mutant malaria parasites associated with partial drug resistance. The treatment was also found to have a rapid response against mature gametocytes, the sexual stage of the parasite’s lifecycle responsible for onward transmission.

The findings come amid urgent calls to tackle the growing threat of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.1 Data were presented at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene annual meeting 2025.2

“GanLum could represent the biggest advance in malaria treatment for decades, with high efficacy against multiple forms of the parasite as well as the ability to kill mutant strains that are showing signs of resistance to current medicines,” said Dr Abdoulaye Djimdé, Professor of Parasitology and Mycology at the University of Science, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Mali. “Drug resistance is a growing threat to Africa, so new treatment options can’t come a moment too soon.”

GanLum is a combination of two compounds, attacking the malaria parasite on multiple fronts: ganaplacide, a novel compound with an entirely new mechanism of action, and a new once-daily formulation of existing antimalarial lumefantrine, a longer-acting treatment.

Ganaplacide is understood to work by disrupting the parasite’s internal protein transport systems, which are essential for its survival inside red blood cells.3 It belongs to a class of compounds called imidazolopiperazines, first identified as potential antimalarials after a groundbreaking screen of 2.3 million molecules to find drug candidates at Novartis labs in San Diego, California.

“Drug-resistant parasites threaten the efficacy of medicines that have helped to control malaria for decades,” said Shreeram Aradhye, M.D., President, Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “Together with our partners, we’ve gone further to develop a new class of antimalarial with an entirely new mechanism of action, which has the potential to both treat the disease and block transmission. We look forward to working with health authorities to bring this innovation to patients as soon as possible, helping close a critical gap in malaria care for those who need it most.”

Novartis plans to seek regulatory approvals from health authorities for GanLum as soon as possible. The combination therapy was granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2022. If authorized by regulators, GanLum would represent the first major innovation in malaria treatment since artemisinin-based combination therapies, the current gold standard treatments, were introduced more than 25 years ago.4

The treatment was developed by Novartis with the scientific and financial support of MMV, and within the framework of the WANECAM2 consortium, which is funded by the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme supported by the European Union, with co-funding from the German Aerospace Center and the UK Department of Health and Social Care.

“Antimalarial drug resistance is a ticking clock—without action today, lives will be lost,” said Dr Martin Fitchet, CEO of MMV. “GanLum’s Phase III results are a key step towards a new tool to help stay ahead of resistance. Working with Novartis and our partners, we’re committed to turning this promise into impact.”

Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE: EVH), a company that specializes in better health outcomes for people with complex conditions through proven solutions that make health care simpler and more affordable, and American Oncology Network (AON), one of the nation's fastest-growing community oncology networks, recently announced a new model enabling high-quality, more affordable, and connected cancer care — all without relying on prior authorization.

The national partnership seeks to improve clinical decision-making by introducing quality-focused interventions, driving clinical insights through an innovative data and analytics platform, and rewarding providers for high-quality care. As providers demonstrate adherence to quality, they will be "gold-carded" — no longer required to seek authorization from payers for most tests and treatments. Meanwhile, Evolent intends to use its care navigation program to complement AON's existing capabilities to help patients manage daily life with cancer and stay better connected to their oncology team. AON and Evolent expect to roll out this model in select markets in the year ahead.

[TITLE]Salarius Pharmaceuticals and Decoy Therapeutics Complete Merger:
[TEXT]
Strategic transaction supports the advancement of Decoy’s rapid computational design and manufacturing of innovative peptide conjugate therapeutics through its IMP3ACT™ platform

Combined company has pro forma cash of $14 million following merger and closing of recent public offering

HOUSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SLRX) (“Salarius” or the “Company”) and Decoy Therapeutics (“Decoy”) announce the completion of their strategic merger with the combined company now focused on advancing Decoy’s pipeline of peptide conjugate therapeutics engineered through its IMP3ACT platform that reduces the complexity of drug development and manufacturing.

“I’d like to thank both the Salarius and Decoy teams for their hard work and dedication in completing this transaction, which supports the advancement of next-generation therapeutics through our proprietary IMP3ACT Platform,” said Frederick “Rick” Pierce, Chief Executive Officer of Salarius and former Chief Executive Officer of Decoy. “By combining artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and high-speed synthesis techniques, we rapidly design, engineer and manufacture peptide conjugate drug candidates that target serious unmet medical needs. Our technology and innovations in manufacturing allow for advancing new therapies from lab to clinic to commercialization with unprecedented speed. We anticipate multiple value-creating inflection points in the coming year, initially targeting unmet needs in respiratory infectious diseases and gastroenterology (GI) oncology indications.”

Prior to this merger, Decoy attracted financing from institutional investors as well as significant non-dilutive capital from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Seed Fund, the Google AI startup program and the NVIDIA Inception program, among other sources. Decoy also received QuickFire Challenge award funding provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) through BLUE KNIGHT™, a legacy collaboration between Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS and BARDA within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

During the next 12 months, Decoy expects to advance its lead asset, a pan-coronavirus antiviral, to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to make progress on other programs including a novel broad-acting antiviral to treat flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a peptide drug conjugate targeting GI cancers.

Then new company will be renamed Decoy Therapeutics. In addition to Decoy’s Co-founder Mr. Pierce serving as Chief Executive Officer, the new company is led by Decoy’s Co-founder Chief Scientific Officer Barbara Hibner, by Decoy’s Chief Business Officer Peter Marschel, by Decoy’s Chief Technology Officer Mike Lipp and by Decoy’s acting Chief Medical Officer and Scientific Advisory Board Chair Shahin Gharakhanian, M.D. Salarius’ current Chief Financial Officer and former acting Chief Executive Officer Mark Rosenblum will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company.

According to a World Bank report published in August 2023, evidence-based digital investments can help governments save up to 15.0% of health system costs across the globe. According to a recent report from Fortune Business Insights, the global digital health market size is projected to grow from USD 427.24 billion in 2025 to USD 1,500.69 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 19.66%.

The Fortune Business Insights report added: “Artificial intelligence and machine learning have a broad number of applications in the healthcare industry, such as image analysis, patient monitoring, and medical device automation, all of which support healthcare staff in managing clinical workflows. In addition, the advances in telecommunications, particularly with the introduction of 3G, 4G, and 5G networks, have begun to release high bandwidth, increasing the adoption of digital health solutions in the healthcare industry globally and proliferating market growth. Therefore, there is a rising demand for remote health services and the integration of artificial intelligence and wearable technologies among the population. Technological advancements are evolving patient and physician preferences, improving the accessibility of patient care and services. The increasing awareness regarding remote diagnostic and virtual hospital wards in healthcare facilities, along with the rising adoption of wearable devices, are some of the major trends witnessed currently in the market.”
