Currently focused on Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the company aims to expand to the United Kingdom, the Nordic countries, the Benelux countries and France, it said in a Wednesday (Nov. 26) post on LinkedIn and in a blog post.

Procure Ai offers artificial intelligence-native procurement automation solutions that cover “all processes and use cases where AI can make a real difference,” according to the blog post.

Rather than replacing customers’ existing systems, Procure Ai’s platform integrates and enriches fragmented procurement data and enables automation across sourcing, contracting, purchasing and invoice management, the post said.

“Our platform sits on top of fragmented data landscapes and makes them intelligible — enriching what’s there rather than replacing it,” Procure Ai Cofounder and Co-CEO Yves Bauer said in the post. “That’s why we can deliver ROI in months, not years, and why our clients see us as a true partner rather than another vendor.”

The platform deploys more than 50 AI agents, including autonomous, collaborative and ambient agents, per the post.

One of its core solutions is Autonomous Spot-Buy and Tactical Sourcing, which delivers time reduction of 35% to 46% and savings of 3.7% to 5.2% per event, according to the post. Another is Quote-to-Order Intake, which enables 60% of requests to run autonomously.

“Our enterprise clients are telling us they need to process 3x the volume of sourcing events with flat or declining headcount,” Procure Ai Co-founder and Co-CEO Konstantin von Büren said in the post.

Dominic Wilhelm, partner at Headline, which led the seed round, said in the release that Procure Ai’s platform solves the procurement system rather than just isolated problems.

“Their end-to-end platform addresses the fragmented data and manual processes that plague procurement operations, delivering measurable ROI across the entire workflow,” Wilhelm said.

PYMNTS reported in October that consulting firm BCG found that procurement functions using generative AI can reduce costs by 15% to 40%, depending on category, and automate up to 30% of routine work.

In another recent development in this space, Magentic said in July that it raised $5.5 million in a funding round to accelerate the growth of its AI agent platform that finds opportunities for savings in global manufacturing supply chains.

In June, Levelpath said it raised over $55 million in a Series B funding round to scale its AI-native enterprise procurement platform that includes AI agents.

The $15 million Baobab Ventures fund will focus on pre-seed and seed technical teams and has already closed seven deals, Reina wrote in a LinkedIn post Wednesday (Nov. 26).

“The thesis for Baobab is simple: Building companies has dramatically changed over the past 3 years. What previously worked is no longer useful,” wrote Reina, who has invested in Revolut and ElevenLabs.

In an interview with Tech Funding News, Reina said he works alongside founders on market strategy, hiring, operations and sales execution at a time when launching a startup no longer means what it once did.

“Sales cycles are faster, there are hundreds of competitors within months, and AI has killed cold outreach conversion rates. Founders need to move incredibly quickly while building a sales and growth motion fit for the AI age,” he told the news outlet.

“To do that, they need operators on their cap table who can draw on relevant frontline experience from the AI era and who are hands-on with their help. This AI-informed operator experience is a clear gap in the European landscape, and it’s one I believe Baobab can fill.”

In other artificial intelligence and robotics news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the emergence of physical AI as the next stage of robotics. This is happening as the next stage of robotics makes strides in sensing, perception and large AI models give machines capabilities never supported by traditional automation.

“Earlier robots followed fixed commands and worked only in predictable environments, struggling with the unpredictability found in everyday operations such as shifting layouts, varying item shapes, mixed lighting, and human movement,” that report said.

“That is beginning to change as research groups show how simulation, digital twins and multimodal learning pipelines enable robots to learn adaptive behaviors and carry those behaviors into real facilities with minimal retraining.”

The report also points to findings from the World Economic Forum on a similar shift happening in manufacturing. Their analysis looked at how improvements in robot dexterity, machine perception, environment mapping and model-based reasoning are turning robots from isolated, fenced-off stations into shared work areas bolstering production, inspection and transport tasks.

According to the WEF research, companies are beginning to think of robots as intelligent mobile systems that can adjust to new product lines, swap out tasks and work alongside people without the need for rigid constraints.

Green Hydrogen: An Alternative That Reduces Emissions And Cares For Our Planet

The decarbonisation of the planet is among the objectives that countries around the world have set for 2050. The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels.

Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen.

Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market

This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points:

100 % sustainable: green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production.

green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production. Storable: hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production.

hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production. Versatile: green hydrogen can be transformed into electricity or synthetic gas and used for commercial, industrial or mobility purposes.

However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind:

High cost: energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain.

energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain. High energy consumption: the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels.

the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels. Safety issues: hydrogen is a highly volatile and flammable element and extensive safety measures are therefore required to prevent leakage and explosions.

Impact of green hydrogen

Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future:

Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner.

Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter.

Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

Green Hydrogen: An Alternative That Reduces Emissions And Cares For Our Planet

The decarbonisation of the planet is among the objectives that countries around the world have set for 2050. The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels.

Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen.

Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market

This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points:

100 % sustainable: green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production.

hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production. Versatile: green hydrogen can be transformed into electricity or synthetic gas and used for commercial, industrial or mobility purposes.

However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind:

High cost: energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain.

the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels. Safety issues: hydrogen is a highly volatile and flammable element and extensive safety measures are therefore required to prevent leakage and explosions.

Impact of green hydrogen

Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future:

Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner.

Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter.

Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

[TITLE]financial services sector reaction:
[TEXT]
The Chancellor’s downgrade to the economic forecasts was far smaller than anticipated-just one of the budget surprises image credit: Fred Duval/shutterstock

It is, says the government, a budget to support working households and UK businesses. Critics will argue that it represents a £26bn rise in taxes and more election promises broken.

As much of the budget had been leaked, industry commentators did at least have time to prepare their ‘instant response’ comments well in advance.

Comments, below, from over 70 industry observers range from the improbably positive to what to some may appear to represent exaggerated outrage.

In the first camp for example, James Neville, CEO of Yaspa, asserts: “Today’s Budget sends a clear and important message to the UK’s entrepreneurs like myself. The government is signalling loud and clear that if you build here, Britain will back you.”

On the other hand, Nimesh Shah, CEO of Blick Rothenberg summarises the measures as “the most damaging Budget in living memory”. He has an ally in the always quotable Nigel Green, the CEO of deVere Group. Always good for a soundbite, Green dismisses the budget as “a masterclass in disincentivising saving and investing.”

Special mention is owed to Hal Cook of Hargreaves Lansdown, for a succinct summary of why gilts really do matter.

[TITLE]Report calls on N.S. to apologize to Mi’kmaw, Black communities for environmental racism:
[TEXT]
The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.

CBC News has obtained a panel's report on environmental racism that calls for a formal apology by the Nova Scotia government. It also suggests reparations to Mi'kmaw and African Nova Scotian communities for generational harm. Michael Gorman has the story.

A report by a provincially legislated panel on environmental racism contains 14 recommendations — including a call for a formal apology by the Nova Scotia government — and suggests reparations should also be considered, according to a draft document obtained by CBC News.

Echoing throughout the report, which has yet to be made public, are calls for affected Mi’kmaw and African Nova Scotian communities to be empowered to work with the government rather than simply be consulted, “so that they themselves can hold government accountable to address the systemic issues that have been plaguing our communities.”

While the report does not specify dollar amounts, it does say that “remediating and resolving” situations that exist due to environmental racism and taking steps to help ensure such practices do not continue “will require investment.”

It also opens the door to the potential of reparations and notes that community land trusts could be one possible solution.

“Resourcing those in community and community-based organizations that have had their health, social and economic wellbeing harmed by environmental racism should be considered,” it says.

The 30-page draft was delivered to the provincial government in February 2024. But since last spring, multiple cabinet ministers have declined to detail its content, say whether it would be made public or confirm if they’d even read it.

Following pressure from Mi’kmaw chiefs and opposition MLAs, Environment Minister Tim Halman confirmed to reporters earlier this month that a meeting between cabinet ministers and panel members to discuss the recommendations and what to do with the report has been scheduled before Christmas.

Although government officials have said the panel’s mandate did not specify that the document would be shared beyond internal circles, the report’s conclusion suggests panel members saw a role for a broader sharing of the information.

[TITLE]Transport Minister says MetroLink plans could be derailed for two years:
[TEXT]
A legal challenge to the MetroLink project is expected to delay its construction by two years

An expected delay to the construction of the long-awaited MetroLink rail line could be as long as two years, Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien has indicated in the aftermath of a High Court challenge to the project.

Mr O’Brien said he was disappointed that judicial review proceedings had been initiated in the courts this week. “It will push our time frame out, frankly,” he said.

It would now “be a stretch” to think construction of the multibillion rail project could begin in 2027 as scheduled, he said, but added: “We will commence this project within the term of this Government.” The current Government is due to be in place until the end of 2029.

Mr O’Brien was speaking on the publication of funding allocation, totalling €24.3 billion, for transport projects from 2026-2030 as part of the National Development Plan (NDP).

The previous government had a 2:1 ratio in favour of public transport funding over roads, when the Green Party’s Eamon Ryan was minister for transport. However, the new plan has allocated €10.1 billion for public transport projects and €9.7 billion for the road network and road safety.

MetroLink, a 19km rail line from Swords in north Dublin to Charlemont in South Dublin, serving Dublin Airport and the city centre, was approved by An Coimisiún Pleanala on September 30th. However, on Monday a group of residents in Dartmouth Square in the South Dublin suburb of Ranelagh initiated judicial review proceedings against the decision to grant permission for the multibillion euro project.

Mr O’Brien said he hoped they would reconsider their action and perhaps resolve their issues through a “mediation” process.

“I might not agree with the decision that they have taken but I respect the right that they have to actually take it. I just want it dealt with quickly, because we want to start Metro, we will start Metro, in the term of this Government.”

The NDP has allocated funding for a number of other Dublin public transport projects, including the Luas extension to Finglas, the Dart+ expansion programme, and BusConnects.

[ Dublin MetroLink construction will need 8,000 workers, committee toldOpens in new window ]

BusConnects projects are also being funded in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford over the 2026-2030 period.

The long-awaited Navan rail line will progress through the planning process during the period, as will Luas in Cork. Construction is scheduled to begin on the Western Rail Corridor between Athenry in Galway and Claremorris in Mayo.

The €9.7 billion investment in roads will be used to renew the existing network in addition to the development of new national, regional and bypass projects. The roll out of EV charging infrastructure will also be funded.

Large road projects expected to progress under the plan include the Galway City Ring Road, currently under consideration by An Coimisiún Pleanála; the Slane bypass; the N17 Knock to Collooney road in Co Sligo; the M20 Cork to Limerick route; and the upgraded Limerick to Foynes road, including the Adare bypass.

A number of smaller projects are also expected to move to construction including the N3 Clonee to M50 road; the Mallow relief road; the Ardee bypass; and the Foxford transport project.

The plan allows for €1.8 billion to be invested in the delivery of 1,000km of “active travel” walking and cycling projects. Large projects in 2026 include the Sustainable Transport Bridge in Waterford; the Glanmire Urban Greenway in Cork City; and the Ballybane and Castlepark Cycle Network in Galway.
