[TITLE]Oil Stabilizes After Selloff Amid OPEC Reassessment and U.S. Funding Deal:
[TEXT]
Oil prices steadied on Wednesday after a sharp 4% slide the day before, with Brent trading near $63.08 and WTI around $58.80 at 11:01 a.m. ET, as traders reassessed the latest OPEC shift toward a more balanced 2026 market outlook. The passage of the U.S. funding deal that ended the government shutdown removed one macro problem, but crude remained focused on supply signals rather than broader risk sentiment.

The modest rebound contrasted with the equity rally highlighted by Bloomberg, where U.S. indices advanced on softer inflation readings, renewed risk appetite and relief following the shutdown resolution. The move in equities had limited pull on crude, which stayed driven by evolving supply projections and near-term balance concerns.

The recovery follows Tuesday’s selloff linked to OPEC’s updated projections, which show the cartel moving away from its earlier deficit view and toward a neutral supply-demand balance next year. Traders reacted to signals that rising non-OPEC output and incremental OPEC+ barrels could offset moderate consumption growth. Those factors, combined with a softer demand trajectory outlined in the IEA’s latest assessment, left the market focused on potential surplus risk.

Diesel margins firmed during the session, while crude futures recovered more slowly. Murban traded near 65.43 on steady Asian buying and stable demand for middle distillates. Natural gas edged toward 4.62, supported by early-season heating needs and lower storage levels.

The Bloomberg update showed equities rising as Treasury yields fell, but that shift offered little lift to crude. Traders said oil remains tied to OPEC+ supply decisions and demand expectations through early 2026, not the broader market mood.

A softer dollar and lower Treasury yields added some support to commodities, though they did not shift the outlook for crude supplies. Asia continued to take regular cargoes, and early-winter demand for diesel and jet fuel stayed firm. Traders said many positions were still small following Tuesday’s selloff as the market waits for guidance on upcoming OPEC+ output levels and demand expectations for early 2026.

[TITLE]Trump DOE gives Microsoft partner $1B loan to restart Three Mile Island reactor:
[TEXT]
The Trump administration announced Tuesday it would provide Constellation Energy with a $1 billion loan to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island.

The energy company said last year it would reopen the reactor, which had been shuttered since 2019, after Microsoft committed to purchasing all the electricity from the 835 megawatt power plant for two decades. Constellation estimated the project would cost $1.6 billion, and it expects to complete the refurbishment in 2028.

Terms of Microsoft’s deal with Constellation weren’t disclosed. Analysts at Jefferies have estimated the tech company might be paying about $110 to $115 per megawatt-hour over 20 years of the deal.

That’s cheaper than a brand-new nuclear power plant would cost, but it’s a hefty premium over wind, solar, and geothermal, according to a comparison of energy costs from Lazard. Even wind and solar projects outfitted with utility-scale batteries to enable 24/7 power are cheaper.

Nonetheless, tech companies have recently fallen in love with nuclear as power demands for their data centers and AI efforts have skyrocketed. This summer, Microsoft competitor Meta signed its own deal with Constellation, buying the “clean energy attributes” of a 1.1 gigawatt nuclear power plant in Illinois.

The reactor at Three Mile Island that’s being restarted isn’t the infamous Unit 2, which melted down in 1979. Rather, it’s Unit 1, which was commissioned in 1974 and taken offline in 2019 as cheap natural gas eroded its profitability.

The debt facility is being made through the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which was formed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to foster the growth of clean energy technologies.

The LPO is most famous for its loan to Solyndra, a U.S. solar startup that went belly-up during the Great Recession. Overall, though, experts consider the LPO a success, with a default rate of 3.3% after recoveries. Tesla, for instance, received a $465 million loan under the program in 2010 and paid it back by 2013.

Last month, the LPO finalized a $1.6 billion loan to American Electric Power, using federal dollars to support the upgrade of around 5,000 miles of transmission lines.

The Inflation Reduction Act, which passed during the Biden administration, created another pot of money under the LPO known as the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program. That program was created to restore existing power plants to operation provided they avoid or reduce pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration kept it largely in tact, rebranding it the Energy Dominance Financing Program.

[TITLE]Is The UAE’s Gas Gamble in Syria A Triple Win for Washington?:
[TEXT]
The US and Great Britain are ramping up their efforts to secure the strategic advantage they created for the West in the Middle East by removing Russia’s key man in Syria, Bashar al-Assad, in December. A critical part of the political, economic, religious, and security fabric of the Middle East, it is also a crucial link from there to Africa in the south and to Europe in the West, by dint of its long Mediterranean coastline, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order. The key to keeping Syria aligned with the West is to build up its economy with investment and on-the-ground help from Western firms, with a particular focus on the country’s previous main source of revenues – gas and oil exports. Handily for the West, such projects also legally allow for the stationing of ‘security’ personnel on these sites into which investment is being funnelled, along with any other assets that the companies involved might think fit to secure their operations. Alongside these, Washington and London believe lessons were learned from previous forays into Iraq and Libya, wherein the West’s efforts in those countries were increasingly regarded as neo-Crusader-like occupations by the indigenous populace, the longer they persisted. Consequently, moves are being made this time around to obviate such objections through the presence of Arabic states happy to work alongside their Western counterparts. Cue the United Arab Emirates (UAE), whose powerhouse enterprise Dana Gas last week signed a preliminary deal with Syria’s state oil company to look at redeveloping the country’s natural gas fields.

Such fields were a foundation stone for Syria’s economy for years, along with oil, and it suffered less damage than its hydrocarbon counterpart during the 13-year-long civil war. Before the outbreak of hostilities, Syria’s gas output was around 316 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of dry natural gas, with proven reserves of 8.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf). This had not gone unnoticed by Russia (along with its sizeable oil reserves and the strategic importance of its Mediterranean coastline), which had busily established a significant presence on the ground even before the civil war began in 2011. In fact, Stroytransgaz had begun the build-out of Syria’s South-Central Gas Area in 2009, which by 2011 had boosted the country’s natural gas production by

[TITLE]RE sector financing doubles as outstanding loans surge 2x in Sep:
[TEXT]
Indian banks are bullish on India’s renewable energy (RE) sector with loans outstanding to the sector as of September, more than doubling year-on-year (y-o-y).

Data from RBI shows that the outstanding credit to the renewable energy sector stood at ₹14,842 crore as of September 2025 as against ₹6,778 crore in the same period last year.

The growth significantly outpaces the rate of growth in other priority sectors like agriculture, MSMEs and Housing and is also up compared to the 39 per cent y-o-y growth from the September 2023 to September 2024 period

Speaking to businessline, industry experts said the increase in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution with GST reductions and favourable policy landscape pushing projects that were previously on hold to the implementation stage.

Healthy growth

Sachin Sachdeva, Vice President, Sector Head - Financial Sector Ratings , ICRA Ltd, said the overall growth of renewable energy sector remains healthy with significant capacity additions taking place y-o-y. “Consequently, a large part of the funding goes towards the under-construction projects as the already developed project would primarily have refinancing requirements,” he added.

Sachdeva noted that large infrastructure non-banking finance companies (NBFC-IFCs), who have a big play in the RE space, have also seen their assets under management (AUM) grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 30 per cent over the last two years.

Ramneek Sehgal, Chairman & Managing Director of infrastructure firm Ceigall India Ltd, noted that the surge in renewable financing reflects a strong acceleration in project execution rather than just pipeline build-up, especially in the solar energy sector.

“With the sharp reduction in solar module prices and the ramp-up of domestic manufacturing capacity, many projects that were previously on hold have now moved into the implementation stage,” he said. Sehgal added that the solar sector has opened up after a period of supply-side constraints and policy adjustments with 42 Giga Watt of solar capacity additions expected in FY26.

Overall installed RE capacity in India as of October 2025 stood at around 2 lakh Mega Watt (MW) (excluding Large Hydro Power) with 27,927 MW added in the April-Oct 2025 period.

Vivek Jain, Director, India Ratings and Research said, “When we look at the loans outstanding it is a combination of both under-construction and commissioned projects and hence we see a significant jump in loans outstanding,” he added. Jain mentions that this trend will persist if under-construction projects continue at the same pace but if their pace declines, the loan growth would appear slower than capacity growth.

Costs moderating

Experts added that the rise in financing is more reflective of expanding execution activity rather than cost inflation.

“Input and equipment costs have largely stabilised over the past year. In fact, the reduction in GST and improved domestic supply chains have helped offset earlier cost pressures. Across the industry, scale efficiencies and better value engineering are enabling developers to optimize overall project costs,” Sehgal said.

Sachdeva from ICRA says project costs have generally trended downward and the growth in funding to the sector seems to be primarily driven by capacity additions taking place at a faster pace.
