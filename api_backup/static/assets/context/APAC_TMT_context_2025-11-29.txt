[TITLE]CNBC's The China Connection newsletter: Foreign investors warm to China’s cheaper AI valuations despite fears of a U.S. bubble:

The big story

Sitting in his new Beijing office, AI2 Robotics Founder and CEO Eric Guo wistfully reflected on fundraising challenges in China — and noted that U.S.-based humanoid rival Figure recently raised $1 billion in a single round, at a $39 billion valuation. That's far more than what a Chinese robotics company can typically raise, he said. His strategy for growth? Do more with less. That means, for instance, developing a robotics AI model that uses less than 10% of the parameters required to train Alphabet's RT-2 AI model, as laid out in one of Guo's widely cited papers. Guo, who holds a Ph.D. from Purdue University, previously worked at Microsoft, smartphone maker Oppo and electric vehicle company Xpeng. It mirrors how DeepSeek and other Chinese players have slashed AI costs for users, and allowed them to claim AI development budgets far below OpenAI's estimated spending, which has exceeded $100 billion. That strategy is enough to make AI2 Robotics one of China's hottest investment targets. The Shenzhen-based startup hit a $1 billion valuation this fall, reaching unicorn status just over two years after launch — thanks to a whopping nine fundraising rounds so far this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

A fraction of the money

The hot U.S. AI trade has shifted to Alphabet this week following rave reviews of its newest AI model — just weeks after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a rare tech position in the stock. Michael Burry, known for calling the U.S. housing crash before 2008, was the latest voice to warn of bubble risks in U.S. AI names that have powered recent market gains on Monday. But whatever's bubbling up in China's tech sector, it pales in comparison with the U.S. U.S. venture deals in AI and robotics have more than quadrupled since 2023 to exceed $160 billion so far this year, according to a CNBC analysis of PitchBook data. Comparable deals in China this year are just over $10 billion — only slightly more than the $9.24 billion recorded in 2023, the data showed. It's a confluence of regulatory pressures in China, U.S. export controls and a scrappy startup environment where locals have overcome stringent pandemic lockdowns to stay competitive. Global investors are increasingly interested. Bubble risks for Chinese AI firms appear far more contained than in the U.S., said Vincent Lu, partner and head of private equity at Australian asset manager Boman Group. The Melbourne-based firm oversees AU$910 million ($591.26 million), mostly allocated in Australia and North America, and has participated in funding rounds for U.S.-based Anthropic earlier this year and OpenAI last year. Lu was "so intrigued" by China's AI and robotics scene that he moved back to Shanghai from Melbourne last year to scout deals, and is just starting to get serious

[TITLE]CNBC Daily Open: A turnaround in sentiment for U.S. markets may be in the cards:
[TEXT]
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Nov. 21, 2025 in New York City.

Last week on Wall Street, two forces dragged stocks lower: a set of high-stakes numbers from Nvidia and the U.S. jobs report that landed with more heat than expected. But the leaves that remained after hot tea scalded investors seemed to augur good tidings.

Even though Nvidia's third-quarter results easily breezed past Wall Street's estimates, they couldn't quell worries

[TITLE]Asian stocks rally on weak US data and Fed rate cut hopes:
[TEXT]
Asia extended a global equities rally on Wednesday after another round of tepid US data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month.

A report that US President Donald Trump’s top economic aide was the frontrunner to be the central bank’s next boss added to the risk-on mood as investors rediscovered their mojo after a recent stutter.

Bets that officials will lower borrowing costs at their December meeting have surged this week after a number of key members of the policy board said they backed a third successive cut as fears

[TITLE]Wall Street edges higher amid tech gains and renewed hopes of Fed rate cut:
[TEXT]
The U.S. stock market rose on Monday, spurred by a jump in tech stocks and renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve may slash its benchmark interest rate at its December meeting.

The S&P 500 climbed 108 points, or 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.6%, as of 2:10 p.m. EDT. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.7%.

Companies with investments in artificial intelligence saw gains on Monday. Alphabet, which has been getting praise for its newest Gemini AI model, rallied 5.5% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. The jump in tech stocks comes as investors continue to assess the potential of AI-focused businesses, even as questions remain

[TITLE]Another rally for Alphabet leads the US stock market higher:
[TEXT]
By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market rallied on Monday, at the start of a week with shortened trading because of the Thanksgiving holiday.

The S&P 500 climbed 1.5% for one of its best days since the summer and added to its jump from Friday, finding some strength following a shaky few weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 202 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 2.7%.

Stocks got a lift from rising hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate again at its next meeting in December, a move that could boost the economy and investment prices.

The market also benefited from strength for stocks caught up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy. Alphabet, which has been getting praise for its newest Gemini AI model, rallied 6.3% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Nvidia rose 2.1%.

Monday’s gains followed sharp swings in recent weeks, not just day to day but also hour to hour, caused by uncertainty
