The company announced Monday (Sept. 8) that it had entered into a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) agreement that will see CoinShares list on the Nasdaq, valuing it at $1.2 billion. Following the agreement, CoinShares will delist from the Swedish market.

Jean-Marie Mognetti, co-founder and CEO of CoinShares, said the transaction marks an effort by the company to achieve “global leadership” amid a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto.

“The case for digital assets as an investment class and blockchain as a transformative technology has reached a decisive inflection point and can no longer be ignored. There is no going back,” he said. “The U.S. is now serving as the crucible of the digital asset space. By listing in the United States, CoinShares is positioning itself to meet growing investor demand and to participate more fully in the evolution of this new industry.”

The company said in the release said that it is the fourth-largest manager of digital asset ETP products globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale and Fidelity, and the top manager in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a 34% market share.

The company also has roughly $10 billion in assets under management, a figure that has tripled in the last two years. CoinShares said it has also gone from a single platform with four products in 2021 to a 32-product suite spread across four platforms.

CoinShares is among several crypto firms that have made an effort to go public on the U.S. markets this year, either through an initial public offering (IPO) or SPAC deals. This is happening as the U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, embraces the crypto sector after years of regulatory crackdown.

Among the companies to already list are Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which had a blockbuster IPO earlier this year. The crypto exchange Bullish enjoyed similar success when it went public last month.

“With Circle’s entry into the public market, a new chapter looks set to begin,” PYMNTS wrote June 5. “With blue-chip banks underwriting the deal and retail investors clamoring for shares, the traditional finance world appears more open than ever to embracing digital assets. Or, at least, the potentially regulated and transparent kind of digital assets.”

Still to come is the IPO from crypto exchange Gemini, which said last week it is targeting a $2.1 valuation when it goes public.

[TITLE]OpenAI #14: OpenAI Descends Into Paranoia and Bad Faith Lobbying — LessWrong:
[TEXT]
I am a little late to the party on several key developments at OpenAI:

OpenAI’s Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane was central to the creation of the new $100 million PAC where they will partner with a16z to oppose any and all attempts of states to regulate AI in any way for any reason. Effectively as part of that effort, OpenAI sent a deeply bad faith letter to Governor Newsom opposing SB 53. OpenAI seemingly has embraced descending fully into paranoia around various nonprofit organizations and also Effective Altruism in general, or at least is engaging in rhetoric and legal action to that effect, joining the style of Obvious Nonsense rhetoric

[TITLE]What’s up with… Qualcomm & BMW, SpaceX, Mistral AI & ASML:
[TEXT]
In today’s industry news roundup: Qualcomm and BMW shift up a gear with their new scalable automated driving platform; SpaceX acquires Echostar spectrum to strengthen Starlink’s direct-to-cell satellite network and enable faster, more reliable 5G coverage; ASML reportedly throws financial weight behind Mistral AI, Europe’s answer to OpenAI and Anthropic; and much more!

Qualcomm Technologies and BMW Group have unveiled Snapdragon Ride Pilot, a jointly developed automated driving (AD) platform designed to bring advanced driver assistance capabilities to production vehicles worldwide. Debuting in the new BMW iX3, the system combines Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Ride system-on-chips (SoCs) with a new automated driving software stack co-developed by the partners. The solution is engineered to scale across a wide spectrum of assisted and automated driving functions, from New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) requirements through to Level 2+ capabilities, such as highway and urban navigation on autopilot (NOA). Validated for deployment in 60 markets, the system is expected to expand its reach to more than 100 countries by 2026. Beyond BMW, it is now available to other automakers and Tier-1 suppliers as a turnkey solution. “This collaboration has enabled us to develop a cutting-edge driver assistance system, setting a new benchmark,” said Dr. Mihiar Ayoubi, senior vice president development driving experience, at BMW Group. The collaborative effort involved more than 1,400 engineers, with Qualcomm developing the perception stack, while the drive policy engine was co-created with BMW, allowing manufacturers to integrate their own custom policy layers or adopt the platform wholesale. The launch comes amid an increasingly competitive ADAS and automated driving landscape, where established automotive suppliers are jostling alongside semiconductor players. With Snapdragon Ride Pilot, Qualcomm aims to leverage its silicon and software ecosystem to position itself as a Tier-1 partner in its own right, offering automakers a scalable route to higher automation levels without the cost and complexity of developing bespoke platforms. “This is also a good day for Qualcomm, as BMW is a great proof point for the capability of the Snapdragon Ride,” noted tech sector analyst Richard Windsor in his latest Radio Free Mobile blog, “and I think it will gain more clients for the chip, although there may be some hesitance to take the driving stack as well.”

SpaceX has struck a purchase agreement with EchoStar, acquiring 50MHz of exclusive S-band spectrum in the US alongside global mobile satellite service (MSS) spectrum rights. The move provides a regulatory and technical foundation for the next generation of its Starlink direct-to-cell (D2C) constellation, which aims to eliminate mobile dead zones and deliver full 5G-grade connectivity via satellite. In January 2024, SpaceX began deploying Starlink satellites with direct-to-cell capabilities, leveraging its laser-linked, 8,000-strong LEO constellation to eliminate mobile dead zones. At the time, more than 90% of the earth remained uncovered by terrestrial service. Starlink says its direct-to-cell service now connects over six million users worldwide. The acquisition of EchoStar’s S-Band spectrum (known as AWS-4 and PCS-H), as well as its global MSS licences, represents a critical enabler for the operator’s next step. SpaceX plans to design and launch a new generation of satellites using proprietary silicon and advanced phased array antennas, allowing thousands of spatial beams and significantly higher throughput. The company claims these innovations will deliver as much as 20 times the performance of current spacecraft, and more than 100 times the overall system capacity. By combining its expanded spectrum rights with optimised 5G protocols, SpaceX intends to offer mobile operators an augmentation strategy, extending their terrestrial 5G networks into remote and underserved regions, and providing resilient coverage during emergencies.

Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML will become the top shareholder in Mistral AI through a €1.3bn commitment to the French startup’s €1.7bn Series C funding round, according to a report by Reuters. (At the time of writing, neither ASML nor Mistral had commented publicly on the Reuters announcement). The deal would give ASML a board seat at Mistral AI and propel the Paris-based firm to a €10bn valuation, making it Europe’s most valuable AI company. For ASML, best known as the sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines required to manufacture cutting-edge semiconductors, the move represents a rare foray into software. By deepening ties with Mistral, ASML could further integrate advanced analytics and generative AI into its toolset, driving efficiency and opening avenues for new product lines. For Mistral AI, the deal offers deep-pocketed backing from one of Europe’s most strategically vital technology firms, complementing existing investors, such as Nvidia. Founded in 2023, Mistral AI has positioned itself as Europe’s answer to OpenAI and Anthropic, aiming to develop open-weight, sovereign AI models that reduce reliance on US and Chinese technology. A partnership with ASML would be a potent symbol of Europe’s desire to consolidate its strengths in both hardware and AI to remain competitive on the global stage. The investment comes as European policymakers intensify calls for digital sovereignty amid concerns that AI development risks becoming dominated by US firms. Mistral’s €10bn valuation underscores both the speed of capital flowing into AI and the strategic weight governments and industry alike are placing on local champions. Should the deal close as reported, it will mark a milestone in Europe’s bid to forge a vertically integrated ecosystem where chip innovation and AI leadership reinforce each other.

Nokia has announced a strategic partnership with Supermicro to deliver integrated datacentre networking solutions optimised for AI, high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud environments. The agreement aligns Supermicro’s 800G Ethernet switching hardware with Nokia’s Service Router Linux (SR Linux) network operating system and Event-Driven Automation (EDA) platform. The companies said the move addresses a pivotal moment for datacentres, as operators face the challenge of scaling infrastructure to meet the demands of AI and cloud workloads. By offering a pre-validated, turnkey package, Nokia and Supermicro claim customers will be able to reduce deployment timelines, streamline daily operations and lower overall costs. “This collaboration gives our customers more choice and flexibility in how they build their infrastructure,” said Cenly Chen, chief growth officer, senior vice president and managing director at Supermicro. “It strengthens our ability to deliver networked compute architectures for high-performance workloads, while simplifying orchestration and automation with a unified platform.” Vach Kompella, senior vice president and general manager of Nokia’s IP Networks Division, added that the partnership “gives us significantly greater reach into the enterprise market through Supermicro’s extensive channels and direct sales, aligning with our strategy to expand in cloud, HPC and AI-driven infrastructure.” By pooling Nokia’s software-driven automation with Supermicro’s established presence in compute and storage, the partnership aims to provide a fully integrated networking architecture positioned for the next wave of AI-driven datacentre transformation.

Vodafone has turned to Nomia to overhaul its management of tail spend – low-value, non-strategic procurement often overlooked in large organisations. The partnership with Vodafone Procure & Connect will see Nomia’s AI-enhanced platform deployed globally to increase efficiency, compliance and insight into fragmented supplier activity. While often neglected, analysts estimate that tail spend can account for 20% of total procurement outlay across thousands of small transactions. Industry studies show that actively managing this category can unlock hidden savings, improve data quality and consolidate supplier relationships. With Nomia, Vodafone expects greater consistency, resilience and control across its procurement operations. “For global organisations, tail spend isn’t just a procurement challenge, it’s a question of control,” said Nick Petheram, CEO of Nomia, adding that the partnership “enables Vodafone to drive innovation by tapping into specialist suppliers, uncovering new insights and making faster, smarter decisions.” Ninian Wilson, global supply chain director at Vodafone, added: “Tail spend can be fragmented and complex to manage. Nomia gives us the confidence that we’re managing it with the right level of oversight, compliance and governance.” Nomia will operate as an embedded extension of Vodafone’s team, combining AI speed with expert guidance to transform what is traditionally an inefficient procurement segment into a strategic asset.

Cerillion has signed two substantial follow-on contracts with a major European customer, adding £17.3m in new business to the £8m agreement announced in May 2025. The three deals together total £25.3m over an initial five-year term, representing one of the company’s largest commercial wins to date. All three contracts relate to the integration of a newly acquired Tier-1 customer base onto Cerillion’s existing BSS/OSS platform. The latest agreements include software licences, maintenance, managed services and access to Cerillion’s Evergreen programme for continual product updates. “This deepens and broadens our relationship with a strategically important customer,” said CEO Louis Hall. “It validates our product-centric approach, enabling clients to lower costs, boost efficiency and enhance user experience,” he added.

[TITLE]Cognition Raises $400 Million to Bolster AI Agent Efforts:

The startup announced Monday (Sept. 8) that it had raised $400 million in a funding round, the latest in a series of AI firms seeing their valuations skyrocket recently.

“We founded Cognition last year to build the future of software engineering,” Co-founder and CEO Scott Wu wrote on the company blog.

“We envision a world of software abundance where engineers become architects, solving the most challenging problems and focusing on their creative visions while tasking an army of autonomous agents to support them on everything else.”

Last March, Wu added, Cognition debuted “Devin,” its AI software engineer. At the time, it was an adept but “very junior” engineer. Now, while “we are still in the earliest innings of AI code,” AI agents are working alongside individual developers and within large enterprise engineering teams.

“As with many technologies throughout history, what first seemed a fringe theory quickly became an obvious reality,” Wu added, first with Devin and then with Windsurf, the AI code generation startup Cognition acquired in July.

And that purchase followed Google’s deal to recruit several Windsurf executives and researchers, which itself came after months of negotiations between Windsurf and OpenAI. The latter company which had explored a possible acquisition valued at $3 billion.

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Cognition had raised $500 million in a funding round that doubled the company’s valuation to $9.8 billion. The same report noted the company raised $300 million in an earlier round this year, valuing it at $4 billion.

Writing about the use of AI agents earlier this month, PYMNTS posited a scenario in which an agent, outfitted with a realistic avatar, can serve as a treasurer, with that avatar functioning as a “conduit of explainability.”

“Imagine a treasury meeting where the AI treasurer presents cash forecasts, highlighting potential liquidity shortfalls two quarters out,” the report said.

“The avatar explains that a pattern in supplier payments and foreign exchange exposures points to risk. When asked why the system recommends hedging euro-denominated receivables, the avatar cites real-time volatility metrics, historical correlations, stress tests, then executes the hedge instantly once approved.”

At the same time, PYMNTS Intelligence research has shown some reluctance among finance chiefs to embrace agentic AI, with just 15% of executives surveyed saying they were even considering the technology, and most still in the early evaluation stage.

[TITLE]Europe Must Use Its Economic “Bazooka” Against the US:
[TEXT]
Nothing is ever final with US President Donald Trump, who recently threatened new tariffs against the European Union and its member states for their digital regulations and taxes. The EU must finally stand up for itself by activating its most powerful tool against economic pressure, the Anti-Coercion Instrument.

BRUSSELS/FLORENCE – As European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen prepares to deliver her annual State of the Union address, she is under pressure from all sides. The trade deal reached with the United States at the end of July, though unbalanced and asymmetric, has not brought back stability and predictability. Instead, US President Donald Trump has recently ratcheted up his trade salvos against Europe. In social-media posts, he has threatened additional tariffs and export restrictions on US technology and semiconductors for countries with digital rules and taxes, and has indicated that he could impose new tariffs in response to the European Commission’s $3.5 billion fine against Google for unfairly favoring its own advertising technology services.

Trump’s threats came just a few days after the US and the European Union reached a framework agreement for the handshake trade deal, which European policymakers had hoped would settle matters. But nothing is ever final with Trump. His new attack on foreign oversight of US tech companies – such as the EU’s landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, as well as digital-services taxes in member states – has the potential to undermine Europe’s sovereignty and its democratic foundations.

Negotiating with Trump is a bit like playing poker, with escalating bids – and sometimes bluffing – over the course of negotiations. But it is also like chess: each move counts toward the endgame and thus requires careful preparation. When early opportunities are squandered, one can hardly expect to gain the upper hand against an unpredictable and more powerful adversary.

For example, the EU could have cornered the US in April and May, after Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs and sent investors into a tailspin. But unlike China, which forced Trump to negotiate under market pressure, the EU decided to delay its retaliatory measures following Trump’s announcement of a 90-day “pause” on his sweeping tariffs mere hours after they took effect.

The EU’s wait-and-see approach proved costly. By summer, the situation had changed: markets had stabilized, and the US and China had reached a provisional trade deal. This, coupled with the declining credibility of its retaliation threat, weakened the EU’s negotiating position, creating a sense of inevitability

[TITLE]Gibraltar government backs plans to build 250MW datacentre on island to tap into AI boom:
[TEXT]
Plans are afoot to build a 250MW datacentre on the British overseas territory of Gibraltar by 2033 that its developers claim will run on power sourced independently from the island’s electrical grid.

The project – based at the port of Gibraltar – will be the first build to be overseen by development company Pelagos Data Centres, and is on course to become one of the island’s largest ever infrastructure initiatives.

According to Pelagos Data Centres, the development is expected to attract investment of around £1.8bn and will create up to 100 permanent jobs once completed.

Its construction is expected to proceed in five phases, which will require the recruitment of up to 500 individuals to work on the project.

The first stage of the development is on course for completion by 2027. After this, the developers anticipate the remaining phases will be completed at approximately 18-month intervals.

“Funded entirely by private investment and backed by the government of Gibraltar, the Pelagos Data Centres Project represents a transformative step for the territory’s digital and economic landscape,” the company said in a statement.

“It will also make an important contribution to meeting Europe’s demand for datacentre capacity, positioning Gibraltar as a significant new node in Europe’s digital infrastructure that can serve the broader needs of the UK and continental Europe.”

Pelagos Data Centres chair Konstantin Sokolov said the project “marks a new chapter for Gibraltar and for Europe’s digital capabilities” and will position the island to tap into the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

“Just as electricity and the internet transformed society in the past, AI is now emerging as the defining technology of our time, with the power to redefine entire industries, economies and communities,” said Sokolov.

“With our new facility, Pelagos Data Centres is laying the foundation for the next era of AI-driven innovation, positioning Gibraltar as a strategic hub and enabling Europe’s brightest minds to unlock the full potential of this revolutionary technology.”

The project is also aiming to host AI workloads using renewable energy sources while minimising the risk posed to the security of the island’s electrical grid.

This will be achieved by powering the site from on-site generators that will run on a mix of renewable energy sources and liquified natural gas, which the developers claim means the project will have no impact on the island’s electricity supply.

The developers have also committed to ensuring the site runs completely on renewable energy by 2030, and repurposing the site’s waste heat for use by other community projects on Gibraltar.

Joe Bossano, Gibraltar’s minister for economic development and inward investment, said the development will future-proof the island’s economy.

“This is the most significant infrastructure investment in Gibraltar since the early 1990s, when the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party Government brought state-of-the-art telecommunications as inward investment from the United States and made possible the creation of a centre for online services,” said Bossano. “Then, we future-proofed Gibraltar’s economy. Today, we are doing so again.”

News of the project comes at a time with demand for large-scale datacentres is on the rise, with the UK government in the midst of an ambitious plan to build out the country’s compute capacity due to the growing demand for AI services.

[TITLE]Telefonica looks to M&A to give European telecoms broader vision:
[TEXT]
By Andres Gonzalez

LONDON (Reuters) -Spanish telecoms group Telefonica is looking to buy telecom assets and free up resources by selling its Spanish-speaking Latin American assets, as CEO Marc Murtra plots a broader vision for Europe's telco sector.

The group is eyeing assets in Germany, the UK, Spain and Brazil, Murtra told Reuters as he prepares his first strategic plan for Telefonica after taking the helm in January.

While wanting to chase scale, the Spanish group must maintain its investment grade credit rating, he said.

Regulators have long pushed back against mergers between European operators, fearing a few dominant players would be able to increase prices and margins to the disadvantage of the consumer, but Murtra argues that Europe's market is too fragmented.

In 2024, there were 41 companies in Europe that offered mobile services to more than 500,000 customers each, compared with five in the United States, four each in China and Japan and three in South Korea, according to Connect Europe.

Murtra, who was president of Spanish defence and technology group Indra until early this year, says the market is changing with the development of new technologies including AI, and Europe needs to keep up or lose out.

European telecom groups should be allowed to expand and in exchange invest in other, related sectors such as cybersecurity and infrastructure including data centers, as a "social contract" between authorities and companies, he said.

"If Europe wants strategic autonomy and technology, we're going to have to have large or titanic European technology operators," Murtra, 52, told Reuters.

"I don't want to be overly dramatic, but imagine a Europe where the satellite systems, the hyperscalers and artificial intelligence are in the hands of tech bros - and this could happen."

Murtra, who is also Telefonica's executive chairman, has been speaking in recent months to regulators and leaders

[TITLE]‘Deep fake’ image of David McWilliams used to dupe social media users, says commentator:

A pensioner who invested €15,000 after an online financial advisory site fraudulently claimed to be endorsed by David McWilliams is just one of many who have been duped, the economist and commentator has said.

Mr McWilliams, a columnist with The Irish Times, said a series of advertisements had been appearing on social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube purporting to show him in support of financial investments, without his prior knowledge or approval.

Recently the social media posts have been using artificial intelligence claiming to show Mr McWilliams exposing “secrets” of the wealthy with fellow broadcaster Tommy Tiernan, before “being bundled out of the studio”.

The posts frequently carry fake representations of Irish national newspapers which in turn appear to be carrying stories of how Mr McWilliams was assaulted after revealing investment strategies. One fake photograph shows him with a black eye, another being detained by gardaí.

Mr McWilliams, a long-time critic of social media companies which allow fake investment recommendations to appear on their platforms, said an “elderly follower” was just one of a number of distressed people who had handed over money.

He said the pensioner had written: “I saw your interview with Tommy Tiernan and rightly or otherwise, I started with...250 euro. Within days they persuaded 15,000 out of me. I am a senior on a very small pension.”

The pensioner said the scam attempted to get more money by way of “tax and other expenses”.

“I don’t have that extra money and am very suspicious and afraid of losing my 15,000. Can you offer any advice please as to what I can do?.”

Mr McWilliams believes his image was used and false recommendations made because he was known to be an adviser on economic matters and a credible voice in relation to online safety.

He called on social media companies to accept responsibility for such fraudulent advertisements and to filter them from their platforms. He said billions are being spent on AI [artificial intelligence] and the social media platforms should “spend some of that money protecting their users”.

The commentator also spoke on RTÉ Radio 1’s Liveline programme on Monday, on which another caller said she had received 31 calls from a range of numbers after she had partially filled in an online form, including giving her phone number. She said the calls to her mobile phone had become increasingly belligerent.

Liveline quoted Meta – which is responsible for WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram – saying it was constantly developing new ways to make it more difficult for scammers to operate.

[TITLE]Cognition Raises $400 Million to Bolster AI Agent Efforts:
[TEXT]
Artificial intelligence (AI) software code generation firm Cognition is now a $10 billion company.

The startup announced Monday (Sept. 8) that it had raised $400 million in a funding round, the latest in a series of AI firms seeing their valuations skyrocket recently.

“We founded Cognition last year to build the future of software engineering,” Co-founder and CEO Scott Wu wrote on the company blog.

“We envision a world of software abundance where engineers become architects, solving the most challenging problems and focusing on their creative visions while tasking an army of autonomous agents to support them on everything else.”

Last March, Wu added, Cognition debuted “Devin,” its AI software engineer. At the time, it was an adept but “very junior” engineer. Now, while “we are still in the earliest innings of AI code,” AI agents are working alongside individual developers and within large enterprise engineering teams.

“As with many technologies throughout history, what first seemed a fringe theory quickly became an obvious reality,” Wu added, first with Devin and then with Windsurf, the AI code generation startup Cognition acquired in July.

And that purchase followed Google’s deal to recruit several Windsurf executives and researchers, which itself came after months of negotiations between Windsurf and OpenAI. The latter company which had explored a possible acquisition valued at $3 billion.

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Cognition had raised $500 million in a funding round that doubled the company’s valuation to $9.8 billion. The same report noted the company raised $300 million in an earlier round this year, valuing it at $4 billion.

Writing about the use of AI agents earlier this month, PYMNTS posited a scenario in which an agent, outfitted with a realistic avatar, can serve as a treasurer, with that avatar functioning as a “conduit of explainability.”

“Imagine a treasury meeting where the AI treasurer presents cash forecasts, highlighting potential liquidity shortfalls two quarters out,” the report said.

“The avatar explains that a pattern in supplier payments and foreign exchange exposures points to risk. When asked why the system recommends hedging euro-denominated receivables, the avatar cites real-time volatility metrics, historical correlations, stress tests, then executes the hedge instantly once approved.”

At the same time, PYMNTS Intelligence research has shown some reluctance among finance chiefs to embrace agentic AI, with just 15% of executives surveyed saying they were even considering the technology, and most still in the early evaluation stage.
