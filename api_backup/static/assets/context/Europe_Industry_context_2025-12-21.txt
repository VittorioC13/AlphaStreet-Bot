[TITLE]Trump's Truth Social to Merge With Fusion Startup You've Probably Never Heard Of:
[TEXT]
A fusion-power startup revealed its own fusion experiment this week: A planned merger with a tech firm that seems to have little in common with its work, but which does bring access to ruling-family levels of influence.

TAE Technologies, a Foothill Ranch, California, company that has been developing a compact nuclear-fusion reactor design since 1998, announced that it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the Florida-based parent firm of President Trump's Truth Social.

The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion, a substantial increase from TMTG's $4.16 billion market cap as of Thursday, and a step up from 2021, when its financial struggles reportedly led Trump to ask Elon Musk to buy his social network.

The transaction calls for TMTG to kick in $200 million to TAE at the signing of the deal, with $100 million more available when it files Securities and Exchange Commission paperwork. The parties predict that the deal will close in the middle of 2026, pending shareholder signoff and regulatory approval, which does not seem like much of a risk in this case.

TAE plans to spend that money to accelerate its plans to build a 50-megawatt commercial fusion electric-power plant. A merger presentation predicts that it will pick a site and begin construction in 2026, start “pre-commercial operations” in 2029, and begin commercial operations in 2031.

Fusion power, in which atoms fuse together under immense pressure to generate heat that can be turned into electricity, promises safe, zero-emission energy without the radioactive waste that nuclear fission plants leave behind.

Creating conditions similar to what allows fusion to happen inside the sun and other stars has proved to be an immensely difficult exercise; it took until 2022 for a US facility’s fusion energy output to exceed the energy input required to initiate that reaction.

Meanwhile, solar panels offer a much cheaper and proven way to turn the sun’s fusion energy into electricity; on a lower-tech scale, a clothesline technically functions as a fusion-powered clothes dryer.

But fusion’s potential, combined with the growing power needs of AI data centers, has pushed interest in the concept to its highest ever level. The “AI Action Plan” that Trump unveiled in July sees a role for fusion, while essentially ruling out the solar and wind power that the president has repeatedly attacked. Fusion also figures in Microsoft’s data-center ambitions.

TAE's plant concept involves using what it calls an “advanced beam-driven Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC)” to confine its hydrogen-boron fuel inside a superhot plasma. Before 2025, it had pitched this as a key part of electrifying transportation; in 2022, it touted its attendance at a fusion-power summit hosted at the White House and approvingly quoted President Biden’s Office of Science & Technology Policy director Alondra Nelson as saying “the world is on fire.”

Building 'Uncancellable Infrastructure'

Global warming, however, did not come up in the brief conference call TAE and TMTG hosted on Thursday morning. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer—who will share chief-executive titles in the combined firm—gave brief statements and took no questions.

"TMTG has built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we're taking a big step toward a revolutionary technology that will cement Americans’ global energy dominance for generations,” Nunes said. “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s, an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, and revive America’s manufacturing base and bolster national defense.”

(Before joining TMTG in January 2022, Nunes served in the House as a Republican representing California and filed a lengthy series of defamation lawsuits—most since dismissed or withdrawn—against news organizations, journalists, Twitter, and such online critics as the unknown operator of a “DevinCow” parody account.)

“Today is a big milestone for TAE, fully recognizing the dedication and passion of our people who worked tirelessly over the last quarter century to advance our research to the point that capital is now becoming our biggest challenge,” Binderbauer said. “Fusion power is the answer, providing reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free electricity– and importantly, cost-competitive with conventional production.”

The merger announcements credit TAE with raising more than $1.3 billion in private capital to date. Truth Social may not have much of a market presence—a November report by the Pew Research Center found that only 3% of Americans had ever used it—but TMTG isn’t just another social-media or technology company.

Trump himself continues to use Truth Social far more than X, TMTG’s board of directors includes Trump’s oldest son Donald Trump, Jr., and the firm’s stock-ticker symbol is Trump’s initials: DJT.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) called for Congressional oversight of the deal in a post on Bluesky: “The merger between Trump Media and TAE raises significant concerns

[TITLE]Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern file historic rail merger application:
[TEXT]
Norfolk Southern President and CEO Mark George highlighted the complementary nature of the two networks, explaining that the combination would bring together Union Pacific’s expansive western reach and Norfolk Southern’s access to eastern manufacturing and population centers in an end-to-end combination. The result would be a unified rail system capable of bridging the gap between east and west, allowing freight to bypass congested interchanges and take the fastest and most efficient, price-competitive route.

The combined entity would create a network encompassing 50,000 route miles in 43 states and more than 100 ports. Union Pacific Chief Executive Jim Vena emphasized the importance of the merger in adapting to changing freight delivery demands, stating that as time and technology continue to transform how freight is delivered, the industry must keep pace and move forward, reaching underserved markets with new rail solutions and strengthening the United States supply chain. Vena expressed confidence that customers deserve stronger, more connected freight rail, and that the merger would deliver on that promise.

The proposed combination would unite Union Pacific’s expansive western reach with Norfolk Southern’s access to eastern manufacturing and population centers. Union Pacific currently operates across 23 western states. Norfolk Southern operates a 22-state network in the eastern United States, with connections to every major container port on the Atlantic coast as well as major ports across the Gulf Coast and Great Lakes.

The two companies expect the merger to be completed by early 2027, pending regulatory review and approval within the statutory timeline established by the STB.

The merger has also drawn opposition from trade groups including chemical and energy shippers, unions representing locomotive engineers and track workers, and rival carrier BNSF.

The merger agreement between the two companies in which UP is acquiring NS was initially executed on July 29, 2025, setting the stage for this regulatory filing. The application highlighted 2,000 letters of support from stakeholders. Shareholders at both Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) earlier voted 99% in favor of the proposed transaction.

The filing represents a landmark moment in American transportation history, proposing the creation of a unified rail network spanning the nation from coast to coast. The nearly 7,000-page application provides extensive details on how this end-to-end combination would enhance competition throughout the freight industry while delivering substantial public benefits to customers, employees, and communities across the country.

Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern on Friday submitted a comprehensive application to the Surface Transportation Board requesting approval to combine the two major freight railroads into what would become America’s first transcontinental railroad.

Story Continues

Enhanced competition and operational efficiencies

The Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern combination represents a classic end-to-end merger, with each railroad currently serving distinct geographic regions with complementary networks, customers, and markets. Unlike mergers that might reduce competition by combining overlapping services, this transaction would connect two systems that have historically operated independently in their respective territories. The application notes only three customer locations out of more than 20,000 served would be impacted by both railroads serving them exclusively, and competitive shipping alternatives would be retained for these locations.

One of the most significant operational improvements promised by the merger involves the transformation of interline service into single-line service. Currently, shipments moving across the country must be handed off between railroads, creating delays and inefficiencies. The combined company would convert 10,000 existing lanes from interline service requiring time-consuming handoffs into faster, more efficient single-line service. This improvement would eliminate an estimated 2,400 rail car and container handlings and 60,000 car-miles each day, dramatically improving the speed and reliability of transcontinental freight movement.

The companies point to research demonstrating that when single-line rail service is available, the share of freight traveling by rail versus highway is roughly two to three times greater than with interline service. This finding suggests that creating a seamless transcontinental network would fundamentally change the competitive dynamics between rail and trucking, particularly for long-haul freight movements.

Benefits for customers

The merger application outlines numerous benefits that customers would realize from the combination. Faster, more efficient service represents the cornerstone of customer benefits, with the integration creating an additional 84,000 county-to-county lanes where shippers currently moving freight by road could, for the first time, utilize single-line rail service. This expansion of service options would provide shippers with alternatives they have never previously had access to.

The combined railroad has announced plans to introduce several new routes as part of its optimized operating plan. Two new daily intermodal train pairs would connect the east and west with more direct service, reducing estimated transit times from Southern California to the Ohio Valley and Northeast by up to 20 hours. Service from Southern California to the Southeast would see transit time reductions of more than two days. Additionally, six new manifest trains would be introduced to bridge the east-west divide more efficiently, reducing over 600 daily car handlings. To meet expected intermodal growth, the combined company plans to introduce a total of six premium intermodal lanes operating seven days a week.

Customers who own rail cars would benefit from improved productive use of their assets. With faster, more predictable service, customers can turn cars more quickly, minimize idle time, and lower equipment costs. The unified digital experience promised by the merger would allow shippers to integrate scheduling, tracking, and shipment visibility through a single platform. Customers would benefit from having one commercial team, one contract, one invoice, and one accountable partner for their entire rail journey.

The application introduces Committed Gateway Pricing, a voluntary enhancement designed to further competition by streamlining pricing of interline moves for thousands of customer locations that otherwise may not directly benefit from the merger. The combined company would keep all existing gateways open for eligible traffic on commercially reasonable terms. As an added protection for customers, Union Pacific would voluntarily create an alternative dispute resolution program to efficiently address certain claims regarding merger-related service issues.

Short line railroads would also benefit from the merger. As Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern create new single-line routes, open competitive markets, and streamline service, short lines are positioned to capture new volumes flowing directly onto their rails, potentially spurring growth throughout the regional rail network.

Nationwide economic benefits

The merger promises substantial economic benefits for the nation, particularly for regions that have historically been underserved by rail transportation. The application identifies what it terms the upper midwest watershed region, an area where trucking was often the only viable option because crossing the divide between eastern and western railroads made rail service too expensive and complicated due to handoffs between carriers. This previously underserved rail market would gain access to single-line manifest service for the first time.

The railroads quoted industry consultant Oliver Wyman estimates that 105,000 carloads of merchandise traffic would convert from road to rail when single-line service becomes available to the watershed markets. By providing domestic shippers with a cheaper alternative to truck transportation, the merger would make American businesses more competitive, strengthening the entire national economy.

The seamless transcontinental railroad would compete more aggressively with long-haul trucking, with the companies estimating that approximately 2 million truckloads of freight annually would shift from road to rail. This modal shift would reduce congestion on America’s highways, create safer roads for motorists, and decrease wear on taxpayer-funded infrastructure. The benefits would extend beyond the freight industry to all road users and the government agencies responsible for maintaining highway systems.

The combined network would provide efficient, flexible, and reliable single-line access to more than 100 ports connecting to global markets and 10 international gateways to markets in Canada and Mexico. This enhanced connectivity would strengthen the position of American businesses in international trade and improve the resilience of the national supply chain.

Environmental and sustainability benefits

Rail transportation already represents the most sustainable way to move freight over ground. According to the Association of American Railroads, rail shipping produces roughly 75 percent less carbon emissions than trucks. The merger would further enhance these environmental benefits through multiple mechanisms. Removing an estimated 2 million trucks from the road annually would directly reduce transportation-related emissions. The combined company would also be positioned to run trains more efficiently, invest in cleaner and more efficient technologies, and provide customers with better tools to achieve their own sustainability goals.

Protecting railroad employees

The application addresses workforce considerations with commitments designed to protect railroad employees. The companies pledge that every employee with a union job at the time of the merger will continue to have one following the combination. Union Pacific has formalized groundbreaking jobs-for-life agreements with multiple unions, providing unprecedented job security for represented workers. Any merger-related union job efficiencies would be achieved solely through attrition rather than layoffs.

Beyond job protection, the companies expect the combined entity to grow, creating approximately 900 net new union jobs by the third year following the merger to handle expected volume growth.

Safety considerations

Safety remains the highest priority for both railroads, and the application includes a comprehensive safety integration plan developed in collaboration with the Federal Railroad Administration and submitted to the STB. The plan outlines how the new company would combine best practices from each railroad to further enhance safety outcomes.

Both companies have demonstrated significant safety improvements in recent years. Comparing the first three quarters of 2023 to the same period in 2025, Union Pacific improved its personal injury rate by 41% and now leads the industry in employee safety. Norfolk Southern’s advanced technologies and industry-leading rail safety practices have improved its Federal Railroad Administration accident rate by 45% over the same period. The merger would allow both companies to share their respective safety innovations and best practices, potentially accelerating safety improvements across the combined network.

The application also addresses passenger rail considerations. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern would maintain dedicated systems to support passenger rail operations. A route-by-route analysis of projected volume growth verified sufficient capacity to continue fulfilling all service obligations to Amtrak and commuter rail agencies, ensuring that the freight merger would not adversely impact passenger transportation.

The companies anticipate investing an estimated $2.1 billion of incremental capital to integrate the two systems and deliver benefits to customers. The combined company also expects $133 million in annual capital synergies by leveraging the combined network and fleet more efficiently.

The application is now subject to a 30-day review by the STB for completeness. The formal evaluation could take a year or longer. Following approval, the combined company would continue to operate under ongoing STB oversight.

[TITLE]Wall Street banked on a flurry of deals under Trump in 2025. It wasn't that simple:
[TEXT]

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025. Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull. "If volumes aren't growing, you can't sit still, you've got to think

[TITLE]Don’t expect Trump Media’s nuclear fusion power plant to generate electricity soon:
[TEXT]
Trump Media — yup, the parent company of Truth Social — is the latest entrant in the near century-long race to develop a nuclear fusion power plant. It announced a merger agreement with fusion company TAE Technologies on Thursday and a bold plan to break ground on the first utility-scale fusion plant some time in 2026.

TAE doesn’t plan to start generating power from its first plant until 2031, which is still an incredibly ambitious timeline. There will likely be a myriad of financial and regulatory issues to contend with along the way, of course. But the scientific and engineering challenges to overcome, which we’ll dive into here, are also enormous.

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies, and AI companies are salivating over it as a potential source of abundant electricity for data centers. But while a future fusion reactor might one day help solve some of humanity’s headaches, it could just be wishful thinking to expect them to come to the rescue for data centers anytime soon.

Why would Trump Media care

The merger agreement between the two companies in which UP is acquiring NS was initially executed on July 29, 2025, setting the stage for this regulatory filing. The application highlighted 2,000 letters of support from stakeholders. Shareholders at both Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) earlier voted 99% in favor of the proposed transaction.

The filing represents a landmark moment in American transportation history, proposing the creation of a unified rail network spanning the nation from coast to coast. The nearly 7,000-page application provides extensive details on how this end-to-end combination would enhance competition throughout the freight industry while delivering substantial public benefits to customers, employees, and communities across the country.

Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern on Friday submitted a comprehensive application to the Surface Transportation Board requesting approval to combine the two major freight railroads into what would become America’s first transcontinental railroad.

Story Continues

Enhanced competition and operational efficiencies

The Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern combination represents a classic end-to-end merger, with each railroad currently serving distinct geographic regions with complementary networks, customers, and markets. Unlike mergers that might reduce competition by combining overlapping services, this transaction would connect two systems that have historically operated independently in their respective territories. The application notes only three customer locations out of more than 20,000 served would be impacted by both railroads serving them exclusively, and competitive shipping alternatives would be retained for these locations.

One of the most significant operational improvements promised by the merger involves the transformation of interline service into single-line service. Currently, shipments moving across the country must be handed off between railroads, creating delays and inefficiencies. The combined company would convert 10,000 existing lanes from interline service requiring time-consuming handoffs into faster, more efficient single-line service. This improvement would eliminate an estimated 2,400 rail car and container handlings and 60,000 car-miles each day, dramatically improving the speed and reliability of transcontinental freight movement.

The companies point to research demonstrating that when single-line rail service is available, the share of freight traveling by rail versus highway is roughly two to three times greater than with interline service. This finding suggests that creating a seamless transcontinental network would fundamentally change the competitive dynamics between rail and trucking, particularly for long-haul freight movements.

Benefits for customers

The merger application outlines numerous benefits that customers would realize from the combination. Faster, more efficient service represents the cornerstone of customer benefits, with the integration creating an additional 84,000 county-to-county lanes where shippers currently moving freight by road could, for the first time, utilize single-line rail service. This expansion of service options would provide shippers with alternatives they have never previously had access to.

The combined railroad has announced plans to introduce several new routes as part of its optimized operating plan. Two new daily intermodal train pairs would connect the east and west with more direct service, reducing estimated transit times from Southern California to the Ohio Valley and Northeast by up to 20 hours. Service from Southern California to the Southeast would see transit time reductions of more than two days. Additionally, six new manifest trains would be introduced to bridge the east-west divide more efficiently, reducing over 600 daily car handlings. To meet expected intermodal growth, the combined company plans to introduce a total of six premium intermodal lanes operating seven days a week.

Customers who own rail cars would benefit from improved productive use of their assets. With faster, more predictable service, customers can turn cars more quickly, minimize idle time, and lower equipment costs. The unified digital experience promised by the merger would allow shippers to integrate scheduling, tracking, and shipment visibility through a single platform. Customers would benefit from having one commercial team, one contract, one invoice, and one accountable partner for their entire rail journey.

The application introduces Committed Gateway Pricing, a voluntary enhancement designed to further competition by streamlining pricing of interline moves for thousands of customer locations that otherwise may not directly benefit from the merger. The combined company would keep all existing gateways open for eligible traffic on commercially reasonable terms. As an added protection for customers, Union Pacific would voluntarily create an alternative dispute resolution program to efficiently address certain claims regarding merger-related service issues.

Short line railroads would also benefit from the merger. As Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern create new single-line routes, open competitive markets, and streamline service, short lines are positioned to capture new volumes flowing directly onto their rails, potentially spurring growth throughout the regional rail network.

Nationwide economic benefits

The merger promises substantial economic benefits for the nation, particularly for regions that have historically been underserved by rail transportation. The application identifies what it terms the upper midwest watershed region, an area where trucking was often the only viable option because crossing the divide between eastern and western railroads made rail service too expensive and complicated due to handoffs between carriers. This previously underserved rail market would gain access to single-line manifest service for the first time.

The railroads quoted industry consultant Oliver Wyman estimates that 105,000 carloads of merchandise traffic would convert from road to rail when single-line service becomes available to the watershed markets. By providing domestic shippers with a cheaper alternative to truck transportation, the merger would make American businesses more competitive, strengthening the entire national economy.

The seamless transcontinental railroad would compete more aggressively with long-haul trucking, with the companies estimating that approximately 2 million truckloads of freight annually would shift from road to rail. This modal shift would reduce congestion on America’s highways, create safer roads for motorists, and decrease wear on taxpayer-funded infrastructure. The benefits would extend beyond the freight industry to all road users and the government agencies responsible for maintaining highway systems.

The combined network would provide efficient, flexible, and reliable single-line access to more than 100 ports connecting to global markets and 10 international gateways to markets in Canada and Mexico. This enhanced connectivity would strengthen the position of American businesses in international trade and improve the resilience of the national supply chain.

Environmental and sustainability benefits

Rail transportation already represents the most sustainable way to move freight over ground. According to the Association of American Railroads, rail shipping produces roughly 75 percent less carbon emissions than trucks. The merger would further enhance these environmental benefits through multiple mechanisms. Removing an estimated 2 million trucks from the road annually would directly reduce transportation-related emissions. The combined company would also be positioned to run trains more efficiently, invest in cleaner and more efficient technologies, and provide customers with better tools to achieve their own sustainability goals.

Protecting railroad employees

The application addresses workforce considerations with commitments designed to protect railroad employees. The companies pledge that every employee with a union job at the time of the merger will continue to have one following the combination. Union Pacific has formalized groundbreaking jobs-for-life agreements with multiple unions, providing unprecedented job security for represented workers. Any merger-related union job efficiencies would be achieved solely through attrition rather than layoffs.

Beyond job protection, the companies expect the combined entity to grow, creating approximately 900 net new union jobs by the third year following the merger to handle expected volume growth.

Safety considerations

Safety remains the highest priority for both railroads, and the application includes a comprehensive safety integration plan developed in collaboration with the Federal Railroad Administration and submitted to the STB. The plan outlines how the new company would combine best practices from each railroad to further enhance safety outcomes.

Both companies have demonstrated significant safety improvements in recent years. Comparing the first three quarters of 2023 to the same period in 2025, Union Pacific improved its personal injury rate by 41% and now leads the industry in employee safety. Norfolk Southern’s advanced technologies and industry-leading rail safety practices have improved its Federal Railroad Administration accident rate by 45% over the same period. The merger would allow both companies to share their respective safety innovations and best practices, potentially accelerating safety improvements across the combined network.

The application also addresses passenger rail considerations. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern would maintain dedicated systems to support passenger rail operations. A route-by-route analysis of projected volume growth verified sufficient capacity to continue fulfilling all service obligations to Amtrak and commuter rail agencies, ensuring that the freight merger would not adversely impact passenger transportation.

The companies anticipate investing an estimated $2.1 billion of incremental capital to integrate the two systems and deliver benefits to customers. The combined company also expects $133 million in annual capital synergies by leveraging the combined network and fleet more efficiently.

The application is now subject to a 30-day review by the STB for completeness. The formal evaluation could take a year or longer. Following approval, the combined company would continue to operate under ongoing STB oversight.

[TITLE]Trump's Truth Social to Merge With Fusion Startup You've Probably Never Heard Of:
[TEXT]
A fusion-power startup revealed its own fusion experiment this week: A planned merger with a tech firm that seems to have little in common with its work, but which does bring access to ruling-family levels of influence.

TAE Technologies, a Foothill Ranch, California, company that has been developing a compact nuclear-fusion reactor design since 1998, announced that it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the Florida-based parent firm of President Trump's Truth Social.

The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion, a substantial increase from TMTG's $4.16 billion market cap as of Thursday, and a step up from 2021, when its financial struggles reportedly led Trump to ask Elon Musk to buy his social network.

The transaction calls for TMTG to kick in $200 million to TAE at the signing of the deal, with $100 million more available when it files Securities and Exchange Commission paperwork. The parties predict that the deal will close in the middle of 2026, pending shareholder signoff and regulatory approval, which does not seem like much of a risk in this case.

TAE plans to spend that money to accelerate its plans to build a 50-megawatt commercial fusion electric-power plant. A merger presentation predicts that it will pick a site and begin construction in 2026, start “pre-commercial operations” in 2029, and begin commercial operations in 2031.

Fusion power, in which atoms fuse together under immense pressure to generate heat that can be turned into electricity, promises safe, zero-emission energy without the radioactive waste that nuclear fission plants leave behind.

Creating conditions similar to what allows fusion to happen inside the sun and other stars has proved to be an immensely difficult exercise; it took until 2022 for a US facility’s fusion energy output to exceed the energy input required to initiate that reaction.

Meanwhile, solar panels offer a much cheaper and proven way to turn the sun’s fusion energy into electricity; on a lower-tech scale, a clothesline technically functions as a fusion-powered clothes dryer.

But fusion’s potential, combined with the growing power needs of AI data centers, has pushed interest in the concept to its highest ever level. The “AI Action Plan” that Trump unveiled in July sees a role for fusion, while essentially ruling out the solar and wind power that the president has repeatedly attacked. Fusion also figures in Microsoft’s data-center ambitions.

TAE's plant concept involves using what it calls an “advanced beam-driven Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC)” to confine its hydrogen-boron fuel inside a superhot plasma. Before 2025, it had pitched this as a key part of electrifying transportation; in 2022, it touted its attendance at a fusion-power summit hosted at the White House and approvingly quoted President Biden’s Office of Science & Technology Policy director Alondra Nelson as saying “the world is on fire.”

Building 'Uncancellable Infrastructure'

Global warming, however, did not come up in the brief conference call TAE and TMTG hosted on Thursday morning. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer—who will share chief-executive titles in the combined firm—gave brief statements and took no questions.

"TMTG has built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we're taking a big step toward a revolutionary technology that will cement Americans’ global energy dominance for generations,” Nunes said. “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s, an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, and revive America’s manufacturing base and bolster national defense.”

(Before joining TMTG in January 2022, Nunes served in the House as a Republican representing California and filed a lengthy series of defamation lawsuits—most since dismissed or withdrawn—against news organizations, journalists, Twitter, and such online critics as the unknown operator of a “DevinCow” parody account.)

“Today is a big milestone for TAE, fully recognizing the dedication and passion of our people who worked tirelessly over the last quarter century to advance our research to the point that capital is now becoming our biggest challenge,” Binderbauer said. “Fusion power is the answer, providing reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free electricity– and importantly, cost-competitive with conventional production.”

The merger announcements credit TAE with raising more than $1.3 billion in private capital to date. Truth Social may not have much of a market presence—a November report by the Pew Research Center found that only 3% of Americans had ever used it—but TMTG isn’t just another social-media or technology company.

Trump himself continues to use Truth Social far more than X, TMTG’s board of directors includes Trump’s oldest son Donald Trump, Jr., and the firm’s stock-ticker symbol is Trump’s initials: DJT.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) called for Congressional oversight of the deal in a post on Bluesky: “The merger between Trump Media and TAE raises significant concerns

[TITLE]Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp. – New Financings Update:
[TEXT]
ATHENS, Greece, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp. (the “Company” or “OET”) (NYSE:ECO / OSE:OET), announced today it has entered into two new facility agreements, for the financing of the recently acquired newbuilding Suezmax vessels, each under construction at Daehan Shipbuilding Co., Ltd, to be named Nissos Piperi and Nissos Serifopoula respectively, with expected deliveries in January 2026.

On December 19, 2025, we entered into a $45.0 million facility agreement, to finance a portion of the acquisition price of the Nissos Piperi, with a prominent Greek bank (the “Nissos Piperi Facility”). The Nissos Piperi Facility contains an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 130 basis points, matures in seven years, and will be repaid in quarterly installments of $0.525 million, together with a balloon installment of $30.3 million at maturity. It will be secured by, among other things, a mortgage over the Nissos Piperi, and it will be guaranteed by the Company.

On December 19, 2025, we entered into a $45.0 million facility agreement, to finance a portion of the acquisition price of the Nissos Serifopoula, with another prominent Greek bank (the “Nissos Serifopoula Facility”). The Nissos Serifopoula Facility contains an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 130 basis points, matures in eight years, and will be repaid in quarterly installments of $0.525 million, together with a balloon installment of $28.2 million at maturity. It will be secured by, among other things, a mortgage over the Nissos Serifopoula, and it will be guaranteed by the Company.

Both facility agreements contain standard representations, warranties and covenants, including financial covenants, and are subject to standard conditions precedent, such as the delivery of the relevant vessel.

Both transactions are expected to close in January 2026.

Iraklis Sbarounis, CFO of the Company, commented:

“We are pleased to announce the final pieces of the puzzle related to the acquisition of the two resale newbuilding Suezmaxes, funded by our successful equity raise in November and now two very competitive bank facilities. We have structured these transactions to be accretive for the benefit of our shareholders, without the need to tap into our cash balance, ensuring a continued focus on our capacity for dividend distributions.

The financings further demonstrate our ability to enhance our capital structure, supported by the strong Alafouzos family relationships in the Greek banking market – relationships that we are keen to develop further. The Nissos Piperi Facility and the Nissos Serifopoula Facility, feature the most competitive financing terms within our fleet, each priced at 130 basis points over SOFR, with maturities in 2033 and 2034 respectively, and we expect such financings to contribute to improved daily debt service breakeven costs.

We are excited to put these vessels to work as soon as they are delivered to us in the first half of January, and benefit from their expected cashflow generation.”

[TITLE]From Super Fibers to Super Deals: Science, Scale, and Strategic Capital Shape the Morning Tape:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- This morning’s market narrative spans futuristic materials, transformational biotech M&A, and creative capital restructuring, underscoring how innovation-driven companies are pairing long-term vision with near-term execution.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (OTCQB: KBLB): Spider Silk Moves From Legend to Industrial Reality

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories set a distinctive tone with a detailed Christmas shareholder letter that framed 2025 as the company’s inflection year, marking its transition from prolonged development into early commercialization of recombinant spider silk.

The operational message was concrete, as Kraig Labs highlighted major advances across genetics, production, and scale, culminating in the rollout of its BAM-1 ALPHA hybrid, a true production-ready, diapausing silkworm line. ALPHA delivers a 22% increase in silk yield, improved automated reeling efficiency, and identical strength and performance characteristics compared to earlier strains, an unusually meaningful gain in a materials business where incremental improvements can materially alter unit economics.

The importance of spider silk as a super fiber is central to the story. Natural spider silk is widely regarded as one of the strongest and toughest fibers known, combining tensile strength comparable to steel with elasticity exceeding Kevlar, while remaining lightweight, biodegradable, and biocompatible. These properties make recombinant spider silk a highly sought-after material across performance apparel, aerospace composites, medical sutures, defense applications, and luxury textiles, markets where durability, weight reduction, and sustainability command premium pricing. Historically, the inability to produce spider silk at scale has constrained commercialization. Kraig’s progress directly addresses that bottleneck.

Operationally, the company reported producing more than one million BAM-1 ALPHA eggs, parallel manufacturing facilities, multi-country operating licenses in Southeast Asia, and a strategic collaboration with a regional government agency have added redundancy, scale, and geopolitical resilience to production. Importantly, Kraig is signaling that customer engagement is now aligning with production readiness. As 2026 approaches, Kraig Labs appears positioned to test whether spider silk’s long-promised value can finally be realized at industrial scale.

BioMarin Pharmaceutical to Acquire Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ: FOLD): Rare Disease Consolidation at Scale

Large-cap biotech conviction was on full display as BioMarin Pharmaceutical announced a definitive agreement to acquire Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ: FOLD) for $14.50 per share in cash, valuing the transaction at approximately $4.8 billion. The deal adds two marketed, high-growth rare disease therapies, Galafold for Fabry disease and Pombiliti + Opfolda for Pompe disease, which together generated $599 million in revenue over the past four quarters.

Strategically, the acquisition immediately expands BioMarin’s enzyme therapy portfolio, accelerates revenue growth, and is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS within 12 months of closing, with substantial accretion projected by 2027. The resolution of U.S. Galafold patent litigation, extending exclusivity to 2037, removes a key overhang and strengthens long-term cash flow visibility. Financing is not contingent, with BioMarin planning to use cash on hand and approximately $3.7 billion in debt, while targeting deleveraging to below 2.5x gross leverage within two years.

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025. Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull. "If volumes aren't growing, you can't sit still, you've got to think

[TITLE]Govt notifies ₹7,280-cr scheme to manufacture rare earth magnets in India:
[TEXT]
The Centre has notified the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) with an outlay of ₹7,280 crore.

The initiative is targeting to reduce dependence on China for critical inputs and secure supply chains for EVs, electronics, aerospace and green energy.

The scheme, approved earlier by the Union Cabinet, aims to build a complete domestic value chain of converting rare earth oxide into sintered NdFeB, essential for India's strategic and industrial advancement.

Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) is the alloy used to create the strongest type of permanent magnets.

"Through this scheme, the Government of India intends to incentivise setting up of 6,000 MTPA (Million Tonnes Per Annum) of integrated REO (rare earth oxides) to sintered NdFeB REPM's manufacturing facilities in the country," the Heavy Industries Ministry said in the notification.

Indigenously produced sintered NdFeB REPMs from NdPr oxide will be eligible for sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy under the scheme.

It will allocate up to 6,000 MTPA of integrated sintered NdFeB magnet manufacturing capacity to five applicants through a transparent bidding process -- Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) by issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP).

The minimum allocation to a beneficiary will be 600 MTPA, going up to a maximum allocation of 1,200 MTPA, in multiples of 100 MTPA, as per the notification.

The beneficiaries will receive sales-linked incentives on the sale of sintered NdFeB REPM and a capital subsidy for setting up the allocated manufacturing capacity.

Further, three selected beneficiaries with the lowest bids would receive an assured limited supply of NdPr oxide from IREL (India) Ltd, a CPSE under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).

The total duration of the scheme will be 7 years, which includes 2 years of gestation period for setting up the manufacturing facilities and 5 years for incentive disbursement on the sale of sintered NdFeB REPM.

Further, in case the first sale of sintered NdFeB REPM commences prior to the completion of the gestation period, then this additional period will also be eligible for sales-linked incentive over and above the 5-year duration.

India has one of the world's largest rare earth reserves, mostly located in coastal regions.

IREL (India), a CPSE under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), is the only company in India that is engaged in the mining of rare earth ores and refining these into REOs.

While India possesses upstream capabilities in mining, separation and oxide refining, there is a notable gap in the industrial-scale midstream capabilities needed for oxide-to-metal, metal-to-alloy and alloy-to-magnet conversion.

Due to this, India currently imports all its sintered NdFeB REPM demand for downstream applications.
