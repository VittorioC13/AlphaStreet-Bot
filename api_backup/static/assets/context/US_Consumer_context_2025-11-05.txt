[TITLE]Here's What's Concerning About Senheng New Retail Berhad's (KLSE:SENHENG) Returns On Capital:
[TEXT]
If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Senheng New Retail Berhad (KLSE:SENHENG), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.

[TITLE]Mega merger alert: Kimberley-Clark to acquire Kenvue for over $40 billion as Tylenol — What's inside the deal?:
[TEXT]
Consumer goods and personal care giant Kimberley-Clark is buying Tylenol-maker Kenvue in a $40 billion deal involving stock and cash, in what can be called a mammoth merger of two consumer health goods companies.

The landmark deal for the consumer sector comes as Kenvue's flagship drug, Tylenol, faces White House scrutiny and choppy demand.

With the merger, Kimberley-Clark would surpass Unilever to become the second-largest company that sells health and wellness products, after Procter & Gamble Co.

What's inside the $40 billion Kenvue-Kimberley Clark deal? Shareholders of Kenvue get $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares per Kenvue share, the companies said in a statement on Monday. That implies an equity value of $40.32 billion, according to calculations made by Reuters.

Together in cash and stocks, the deal value aggregates to $21.01 per share. This implies a a hefty 46.2% premium to the Kenvue stock's last closing price.

Gross collections of goods and services tax ( GST ) rose 4.6% on-year to Rs 1.95 lakh crore in October, reflecting robust local consumption that helped offset potential tax revenue shrinkage after the biggest cuts to the levy in eight years.Data published on Saturday showed indirect tax revenues edged up despite the Centre's decision to largely abolish a cess and lower taxes from September 22 on 99% of regular goods and services. Collections overshadowed the impact of a 40% growth in GST refunds through the month."The fact that the GST collections have grown, though marginally, with significantly reduced rates indicates that consumption remains robust, as borne out by other economic indicators as well," said MS Mani, tax partner at Deloitte India. He said abolition of levy on two-wheelers, cars, air-conditioners and television sets reduced the quantum of incident tax on these items that saw robust consumption demand.Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were at the vanguard of demand growth through the month.“October GST data would affirm that India’s growth story is both broadening and deepening, founded on robust local demand, rising industrial momentum, and sustained fiscal resilience in a challenging global environment,” Manoj Mishra, tax partner at Grant Thornton Bharat.Early retail indicators show broadbased demand across autos, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), apparel and electronics, reflecting renewed consumer confidence, Mishra said.Gross import collections stood at ₹50,884 crore, up 12.84%.“Higher gross GST collections reflect a strong festive season, higher demand and a rate structure that has been well absorbed by businesses," said Abhishek Jain, indirect tax head and partner, KPMG.November collections should also show similar trends.Collections, however, are anticipated to soften from December onward, when festival-driven consumption slows.That run rate should show the full impact of GST rate rationalisation on both collection and consumption, a run rate expected to be keenly tracked both by the Centre and economists.Through the month, the Centre issued ₹26,934 crore as refunds, 40% higher than last year."A consistent increase in GST refunds (domestic as well as exports) shows confidence of tax administration that GST collections would show positive trend in the future as well," said Pratik Jain, partner at PwC LLP.The collection net of refunds stood at ₹1.69 lakh crore, up 0.6%, against the same period last year.“Crucially, the government’s unwavering commitment to resolve working capital issues for exporters and address concerns around the inverted duty structure are significant positive developments,” said Saurabh Agarwal, tax partner at EY India.Agarwal added that certainty in the tax regime and reduction of working capital leakages are vital confidence boosters for the investor community, reinforcing India’s ease of doing business credentials.

[TITLE]Gov. Shapiro signs disaster declaration, announces $5M in funding for Pennsylvania food banks:
[TEXT]
Pennsylvanians who rely on SNAP benefits are getting some help from the state.

Gov. Josh Shapiro on Friday announced $5 million in state funding to Feeding Pennsylvania, which will distribute funds through its network of food banks.

Shapiro also signed a declaration of disaster emergency to speed up funding and hasten the delivery of state resources.

The moves come a day before Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will stop being issued, resulting from the ongoing federal government shutdown.

“Nearly 2 million Pennsylvanians rely on SNAP every month, and they shouldn’t have to wonder where their next meal will come from because of the dysfunction in Washington,” Shapiro said. “There is no substitute for the federal government’s decision not to release SNAP benefits, but my administration is stepping up to use every tool we have — state resources, private sector support and the compassion of our communities — to make sure our food banks are fully stocked and our families are fed."

Shapiro has also launched a private sector fundraising effort to help food banks meet demands. The effort has reportedly raised $1 million to date.

[TITLE]Judges Order White House to Keep Funding Food Stamps:
[TEXT]
Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Trump's administration must to continue to fund SNAP, the nation's biggest food aid program, during the government shutdown, per the AP . The rulings came a day before the US Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.

The administration has said it wasn't allowed to use a contingency fund with about $5 billion in it for the program, but the judges rejected that. A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds—and asked for an update on progress by Monday. A Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.

It wasn't immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling, a process that often takes one to two weeks. The rulings are likely to face appeals. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks, and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.

[TITLE]Harrell Announces Emergency Funding for Food Banks:
[TEXT]
The one in 10 Washington residents who rely on the government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are preparing for the worst. With the now 31-day-long government shutdown still in effect, SNAP benefits will lapse on Nov. 1 for the first time in the program’s history. To stave off some of the pain, Mayor Bruce Harrell proclaimed a limited civil emergency to direct $8 million in funds toward Seattle-area food banks.

Harrell’s limited emergency order will send funding directly to food banks rather than restoring individuals’ SNAP benefits. That means instead of paying for food at reduced prices at any grocery stores, SNAP users will need to line up at a food bank.

"Our city has a strong network of local food banks, and we're prepared to fill the gap left by the other Washington's dysfunction with immediate action and $8 million to support our neighbors in need,” Harrell said.

The City chose to fund food banks and meal programs because it’s the most barrier-free route available to get food to Seattleites, says Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck. Cities and states don’t have access to the SNAP infrastructure. The only infrastructure we have on a city-level that compares to SNAP is FreshBucks, but there are only 12,000 people in Seattle enrolled in the program, and it would take much more time to enroll new people into it than to direct them to their local food bank.

The funds come from the city’s reserves, and will be distributed $4 million per month. So, hopefully the shutdown lifts before the new year. If it doesn’t “and the need remains,” Mayoral spokesperson Jamie Housen says the mayor “can extend the order and investment.”

According to federal data, Washington state receives more than $173 million in monthly food benefits. It is unclear how much the Seattle area receives, or how much of a stop-gap Harrell’s emergency funding is.

Earlier this week, Gov. Bob Ferguson announced that he was directing the Department of Social and Health Services to direct $2.2 million a week to the state Department of Agriculture, the agency that delivers grants to food banks. That money will funnel toward food banks rather than individuals as well. Even before the government shutdown pushed SNAP off a cliff, Trump cuts and cancelled food shipments had put Washington food banks in a bad way, according to the Washington State Standard.

With the sweeping loss of federal funds, “we’re at COVID-levels of crisis management,” says Rinck. “So we need to move toward these kinds of emergency proclamations.”

Directing this funding into food banks and meal programs will put stress on their existing infrastructure. But by declaring an emergency, the mayor’s office is also able to redirect City staff and vehicles to provide operational support and make sure food is distributed to people who need it. It’s not yet clear if that’s part of Harrell’s plan.

“We have to have a proactive approach to getting that food out there,” Rinck says.

For food banks, this emergency funding is stabilizing. Northwest Harvest, a hunger relief non-profit, operates two free markets—one in Yakima, one in Seattle. It also distributes food to a network of more than 375 food banks and meal programs.

"We are deeply embedded in Washington’s hunger relief infrastructure," Natasha Dworkin, director of communications at Northwest Harvest wrote in an email. "Emergency funding like this will help... keep shelves stocked and meet growing demand with dignity and care."

Dworkin said Northwest Harvest was already seeing increased demand this year ahead of the SNAP benefits pause. Plus, new changes to work requirements and exemptions for SNAP that came from the Trump administration earlier this year reduced food access for many. Medicaid cuts add further strain on those in need.

"The government shutdown has created widespread uncertainty, and families who rely on federal assistance are turning to food banks and community markets in growing numbers," Dworkin said. "We expect this increased demand to continue—and likely intensify—even after the shutdown ends."

City Council will hold an emergency vote on Monday to ratify the order. Council President Sara Nelson, and Councilmembers Joy Hollingsworth, Dan Strauss, and Rinck have already made statements in support of the funding. It’s expected to pass.

Update:

Update: As of Friday afternoon, two federal judges in different states issued rulings opposing the Trump administration’s handing of SNAP benefits. A Rhode Island judge blocked the administration from ceasing to pay for SNAP while a judge in Boston, Massachusetts ruled the suspension of benefits was “unlawful.”

When asked how this would impact Harrell’s order, mayoral spokesperson Kevin Mundt wrote in an email:

“We are currently reviewing the implications of these rulings and monitoring any potential gaps in SNAP payments. It is unclear at this time whether SNAP funding will cover all or only part of regular allocations in November. We have little trust that President Trump will do the right thing and fully fund SNAP for our must vulnerable. There is also the probability of an emergency appeal of the ruling by the Trump administration.

With this uncertainty and because of a possibility for a reduction in funding, at this time the City will continue moving forward quickly to support our food banks and meal program partners to meet emerging needs should a gap in benefits occur.”

On Saturday, some 42 million people in the U.S. who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could lose the ability to afford food because of the ongoing government shutdown.

The Trump administration has warned that the debit-like EBT cards that hold an individual's SNAP funds won't be refilled when the money runs out on Nov. 1 — despite millions in emergency contingency money being available.

On Friday, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits. But it was unclear how much assistance may be provided or when it might come.

Sponsor Message

This comes as more than 700,000 federal workers are furloughed without pay or continue to work without their regular paychecks also because of the government shutdown.

These crises have placed immense pressure on food banks and food pantries across the country to fill in and provide much needed supplies for hungry families.

Revenue totaled $82.2 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. Gross Profit and Gross Margin: Gross profit totaled $65.2 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. Gross margin was 79.4% as compared to 79.3% in the third quarter last year.

Gross profit totaled $65.2 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. Gross margin was 79.4% as compared to 79.3% in the third quarter last year. Loss from Continuing Operations: Loss from continuing operations was $4.2 million, or a negative 5.2% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $10.4 million, or a negative 16.8% of revenue, for the third quarter last year.

Loss from continuing operations was $4.2 million, or a negative 5.2% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $10.4 million, or a negative 16.8% of revenue, for the third quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations 1 : Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $3.8 million, or 4.6% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for the third quarter last year.

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $3.8 million, or 4.6% of revenue, for the third quarter 2025, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.5% of revenue, for the third quarter last year. Active Buyers and Orders: Active Buyers of 1.57 million and Orders of 1.61 million for the third quarter 2025, representing increases of 26% and 37%, respectively, over the third quarter last year.

Financial Outlook

For the fourth quarter 2025, ThredUp expects:

Revenue in the range of $76.0 million to $78.0 million, +14% year-over-year at the midpoint

Gross margin in the range of 78.0% to 79.0%

Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 3.0%

For the full fiscal year 2025, ThredUp expects:

Revenue in the range of $307.0 million to $309.0 million, +18% year-over-year at the midpoint

Gross margin in the range of 79.0% to 79.2%

Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 4.2%

ThredUp is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance of the Non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA margin to net loss margin, the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP because certain items are out of ThredUp’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude, where applicable in a given period, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, severance and other reorganization costs, and gain on sale of non-marketable equity investment. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue for the same period. Accordingly, a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA in order to calculate forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin is not available without unreasonable effort. However, for the fourth quarter of 2025 and full year 2025, Depreciation and amortization is expected to be $3.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively. In addition, for the fourth quarter of 2025 and full year 2025, Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be $3.8 million and $18.3 million, respectively. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could result in projected net loss being materially greater than is indicated by the currently estimated Adjusted EBITDA margin.

ThredUp is not providing a quantitative reconciliation for free cash flow estimates on a forward-looking basis because it is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to provide a meaningful or reasonably accurate calculation or estimation of net cash provided by operating activities and certain reconciling items on a forward-looking basis, which could be significant to the Company's results.

[TITLE]American consumers will shoulder 55% of the cost of Trump’s tariffs — here's how to update your shopping habits:

[TITLE]Garments, textiles manufacturers seek tax breaks, export support:
[TEXT]
The garments and textiles industry, reeling under the effect of US import tariffs, has asked the government for a slew of measures, including tax concessions for new units, depreciation allowance, interest subvention and rationalisation of key schemes in recent pre-budget consultations.

“Representatives of the textiles and garments industry, including exporters, met the Textiles Secretary recently to give submissions on expectations from budget 2026-27. With the US tariffs giving a sharp blow to the Indian industry, the government was urged to provide both tax and non-tax relief in budget 2026-27 as well as during the ongoing fiscal,” a source tracking the matter told businessline.

The textile and garments sector is crucial for India as the sector provides employment to over 45 million people and its current size, at $174 billion, is projected to reach $350 billion by 2030, per government estimates.

US additional tariffs of 50 per cent imposed on the sector in August has, however, hit manufacturers hard as tariffs on competing countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh is much lower at 19-20 per cent.

Exports of textiles, garments, and made-ups fell 37 per cent, from $944 million in May 2025 to $597 million in September 2025, per numbers put together by research body GTRI.

“Garments alone declined 44 percent, home textiles 16 percent, and yarn and fabrics 41 percent. Within garments, knitted apparel was down 39 percent, woven apparel 50 percent, and girls’ suits 66 percent,” the report noted.

In its representation, the industry made a strong pitch for resumption of the interest equalisation scheme, on pre- and post-shipment rupee export credit, which expired after December 31 2024, has now expired.

“The reintroduction of this scheme is essential for supporting the MSME segment of the apparel export industry. The apparel sector, being labour-intensive and largely composed of micro and small enterprises, relies heavily on government support to compete with cost-efficient countries such as Bangladesh. Additionally, the industry is facing ongoing global recessionary pressures and stiff competition from nations enjoying lower input costs and preferential market access,” according to the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC).

The US is India’s largest export market for the sector, accounting for 28.97 per cent of textile and apparel exports of $ 37.7 billion in 2024-25.

The industry also recommended that the concessional tax rate of 15 per cent (under Section 115BAB of the Income Tax Act) be introduced again to support the sustained growth of new manufacturing companies within the Indian apparel industry and enhance their competitive edge in the international market.

To strengthen the liquidity position and global competitiveness of Indian exporters, exporters proposed that an accelerated depreciation allowance of 100 per cent over two years be extended to export-oriented enterprises on eligible capital assets for tax computation purposes.

“As it only advances the timing of the depreciation claims, this measure will not result in any revenue loss to the government while giving exporters a short-term liquidity advantage. It will enable them to reinvest in modernisation, technology upgradation, energy efficiency, and capacity expansion,” the source said.

The industry also submitted that duty-free import of trims and accessories under IGCR (import of goods at concessional rates of duty) Rules should not restricted to the ultimate exporter and to physical exports, excluding intermediate suppliers and deemed exports.

“IGCR benefits should be extended to intermediate suppliers and deemed exporters. It is requested that minimum wastage of 10 per cent be allowed under the IGCR Rules for import of trimmings and accessories by issuing an appropriate notification. It is requested that IGCR facility should also be allowed for the imports done under courier mode,” the AEPC noted.

[TITLE]S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Amazon Stock Jumps After OpenAI Deal; Kimberly-Clark Acquires Kenvue:
[TEXT]
Key Takeaways An AI collaboration boosted the company behind the largest U.S. cloud service on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025, while shares of the companies involved in a consumer goods deal saw major moves.

Amazon shares surged after the e-commerce and cloud computing giant signed an agreement with ChatGPT owner OpenAI.

Kleenex parent Kimberly-Clark announced a deal to buy Tylenol parent Kenvue. Kimberly-Clark stock fell, while Kenvue stock soared.

A linkup with an artificial intelligence player helped power shares of a top cloud-computing services company higher Monday, while an acquisition in the consumer goods space sent the two stocks on divergent paths.

Major U.S. equities indexes ended the first trading day of November mixed, kicking off a market week that will bring a wave of big-name quarterly reports. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%. The Dow ended the session 0.5% lower. For more from Investopedia on the day's major market news, click here.

IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX) shares jumped 15%, the best performance on the S&P 500 today, after the pet health specialist reported better-than-expected third quarter sales and profit. The company raised its 2025 revenue and earnings per share guidance, highlighting global customer adoption of its new diagnostic tools, which IDEXX says can help veterinarian teams increase clinical insights and streamline their workflows.

Paper products giant Kimberly-Clark (KMB) said it would buy Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine parent company Kenvue (KVUE) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at around $49 billion. Kenvue, which completed a spin-off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, has been navigating litigation over allegations that its talcum powder causes cancer and statements from the Trump administration linking Tylenol to autism.

Kenvue shares rose more than 12% Monday following the announcement of the deal, which came at a significant premium to Friday's closing price for Kenvue stock, while Kimberly-Clark shares plunged more than 14%. The latter company's shares were the worst performers on the S&P 500 today.

Amazon (AMZN) shares jumped 5% after ChatGPT owner OpenAI signed an agreement to buy more than $38 billion worth of capacity its Amazon Web Services cloud unit. OpenAI said the deal to use AWS infrastructure would provide it with access to a significant number of Nvidia (NVDA) graphics processing units that could be employed to train its AI models. Nvidia shares gained 2.2%.

Moderna (MRNA) stock sank 8.3% Monday, reversing a portion of the gains posted last week amid reports that the vaccine maker had held strategic talks with a major pharmaceutical company about a potential partnership or sale. Waning enthusiasm around a possible deal and concerns

[TITLE]OpenAI, Amazon sign $38bn AI deal:
[TEXT]
The announcement comes less than week after Amazon laid off 14,000 people.

OpenAI has signed a new deal valued at $38bn with Amazon that will allow the artificial intelligence giant to run AI workloads across Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure.

The seven-year deal announced on Monday is the first big AI push for the e-commerce giant after a restructuring last week.

The new deal will give the ChatGPT maker access to thousands of Nvidia graphics processors to train and run its artificial intelligence models.

Experts say this does not mean that it will allow OpenAI to train its model on websites hosted by AWS – which includes the websites of The New York Times, Reddit and United Airlines.

“Running OpenAI training inside AWS doesn’t change their ability to scrape content from AWS-hosted websites [which they could already do for anything publicly readable]. This is strictly speaking

Known for its foodie clientele, she said the market became an incredible way to engage with customers.

The business had eight flavours at the time, and often was sold out by the end of the day.

However, the macaron business was still just a side hustle for O’Sullivan as she was working fulltime as a commercial lawyer.

It wasn’t until six years later she made the decision to commit to J’aime fulltime.
