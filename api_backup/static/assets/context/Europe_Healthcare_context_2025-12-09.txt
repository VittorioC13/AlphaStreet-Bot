[TITLE]Adaptive Biotechnologies Showcases Leadership in Hematology-Oncology MRD with New clonoSEQ® Data Driving Treatment Interventions at 2025 ASH Annual Meeting:
[TEXT]
SEATTLE, Dec. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (Nasdaq: ADPT), a commercial stage biotechnology company that aims to translate the genetics of the adaptive immune system into clinical products to diagnose and treat disease, announced growing interventional use of its clonoSEQ® test among the 90 abstracts featuring clonoSEQ data at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, taking place Dec. 6–9, 2025, in Orlando. Notably, 17 abstracts utilizing Adaptive’s clonoSEQ® test exemplify how next-generation sequencing-based measurable residual disease (MRD) status is guiding clinical actions to improve blood cancer patient care.

Practice-changing data from the phase II EndRAD study support the use of NGS MRD status prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to guide the selection of non-total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning approaches to reduce long-term toxicities in children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), without compromising outcomes. The study showed outstanding event-free and overall survival outcomes in 51 patients who were NGS MRD negative and received a non-TBI regimen. The study also enrolled a comparator cohort who received TBI and showed equivalent survival in NGS MRD negative patients who received TBI (the current standard of care) compared to non-TBI approaches (oral presentation, abstract 163).

“For young people facing leukemia, the impact of treatment doesn’t end when therapy does,” said Michael Pulsipher, M.D., Division Chief of Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation at Primary Children’s Hospital and Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. “The EndRAD results demonstrate that, for NGS MRD-negative patients, we may be able to choose transplant approaches without radiation that support both survival and long-term well-being—an advancement with real, lasting impact for patients and their families.”

Across hematologic malignancies, clonoSEQ MRD status is used by health care providers as an interventional tool to guide clinical decisions at key points in care. The presentations below show how investigators are applying clonoSEQ MRD results to tailor treatment intensity or duration with greater precision.

Multiple Myeloma (MM)

A total of 32 abstracts will be presented (31 MM, one smoldering MM), with a focus on MRD assessment of treatment response, real-world data demonstrating the link between MRD status and clinical outcomes, and several studies describing how clonoSEQ MRD results are being used to guide treatment decisions.

A presentation focused on MRD dynamics in the phase III AURIGA study of 200 newly diagnosed MM patients demonstrated that deep MRD responses and sustained MRD negativity correlated with improved progression free survival. The study shows that use of intensified maintenance in MRD-positive patients post-transplant doubled MRD negativity rates (oral presentation, abstract 97).

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)

Fifteen abstracts in NHL will be presented, focusing on use of MRD to better understand depth of response and to guide therapy.

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), results from a phase II Wisconsin Oncology Network study which used clonoSEQ to de-escalate therapy in frail older adults with DLBCL will be presented (poster presentation, abstract 1964). Additionally, data supporting the integration of ctDNA into post–CAR T surveillance will be presented (oral presentation, abstract 941).

Results from a phase II, MRD-guided study in older mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients demonstrate the use of clonoSEQ to guide duration of frontline BOVen therapy (zanubrutinib, obinutuzumab, venetoclax) (oral presentation, abstract 888).

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)

Seven abstracts utilizing clonoSEQ MRD will be presented, with the majority leveraging the test to assess treatment response and guide treatment discontinuation.

Data from a Phase II study of 80 patients with previously untreated CLL showed that time-limited pirtobrutinib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab (PVO) achieved notably deep and durable remissions based on MRD assessment at a threshold of 10-6. MRD positive status using clonoSEQ was used to identify patients who may continue therapy, highlighting clonoSEQ as a potential tool for guiding treatment duration in this regimen (oral presentation, abstract 680).

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

In addition to the EndRAD trial, 30 ALL abstracts will be presented describing the use of clonoSEQ to assess treatment response in investigator studies and real-world data, as well as analyses describing comparisons of bone marrow and peripheral blood MRD by clonoSEQ.

“The unprecedented volume and diversity of data at ASH this year further solidifies clonoSEQ’s leadership in the field of blood cancer MRD monitoring,” said Susan Bobulsky, chief commercial officer, MRD, Adaptive Biotechnologies. “Our unmatched body of clinical evidence and real-world patient experience, together with meaningful updates across lymphoid cancer clinical practice guidelines over the past year, reflect clear recognition of the test’s value in accelerating therapeutic progress and strengthening MRD-informed patient management.”

[TITLE]Arvinas Presents Preclinical Data Supporting Mechanistic Synergies and Enhanced Antitumor Activity with the Combination of ARV-393 and Glofitamab at the 2025 American Society of Hematology Annual Meet:
[TEXT]
– Data support initiation of a combination cohort in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate ARV-393 plus glofitamab as a chemotherapy-free combination approach in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); initiation expected in 2026 –

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arvinas, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARVN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company creating a new class of drugs based on targeted protein degradation, today announced preclinical data for ARV-393, a PROTAC BCL6 degrader, in combination with glofitamab, a CD20×CD3 bispecific antibody, presented in a poster at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH®) Annual Meeting and Exposition, held December 6–9, 2025, in Orlando, Florida. In a humanized high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) cell line–derived xenograft (CDX) model, the combination of ARV-393 and glofitamab resulted in significantly enhanced tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and increased rates of tumor regression compared with either agent alone. These preclinical data suggest mechanistic synergies between BCL6 degradation with ARV-393 and T-cell engagement.

“Despite advances in treatment options, many patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma continue to face limited options once standard therapies fail. By pursuing a chemotherapy-free combination approach, we aim to address this significant unmet need and potentially offer patients a more targeted, better-tolerated therapeutic alternative,” said Noah Berkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Arvinas. “The initiation of our Phase 1 combination clinical trial, planned for 2026, represents an important step toward defining the potential of ARV-393 in the treatment of this aggressive form of lymphoma.”

Key highlights from the poster presentation include:

In a humanized HGBCL CDX model ARV-393 (3 mg/kg) combined with glofitamab (0.15 mg/kg) achieved 81% TGI with concomitant dosing and 91% TGI with sequential dosing (ARV-393 followed by glofitamab), versus 38% for single-agent ARV-393 and 36% for glofitamab alone.

At a higher ARV-393 dose (6 mg/kg) combined with glofitamab (0.15 mg/kg), an increase in tumor regressions was observed with concomitant (10/10 mice) and sequential dosing (7/8 mice) vs single-agent ARV-393 (5/11 mice) or glofitamab (0/11 mice).

RNA sequencing and biomarker analyses revealed that ARV-393 upregulated CD20 expression and genes that promote interferon signaling and antigen presentation, while downregulating proliferation-associated gene sets. These collective effects likely contributed to the observed synergistic antitumor activity.

“We believe these results underscore the potential for ARV-393 and provide a strong mechanistic rationale for exploring ARV-393 in combination with glofitamab as a chemotherapy-free treatment strategy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,” said Angela Cacace, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Arvinas. “These preclinical results support our belief in the clinical potential and combinability of ARV-393 and the possibility to provide real benefit to patients in need.”

ARV-393 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Arvinas plans to share clinical data from this trial at a medical congress in 2026. Additionally, Arvinas plans to add a glofitamab combination cohort in patients with DLBCL in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of ARV-393 in 2026.

[TITLE]Beam Therapeutics Reports Updated Data from BEACON Phase 1/2 Trial of ristoglogene autogetemcel (risto-cel) Highlighting Durable, Differentiated Profile in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) at American Societ:
[TEXT]
Updated Data from 31 Adult and Adolescent SCD Patients Treated with risto-cel (Formerly BEAM-101) Show Mean Hemoglobin F (HbF) Induction of >60%, Hemoglobin S (HbS) Reduction to <40%, and Resolution of Anemia Durable for up to 20 Months

Patients Required a Median of One Cell Collection Cycle and Experienced Rapid Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment

Safety Profile Remained Consistent with Busulfan Conditioning, Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Underlying SCD

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beam Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: BEAM), a biotechnology company developing precision genetic medicines through base editing, today announced new safety and efficacy data from its BEACON Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ristoglogene autogetemcel (risto-cel), formerly known as BEAM-101, an investigational genetically modified ex vivo base editing cell therapy, in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) with severe vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). The data will be shared today at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in Orlando.

“With a growing dataset and longer follow up, these updated data continue to underscore the potential of risto-cel to make a transformative difference in the lives of patients with SCD,” said Ashish Gupta, M.D., MPH, University of Minnesota. “Given the cumbersome nature of the transplant process, it is encouraging that patients receiving risto-cel are on average experiencing a low number of cell collection cycles, rapid neutrophil and platelet engraftment, and low neutropenic days post-risto-cel treatment. Each of these factors contributes to fewer days in the hospital, potentially improving the overall patient experience.”

“Risto-cel continues to demonstrate how base editing can fulfill its promise as a next-generation precision genetic medicine that could significantly improve the treatment process and outcomes for patients with SCD,” said John Evans, chief executive officer of Beam Therapeutics. “The strength of these updated data from the BEACON trial reinforce the potential of risto-cel to deliver durable clinical benefit through efficient, more precise editing, and optimized cell collection and manufacturing processes. Given the rapid clinical execution of the BEACON trial, we’re on track to efficiently dose the remaining patients enrolled in the study and advance toward a regulatory filing.”

As of an August 6, 2025, data cut-off, a total of 31 patients with severe SCD were treated with risto-cel in the BEACON Phase 1/2 trial and are included in the safety and efficacy analysis. Follow-up ranged from 0.3 to 20.4 months. Data from an earlier cut-off date were previously reported at the European Hematology Association 2025 Congress (EHA2025) in Milan in June 2025.

Key highlights include the following, consistent with previously presented data:

Efficient and Predictable Cell Collection, Manufacturing, and Release: Risto-cel’s efficient cell collection and manufacturing processes combined with high, predictable yields from base editing resulted in patients requiring few stem cell collection cycles and total collection days to manufacture risto-cel. Patients required a median of 1 (range: 1-5) stem cell collection cycle, comprising a median of 3 (range: 1–13) total collection days for the risto-cel manufacturing process and back-up cell collection. An oral presentation on the optimized cell mobilization and collection process will be presented at ASH on Monday, December 8, 2025.

An oral presentation on the optimized cell mobilization and collection process will be presented at ASH on Monday, December 8, 2025. Rapid Engraftment: Patients achieved rapid and robust bone marrow reconstitution post-risto-cel treatment. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 17.5 days (range: 12-30), with a median duration of severe neutropenia of 7 days (range: 1-17). The median time to platelet engraftment was 19 days (range: 11-53). In addition, 29% of patients did not require any platelet transfusions following risto-cel treatment.

N o Severe VOCs Reported : No patients experienced any investigator-reported severe VOCs post-engraftment.

: No patients experienced any investigator-reported severe VOCs post-engraftment. Durable, High Editing Efficiency: Durable, high editing efficiency was observed in peripheral blood and bone marrow following treatment with risto-cel. Mean peripheral blood editing was 67.4% at Month 6 and 72.8% by Month 12.

Durable, high editing efficiency was observed in peripheral blood and bone marrow following treatment with risto-cel. Mean peripheral blood editing was 67.4% at Month 6 and 72.8% by Month 12. Rapid and Sustained Increases in Protective Hemoglobin F (HbF) and Reductions in Pathologic Hemoglobin S (HbS): Consistent with data presented at EHA2025, patients achieved mean HbF levels above 60% and a mean durable reduction in corresponding HbS below 40%. A pancellular distribution of HbF, reflecting expression across most of the circulating red blood cells, was observed, with mean per-cell HbF levels maintained above the sickling threshold throughout follow-up.

A pancellular distribution of HbF, reflecting expression across most of the circulating red blood cells, was observed, with mean per-cell HbF levels maintained above the sickling threshold throughout follow-up. Improvement or Normalization of Anemia, Hemolysis Markers, Erythropoietin Levels, and Sickling Parameters: Total Hb levels increased rapidly with all patients experiencing resolution of anemia after elimination of the transfused blood. Key markers of hemolysis, including indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and reticulocytes, normalized or improved in all patients following risto-cel treatment. Erythropoietin levels also trended toward normal, indicating significant improvement in oxygen delivery to tissues. Sickling parameters all decreased in the blood following risto-cel treatment to levels comparable to that seen in individuals with sickle cell trait.

Erythropoietin levels also trended toward normal, indicating significant improvement in oxygen delivery to tissues. Sickling parameters all decreased in the blood following risto-cel treatment to levels comparable to that seen in individuals with sickle cell trait. Safety Profile Consistent with Busulfan and Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT): The safety profile of risto-cel was consistent with busulfan conditioning, autologous HSCT and underlying SCD. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with busulfan conditioning, including stomatitis, febrile neutropenia, and decreased appetite. As previously reported, one patient died four months after risto-cel infusion due to respiratory failure that was determined by the investigator to be likely related to busulfan conditioning and deemed unrelated to risto-cel.

In addition, Beam is presenting an oral presentation on Monday, December 8, 2025, (Abstract #2532) showing that a tiered fixed-dose plerixafor mobilization regimen led to higher CD34+ cell yields, faster collection, and fewer collection cycles compared to traditional weight-based dosing. The safety profile was generally comparable between fixed-dose and weight-based regimens, with four days of collection being well-tolerated, and a fixed dose regimen demonstrating greater efficiency in stem cell collection, supporting its use for manufacturing risto-cel in SCD.
