[TITLE]What BGC Group (BGC)'s Macro Hive Acquisition Means For Its Technology-Driven Growth Strategy:
[TEXT]
Earlier this month, BGC Group announced the acquisition of Macro Hive Limited, a provider of global macro market analytics and strategy, aiming to enhance its agency business and AI-driven capabilities in the Rates and FX markets.

This move signals BGC’s commitment to technology-led innovation, as Macro Hive’s leadership joins BGC to accelerate the integration of advanced analytics into its core broking and execution platform.

We'll examine how Macro Hive's AI analytics integration could reshape BGC Group's investment narrative and technology growth outlook.

Uncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward.

BGC Group Investment Narrative Recap

To own BGC Group stock, investors should have confidence in the company's ability to leverage technology and analytics to drive higher trading volumes and margins, particularly through expansions like the Macro Hive acquisition. While integrating Macro Hive’s AI-driven analytics aligns with BGC’s technology goals, this development does not materially alter the need for continued success in digital trading platforms, which remains the main catalyst, nor does it resolve the key risk of potential revenue decline if FX and rates market volatility fades.

One recent announcement that stands out is the launch of Opti Match, an electronic trading platform for U.S. dollar swaps. This innovation underscores BGC's focus on scaling its electronic trading, a central catalyst for potential margin expansion and future growth, and complements the technology push seen in the Macro Hive deal.

Yet, in contrast, investors should be mindful of the risk that if market volatility normalizes and cyclical tailwinds recede, BGC’s revenue growth could be pressured...

Read the full narrative on BGC Group (it's free!)

BGC Group's outlook anticipates $4.2 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in earnings by 2028. This is based on a projected 19.6% annual revenue growth rate and a $1.55 billion increase in earnings from the current level of $146.6 million.

Uncover how BGC Group's forecasts yield a $14.50 fair value, a 60% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

BGC Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025

Fair value estimates from three Simply Wall St Community members range from US$2.99 to US$14.50 per share. Despite this spread, the continued push into electronic trading platforms remains a primary area to watch for future performance shifts.

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:
[TEXT]

Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defense, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world's cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world's lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60%–70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union—long-term trading partners with African nations—have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa's resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa's position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasize local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa's critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another "resource curse."

The emerging 'New World Order'

A Chinese-led "New World Order" is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organizations. The initiative has expanded China's access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent
