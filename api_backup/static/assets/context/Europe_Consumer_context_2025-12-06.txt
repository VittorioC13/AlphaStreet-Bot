[TITLE]Sportsman’s Warehouse Holdings, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
Announces Opening of its Newest Store in Surprise, Arizona

Same store sales increased 2.2% over last year; outperforms the Q3 Adjusted NICS data

Gross margin up 100 basis points versus last year

Updates its full year 2025 Outlook

WEST JORDAN, Utah, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (“Sportsman's Warehouse” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPWH) today announced financial results for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025.

“This quarter we delivered our third consecutive period of positive same-store sales growth, driven by strong performance in our hunting, fishing, firearms, and personal protection categories, while continuing to gain share in a highly promotional and challenging retail environment,” said Paul Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Sportsman’s Warehouse. “We were also pleased in early November to open our new Surprise, Arizona location — our 11th store in the state — which marks our first personal protection-focused concept in a market where we have a proven track record of strong performance. This strategically located store represents our only planned opening for both 2025 and 2026 and reflects our commitment to thoughtful capital management.”

“In mid-October we started to see a softening in consumer spending from external disruptions which is weighing on our early fourth quarter sales,” continued Mr. Stone. “While still early, we are carefully navigating these consumer headwinds, and remain focused on disciplined execution, prudent cost management, and improving inventory productivity.”

For the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025:

Net sales were $331.3 million, an increase of 2.2%, compared to $324.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales in our Hunting and Shooting, Fishing and Apparel departments as we continue to emphasize inventory in-stocks, and our focused strategy to win the seasons in hunting and fishing to ensure we have the right inventory at the right location at the right time. In addition, the sales growth was driven by our strategic decision to lean into personal protection, including less-lethal alternatives.

Same store sales increased 2.2% during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily as a result of the same factors noted above that drove net sales growth and new digital marketing efforts.

Gross profit was $108.7 million, or 32.8% of net sales, compared to $103.1 million or 31.8% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. This 100 basis-point improvement, was largely driven by stronger product margins from healthier inventory, improved shrink, and increased sales in the Fishing department, which has an overall higher margin profile.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to $104.5 million, or 31.5% of net sales, compared to $100.0 million, or 30.8% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, due to a reinvestment into customer facing and sales driving areas of the business including store and support area labor and digital marketing to drive sales and improve omni-channel traffic.

Net income was $0.0 million, compared to a net loss of $(0.4) million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted net income was $3.0 million, compared to adjusted net income of $1.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Adjusted EBITDA was $18.6 million, compared to $16.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Diluted earnings per share were $0.00, compared to diluted loss per share of $(0.01) in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.08, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.04 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2025:

Net sales were $874.3 million, an increase of 2.0%, compared to $857.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales in our Hunting and Shooting, Fishing and Apparel departments as we continue to emphasize inventory in-stocks, and our focused strategy to win the seasons in hunting and fishing to ensure we have the right inventory at the right location at the right time. In addition, the sales growth was driven by our strategic decision to lean into personal protection, including less-lethal alternatives.

Same store sales increased 2.1% compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily as a result of the same factors noted above that drove net sales growth and new digital marketing efforts.

Gross profit was $278.3 million or 31.8% of net sales, compared to $266.9 million or 31.1% of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. The margin improvement was primarily driven by stronger product margins from healthier inventory, improved shrink, and increased sales in the Fishing department, which has an overall higher margin profile. These gains were partially offset by a sales mix shift toward lower-margin firearms and ammunition, which have a lower gross margin, and lower Camping department sales, which has a higher gross margin, and increased freight expense tied to our strategic inventory pull-forward.

SG&A expenses increased to $296.9 million or 34.0% of net sales, compared to $288.7 million or 33.7% of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, due to a reinvestment into customer facing and sales driving areas of the business including store and support area labor to drive sales and improve omni-channel traffic.

Net loss was $(28.3) million, compared to net loss of $(24.3) million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted net loss was $(17.4) million, compared to adjusted net loss of $(21.8) million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Adjusted EBITDA was $17.9 million, compared to $15.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Diluted loss per share was $(0.74), compared to diluted loss per share of $(0.65) in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted diluted loss per share was $(0.45), compared to adjusted diluted loss per share of $(0.58) in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Balance sheet and capital allocation highlights as of November 1, 2025:

The Company ended the third quarter with net debt of $179.7 million, comprised of $137.9 million of borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility, $44.0 million of net borrowings outstanding under the Company’s term loan facility, and $2.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $424.0 million.

Total liquidity was $111.9 million as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, comprised of $109.7 million of availability under the Company’s revolving credit facility and term loan facility and $2.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.

Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook:

“During the third quarter, we remained focused on strengthening our balance sheet and improving working capital efficiency in a challenging operating environment,” said Jennifer Fall Jung, Chief Financial Officer of Sportsman’s Warehouse. “We reduced total inventory by $14.2 million year-over-year and by $19.5 million sequentially, while ensuring our stores were appropriately positioned for the fall hunting, fishing, and holiday selling seasons. Our inventory strategy continues to prioritize core, seasonally relevant, and higher-turning products, and we remain committed to reducing overall inventory levels as we drive improved efficiency in our operating model.”

Fall Jung continued, “We also remain focused on enhancing liquidity, paying down $13.2 million in debt during the quarter and generating positive momentum toward year-end free cash flow. Given ongoing macroeconomic pressures, external disruptions since mid-October weighing on sales, and a highly promotional retail environment, we are adjusting our full year guidance. While visibility remains limited, we believe our continued focus on inventory discipline, cost control, and positive free cash flow generation positions us to navigate near-term challenges while working toward more sustainable profitability over time.”

The Company is adjusting its sales guidance for fiscal year 2025 and now expects net sales to be flat to up slightly and anticipates adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $22 million to $26 million, reflecting a tough fourth quarter environment due to a challenged US consumer. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2025 to be less than $25 million, primarily related to strategic technological investments, such as planogramming, merchandising and replenishment and store scheduling tools, and general store fleet maintenance. Additionally, the company anticipates to end the year with less than $330 million in inventory and lower debt, reflecting working capital efficiency.

The Company has not reconciled expected adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2025 to GAAP net income because the Company does not provide guidance for net (loss) income and is not able to provide a reconciliation to net (loss) income without unreasonable effort. The Company is not able to estimate net (loss) income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

[TITLE]Shift4 Payments, Inc. (FOUR): A Bull Case Theory:
[TEXT]
We came across a bullish thesis on Shift4 Payments, Inc. on GabGrowth’s Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on FOUR. Shift4 Payments, Inc.'s share was trading at $70.79 as of December 2nd. FOUR’s trailing and forward P/E were 34.48 and 11.67 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Mastercard Incorporated (MA) Has Very Strong Fundamentals, Says Jim Cramer

Shift4 has transformed from a small merchant acquirer founded in 1999 by Jared Isaacman into a vertically integrated global payments and commerce technology platform. The company serves over 200,000 businesses across restaurants, retail, hotels, casinos, and e-commerce, providing an end-to-end ecosystem that combines point-of-sale (POS) hardware and software, payment processing, and value-added services such as loyalty programs, fraud prevention, and analytics.

Shift4’s evolution was shaped by an aggressive acquisition strategy—over 18 deals totaling $3.5 billion—that expanded its capabilities and geographic reach, including the landmark $2.5 billion acquisition of Global Blue in 2025, which added 400,000 international merchant locations and a cross-border VAT refund service.

Earlier acquisitions like Finaro, Revel, and Givex established a strong European infrastructure, enterprise-grade POS offerings, and global gift card and loyalty capabilities, respectively. This consolidation has enabled Shift4 to build a unified commerce platform that supports in-person, online, and mobile transactions across markets. Its vertically integrated model—combining software, hardware, and payments—simplifies operations for merchants, reduces vendor fragmentation, and enhances pricing control.

Financially, the company’s growth has been underpinned by recurring transaction revenue with high retention rates above 98% and strong operating leverage from scale. While critics have questioned its acquisition-driven growth and leverage, Shift4 has maintained robust performance, aided by partnerships with major hospitality and entertainment brands. As it transitions leadership from Isaacman to Taylor Lauber, Shift4 appears well-positioned to leverage its global infrastructure and diversified product suite, offering investors exposure to the expanding digital payments and omnichannel commerce ecosystem.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Shift4 Payments, Inc. (FOUR) by Next 100 Baggers in May 2025, which highlighted strong payment volume growth, operating leverage, and M&A-driven synergies. The company’s stock has depreciated approximately 14.97% since our coverage as sentiment softened. The thesis still stands given resilient fundamentals and leadership stability. GabGrowth shares a similar view but emphasizes Shift4’s global expansion and vertical integration.

[TITLE]Car-makers drive European stocks gains on back of Trump move to ease fuel standards:

European stocks advanced Thursday as carmakers fuelled gains on the back of the news that US President Donald Trump is looking to reduce fuel economy standards aimed at making it easier for carmakers to sell fossil fuel cars.

Dublin

The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 0.16 per cent to 12,746.24, giving up Wednesday’s gains and a bit more.

Cairn Homes was the biggest winner on the day, adding 1.81 per cent to hit €2.03. Glenveagh narrowly stayed in the green, up 0.1 per cent.

A number of major components trimmed recent gains, Ryanair backed off from its recent €28 highs, falling 0.18 per cent to €27.67. Kerry Group lost 1.33 per cent to €77.65 and Bank of Ireland dropped 0.03 per cent.

Further share prices losses from insulation and building materials specialist, Kingspan Group, dragged the index into the red. It fell 0.54 per cent to €73.50.

London

The FTSE 100 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 9,710.87, despite downbeat construction data, amid growing conviction of a US interest rate cut next week.

Among the winners was London-based SSP, which operates Upper Crust. It leapt 11 per cent after reporting that trading had “gained momentum” in recent weeks and announced a “wide-ranging review” of its Continental European rail business.

The operator of food and beverage outlets in travel locations in 38 countries said it is also mulling options to “realise value” in recently-listed Indian investee Travel Food Services.

British luxury fashion house Burberry gained 3.01 per cent after an HSBC raised its target price on the luxury goods maker.

Trustpilot dropped 32 per cent, after a scathing report from short-seller Grizzly Research, which accused the Copenhagen-based consumer review platform of “mafia-style extortion campaigns against non-paying businesses”.

Citing its own investigation, Grizzly said that Trustpilot created “unsolicited review profiles for all kinds of businesses with the intention to attract hyper-negative reviews and force these businesses into paying subscription deals to ‘more actively manage’ the reviews.” Trustpilot called the claims “selective, misleading and framed to support a predetermined narrative”.

Also firmly in the red was Baltic Classifieds, down 14 per cent, after it warned that lower revenue growth and continued investment will depress margins in the short term.

Europe

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.5 per cent at the close. Auto stocks led gains with Mercedes-Benz closing up 4.8 per cent and Porsche adding 6.13 per cent. With BMW, up 4.49 per cent, the German auto stocks were among the beneficiaries of the news on fuel economy standards.

Industrials stocks also outperformed, with travel and leisure as well as healthcare shares among the laggards.

In company news, Schneider Electric gained 3.5 per cent and Siemens Energy rose 2.5 per cent after JPMorgan Chase analysts upgraded both firms, saying they remain bullish on the European capital-goods sector.

Royal Philips slumped 5.7 per cent, the biggest fall on the index in percentage point terms, after Citigroup analysts flagged tariff and China challenges for 2026.

The main regional index is within 1 per cent of a November record amid resilient earnings and economic growth.

New York

Wall Street’s major indices were mostly flat in the midafternoon, as investors reviewed fresh labour-market signals and firmed up their expectations for a possible Federal Reserve rate ‍cut next week.

Investors were also treading carefully ahead of Friday’s September Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, the Fed’s preferred inflation ‌gauge, ​which ‍would be the first PCE readout since the recent US government shutdown.

Meta rose after a report said the tech giant planned to make cuts of up to 30 per cent to its Metaverse budget.

Amazon.com said it was in discussions with the US Postal Service about their future relationship and is considering its options before its contract expires next year. The ecommerce giant’s shares were down.

The consumer staples sector was pressured by a fall in Kroger shares. The ‌supermarket chain narrowed its annual sales ‌forecast and missed quarterly sales estimates. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

[TITLE]Flipkart festival season customer base tops 200 million; Tier-2 & Tier-3 drive growth:
[TEXT]
E-commerce firm Flipkart on Wednesday said it has reported one of its strongest growth phases in recent years, marked by a sharp rise in customer base, higher order volumes, and deeper participation from Tier-2 and Tier-3 towns.

The company said it served over 200 million customers across its ecosystem during the festive season, reflecting its expanding relevance in urban and non-metro India.

Overall orders on the platform grew 21 per cent during the festive period, and around 40 per cent year-on-year post-festive period, signalling broad-based consumer confidence and category momentum, the company said in a statement.

Small-town momentum

The festive cycle attracted 101 million customers, with two-thirds of them from non-metro areas - a trend Flipkart said reflects the accelerating shift of smaller towns toward online consumption and category diversification.

"The belief that India's consumption story is driven only by metros is outdated. We see multiple Indians shopping on Flipkart: value-conscious families, convenience-driven younger customers, and a rapidly growing segment of aspirational buyers exploring brands and new categories. This shift is structural, not seasonal. Our priority is to serve all of them with access, affordability, and trust as we deepen our role in India's digital retail economy," Flipkart Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Rajneesh Kumar, said.

Flipkart attributed its momentum to sustained investments in commerce, supply chain, and technology, supported by a seasoned leadership bench guiding its scale-up and long-term vision.

MSME boost strategy

To support this rising tide of customers, the company doubled down on enabling its seller ecosystem, particularly MSMEs.

A major development this year was Flipkart's introduction of a zero-commission model for all eligible products priced below Rs 1,000, which is expected to reduce sellers' platform costs by up to 30 per cent in certain categories.

This strategic move strengthens the platform's inclusive marketplace by allowing sellers to price more competitively, expand selection, and meet the massive demand in the sub-Rs 1,000 segment.

On Shopsy, Flipkart’s hyper-value platform, the zero-commission structure applies across all price points.

Flipkart said the change expands affordability for customers, while enabling MSMEs to scale more easily.

Sakait Chaudhary, Senior Vice President and Head of Marketplace, said the initiative is designed to widen opportunities. "Millions of customers in India shop in the sub-Rs 1,000 segment. By removing commission barriers, we allow sellers to price more competitively, expand their catalogue, and reach more households. This is how we strengthen a more inclusive, sustainable marketplace." The festive period also witnessed a strong momentum from India's MSME ecosystem. Flipkart saw participation from lakhs of sellers, with women-led enterprises, regional manufacturers, and artisan communities showing significant momentum.

Logistics at scale

The company said this signals accelerating digital entrepreneurship beyond major metros. The platform's growth is underpinned by an expanding, resilient, and greener logistics network.

Flipkart's supply chain network saw a significant expansion of 35 lakh square feet, covering over 21,000 pin codes with a logistics network of more than 100 fulfilment centres, and rapidly scaling its quick commerce business with more than 450 new micro-fulfilment centres across 30 cities.

The company has doubled its EV last-mile fleet to more than 20,000, with nearly 70 per cent of grocery deliveries now made via EVs, and has also introduced electric long-haul trucks on routes such as Delhi–Jaipur, strengthening its commitment to sustainable operations.

Hemant Badri, Senior Vice President for Supply Chain, Minutes, and Customer Experience, said the festive season showed the strength of Flipkart's long-term investments.

"Our network has been built pin code by pin code for over a decade. This season, our supply chain demonstrated robust scale and resilience, managing a 24 per cent year-on-year growth in unit volumes, maintaining 99.9 per cent uptime on peak days, and operating with a significantly greener last-mile fleet. With over 60 per cent of orders coming from Tier 2 and 3 regions, it reaffirms that our infrastructure is built to serve all of India. We are proud to have delivered not just packages, but trust and celebration to millions of households across Bharat." Underpinning the entire ecosystem is Flipkart's investment in technology to ensure a trusted and safe consumer experience.

Balaji Thiagarajan, Chief Product and Technology Officer, said, "Our platform is built for the future of commerce - a future defined by both massive scale and unshakeable trust. The number of users that seamlessly engaged on the platform grew by nearly 16 per cent this festive season compared to last year, demonstrating the exponential power of engineering at scale. Trust remains a defining factor in India's maturing e-commerce market. We have made deeper investments in platform safety and have delivered a 25 per cent reduction in account takeover frauds, 99.95 per cent accuracy in blocking malicious requests, and a 50 per cent cut in customer handling time through GenAI-powered support." Across categories, Flipkart saw a balanced growth across fashion, home, beauty, electronics, and refurbished goods with rising repeat purchases in metros and non-metros, driven increasingly by reliability, convenience and selection - not offers alone. "As India's consumption story evolves, the platforms that will succeed are the ones that deliver access, affordability, and trust simultaneously," Rajneesh Kumar said. "That is the direction we have set for Flipkart."

Uses of Paints and Coatings Market

Paint: Paint is often used in residential, commercial, and strata buildings for interior and exterior walls and ceilings. It is also used to decorate furniture, doors, and windows. The most important fact is that you can paint over coatings but can’t apply coatings over paint.

Coatings: Coatings are used mostly in industrial buildings like garages, shopping malls, and warehouses. They can also be used on cars, appliances, bridges, and pipes where protection is required to save the property from wear and tear.

Purpose

Paint: Painting mainly enhances the beauty of any structure. Its main purpose is to make any property look appealing or aesthetic. Though it can provide some level of protection, it’s not the main goal. Paint is used only for decorative purposes to make old buildings newer and nicer.

Coatings: The coating scenario is different. It has a wide range of purposes. Coatings can also add decoration to the property, but the main purpose is to give protection and perform for a long time. The functions coatings can do include rust and corrosion protection, stability in ultra-violate rays, colour retention, protection against mould, mildew and bacteria, waterproofing, water shading, etc. Coatings can also be fire and chemical-resistant.

Welcome to our weekly newsletter where we highlight environmental trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world.

Molly Segal here. Given the cost of living crisis Canadians are grappling with, I wondered if it’s possible to invest green and still meet your financial goals.

Can you actually invest green and make money?

Lori and Rick Findlay like to be climate-conscious, which prompted them to take a closer look at their investments. (Submitted by Rick and Lori Findlay)

Lori Findlay, a retired school principal living in Toronto, said she and her husband, Rick, try to make decisions in their daily lives that "will have the least negative impact on others and on our planet."

From fixing rather than replacing broken items to taking public transit and limiting air travel, the 68-year-old couple likes to be climate-conscious. Rick, who is semi-retired and works in clean technology ventures, took a closer look at how they had invested their savings.

"I found sort of down deep in these funds, a lot of fossil fuel and I just said, 'OK, that's it. We have to make a change,'" he said.

But when they asked their financial advisor

European stocks advanced Thursday as carmakers fuelled gains on the back of the news that US President Donald Trump is looking to reduce fuel economy standards aimed at making it easier for carmakers to sell fossil fuel cars.

Dublin

The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 0.16 per cent to 12,746.24, giving up Wednesday’s gains and a bit more.

Cairn Homes was the biggest winner on the day, adding 1.81 per cent to hit €2.03. Glenveagh narrowly stayed in the green, up 0.1 per cent.

A number of major components trimmed recent gains, Ryanair backed off from its recent €28 highs, falling 0.18 per cent to €27.67. Kerry Group lost 1.33 per cent to €77.65 and Bank of Ireland dropped 0.03 per cent.

Further share prices losses from insulation and building materials specialist, Kingspan Group, dragged the index into the red. It fell 0.54 per cent to €73.50.

London

The FTSE 100 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 9,710.87, despite downbeat construction data, amid growing conviction of a US interest rate cut next week.

Among the winners was London-based SSP, which operates Upper Crust. It leapt 11 per cent after reporting that trading had “gained momentum” in recent weeks and announced a “wide-ranging review” of its Continental European rail business.

The operator of food and beverage outlets in travel locations in 38 countries said it is also mulling options to “realise value” in recently-listed Indian investee Travel Food Services.

British luxury fashion house Burberry gained 3.01 per cent after an HSBC raised its target price on the luxury goods maker.

Trustpilot dropped 32 per cent, after a scathing report from short-seller Grizzly Research, which accused the Copenhagen-based consumer review platform of “mafia-style extortion campaigns against non-paying businesses”.

Citing its own investigation, Grizzly said that Trustpilot created “unsolicited review profiles for all kinds of businesses with the intention to attract hyper-negative reviews and force these businesses into paying subscription deals to ‘more actively manage’ the reviews.” Trustpilot called the claims “selective, misleading and framed to support a predetermined narrative”.

Also firmly in the red was Baltic Classifieds, down 14 per cent, after it warned that lower revenue growth and continued investment will depress margins in the short term.

Europe

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.5 per cent at the close. Auto stocks led gains with Mercedes-Benz closing up 4.8 per cent and Porsche adding 6.13 per cent. With BMW, up 4.49 per cent, the German auto stocks were among the beneficiaries of the news on fuel economy standards.

Industrials stocks also outperformed, with travel and leisure as well as healthcare shares among the laggards.

In company news, Schneider Electric gained 3.5 per cent and Siemens Energy rose 2.5 per cent after JPMorgan Chase analysts upgraded both firms, saying they remain bullish on the European capital-goods sector.

Royal Philips slumped 5.7 per cent, the biggest fall on the index in percentage point terms, after Citigroup analysts flagged tariff and China challenges for 2026.

The main regional index is within 1 per cent of a November record amid resilient earnings and economic growth.

New York

Wall Street’s major indices were mostly flat in the midafternoon, as investors reviewed fresh labour-market signals and firmed up their expectations for a possible Federal Reserve rate ‍cut next week.

Investors were also treading carefully ahead of Friday’s September Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, the Fed’s preferred inflation ‌gauge, ​which ‍would be the first PCE readout since the recent US government shutdown.

Meta rose after a report said the tech giant planned to make cuts of up to 30 per cent to its Metaverse budget.

Amazon.com said it was in discussions with the US Postal Service about their future relationship and is considering its options before its contract expires next year. The ecommerce giant’s shares were down.

The consumer staples sector was pressured by a fall in Kroger shares. The ‌supermarket chain narrowed its annual sales ‌forecast and missed quarterly sales estimates. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

[TITLE]PVH Stock Drops 11.8% as Wall Street Waits for Fundamentals to Improve:
[TEXT]
Updated 4:13 p.m. ET Dec. 4

Wall Street is still waiting for PVH Corp. to take off.

Shares of the company fell 11.8 percent to $77.21 on Thursday, after the company beat its third-quarter earnings estimates, but didn’t raise its outlook for the year, signaling that business will be spread out between the two quarters.

“PVH shares look cheap, but they sure aren’t making it easy for value investors to step in,” said Tom Nikic, an analyst at Needham. “Trends continue to be very volatile.”

The Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent company saw third-quarter revenues increase 2 percent to $2.3 billion, making for a drop of less than 1 percent in constant currencies. PVH expects revenues to be flat to slightly positive for the year, in constant currencies.

Nikic zeroed in on the company’s “negative inflection” in the Europe, Middle East and Africa division, which trended down 2 percent in constant currencies.

“This was expected to be one of the growth drivers of the business following last year’s reset of the market — a gross margin miss didn’t help either,” the analyst said. “We continue to believe that shares are too cheap, particularly since they can probably buy back a high-single-digit percent of the float annually at these levels, if not more.

“Third-quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points, missing guidance by 25 basis points, driven by tariffs (110 basis point negative impact), the impact of bringing licenses in-house (50 basis points) and higher promotional mix, partially due to the … Calvin Klein product shipment delays,” he said.

PVH has been busy taking back licenses for its North American wholesale business from G-III Apparel Group, absorbing some of the businesses and finding other licensees for some categories, including dresses.

In conjunction with that take-back, the company set up a “global product kitchen” for Calvin Klein in New York, a complicated switch that had an uneven start.

Stefan Larsson, chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call Thursday that the “delays from the transitory Calvin global product challenges put extra strain on our European distribution center, impacting shipments for both Calvin and Tommy, which made us lose a few critical weeks of full-price selling.”

But Larsson, who’s been busy remaking the company since stepping into the corner office in 2021, suggested it was growing pains the company was feeling.

“We are on track both from on-time delivery coming into spring ’26 and the margin recapture that we set out to take back. On both fronts, we are on track, which is really good,” he said. “It’s painful now, but we had to do it because in order to build premium products, differentiated product franchises with innovation, we need the global capability to do that. And now we have it for both Calvin and Tommy. And so do all of our best competitors in the premium space also have it. But we had to build that. And now you start to see it.”

But Wall Street is still waiting.

Matthew Boss, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said: “While we see multiyear brand ‘unlock’ underway with the new leadership team focused on driving increased desirability of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands through improved product design and marketing, we see an elongated path to reaching management’s mid-teens operating margin target given a slower top-line recovery with continued macroeconomic challenges globally, in addition to a competitive external promotional backdrop, and foreign exchange pressures.”

This year, PVH expects its adjusted operating margin to come in at about 8.5 percent.

[TITLE]Sportsman’s Warehouse Holdings, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
Announces Opening of its Newest Store in Surprise, Arizona

Same store sales increased 2.2% over last year; outperforms the Q3 Adjusted NICS data

Gross margin up 100 basis points versus last year

Updates its full year 2025 Outlook

WEST JORDAN, Utah, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (“Sportsman's Warehouse” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPWH) today announced financial results for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025.

“This quarter we delivered our third consecutive period of positive same-store sales growth, driven by strong performance in our hunting, fishing, firearms, and personal protection categories, while continuing to gain share in a highly promotional and challenging retail environment,” said Paul Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Sportsman’s Warehouse. “We were also pleased in early November to open our new Surprise, Arizona location — our 11th store in the state — which marks our first personal protection-focused concept in a market where we have a proven track record of strong performance. This strategically located store represents our only planned opening for both 2025 and 2026 and reflects our commitment to thoughtful capital management.”

“In mid-October we started to see a softening in consumer spending from external disruptions which is weighing on our early fourth quarter sales,” continued Mr. Stone. “While still early, we are carefully navigating these consumer headwinds, and remain focused on disciplined execution, prudent cost management, and improving inventory productivity.”

For the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025:

Net sales were $331.3 million, an increase of 2.2%, compared to $324.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales in our Hunting and Shooting, Fishing and Apparel departments as we continue to emphasize inventory in-stocks, and our focused strategy to win the seasons in hunting and fishing to ensure we have the right inventory at the right location at the right time. In addition, the sales growth was driven by our strategic decision to lean into personal protection, including less-lethal alternatives.

Same store sales increased 2.2% during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily as a result of the same factors noted above that drove net sales growth and new digital marketing efforts.

Gross profit was $108.7 million, or 32.8% of net sales, compared to $103.1 million or 31.8% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. This 100 basis-point improvement, was largely driven by stronger product margins from healthier inventory, improved shrink, and increased sales in the Fishing department, which has an overall higher margin profile.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to $104.5 million, or 31.5% of net sales, compared to $100.0 million, or 30.8% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, due to a reinvestment into customer facing and sales driving areas of the business including store and support area labor and digital marketing to drive sales and improve omni-channel traffic.

Net income was $0.0 million, compared to a net loss of $(0.4) million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted net income was $3.0 million, compared to adjusted net income of $1.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Adjusted EBITDA was $18.6 million, compared to $16.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Diluted earnings per share were $0.00, compared to diluted loss per share of $(0.01) in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.08, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.04 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2025:

Net sales were $874.3 million, an increase of 2.0%, compared to $857.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales in our Hunting and Shooting, Fishing and Apparel departments as we continue to emphasize inventory in-stocks, and our focused strategy to win the seasons in hunting and fishing to ensure we have the right inventory at the right location at the right time. In addition, the sales growth was driven by our strategic decision to lean into personal protection, including less-lethal alternatives.

Same store sales increased 2.1% compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily as a result of the same factors noted above that drove net sales growth and new digital marketing efforts.

Gross profit was $278.3 million or 31.8% of net sales, compared to $266.9 million or 31.1% of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. The margin improvement was primarily driven by stronger product margins from healthier inventory, improved shrink, and increased sales in the Fishing department, which has an overall higher margin profile. These gains were partially offset by a sales mix shift toward lower-margin firearms and ammunition, which have a lower gross margin, and lower Camping department sales, which has a higher gross margin, and increased freight expense tied to our strategic inventory pull-forward.

SG&A expenses increased to $296.9 million or 34.0% of net sales, compared to $288.7 million or 33.7% of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, due to a reinvestment into customer facing and sales driving areas of the business including store and support area labor to drive sales and improve omni-channel traffic.

Net loss was $(28.3) million, compared to net loss of $(24.3) million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted net loss was $(17.4) million, compared to adjusted net loss of $(21.8) million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Adjusted EBITDA was $17.9 million, compared to $15.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Diluted loss per share was $(0.74), compared to diluted loss per share of $(0.65) in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted diluted loss per share was $(0.45), compared to adjusted diluted loss per share of $(0.58) in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).

Balance sheet and capital allocation highlights as of November 1, 2025:

The Company ended the third quarter with net debt of $179.7 million, comprised of $137.9 million of borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility, $44.0 million of net borrowings outstanding under the Company’s term loan facility, and $2.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $424.0 million.

Total liquidity was $111.9 million as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, comprised of $109.7 million of availability under the Company’s revolving credit facility and term loan facility and $2.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.

Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook:

“During the third quarter, we remained focused on strengthening our balance sheet and improving working capital efficiency in a challenging operating environment,” said Jennifer Fall Jung, Chief Financial Officer of Sportsman’s Warehouse. “We reduced total inventory by $14.2 million year-over-year and by $19.5 million sequentially, while ensuring our stores were appropriately positioned for the fall hunting, fishing, and holiday selling seasons. Our inventory strategy continues to prioritize core, seasonally relevant, and higher-turning products, and we remain committed to reducing overall inventory levels as we drive improved efficiency in our operating model.”

Fall Jung continued, “We also remain focused on enhancing liquidity, paying down $13.2 million in debt during the quarter and generating positive momentum toward year-end free cash flow. Given ongoing macroeconomic pressures, external disruptions since mid-October weighing on sales, and a highly promotional retail environment, we are adjusting our full year guidance. While visibility remains limited, we believe our continued focus on inventory discipline, cost control, and positive free cash flow generation positions us to navigate near-term challenges while working toward more sustainable profitability over time.”

The Company is adjusting its sales guidance for fiscal year 2025 and now expects net sales to be flat to up slightly and anticipates adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $22 million to $26 million, reflecting a tough fourth quarter environment due to a challenged US consumer. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2025 to be less than $25 million, primarily related to strategic technological investments, such as planogramming, merchandising and replenishment and store scheduling tools, and general store fleet maintenance. Additionally, the company anticipates to end the year with less than $330 million in inventory and lower debt, reflecting working capital efficiency.

The Company has not reconciled expected adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2025 to GAAP net income because the Company does not provide guidance for net (loss) income and is not able to provide a reconciliation to net (loss) income without unreasonable effort. The Company is not able to estimate net (loss) income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

[TITLE]Zumiez Inc. Announces Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Results:
[TEXT]
Third Quarter Earnings Per Share Increased to $0.55 from $0.06 last year

Third Quarter Comparable Sales Increased 7.6%

North American Third Quarter Comparable Sales Increased 10.0%

Fourth Quarter To-Date Comparable Sales Up 6.6%

LYNNWOOD, Wash., Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zumiez Inc. (NASDAQ: ZUMZ) a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for young men and women, today reported results for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025.

Net sales for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025 (13 weeks) increased 7.5% to $239.1 million from $222.5 million in the third quarter ended November 2, 2024 (13 weeks). Comparable sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2025, increased 7.6% on top of a 7.5% increase in the year ago period. Net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $9.2 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.06 per share, in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025 we benefitted from one-time discrete tax items which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09.

Total net sales for the nine months (39 weeks) ending November 1, 2025 increased 4.5% to $637.7 million from $610.0 million reported for the nine months (39 weeks) ending November 2, 2024. Comparable sales increased 5.3% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2025. Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was $6.2 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to a net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 of $16.5 million, or $0.86 per share. The first nine months of 2025 was negatively impacted by $3.6 million, or approximately $0.15 per share related to the settlement of a wage and hours lawsuit in California.

On November 1, 2025, the Company had cash and current marketable securities of $104.5 million compared to cash and current marketable securities of $99.3 million on November 2, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by $50.5 million of cash flow from operations and the release of $3.0 million in restricted cash, partially offset by $38.3 million related to share repurchases and $12.5 million of capital expenditures. The Company repurchased 0.3 million shares during the third quarter of 2025 at an average cost including commission of $18.61 per share and a total cost of $5.4 million. Fiscal year-to-date through November 1, 2025, the Company has repurchased 2.7 million shares at an average cost including commission of $14.18 per share and a total cost of $38.3 million. $1.7 million remains on the current open repurchase authorization.

“We achieved our best third quarter in several years,” said Rick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer of Zumiez Inc. “High-single digit comparable sales growth and strong full price selling drove meaningful gross margin expansion, which combined with good expense management, resulted in a significant improvement in profitability. The work we have done enhancing our brand and merchandise assortments continues to resonate with our consumers, especially in North America, evidenced by the sharp sequential increase in the region’s comparable sales trends to double digits. Importantly, the holiday season is off to a strong start with overall comps up 6.6% fourth quarter-to-date and up 8.7% over the Black Friday to Cyber Monday timeframe. While the overall consumer environment remains choppy, we are encouraged by the pace of our business and are increasingly confident in delivering a solid finish to fiscal 2025 and building on our progress next year.”

Fourth Quarter To-Date

Fourth quarter-to-date total sales for the 31 days ending December 2, 2025 increased 7.5%, compared with the same 31-day period in the prior year ended December 3, 2024.

Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Outlook

The Company is introducing guidance for the three months ending January 31, 2026. Net sales are projected to be in the range of $291 to $296 million representing sales growth of 4.0% to 6.0%. Consolidated operating margins are expected to be between 8.0% and 8.5% resulting in earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.97 to $1.07.

The Company opened 6 new stores in fiscal 2025, including 5 stores in North America and 1 store in Australia.

[TITLE]Global luxury apparel market to rebound slowly after 2024 setback – analysis:
[TEXT]

The global luxury apparel market will undergo a gradual recovery after a 2.4% contraction in 2024, analysis indicates.

According to GlobalData Global Luxury Apparel Market to 2029 report, growth will return in 2025, but it is expected to be largely fuelled by price increases rather than higher sales volumes.

Macro pressures including inflation across Europe and the US and a sharp slowdown in China dented consumer spending last year, producing the market’s first material setback in several years. GlobalData’s report forecasts that the sector will grow by 2.0% in 2025 as brands raise prices to protect margins, even as volumes continue to decline.

Free Sample Download sample pages of selected reports Explore a selection of report samples we have handpicked for you. Get a preview of the insights inside. Download your free copy today.

Over the 2024–29 period, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 2.8% and to begin outperforming the broader apparel market from 2028 as the finances of aspirational shoppers improve.

Clothing is projected to be the strongest category through 2029, with a 3.1% CAGR driven by ultra-wealthy consumers who remain willing to spend on trend-led pieces; womenswear is expected to outperform menswear. Accessories – led by luxury handbags as enduring status symbols – should record a 2.9% CAGR. Footwear looks set to be the weakest area, with a modest 1.0% CAGR, as strong demand for trainers from premium and mass-market specialists limits growth for high-end shoe categories.

Asia-Pacific will be the growth engine, posting the strongest regional CAGR of 4.0% between 2024 and 2029, supported by the recovery of China and robust growth in emerging Asian markets. In contrast, Europe and the Americas are forecast to experience softer growth – 1.8% and 1.5% CAGRs respectively – hampered by sluggish economies and the lingering effects of US tariffs. The Middle East and Africa will increase its share of the global market, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates benefiting from tourism and strong domestic spending.

Luxury heavyweights retained power in 2024. Louis Vuitton remained the largest apparel brand, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Hermès was the standout performer, expanding share by 0.7 percentage points to 6.0% as its exclusivity and craftsmanship held strong appeal among the ultra-wealthy. Chanel also gained share, largely through strategic price increases. By contrast, brands such as Gucci and Burberry lost ground amid unclear positioning and weaker product offerings.

Luxury apparel rebound drivers

Several structural factors underpin the recovery outlook. Ultra-wealthy customers continue to provide a stabilising base for top-tier luxury houses, maintaining demand and preserving brand equity. Meanwhile, improvements in broader macroeconomic conditions and rising consumer confidence should gradually bring back aspirational shoppers – the expanding middle and upper-middle segments whose purchasing power was most affected during the downturn.

Social media and influencer marketing are playing an increasingly important role in engaging younger buyers. Luxury brands are courting content creators and leaning into platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to capture Gen Z’s appetite for luxury. Collaborations with celebrities, entertainment franchises and other brands continue to deliver cultural moments that drive excitement and sales.

At the same time, the booming resale market presents both opportunity and challenge. Resale apparel is expected to grow sharply – by nearly 48% between 2024 and 2028 – with luxury items particularly coveted as more affordable options. Some houses have partnered with resale platforms to reclaim share, but secondhand channels remain a threat to full-price sales, especially among budget-conscious aspirational shoppers.

China’s 2024 slowdown – driven in part by its real estate crisis – hit the market hard, and while stimulus should support a recovery in 2025, Chinese shoppers are likely to remain cautious, amplified by government messaging discouraging ostentatious displays of wealth. Online luxury retail also faces challenges: the collapse of major multi-brand platforms in 2024 has reinforced the importance of brick-and-mortar boutiques, where premium service and in-store experience are key to selling high-priced items.

Ulta Beauty beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines in its third quarter, helped by fragrance, K-beauty and international expansion.

The Bolingbrook, Ill.-based retailer reported net sales increased 12.9 percent to $2.9 billion, primarily due to increased comparable sales, the acquisition of Space NK, and net new store contribution. Wall Street had penciled in $2.71 billion.

Net income was $230.9 million, compared to $242.2 million a year earlier, while diluted earnings per share were flat at $5.14, but above analysts’ estimates for $4.61.

As a result of a better than expected third quarter, Ulta is now anticipating net sales of

[TITLE]Salmon Market Set to Reach Valuation of US$ 51.20 Billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global salmon market was valued at US$ 25.19 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 51.20 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.2% from 2025-2033.

The global salmon market is currently navigating its most volatile period in two decades. For years, Atlantic salmon was the darling of the "Blue Economy"—a protein with a feed conversion ratio (FCR) that embarrassed the beef industry and a consumer demand curve that seemed exclusively vertical. But as we step further into 2025, the narrative of "Pink Gold" has fractured. We are no longer looking at a homogeneous growth market; we are witnessing a sector being torn apart by three simultaneous shockwaves: a radical redrawing of tax regimes, a biological ceiling that net-pens cannot seem to breach, and a brutal correction in land-based farming valuations.

The "Salmon Tax" Shockwave: Capital Flight and the Price Council Standoff

The biggest geopolitical disruption in aquaculture history hit on January 1, 2023, but its true aftershocks are only now being felt in the Q4 2024 and Q1 2025 balance sheets. Norway’s implementation of a 25% "Resource Rent Tax" on sea-phase profits has done more than just skim margins; it has fundamentally altered the risk profile of the North Atlantic salmon market.

While the headline tax rate was reduced from the initial threatening 40%, the devil has proven to be in the administrative details—specifically, the Norm Price Council (Prisrådet).

The core friction today is not the tax itself, but the valuation mechanism. The Norwegian government insists on taxing farmers based on a "spot price" set by a bureaucratic council, rather than the actual realized price. In 2024, we saw a massive divergence between these two figures. Because of the "winter ulcer" crisis (more on this below), a significant percentage of Norwegian harvest was "production grade" (prodfisk)—fish that cannot be exported until processed because of skin lesions. The Price Council often sets taxes based on "Superior" grade prices, leaving farmers to pay taxes on phantom profits they never earned.

The Market Move: Salmon market capital is fleeing the fjords. Major players like SalMar and Mowi have frozen billions in offshore development. The immediate beneficiaries are not other net-pen jurisdictions, but Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Watch for a valuation premium emerging in Faroese operators (like Bakkafrost) who are shielded from this specific tax structure, allowing them to reinvest free cash flow into biology while their Norwegian rivals burn cash on tax compliance.
