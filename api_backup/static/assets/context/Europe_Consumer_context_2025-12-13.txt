CANTON, Mass. and NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Destination XL Group, Inc. (“DXL”) (NASDAQ: DXLG), the leading integrated commerce retailer of Big + Tall men’s clothing and footwear, and FBB Holdings I, Inc. (“FullBeauty”), a first mover in inclusive sizing for both women and men and proudly inclusive since 1901, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine in a merger of equals and create a scaled, category-defining retailer for inclusive apparel.

The combined company will unite complementary brands, channels, and capabilities to better serve plus-size women and Big + Tall men as a larger, stronger and more flexible public company positioned for long-term growth. Together, DXL and FullBeauty will be a leader in inclusive sizing apparel with one of the industry’s broadest and most diverse portfolios – spanning value to premium across lifestyles and occasions. By leveraging complementary strengths across gender, product and channel, the combined company will be positioned to accelerate growth, improve operational efficiency and deliver an enhanced customer experience through a comprehensive, innovative multi-channel strategy. The combined company will reflect a direct-to-consumer mix at 73% of total sales, with bricks-and-mortar at 27% of total sales.

The companies delivered combined net sales of approximately $1.2 billion for the last twelve months ending October 2025. Assuming no pro forma adjustments, Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was approximately $45 million. Including $25 million in expected annual run-rate cost synergies, the combined company would have generated approximately $70 million of LTM Adjusted EBITDA.

Following the completion of the all-stock transaction, FullBeauty and DXL shareholders will own 55% and 45% of the combined company, respectively.

[TITLE]Destination XL Group, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Financial Results:
[TEXT]
Sales of $101.9 million, Net Loss of $(0.08) per diluted share

Separately Announces Definitive Agreement to Combine with FullBeauty in a Merger of Equals

CANTON, Mass., Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Destination XL Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXLG), the leading integrated-commerce specialty retailer of Big + Tall men’s clothing and footwear, today reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

Third Quarter Financial Highlights

Total sales for the third quarter were $101.9 million, down 5.2% from $107.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 7.4% as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Net loss was $(4.1) million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, for the third quarter, as compared to a net loss of $(1.8) million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) for the third quarter was $(2.0) million as compared to $1.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Total cash and investments were $27.0 million at November 1, 2025, as compared to $43.0 million at November 2, 2024, with no outstanding debt for either period. The decrease in cash and investments includes $13.1 million on capital spent over the past 12 months for new store development and $3.3 million of shares repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.

As previously reported, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company extended its credit facility through August 13, 2030, providing access to up to $100 million of future borrowing capacity.

Management’s Comments

“Since the start of the fiscal year, we have pursued three critically important strategic initiatives to address ongoing volatility, evolving consumer dynamics, and challenges specific to the Big +Tall retail sector: assortment, our proprietary FiTMAP® technology, and promotions. We believe these strategic initiatives will better position the Company’s return to growth and enhance value for our shareholders,” said Harvey Kanter, President and CEO.

“Our sales results continue to reflect a big and tall customer who is not shopping as frequently or spending as much money with DXL as we have seen in prior years. There has been a discernable shift in customer preference towards entry level price points and private brands, which compels us to extend and evolve our core assortment to provide a greater selection of our private and value-driven brands. In addition, we are also accelerating the roll out of our FiTMAP scanning technology to additional stores, which allows us to build a deeper level of engagement with our customers. FiTMAP scanning uniquely positions DXL to more rapidly help consumers respond to GLP-1 medications which are transforming their lives. As weight loss journeys accelerate, customers’ needs are shifting - sizes are changing, confidence is growing, and shopping habits are evolving. DXL is embracing that journey using tools like FiTMAP.”

“Despite the dynamic consumer environment, we are confident in our regimented process, structure and discipline that sets us up for greater success when we return to growth. As noted, this discipline has been key in guiding our marketing and promotional strategies, enabling us to make dynamic, real-time adjustments to our assortment. Our operating regimen has maintained solid merchandise margins while proactively managing our inventory to a healthy position for the holiday season. We have been aggressively pivoting our sourcing strategy to diversify away from high tariff countries, negotiate better cost sharing with vendors, and value engineer product cost savings. We are also conducting a comprehensive review of our pricing across all private brands.”

“Our strategic priorities are supported through strong positions in cash, investments, debt, merchandise margins and inventory. We are ending the quarter with $27.0 million in cash and investments, no debt, merchandise margins that only decreased by 30 basis points from last year’s third quarter and an inventory position that is down 4.6% from last year's third quarter, and importantly, is down over 30% from 2019,” Mr. Kanter concluded.

Strategic Priorities :

Assortment

Over the course of the next two years, we are strategically shifting our assortment to prioritize private brands, which deliver consistent fit, the flexibility to balance trend-right fashion with core essentials and stronger margins. To support this focus, we are reducing investment in underperforming national brands, which will drive higher profitability and enable us to leverage strategic promotions to fuel customer acquisition and sales growth. Our intent is to grow private brand sales penetration from 57% at the start of fiscal 2025 to greater than 60% in 2026 and to greater than 65% in 2027. We are confident that with the strength of our assortment, enhanced storytelling, and strategic marketing efforts, we can drive greater customer loyalty and position our private brands as a primary reason customers choose DXL.

FiTMAP

Over the past three years, we have been working with and testing a proprietary FiTMAP® Sizing Technology for which we have an exclusive license for Big + Tall men until 2030. This innovative, contactless, digital scanning technology captures 243 unique measurements and offers custom clothing options and a great fit for all our customers. FiTMAP offers a unique experience for our customers, whether selecting from our Ready-to-Wear clothing or opting for custom garments. We are able to provide recommended sizes in all of our private brands, as well as 29 of our national brands. We believe this technology will enhance customer engagement, attract new customers and further establish DXL as a technology leader in men's big + tall apparel. To date, we have scanned over 30,000 customers. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025, FiTMAP was in 88 DXL retail locations, and as of the end of September 2025, the technology is available on our mobile app, providing our customers with the ability to self-scan. We plan to expand to another 100 stores in the first half of fiscal 2026.

Promotional Strategy

We have continued to reframe our promotional strategy around a more disciplined, strategic framework that prioritizes relevance, competitiveness, and a stronger perception of value. Our customer has been telling us that we need to create greater levels of value, and our go-forward approach treats promotions like a managed category, with a clear and deliberate intent around timing, product focus, and purpose to drive sales, engagement, and brand equity. We continue to drive our positioning to maximize the return on every markdown dollar, better align with strategic imperatives, and precisely target specific customer cohorts.

Third Quarter Results

Sales

Total sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were $101.9 million, as compared to $107.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in total sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable sales for the third quarter of 7.4%, partially offset by an increase in non-comparable sales from new stores. Comparable sales were down 6.7% in August, down 9.3% in September, and down 5.8% in October, which was a slight improvement from the first half of fiscal 2025.

The third quarter comparable sales decrease of 7.4% consisted of a comparable sales decrease of 5.2% from stores and a comparable sales decrease of 13.1% from our direct business. The decrease in traffic continued to be the primary driver for the decrease in comparable sales. While conversion rate was up slightly, our dollars per transaction were down, partly due to the shift in product mix toward more value-driven merchandise, as our customers continue to be price sensitive due to reduced discretionary spending.

While we have seen positive results from our loyalty program, Price Match Guarantee, FiTMAP, and our Heroes discounts, our total active customer file has continued to be under pressure as customers are spending less and shopping less frequently in the current environment.

Comparable sales through the first five weeks of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 were down 5.7%, which is an improvement in trend over the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

Gross Margin

For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, our gross margin rate, inclusive of occupancy costs, was 42.7% as compared to a gross margin rate of 45.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Our gross margin rate decreased by 240 basis points, which was driven by an increase of 210 basis points in occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, due to the deleveraging from lower sales and increased rents from new stores and lease extensions. Merchandise margin for the third quarter decreased by 30 basis points, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the impact of tariffs and increased markdown activity and promotional offers associated with our marketing initiatives. These increased costs were partially offset by an improvement in merchandise margins as a result of a shift in product mix toward our private brand merchandise.

There remains significant volatility with respect to evolving trade policies and the enactment of additional tariffs globally. Through vendor negotiations, sourcing diversification and cost mitigation programs, we have and will continue to take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of tariffs and trade restrictions on our business and our customers. Given the volatility that currently exists around these trade discussions, it is difficult to determine the potential impact that these tariffs may have on our financial results. However, if currently enacted rates remain in effect throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, and no new tariffs are added, we estimate that the impact of tariffs on gross margin for fiscal 2025 will be approximately $2.0 million. For the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, the impact of tariffs on merchandise margins was estimated to be approximately 60 basis points and 25 basis points as a percentage of sales, respectively.

Selling, General & Administrative

As a percentage of sales, SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were 44.7% as compared to 44.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

On a dollar basis, SG&A expenses decreased by $1.9 million as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in supporting payroll costs and incentive-based compensation.

Marketing costs were 6.0% of sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 5.7% of sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2025, marketing costs are expected to be approximately 6.0% of sales.

Management views SG&A expenses through two primary cost centers: Customer Facing Costs and Corporate Support Costs. Customer Facing Costs, which include store payroll, marketing and other store and direct operating costs, represented 25.2% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 24.2% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Corporate Support Costs, which include the distribution center and corporate overhead costs, represented 19.5% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 19.9% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Interest Income, Net

Net interest income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $0.1 million as compared to $0.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. For both periods, interest income was earned from investments in U.S. government-backed investments and money market accounts. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to the decrease in the average balance of investments during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior year period. Interest costs for both periods were minimal because we had no outstanding debt and no borrowings under our credit facility.

Income Taxes

Our income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and make a year-to-date adjustment to the provision.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company's effective tax rate was 26.1% as compared to an effective tax rate of 9.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 reflects an annual effective tax rate estimate of 18.3%, net of discrete items and the impact of permanent book-to-tax differences as well as the impact of adjustments to our net operating losses reflected in our recently filed tax returns.

Net Loss

For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, net loss was $4.1 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, as compared to a net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 of $1.8 million, or $(0.03) per diluted share. The decrease in earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by the decrease in sales.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $(2.0) million, as compared to $1.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Cash Flow

Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was $(3.2) million as compared to $12.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a decrease in earnings as well as the timing of other working capital.

Free cash flow, before capital expenditures for store development, a non-GAAP measure, was $(10.9) million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 as compared to $2.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024.

Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $(20.2) million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 as compared to $(7.0) million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024.

For the Nine Months Ended (in millions) November 1, 2025 November 2, 2024 Cash flow from operating activities (GAAP basis) $ (3.2 ) $ 12.5 Capital expenditures, excluding store development (7.7 ) (10.0 ) Free Cash Flow before capital expenditures for store development (non-GAAP basis) $ (10.9 ) $ 2.5 Capital expenditures for store development (9.3 ) (9.4 ) Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP basis) $ (20.2 ) $ (7.0 )

Non-GAAP Measures

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow before capital expenditures for store development and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see “Non-GAAP Measures” below and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures that follow in the tables below.

Balance Sheet & Liquidity

As of November 1, 2025, we had cash and investments of $27.0 million as compared to $43.0 million as of November 2, 2024, with no outstanding debt in either period. The decrease in cash and investments at November 1, 2025 as compared to November 2, 2024 included $13.1 million on capital spent over the past 12 months for new store development and $3.3 million of shares repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We did not have any borrowings under our credit facility during either period and, as of November 1, 2025, the availability under our credit facility was $73.6 million, as compared to $78.1 million as of November 2, 2024. Availability under our credit facility is primarily driven by our available inventory.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we amended our credit facility to extend the maturity of the facility from October 28, 2026 to August 13, 2030. In connection with the amendment, we also reduced the size of the credit facility from $125.0 million to $100.0 million to more closely align the credit facility with the Company's lower inventory levels. The Company's availability under the credit facility did not materially change as a result of the amendment.

As of November 1, 2025, our inventory decreased $4.1 million to $85.0 million, as compared to $89.1 million as of November 2, 2024. We continue to take proactive measures to manage our inventory and adjust our receipt plan given the ongoing macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending, while at the same time, accelerating certain receipts to minimize the impact of tariffs. At November 1, 2025, our clearance inventory was 10.0% of our total inventory, as compared to 9.2% at November 2, 2024. Our inventory position is healthy, and our clearance levels are in line with our benchmark of 10%. Our inventory turnover rate has improved by over 30% from fiscal 2019.

Digital Commerce Information

We distribute our national brands and private brand merchandise directly to consumers through our stores, website, app, and third-party marketplaces. Digital commerce sales, which we also refer to as direct sales, are defined as sales that originate online, whether through our website, at the store level or through a third-party marketplace. Our direct business is a critical component of our business and an area of significant growth opportunity for us. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, our direct sales were $27.3 million, or 26.8% of sales, as compared to $31.3 million, or 29.1% of sales, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in direct sales was driven primarily by a decrease in online traffic.

[TEXT]
Analysis: Consumers now navigate a marketplace where trends, novelty and online influence mean safety and quality can slip as speed and low costs dominate

By Catarina Marvão, UCD

Trust is an invisible ingredient in every purchase. We assume that what we buy is safe, that descriptions are accurate, and that companies play by the rules. But a series of investigations, product recalls and concerns around online shopping platforms suggest that this trust is coming under pressure

Recent enforcement actions by Ireland's Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)—including cases involving Boots Ireland and Lifesyle Sports, and warnings to fast-fashion retailers such as Shein —have put a spotlight on a growing question for shoppers: how confident can we really be in what we’re buying?

When Cindy Rose took the helm at the advertising agency giant WPP in September, she inherited one of the most challenging jobs on Madison Avenue.

Battered by a period of big account losses, internal restructuring, and thousands of layoffs, morale had sunk. So had the share price. London-based WPP was trading at lows not seen since 2009, and the company had warned investors that the remainder of the year would continue to be rocky.

Insiders and shareholders were hopeful that Rose, a US-born executive most recently at Microsoft, could serve as a kind of Goldilocks porridge compared to her predecessors. She was widely seen as a happy medium between Martin Sorrell, the outspoken British business mogul who had built WPP from the ground up over 33 years, and Mark Read, the more introverted operator who took over in 2018.

Rose was described by one analyst as a "peacemaker," and her tech background and experience in maintaining client relationships were viewed as positive attributes that would help bring

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package Monday — a boost to farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war.

He unveiled the plan Monday afternoon at a White House roundtable with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers from farm states, and farmers who thanked him for the help.

“With this bridge payment, we’ll be able to farm another year,” Iowa farmer Cordt Holub told Trump during the event.

Rollins put the immediate value of the program at $11 billion — money that the White House said will offer one-time payments to row-crop farmers. Another $1 billion will be put aside for specialty crops as the administration works to better understand the circumstances for those farmers, Rollins said. The aid will move by the end of February, she said.

“We looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,” Trump said, explaining how the administration came up with the size of the package. Trump said the money for the program will come from tariff revenue.

Later this month, the USDA will use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. Payments will be capped at $155,000 per farm or person, and only entities that make less than $900,000 a year will be eligible for aid. That will limit payments to large farms, which was a criticism of farm aid Trump delivered in his first term.

Farmers have backed Trump politically, but his aggressive trade policies and frequently changing tariff rates have come under increasing scrutiny because of the impact on the agricultural sector and because of broader consumer worries.

The aid is the administration’s latest effort to defend Trump’s economic stewardship and answer voter angst

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package Monday — a boost to farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war.

[TITLE]‘Dynamic pricing’ used to raise costs of everything from food and Uber rides to museum visits:
[TEXT]
If you feel like you’re being nickel-and-dimed everywhere you shop – you probably are.

Instacart has been using a shady AI algorithm that charges different prices to different customers on the same grocery items in the same stores without telling them, according to an explosive study released by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative earlier this week.

At a Target store in North Canton, Ohio, for example, the popular grocery app charged one customer $2.99 for Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter – while other Instacart users paid as much as $3.59 for the same jar picked up from the same location, the study found.

But it’s not just Instacart using cutting-edge tech to set higher prices. So-called “dynamic pricing” practices have been used by rideshares Uber and Lyft; Las Vegas convenience stores; children’s museums and zoos; and even your local grocery stores.

Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and Kroger have already rolled out electronic price tags that allow workers to raise shelf prices in a matter of minutes. Walmart has said it’s planning to add the tags to thousands of stores by 2026.

Variable pricing is nothing new, but artificial intelligence has made it easier for companies of all sizes to leverage dynamic pricing – and “when something is easier to use, it becomes easy also to take advantage of,” said Pascal Yammine, CEO at Zilliant, an AI-driven pricing strategy firm.

Wendy’s faced heated backlash last year over its plans to invest $20 million in digital menu boards that could change the price of a Dave’s burger in real time – but it quickly walked back the comments, saying it “will not implement surge pricing … We didn’t use that phrase.”

While businesses have always adjusted prices to find the highest amount a customer will fork over, now artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms and massive troves of user data are allowing companies to be more exacting than ever.

“The problem isn’t that companies across multiple industries are using AI for dynamic pricing or even surge pricing,” Yammine said. “The problem is more around transparency and trust.”

Variable pricing, after all, can benefit consumers in some ways – offering discounts when they bulk-buy at Costco, allowing them to compare Amazon prices to other retailers online, and saving them money on plane tickets and vacations when they book during off-seasons, he noted.

The problem arises when data collection and algorithms are used without customers’ knowledge, experts said.

Just last month, the Justice Department settled its case against real estate tech firm RealPage, which allegedly used “completely sensitive information” to jack up rents for tenants.

Around the same time, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul made New York the first state to prohibit the use of algorithmic tools in setting rent prices.

Furious New Yorkers have blasted “slime balls” Uber and Lyft for hiking prices when subway lines are shut down during rainstorms – reportedly charging $80 for a 10-minute ride to work.

People have also reported being charged higher Uber fares when using a personal credit card instead of a corporate one. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog suggested in a report that Uber might charge more on users with low phone batteries — the idea seeming to be that customers are more likely to pay higher prices when they’re desperate — though the company denied this.

[TITLE]Friday essay: experts are predicting a stock market crash – what does 1929 have to teach us?:
[TEXT]
Winston Churchill has just arrived in New York City. It is October 6 1929. Travelling with several members of his family, the British statesman checks into the Plaza Hotel, synonymous with wealth and celebrity – and certainly not cheap. But that’s no concern for Churchill: the cost of his stay – along with his cigars and brandy – is being covered by his old friend, financier Bernard Baruch.

After eight weeks of crisscrossing North America, after being wined and dined by his affluent contacts and business acquaintances, it’s no wonder Churchill became “swept up in stock market fever”, writes journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin in his riveting new book, 1929: The Inside Story of the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History.

The anecdote is an insight into conditions in the US in the weeks leading up to the October 1929 Wall Street Crash. The first day of real panic, October 24 – known as Black Thursday – came just a few weeks after Churchill’s visit. A record 12.9 million shares were traded on the exchange that day, marking the beginning of the Wall Street Crash. Over two trading days, US$30 billion of the market’s US$80 billion value disappeared.

Review: 1929: The Inside Story of the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History – Andrew Ross Sorkin (Allen Lane)

The release of this book seems timely: many are making parallels between 1929 and now. “The 1920s economy boomed while America recovered from a deadly pandemic, the flu of 1918,” wrote William A. Birdthistle, a former director of Investment Management at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, in the New York Times last month. “Automobile and telephone stocks were the high-flying tech investments of their day; Tesla and Apple are two of ours.”

And consider the breathless hype surrounding artificial intelligence. Michael Burry, made famous by The Big Short for making money on the 2008 financial crisis, “announced he was shorting Nvidia and Palantir stock – and warned of an AI bubble – before abruptly winding down his investment company, Scion Asset Management”, the Guardian reported last week.

Jamie Dimon, chair and chief executive of giant Wall Street bank JPMorgan Chase, has recently predicted a serious market correction in the next six months to two years. In the meantime, those at the top continue to fill their coffers and carry on as if nothing is amiss.

Prosperity to poverty

Back in October 1929, “Churchill saw moneymaking opportunities in Canada and the United States seemingly everywhere he turned,” writes Sorkin. A cable Churchill sent to his wife bears this out. His message home describes “a stock exchange in every big hotel. You go and sit and watch the figures being marked up on the slates every few minutes.”

Stock market speculation had wormed its way into everyday life. Finance was no longer the fiercely guarded preserve of bankers and brokers; it had become something close to a national pastime.

Ticker tapes clattered away in hotel lobbies and kitchens. Easy, fast and seemingly endless credit was available at the stroke of the pen. Buying and selling stock had become almost routine – a cheeky flutter here, a hopeful punt there – as ordinary Americans bought into the idea that the market’s dizzying ascent would continue forever; that the good times of the Roaring Twenties would roll effortlessly over into an equally dazzling thirties. Onward and upward.

But within weeks of Churchill’s visit, the collective fantasy of what we would now characterise as irrational exuberance would collapse like a house of cards. The bright and buoyant world that so enamoured him would give way to years of mass unemployment, snaking breadlines and tinpot shantytowns known as Hoovervilles.

Churchill, a dabbler in the market, lost a small fortune. Born into wealth and privilege, he was able to weather the subsequent storm. But countless ordinary Americans, who had basically been tricked into believing the boom could only continue, weren’t so fortunate. Swathes of the population were left totally destitute.

America went from a nation drunk on the dream of perpetual prosperity to one struggling through the nightmare of the worst economic crisis in history, its ramifications felt across the globe.

It is impossible to engage with Sorkin’s painstaking reconstruction of those final, feverish weeks without thinking of our own times.

How did the stock market crash play out?

1929 brings to life the furious disputes between brokers and policymakers, the frantic attempts to keep the economic ship on an even keel and the blunders that helped tip the entire financial system into freefall.

“Gradually and then suddenly.” That is how Ernest Hemingway famously described the process of going broke. This line can easily be repurposed to speak to the events of 1929.

Stock prices had been driven to ludicrous heights by unchecked speculation, mountains of borrowed money and underhand banking practices that actively encouraged people to overextend on credit. Once confidence faltered, margin loans (loans that allow investors to buy shares with borrowed money, using the shares themselves as collateral) were called in, precipitating even more selling and triggering a vicious downward spiral – one that could not be stopped.

What emerges is a picture that feels uncannily familiar: a financial and political elite convinced the Federal Reserve was being too cautious, too meddlesome and far too willing to spoil the party.

The Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in Sorkin’s narrative, much as it does today. In 1929, its leaders were caught between competing pressures: on the one side, financiers urging them to loosen control over credit and keep speculation humming along; on the other, mounting signs the market was dangerously overheated.

Sorkin points to the warning delivered on September 2 1929 by economist Roger Babson, who argued several key indicators were suggesting the American economy was beginning to soften, even as share prices hit new heights. He noted that production and freight figures had started to dip and the numbers of declining stocks were quietly rising – a sure sign the market’s apparent strength masked growing fragility.

That tension, it seems, has never really been resolved.

Reading this, I immediately thought

Creating One of the Largest Omni-Channel Retailers Across the Full Inclusive Sizing Market, with Approximately $1.2 Billion of Combined Annual Net Sales

Poised to Capture Accelerated Growth Opportunities in an Underserved, Fragmented Market

Expect $25 Million in Annual Run-Rate Cost Synergies Significantly Actioned Within the First 12 Months of Closing, with Meaningful Commercial Synergy Upside

Enhancing Financial Position and Free Cash Flow Generation, While Exercising Disciplined Capital Allocation to Drive Future Growth and Shareholder Returns

Companies to Host a Joint Investor Conference Call at 5:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time

CANTON, Mass. and NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Destination XL Group, Inc. (“DXL”) (NASDAQ: DXLG), the leading integrated commerce retailer of Big + Tall men’s clothing and footwear, and FBB Holdings I, Inc. (“FullBeauty”), a first mover in inclusive sizing for both women and men and proudly inclusive since 1901, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine in a merger of equals and create a scaled, category-defining retailer for inclusive apparel.

The combined company will unite complementary brands, channels, and capabilities to better serve plus-size women and Big + Tall men as a larger, stronger and more flexible public company positioned for long-term growth. Together, DXL and FullBeauty will be a leader in inclusive sizing apparel with one of the industry’s broadest and most diverse portfolios – spanning value to premium across lifestyles and occasions.

The combined company will reflect a direct-to-consumer mix at 73% of total sales, with bricks-and-mortar at 27% of total sales.

The companies delivered combined net sales of approximately $1.2 billion for the last twelve months ending October 2025. Assuming no pro forma adjustments, Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was approximately $45 million. Including $25 million in expected annual run-rate cost synergies, the combined company would have generated approximately $70 million of LTM Adjusted EBITDA.

Following the completion of the all-stock transaction, FullBeauty and DXL shareholders will own 55% and 45% of the combined company, respectively.

[TITLE]With a $35 billion push, Amazon puts e-commerce rivals on notice:
[TEXT]
Amazon.com Inc.’s plan to invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030 is expected to intensify competition in the online commerce and prompt rivals to increase their spending on infrastructure, supply chains, and consumer acquisition.

The US tech giant, which has already deployed $40 billion in the country, will invest money in all of its businesses—its core e-commerce operations, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services, entertainment businesses including Prime Video and MX Player, and its devices segment.

“Other players will be pushed to accelerate investments of their own, spurring faster innovation, deeper regional penetration, and more nuanced strategies for tier-II and tier-III markets," said Naveen Malpani, partner and retail and e-commerce industry leader, consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat.

Deeper penetration

Amazon, which has millions of Prime subscribers in the country, has been stepping up its promise of quicker deliveries.

For instance, this festive season, Prime members drove demand from tier-II and tier-III cities across key categories, including appliances, fashion and beauty, smartphones, and furniture. Prime members experienced faster deliveries, with over 3 million products delivered in metro cities within the same day or the next day, and more than 5 million products reaching customers in tier-II and -III cities within two days.

Although a late entrant in the quick-commerce play, it is also expanding its presence through Amazon Now, its 10-minute delivery service that now operates in three cities with more than 300 micro-fulfilment centres. The company is adding two centres a day as it scales its shorter delivery-window model.

Udit Madan, senior vice-president, worldwide operations at Amazon, said speed remains a central focus for the business. “We’re going to get to faster speeds—not just our fastest speeds with Amazon Now, but by expanding into more and more areas. This is a significant area of investment for us and one that will shape the business and demand patterns in India. A large part of our investment this year went towards speeding up and improving reliability in tier II-III markets, something we are now doing in parts of the US and Europe."

India’s online commerce ecosystem has expanded significantly over the last decade, dominated by companies such as Walmart-backed Flipkart, Amazon, Meesho, Nykaa, Swiggy, and Eternal Ltd.

While the overall retail market is expected to grow from $1 trillion in 2024 to $1.7 trillion by 2030, according to estimates from consulting firm Deloitte, online retail is projected to grow much faster—from $75 billion in 2024 to $260 billion by 2030—doubling its share of total retail to 14%.

Quicker response

Young shoppers are increasingly comfortable buying everything from cosmetics to apparel on their smartphones. This is especially true post-covid with the entry of new quick-commerce players such as Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, Zepto, etc.

A slogan related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) is displayed on a screen in Intel pavilion, during the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 16, 2024.

Big Tech is doubling down on investing billions in India, drawn by its abundance of resources for building data centers, a large talent and digital user pool, and market opportunity.

In under 24 hours, Microsoft and Amazon pledged more than $50 billion toward India's cloud and AI infrastructure, while Intel on Monday announced plans to make chips in the country to capitalize on its growing PC demand and speedy AI adoption.

While India trails the U.S. and China in the race to develop a native AI foundational model, and lacks a large domestic AI infrastructure company, it wants to leverage its expertise in the information technology sector to create and deploy AI applications at enterprise level, also offering Big Tech companies a huge opportunity.

Having a model or computing is not enough for any enterprise to use AI effectively, and it requires companies making application layer and a large talent pool to deploy them, S. Krishnan, secretary at India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, told CNBC.

Stanford University ranks India among the top four countries along with the U.S., China and the UK in the global and national AI vibrancy ranking. GitHub, a community of developers, has ranked India at the top with the global share of 24% of all projects.

India's opportunity lies more in "developing applications" which will be used to drive revenues for AI companies, Krishnan said.
