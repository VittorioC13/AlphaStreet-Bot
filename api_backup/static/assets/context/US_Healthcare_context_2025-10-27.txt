[TITLE]New menopause drug to target hot flashes without hormones gets FDA approval:
[TEXT]
The US Food and Drug Administration has approved another once-a-day pill that works without hormones to treat moderate to severe hot flashes in menopausal women, drugmaker Bayer said Friday.

The drug, elinzanetant, is expected to be available in the United States beginning in November under the brand name Lynkuet, Bayer said.

It works by blocking the brain chemicals responsible for hot flashes and night sweats – what doctors call vasomotor symptoms – in menopausal women. It’s estimated that more than 80% of women have hot flashes during menopause.

“This FDA approval represents a bold step forward – our first hormone-free treatment for alleviating vasomotor symptoms of menopause,” Christine Roth, Bayer’s executive vice president of global product strategy and commercialization, said in a news release Friday.

“There is a need for more individualized approaches to menopause care, and Lynkuet addresses a significant gap in treatment options,” she said.

For many women, hormone therapy can be a safe and effective treatment for menopause symptoms such as hot flashes. But some with underlying health conditions or histories, including certain cancers, are sometimes advised against using hormone replacement therapies. Experts say that for those women, alternative treatment options can be helpful.

A Phase 3 clinical trial of elinzanetant that included 628 postmenopausal women found that those taking the drug for 12 weeks reported a more than 73% reduction in the frequency of their vasomotor symptoms, or VMS. In contrast, those taking a placebo reported a 47% reduction.

The most common side effects in women taking the drug were drowsiness, fatigue and headaches.

“This yearlong study not only confirmed the initial findings of rapid and significant reduction in the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats but also provided evidence that these effects were sustained over a year, offering hope for longer-term relief,” researcher Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, UVA Health’s director of midlife health and emeritus executive director of the North American Menopause Society, said in a statement last month when the trial findings were published.

“For those dealing with moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, the treatment options have been limited, especially for those who cannot or choose not to undergo hormone therapy,” Pinkerton said. “The disruptive nature of these bothersome hot flashes, particularly when they are more severe, can significantly affect women’s daily lives, both at work and at home, underscoring the urgent need for effective non-hormonal treatments.”

Hot flashes are a sudden feeling of being very hot that’s usually centered around the face, chest and head. They can also cause intense sweating and flushing that may last several minutes. When this happens at night, it’s called a night sweat. Women in menopause may get them occasionally or many times a day, which can be extremely disruptive.

“It’s important that women know they have choices for treating moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause, and today’s approval further expands a woman’s options for treating these symptoms,” Claire Gill, president and founder of the National Menopause Foundation, said in Bayer’s announcement Friday.

In 2023, the FDA approved the menopause drug fezolinetant, which also works as an alternative to traditional hormone replacement therapies for managing hot flashes. Fezolinetant and elinzanetant are among the first drugs to take advantage of a newly understood pathway in the brain that appears to control hot flashes.

As estrogen decreases during menopause, nerves in the hypothalamus — an almond-size region deep inside the brain whose functions include helping regulate the body’s thermostat — become hyperactive and produce an overabundance of chemical signals called neurokinins. Both of the new drugs block the doorways on cells where certain neurokinins dock, which turns down their ability to stimulate the brain to cause hot flashes.

“Hot flashes, particularly when severe, can have an impact on women’s daily lives,” Pinkerton said in Bayer’s announcement. “This approval provides healthcare providers with a new treatment option that can be used first-line for moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause.”

[TITLE]Dr Reddy’s Q2 revenue beats estimates buoyed by consumer NRT portfolio:
[TEXT]
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories beat street estimates in the September quarter, with a revenue of ₹8,805 crore and profit after tax of ₹1,437 crore, buoyed by growth in branded markets and its nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) portfolio.

A Bloomberg poll of 26 brokerages had pegged the drugmaker’s consolidated revenue at ₹8,706.2 crore and its profit after tax at ₹1,397.5 crore.

The Hyderabad-based firm’s revenue grew nearly 10% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 3% sequentially, while its profit after tax was up 14% y-o-y, despite the drag of price erosion in its largest market, the US.

Dr Reddy’s revenue in North America declined 13% y-o-y and 5% sequentially to ₹3,241 crore, primarily due higher price erosion in some key products, including Lenalidomide (Revlimid).

Dr Reddy’s is among Indian generic players to have reached a settlement with the innovator of blood cancer medicine Revlimid or Lenalidomide, Celgene, to sell the drug in restricted quantities until its patent expires this January.

“Growth in Q2 was driven by momentum in branded markets and steady contributions from the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) portfolio, which helped offset the decline in US Lenalidomide sales,” co-chairman and managing director, G.V. Prasad said in a statement.

The company’s revenue from Europe was up 138% y-oy to ₹1,376 crore, largely driven by the acquired NRT portfolio. The NRT portfolio reported sales of ₹700 crore and accounted for 51% of the revenue from Europe. Dr Reddy’s acquired Haleon’s global portfolio of consumer healthcare brands in the NRT category outside of the US in 2024.

Focus on semaglutide The company is banking on next year's key new launches, including weight loss drug Semaglutide and biosimilar Abatacept to drive growth after the loss of revenues from Revlimid.

Semaglutide, a weight loss drug by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, goes off patent in 2026 in several countries including India, Canada and Brazil. Dr Reddy’s had earlier indicated it would target 87 countries where the patent is expiring or the drug is not covered under a patent.

n Q2, a subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) recommended approval for the Semaglutide injection in India. The company is in the process of filing for regulatory approvals in other countries to export the drug next year, senior management told reporters in a post-earnings interaction on Friday.

“By the end of FY26, we hope we will be able to launch it in several countries…By the end of FY27, we will likely have semaglutide in tens of countries,” chief executive officer Erez Israeli told reporters.

On Thursday, competitor Cipla announced a partnership with innovator Eli Lilly to increase access of its weight loss drug Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) in India. Israeli clarified Dr Reddy’s is not looking at a partnership with Lilly for the drug in India.

The company is focusing on double-digit growth of its base business in the near-term, and is managing costs to increase profitability, said Israeli.

On the issue of US tariffs, he said while President Donald Trump’s 100% import tariffs announced last month do not impact the firm’s generic business, the potential impact on biologics remains to be seen. Biologics are a class of medicines derived from or made in living organisms.

[TITLE]Billionaires’ tax to solve Medicaid funding cuts? Major California union floats one-time policy patch:
[TEXT]
A major union announced a proposal Thursday to impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires in California to address federal funding cuts to health care for low-income people.

Proponents, including the Service Employees International Union, hope to place the statewide measure before voters next year. The tax would be on the net worth of California’s richest residents. A small portion of the money would also help fund K-12 education since the federal government has threatened to withhold grant money from public schools.

Backers of the measure sent a request to Attorney General Rob Bonta this week to get approval to start collecting signatures. The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it’s not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, has opposed tax hikes in the past, including those specifically targeting the rich.

Proponents of the initiative said it was critical to backfill cuts to Medicaid because lives are at stake.

“If we do not do this, millions of people are going to lose health care, an untold number of people will go without treatment and there will be tragedy after tragedy,” said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West.

Billionaires would have to pay for tax year 2026, and the money could start being appropriated in 2027. The tax would generate $100 billion in revenue for the state, backers say. The initiative says it’s “designed to make the State tax system more equitable.”

The big tax and spending cuts law President Donald Trump signed earlier this year will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from Medicaid and federal food assistance.

The California Budget and Policy Center, a think tank in Sacramento, estimated the state could lose $30 billion in federal funding a year for Medicaid, which would result in up to 3.4 million people losing their coverage.

Newsom said earlier this month that people enrolled in Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace, could see their monthly health care bills nearly double next year as a result of the spending cuts law.

“California has led the nation in expanding access to affordable health care, but Donald Trump is ripping it away,” he said.

Proponents of the proposed ballot initiative say billionaires have an obligation to do their part.

“We hope that some and perhaps hopefully a large number of billionaires will recognize that it’s important in the state where they’ve grown their fortune that they have a responsibility to society to preserve the future of California,” said Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.

[TITLE]PMV Pharmaceuticals Announces Updated Rezatapopt Monotherapy Interim Data From Ongoing PYNNACLE Phase 2 Trial Across Multiple Solid Tumors With a TP53 Y220C Mutation:
[TEXT]
Data presented today as an oral presentation at 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics

Confirmed responses observed in eight tumor types spanning ovarian, lung, breast, endometrial, head and neck, colorectal, gallbladder, and ampullary carcinoma

34% overall response rate (ORR) observed among 103 evaluable patients across all cohorts with a median duration of response of 7.6 months

46% ORR observed among 48 evaluable patients in ovarian cancer cohort with a median duration of response of 8.0 months

Rezatapopt New Drug Application submission for platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer planned in first quarter of 2027

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PMV Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“PMV Pharma” or the “Company”; Nasdaq: PMVP), a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53, today announced updated data from the Phase 2 pivotal portion of the ongoing PYNNACLE clinical trial. Results were presented today in an oral presentation by Alison M. Schram, M.D., Medical Oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and PYNNACLE Study Investigator, at the 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics taking place in Boston, Massachusetts. The ongoing Phase 1/2 PYNNACLE clinical trial is evaluating rezatapopt in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation.

“Patients with TP53 Y220C-mutated advanced solid tumors are in need of better treatment options, particularly those with platinum-resistant and refractory ovarian cancer. The rezatapopt data presented today demonstrate very encouraging clinical activity, reinforcing the potential for rezatapopt to target the underlying biology of these cancers and providing a potential shift in the current treatment paradigm,” said Dr. Schram.

The Phase 2 clinical trial data below are summarized as of a September 4, 2025 data cutoff date:

The safety population consisted of 112 patients treated with at least one dose of rezatapopt 2000mg daily as monotherapy. Median number of prior lines of systemic therapy was three (range: 1-10)

The efficacy population consisted of 103 patients treated with at least one dose of rezatapopt as of the data cutoff date and either had ≥1 post-baseline tumor assessment or discontinued early.

Efficacy

Confirmed responses were observed in patients whose tumors were TP53 Y220C mutated and KRAS wild-type in eight tumor types including ovarian, lung, breast, endometrial, head and neck, colorectal, gallbladder cancers, and ampullary carcinoma.

Overall response rate (ORR) of 34% (35/103 patients) per investigator assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, including confirmed and unconfirmed responses.

The cohort-specific ORRs were as follows: Ovarian cancer: 46% ORR (22/48 patients, including one confirmed complete response, 18 confirmed partial responses, and three unconfirmed partial responses [uPR]) Breast cancer: 17% ORR (2/12 patients) Endometrial cancer: 60% ORR (3/5 patients, including one uPR) Lung cancer: 21% ORR (4/19 patients, including one uPR) Other solid tumors: 21% ORR (4/19 patients)

Across all cohorts, the median time to response was 1.3 months and the median duration of response was 7.6 months.

In the ovarian cancer cohort, the median time to response was 1.3 months and median duration of response was 8.0 months.

Post the September 4, 2025 data cutoff date, four uPRs were confirmed and one uPR (ovarian cancer) remains on treatment.

Safety

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were mostly Grade 1-2 with the most frequent TRAEs observed (>15%) being nausea, fatigue, blood creatinine increased, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased. The rates of individual Grade 3 TRAEs were ≤6%. All Grade 3 TRAEs resolved on treatment and there were no discontinuations due to Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT elevations.

Rezatapopt administration with food led to an improvement in gastrointestinal tolerability relative to Phase 1 data.

Lab abnormalities were manageable, with the majority of cases being transient and reversible.

The rate of drug discontinuations due to a TRAE was 3.6%.

“We are pleased to share these updated results from the pivotal portion of the ongoing PYNNACLE trial, which continue to enhance our understanding

[TEXT]
Longleaf Partners, managed by Southeastern Asset Management, released its “Partners Fund” third-quarter 2025 investor letter. The letter can be downloaded here. The fund returned -0.33% in the third quarter, compared to the S&P 500’s 8.12 % return and the Russell 1000 Value’s 5.33% return. The firm is not happy with the flat performance of the portfolio, emphasizing its investments in real assets and brands that generate growing free cash flow (FCF) per share. Despite facing market pressures from speculation and government uncertainty, it anticipates that the Fund's ~10x FCF multiple could rise to the mid-teens as management implements strategies to improve margins and increase share repurchases.

The upcoming third quarter 2025 results announcement and investor call, while relevant for short-term sentiment, does not materially change the main near-term catalyst, new clinical data for SGR-1505, nor does it resolve the biggest risk of sluggish new client acquisition amid biotech sector headwinds.

The most closely related recent announcement is Schrödinger’s update on initial clinical results for SGR-1505, a MALT1 inhibitor, which showed early efficacy and received FDA Fast Track designation this June. This progress in the clinic positions SGR-1505 as a primary driver for milestone payments and licensing, supporting management's focus on revenue growth from drug discovery and anchoring the short-term investment outlook.

However, investors should also be mindful that, in contrast to the excitement around new clinical milestones, ongoing challenges in expanding the customer base persist and...

[TITLE]AI Biodefense Startup Valthos Launches With $30 Million, OpenAI Backing:
[TEXT]
In brief Valthos launched with $30 million from the OpenAI Startup Fund, Lux Capital, and Founders Fund.

Its AI tools aim to detect and neutralize biological threats faster than traditional biodefense systems.

The launch follows RAND’s warning that governments are unprepared for fast-moving AI-driven crises.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Biodefense startup Valthos emerged from stealth on Friday with $30 million in funding backed by ChatGPT creator OpenAI to develop and use artificial intelligence to detect and counter biological threats in real time.

The company develops AI systems that update medical countermeasures to match the speed of the biological threats, allowing researchers and government agencies to identify and respond to pathogens as fast as they emerge.

“Of all AI applications, biotechnology has the highest upside and most catastrophic downside,” the company wrote on X.

Valthos was co-founded last November by Kathleen McMahon, formerly Head of Life Science at Palantir Technologies and Tess van Stekelenburg, a former researcher of computational neuroscience at the University of Oxford.

﻿

“In this new world, the only way forward is to be faster. So we set out to build the tech stack for biodefense,” they wrote. “Our team of computational biologists and software engineers applies frontier AI to identify biological threats and update medical countermeasures in real-time.”

Joining the OpenAI Startup Fund in the $30 million investment are Lux Capital and Founders Fund. The company said it is hiring engineers and researchers to expand its platform for government and life sciences partners.

“Technology is moving fast. One of the best ways to keep up is with more technology, more research, more startups and more entrepreneurship,” Jason Kwon, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, said on X. “An industrial ecosystem of builders, companies and solutions further democratizes AI to provide broad resilience, and ensures the U.S. continues to lead as AI increasingly powers everything around us. As AI and biotech rapidly advance, biodefense is one of those verticals.”

Understanding biodefense

Biodefense refers to technologies and systems built to protect populations from biological threats—ranging from naturally occurring diseases to lab accidents or deliberately engineered pathogens. Traditional defense measures rely on vaccines, detection networks, and drug stockpiles, but those are often too slow for a world where synthetic biology can rapidly create new or modified organisms.

Valthos said its platform will use AI to analyze biological sequences and adapt existing medicines or treatments in response—technology the company claims could shrink the time between identifying a new threat and developing a response from months to hours.

Researchers are increasingly using AI to forecast disease risk before symptoms appear. A model called Delphi-2M, trained on UK Biobank data, can predict more than 1,000 conditions up to 20 years in advance, showing how AI could shift medicine from reaction to prevention, and in biodefense, help detect emerging outbreaks before they spread.

The Valthos announcement follows a RAND Corporation report this week warning that governments are unprepared to handle AI-driven cyber crises.

“Today, it’s faster to weaponize biology than to advance new cures,” Valthos said in a statement. “Our future hangs in the balance.”

Neither OpenAI nor Valthos responded to requests for comment by Decrypt.

[TITLE]New menopause drug to target hot flashes without hormones gets FDA approval:
[TEXT]
The US Food and Drug Administration has approved another once-a-day pill that works without hormones to treat moderate to severe hot flashes in menopausal women, drugmaker Bayer said Friday.

The drug, elinzanetant, is expected to be available in the United States beginning in November under the brand name Lynkuet, Bayer said.

It works by blocking the brain chemicals responsible for hot flashes and night sweats – what doctors call vasomotor symptoms – in menopausal women. It’s estimated that more than 80% of women have hot flashes during menopause.

“This FDA approval represents a bold step forward – our first hormone-free treatment for alleviating vasomotor symptoms of menopause,” Christine Roth, Bayer’s executive vice president of global product strategy and commercialization, said in a news release Friday.

“There is a need for more individualized approaches to menopause care, and Lynkuet addresses a significant gap in treatment options,” she said.

For many women, hormone therapy can be a safe and effective treatment for menopause symptoms such as hot flashes. But some with underlying health conditions or histories, including certain cancers, are sometimes advised against using hormone replacement therapies. Experts say that for those women, alternative treatment options can be helpful.

A Phase 3 clinical trial of elinzanetant that included 628 postmenopausal women found that those taking the drug for 12 weeks reported a more than 73% reduction in the frequency of their vasomotor symptoms, or VMS. In contrast, those taking a placebo reported a 47% reduction.

The most common side effects in women taking the drug were drowsiness, fatigue and headaches.

“This yearlong study not only confirmed the initial findings of rapid and significant reduction in the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats but also provided evidence that these effects were sustained over a year, offering hope for longer-term relief,” researcher Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, UVA Health’s director of midlife health and emeritus executive director of the North American Menopause Society, said in a statement last month when the trial findings were published.

“For those dealing with moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, the treatment options have been limited, especially for those who cannot or choose not to undergo hormone therapy,” Pinkerton said. “The disruptive nature of these bothersome hot flashes, particularly when they are more severe, can significantly affect women’s daily lives, both at work and at home, underscoring the urgent need for effective non-hormonal treatments.”

Hot flashes are a sudden feeling of being very hot that’s usually centered around the face, chest and head. They can also cause intense sweating and flushing that may last several minutes. When this happens at night, it’s called a night sweat. Women in menopause may get them occasionally or many times a day, which can be extremely disruptive.

“It’s important that women know they have choices for treating moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause, and today’s approval further expands a woman’s options for treating these symptoms,” Claire Gill, president and founder of the National Menopause Foundation, said in Bayer’s announcement Friday.

In 2023, the FDA approved the menopause drug fezolinetant, which also works as an alternative to traditional hormone replacement therapies for managing hot flashes. Fezolinetant and elinzanetant are among the first drugs to take advantage of a newly understood pathway in the brain that appears to control hot flashes.

As estrogen decreases during menopause, nerves in the hypothalamus — an almond-size region deep inside the brain whose functions include helping regulate the body’s thermostat — become hyperactive and produce an overabundance of chemical signals called neurokinins. Both of the new drugs block the doorways on cells where certain neurokinins dock, which turns down their ability to stimulate the brain to cause hot flashes.

“Hot flashes, particularly when severe, can have an impact on women’s daily lives,” Pinkerton said in Bayer’s announcement. “This approval provides healthcare providers with a new treatment option that can be used first-line for moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause.”

The Northampton-based manufacturing site was producing counterfeit versions of Eli Lilly’s top-selling obesity medication, Zepbound (tirzepatide).

Unlicensed pens containing Eli Lilly’s investigational GLP-1RA, retatrutide, were also found on the premises. The compound, which is currently in Phase III trials for obesity with comorbid knee osteoarthritis, has not received approval from any regulatory body worldwide.

Alongside finished products, “sophisticated” manufacturing and packing equipment was also found at the site, as well as tens of thousands of autoinjectors ready to be filled.

According to the MHRA, this is the largest single seizure of trafficked weight loss medications in recorded history.
