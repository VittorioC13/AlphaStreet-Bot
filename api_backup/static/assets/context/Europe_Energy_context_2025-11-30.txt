[TITLE]Heed electricity, gas safety during floods, Energy Commission cautions:
[TEXT]
PUTRAJAYA: The Energy Commission has reminded the public to remain vigilant and prioritise electricity and gas safety during the current flood season.

In a statement Monday (Nov 24), the commission said floods pose various risks, including fallen electricity poles, broken power lines, and damage to electrical and gas equipment. It also outlined several safety measures to be taken before, during and after a flood.

“If instructed to evacuate, place electrical appliances in a high and safe location to prevent them from being submerged. Switch off the main power supply at the electrical distribution board, as well as any installations connected separately from the main switch, such as solar PV systems, electric fences or electric vehicle chargers. Also, close the valves of gas cylinders or piped gas," it said.

The commission further advised the public to avoid areas with submerged electrical lines or installations, such as substations and switch rooms, and to refrain from touching poles or any structures that carry electricity.

It also reminded the public not to move fallen electricity poles or severed power lines, but instead to report them immediately to the electricity utility provider.

To ensure the safe use of electricity and gas after a flood, the main switch on the electrical distribution board and gas line valves must be turned off before any cleaning work begins.

"Before switching the main supply back on, ensure that all electrical equipment is in good condition and completely dry. Always remain cautious when carrying out post-flood cleaning activities near electrical lines, installation structures or piped gas systems.

"Avoid using any electrical or gas equipment if its safety is uncertain. If you are still in doubt, seek the assistance of an electrical or gas contractor registered with the Energy Commission," the statement said.

The public is also reminded to keep important emergency numbers, including the police, the fire and rescue department, the hospital and utility service providers, easily accessible at all times.

[TITLE]Russia’s Gazprom Turns to Profit in Q3:
[TEXT]
Russian gas giant Gazprom booked a net income for the third quarter versus a loss a year earlier, when it was hit by a one-off tax for the Russian budget.

Gazprom, which in 2023 booked its first annual net loss in 23 years on the plunge of its gas sales to Europe, has started making profits again in recent months.

Last year, Gazprom returned to a yearly profit, earning the equivalent of $14.8 billion.

For the third quarter of this year, the Russian gas giant reported on Friday a net income of $1.72 billion (134.2 billion Russian rubles). This compares to a net loss of $680 million (53 billion rubles) for the third quarter of 2024, when the company had to pay a one-off tax.

Gazprom’s revenues in the July-September 2025 quarter fell to $28 billion (2.18 trillion rubles), down from $30.8 billion (2.4 trillion rubles) for the same quarter last year.

Russia has hiked dramatically the so-called mineral extraction tax to raise funds for the war in Ukraine. These higher taxes and the slump in gas sales hit Gazprom in 2023 with a major annual loss, but the company has been reporting steadier results recently.

Meanwhile, Russian oil and gas revenues are poised to slump by 35% in November from a year earlier as the price of Russia’s crude has plunged and the local currency strengthened.

Russia’s budget is expected to receive $6.63 billion (520 Russian billion rubles) from oil and gas in November, a decline of 35% compared to the same month of 2024, Reuters calculations showed earlier this week.

Oil and gas revenues make up the single largest budget income item for the Russian Federation, which relies on these revenues for heavy spending on its war in Ukraine.

This month, the discount of Russia’s flagship crude grade, Urals, has widened to the highest level since May 2023 following the U.S. sanctions on Russia’s top oil producers and exporters, Rosneft and Lukoil.

[TITLE]Experts Urge Digital Air Cargo Reforms in Nigeria:
[TEXT]
Aviation experts under the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Nigeria have proposed a series of strategic reforms to strengthen the country’s air cargo sector, urging the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria to lead a full-scale transformation that aligns with global standards.

The experts called for the development of state-of-the-art cargo villages at major airports, equipped with cold-chain systems, automated handling equipment, and renewable energy installations.

The President of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Nigeria, Dr. Alexander Nwuba, made this call while delivering a paper titled “Building a World-Class Air Cargo Ecosystem” during a stakeholders’ engagement on cargo recently in Lagos.

Citing Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a model, Nwuba explained that its advanced cold-chain facilities and traceability systems enable perishable exports to reach global markets swiftly and sustainably.

He also recommended a single-window digital clearance platform and harmonised operating procedures across all relevant agencies. Additionally, he proposed what he called a “Cargo Bill of Rights” to protect shippers, handlers, and consumers. Nwuba referenced Ghana’s digital customs system as an example of improved efficiency and reduced bottlenecks.

He further emphasised the need for electronic documentation, blockchain-enabled traceability, barcoding, and data analytics to enhance compliance and operational transparency.

Regular training for cargo handlers, regulators, and logistics professionals was described as essential. Nwuba proposed that such training should incorporate environmental stewardship and engage local communities and environmental groups.

He urged the expansion of credit and insurance access for exporters, including green financing options. Public-private partnerships—similar to those seen in Kenya’s logistics sector—were identified as crucial for unlocking investment in infrastructure and technology.

Outlining the key pillars of his proposed transformation, Nwuba said, “We must develop state-of-the-art cargo villages at major airports, equipped with cold-chain facilities, automated handling, and renewable energy systems such as solar panels.

“For example, Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport has implemented advanced cold-chain infrastructure and farm-to-fork traceability, ensuring that perishable goods reach global markets efficiently and sustainably. Regional hubs must be upgraded with sustainable transport links, and all facilities should incorporate natural ventilation, daylighting, and rainwater harvesting.

“We need a single-window digital clearance platform, harmonized operating procedures, and a Cargo Bill of Rights that protects shippers, handlers, consumers, and the environment. Ghana has pioneered advanced digital customs and regional trade facilitation, streamlining processes and reducing paperwork, thereby improving efficiency and environmental outcomes.

“Electronic documentation, traceability tools such as barcodes and blockchain, and data analytics will help us monitor performance and environmental metrics. Ethiopia’s cargo terminals operate 24/7 and use integrated digital systems to ensure compliance with EU standards, including strict environmental requirements.”

In his remarks, the Director of Cargo Services at FAAN, Lekan Thomas, said the establishment of the Directorate was intended to serve as the engine room for dismantling barriers, resolving persistent challenges, and forging the partnerships required to advance the nation’s cargo ambitions.

Aligning with the call of the FAAN Managing Director, Olubunmi Kuku, for a genuine “partner–partner relationship,” the Directorate stated that it has developed a comprehensive roadmap whose success “will depend largely on the integration of stakeholders’ expertise and insights.”

Earlier, while declaring the event open, the FAAN Managing Director, represented by the Director of Special Duties, Obiageli Orah, sought stakeholders’ contributions toward addressing longstanding challenges in infrastructure, ground handling, and operational efficiency, while creating an enabling environment for trade and export growth.

Emphasising the collaborative nature of the initiative, she said, “This session marks a fundamental pivot; a shift from the old, transactional operator-stakeholder dynamic to a true, collaborative partner-partner relationship. Your expertise, your challenges, and your innovative ideas are not just welcomed; they are the critical ingredients for our collective success.”

She urged participants to co-create solutions that would position Nigeria as a strategic gateway connecting Africa to global markets.

[TITLE]Challenges and Prospects in the Global Power Rental Market, 2025-2030: Data Centers and Grid Instability Drive Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Power Rental Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Power Rental Market, valued at USD 22.83 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.39% to reach USD 37.02 Billion by 2030. Growth is primarily driven by rapid industrialization, ongoing global infrastructure development, rising energy demand across multiple sectors, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that necessitate emergency power.

Key Market Drivers

The increasing need for continuous and reliable power supply is a crucial driver of the global power rental market, as industries rely on uninterrupted energy to maintain productivity and prevent financial losses. Data centers, for example, require consistent power beyond what traditional grids can reliably provide. The International Energy Agency's March 2024 Electricity 2024 report indicates that global electricity consumption from data centers is expected to more than double, rising from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh by 2026.

The escalating regulatory burden directly hampers market expansion by elevating expenditures for both producers and end-users. According to the American Chemistry Council, in the fourth quarter of 2023, 43% of chemical manufacturers indicated their regulatory burden had increased. This trend continued, with 38% of manufacturers reporting an increased regulatory burden in the second quarter of 2024, and over half expecting a further rise in the subsequent six months. This consistent upward pressure on compliance costs can constrain profitability, slow down the adoption of new demulsifier solutions, and limit overall investment within the demulsifier segment.

Key Market Trends

The global demulsifier market is significantly influenced by a pronounced shift towards bio-based and sustainable demulsifier solutions. This trend is driven by increasing environmental regulations and a broader industry commitment to reducing the ecological footprint of chemical processes. Manufacturers are investing in research and development to create products derived from renewable resources that offer improved biodegradability profiles.

For example, research published in April 2025 highlighted that natural demulsifiers, sourced from plant extracts, waste oils, and biopolymers, are emerging as sustainable alternatives for crude oil demulsification, with studies in 2023 specifically evaluating the effectiveness of green demulsifiers on Nigerian crude oils. This indicates a move away from conventional petroleum-derived chemicals to more environmentally benign options.
