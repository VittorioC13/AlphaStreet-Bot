[TITLE]SoftBank races to fulfill $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by year-end:
[TEXT]
By Echo Wang, Miho Uranaka and Krystal Hu

NEW YORK/TOKYO/SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group (SFTBY) is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) by year-end through an array of cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments, and could tap its undrawn margin loans borrowed against its valuable ownership in chip firm Arm Holdings (ARM), sources said.

The "all-in" bet ​on OpenAI is among the biggest yet by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, as the Japanese billionaire seeks to improve his firm's position in the race for artificial intelligence. To come up with ‌the money, Son has already sold SoftBank's entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA), offloaded $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile (TMUS) US stake, and slashed staff.

Son has slowed most other dealmaking at SoftBank's Vision Fund to a crawl, and any deal above $50 million now requires his ‌explicit approval, two of the sources told Reuters.

Son's firm is working to take public its payments app operator, PayPay. The initial public offering, originally expected this month, was pushed back due to the 43-day-long U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. PayPay's market debut, likely to raise more than $20 billion, is now expected in the first quarter of next year, according to one direct source and another person familiar with the efforts.

The Japanese conglomerate is also looking to cash out some of its holdings in Didi Global (DIDIY), the operator of China’s dominant ride-hailing platform, which is looking to list its shares in Hong Kong after a regulatory crackdown forced it to delist in the ⁠U.S. in 2021, a source with direct knowledge said. Investment managers at ‌SoftBank's Vision Fund are being directed toward the OpenAI deal, two of the above sources said.

SoftBank's scramble to marshal funds offers a window into the strain faced even by the world's biggest dealmakers as they scramble to finance ambitious AI data center projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

SoftBank declined to comment.

SoftBank has options

OpenAI has not ‍yet received the remaining funding, but expects the money to come in by the end of 2025, as stipulated in the contract, sources said.

SoftBank has multiple sources of capital it could tap, including margin loans, cash on its balance sheet, stakes in listed companies, and corporate bonds or bridge loans, sources said.

Son has strong reasons to draw on a range of funding mechanisms to fulfill those obligations. SoftBank secured a deal to invest in OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation in April. ​Since then, the valuation of OpenAI has risen dramatically and the company is in talks to raise additional funding from investors, including Amazon, tripling its valuation to close to $900 billion, one of the sources added, ‌which would give SoftBank a significant paper gain once the transaction is completed.

Data center deals hit record $61 billion in 2025 amid global construction frenzy

CNBC ^ | 12/19/25 | April Roach

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Global data centers dealmaking surged to hit another record high this year, driven by a rush to build out the infrastructure required for energy-intensive AI workloads.

That surge came even as investors grew increasingly wary of inflated artificial intelligence valuations and the financing underpinning the rapid expansion of data centers. Global stocks sold off in November as worries of an AI-fueled bubble persisted.

But S&P Global reported that more than $61 billion has flowed into the data center market this year, up slightly from $60.8 billion last year, amid what it called a “global construction frenzy.”

A surge in debt financing contributed to the record high as hyperscalers increasingly tap private equity markets rather than funding the expensive infrastructure themselves.

That trend has sparked concerns from some investors as they question the value of the advanced tech that data centers house.

Shares of cloud company Oracle fell 5% on Wednesday following a report that Blue Owl Capital was pulling out of a deal to back a $10 billion data center in Michigan. Oracle has denied the report, but Broadcom, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices retreated after it was published. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.81% in its worst day in nearly a month.

Iuri Struta, TMT analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said his team expects market concerns around AI and Oracle to be temporary and unlikely to have a “massive impact” on data center buildout and M&A in the near future.

“The competitive dynamic among frontier AI model providers, like OpenAI, Alphabet and Anthropic, is changing quickly, and this can have an impact on investor sentiment in public markets. But overall, we see demand for AI applications continuing to grow strongly in 2026.”

Despite the recent pullback in AI stocks, many analysts remain bullish on the sector.

These data centers are nothing but massive black holes for valuable space and water.

The amount of energy they suck up is mind boggling,

The reason why Gates and other tech moguls have suddenly changed their mind on climate change and the environment... They need lots and lots of electricity and lots and lots of water to keep these AI data centers running. The kind of electricity that can only be provided in vast amounts by gas, oil and coal burning plants.

They will take it from places replete with it such as Michigan. Seems like there could be a very good opportunity for energy recovery systems generating heating water from all that server equipment that has to be cooled.

Despite the huge water resources needed to operate a data center, big tech continues to build these data center in the desert southwest where water resources are already overstressed. Follow the money.

To: SeekAndFind

Ai has real value, but it depends on who is controlling it. Better us than the China in the lead on it. Whether we like it or not, American based tech companies need to focus hard on it and spend everything they can to lead. Otherwise, we will definitely drown in the chaos AI could be used to create and sink even faster than we already are.

You’re taking a substantial risk by buying FRMI. It was recently revealed that a prospective anchor tenant for Fermi’s Project Matador (the company’s Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus at Texas Tech University) terminated an agreement that would have advanced $150 million to help fund construction. The tenant’s cancelation news and severe market reaction have prompted national shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman to open an investigation into whether Fermi may have previously misled investors about the strength of the First Tenant agreement. I hope this gets settled and you didn’t put too much money into FRMI.

To: ridesthemiles

the computers will be cooled by a anti-freeze type gel that controls the temperature of the systems. Water will not be required. However, these systems will make new cancer-causing agents, the likes of which we have never seen before. Just my 2cents.

[TITLE]Rivian’s AI pivot is about more than chasing Tesla:
[TEXT]
is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.

RJ Scaringe is sitting in Rivian’s Palo Alto offices, explaining why the adventure-themed EV company suddenly decided to build its own self-driving cars, when an unexpected guest glides by the window outside: Waymo.

A robotaxi from the Alphabet-owned company pulls up outside the office. The passenger, an analyst from Goldman Sachs, briefly takes a selfie before climbing inside. The Rivian founder and CEO chuckles at the scene.

“That’s amazing,” he laughs. “So perfect.”

The arrival of the Waymo helps clarify the challenge that lies ahead for Rivian. A few hours earlier, Scaringe was onstage in front of an audience of hundreds of investors, reporters, and influencers gathered for the company’s announcement of a huge, expensive, and undeniably risky bet on autonomy and AI. The goal, he said, is for Rivian to design its own AI chips that can help power higher levels of autonomy, eventually leading to Level 4 — no human supervision required within certain limits. Could Rivian achieve what has taken Waymo decades to accomplish, but on a much shorter timeline?

More importantly, can it do it safer and more effectively than Tesla, the other EV-only company that is attempting its own messy transformation into an AI and robotics company? Rivian was founded as the outdoor lover’s answer to Elon Musk’s company: rugged, off-road worthy, and fully electric. Now it seems like it’s trying to chase the mercurial billionaire down an AI rabbit hole.

Scaringe insists this isn’t anything motivated by Tesla, but a recognition that the auto industry is staring up its own cliff. Advances in transformer-based encoding and large-parameter models prompted a fundamental shift in Rivian’s thinking of the “physical AI” of autonomous driving, he says. As such, Rivian began a clean-sheet redesign of its autonomy platform in early 2022. With the introduction of its Gen 2 platform, the company began building a “data flywheel” to train a large driving model (sort of like an LLM, but for driving) using real-world driving data from its fleet. And because the model is trained end-to-end, Rivian says that improvements in sensors or compute directly enhance its capabilities, allowing the system to continuously improve as hardware advances.

Either Rivian pursues its own self-produced, vertically integrated autonomy strategy, or it risks being left in the dust by Waymo, Tesla, and others. Several times during the presentation, Scaringe notes that this isn’t some bandwagon chasing, but rather a move born out of years of hard work and thoughtful design.

[TITLE]Wall Street banked on a flurry of deals under Trump in 2025. It wasn't that simple:
[TEXT]

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025. Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull. "If volumes aren't growing, you can't sit still, you've got to think

Happy Friday! Startup funding stayed stagnant in 2025, with fewer late-stage deals and a greater focus on public markets. This and more in today’s ETtech Morning Dispatch.■ Indians’ H-1B limbo■ Chip startups adopt AI■ Cognizant exec on AIIndian startup funding barely moved the needle in 2025 , even as dealmaking stayed busy beneath the surface. Total funding stood at $9.8 billion year-to-date, marginally lower than $10.1 billion in 2024, as gains in growth-stage rounds were offset by a sharp pullback in late-stage private capital.Late-stage private funding slid to $1.8 billion from $2.9 billion last year as mature startups chose the public markets over late private deals. Nearly a dozen consumer and tech companies — including Meesho, Lenskart, and PhysicsWallah — tapped the bourses, unlocking liquidity to early backers and employees.“Two things were happening this year. New investments and exits. After a couple of years where the pace had declined, thanks to all things AI in particular, along with consumer brands, it's been quite a hectic year,” said Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director at Peak XV Partners.Large rounds still came through, anchoring the year’s fund tally:Early-stage funding dipped slightly to $3.1 billion, but AI investment nearly doubled to $1.3 billion. Firms such as Peak XV and Stellaris Venture Partners are leaning into enterprise and voice AI, looking past “bubble” fear toward long-term execution.Ola Electric founder Bhavish Aggarwal has wrapped up a three-day stake sale , offloading 9.6 crore shares worth Rs 324 crore, even as the stock slid to fresh lows.The final tranche on Thursday amounted to Rs 90.2 crore, completing what the company described as a "one-time, limited monetisation" to pare promoter-level debt and release pledged shares.Ola Electric said the transaction is now complete, with the promoter group's holding falling to 34.6% from 36.78%. Aggarwal sold roughly 2.1% of his stake to repay a Rs 260 crore loan, funds used mainly to capitalise his AI venture, Krutrim.The stock has remained under sustained pressure, exacerbated by the recent complete exit of early backer Z47 . The selling triggered a sharp reaction on Dalal Street, with shares plunging to an all-time intraday low of Rs 30.76 on the NSE before closing 5.2% lower at Rs 31.26.Appointments for H-1B visa stamping are being pushed back by more than a year , with many now rescheduled as late as 2027, leaving thousands of applicants in extended limbo.US consular appointments originally scheduled for December have been deferred to 2026. In several cases, slots in early 2026 have also been pushed out to 2027, significantly lengthening wait times.The delays follow a new directive that took effect on December 15 , mandating enhanced social media vetting for H-1B and H-4 applicants. To accommodate the additional scrutiny, US consulates have reduced the number of interviews conducted each day, further stretching appointment queues.The slowdown disproportionately affects Indians, who account for roughly three-fourths of all H-1B visas issued annually. Those hit include applicants with already approved petitions — both fresh filings and renewals — who still need to travel to India for visa stamping.Artificial intelligence (AI) is quietly reshaping how early-stage semiconductor startups in India design and build chips, helping them move faster with leaner teams.Young chipmakers are embedding AI across design and documentation workflows to take on much larger rivals in a capital-intensive industry:AI is also changing staffing equations. “A lot of the design software we use already integrates AI,” said Hareesh Chandrasekar, CEO of 3one4-backed Agnit Semiconductors. “If you had 100 designers on a project, AI could bring that down to maybe 70.”While a lot of investments are pouring into building large language foundational models and subsequently data centres to power them, people have been more conservative

Wanted: leaders to take the helm of India’s manufacturing growth story, as it seeks to dominate global markets and edge past its rivals.Search firms and hiring companies such as Heidrick & Struggles, Insist Consulting, and Michael Page are seeing a sharp uptick in mandates from the manufacturing sector, as companies look to bring on board leaders with expertise in areas such as engineering-led manufacturing, electronics, and semiconductors.A chunk of the hiring is being driven by Indian companies focusing on strengthening their R&D capabilities, industry insiders said. CEAT , Larsen & Toubro, Thermax Kirloskar Brothers , Tata Electronics and Dixon Manufacturing are among those hiring in this space, said companies and recruiters.While domain skills are crucial, industry executives said digital transformation, sustainability, and leadership for large-scale change are universal priorities.Multinationals and domestic conglomerates are strong hunting grounds for such talent, but expat talent is also being tapped from the US, Europe, Middle East, Singapore, and Taiwan for niche, high-tech areas like semiconductors, EV batteries, and biologics, they said.Semiconductor and electronics industries account for the strongest hiring appetite, but there is also a rise in opportunities in capital goods companies, EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) players, green energy, auto and speciality chemicals, industry executives said.Salaries can start at Rs 70 lakh for a plant head role and go as high as Rs 5-6 crore plus ESOPs at bigger companies for top leaders, recruiters said.“We’re seeing heightened interest in senior leaders across operations, technology, and R&D who can embed automation, Industry 4.0 technologies, and stronger quality systems across the manufacturing lifecycle,” said Suresh Raina, partner at Heidrick & Struggles India. “This includes leaders who can stabilise and scale greenfield facilities, improve productivity and cost efficiency, and localise supply chains to reduce dependency on single markets.”Indian companies are looking to expand their markets and reduce dependence on the US and Chinese markets amid geopolitical uncertainties.Evolving US trade policies are prompting Indian companies to actively diversify beyond a single export market, which has increased demand for senior leaders who can strengthen global sales and business development capabilities, particularly across Europe, APAC, and the Middle East and Africa, Raina said.At Insist Consulting, the manufacturing sector accounts for 30-40% of overall mandates compared to 10-20% a year ago.“In the October-December period, we’ve already placed three CXOs at manufacturing companies in Bengaluru alone,” said R Suresh, managing director of Insist Consulting. “Salaries are through the roof – the CEO of a Rs 2000-crore revenue engineering company can get Rs 3-4 crore plus ESOPs; at bigger companies, that would go up to Rs 5-6 crore plus ESOPs.”Michael Page has seen a 40-50% jump in mandates compared to last year, and is seeing demand for manufacturing, supply chain, and tech roles from the automotive and heavy engineering sector, and R&D, projects, and legal roles in the chemicals and pharma space.“Many Indian setups are investing heavily in building their manufacturing and R&D capabilities, specifically industries like precision engineering, chemicals and the like,” said Anshul Lodha, managing director of Michael Page India.Tyre manufacturer CEAT is looking at hiring mid-level to senior professionals for roles in digital transformation, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and R&D, over the coming months. The RPG Group company has leveraged AI-driven recruitment tools and people analytics to identify and attract talent.“The tyre industry is rapidly evolving with capacity expansion, technology shifts and changing mobility trends. To stay ahead, we need leaders who can drive innovation, strengthen processes, and accelerate our sustainability agenda,” said Somraj Roy, chief HR officer at CEAT.Tata Motors is prioritising skillsets in battery technology, software-defined vehicles, hydrogen fuel systems, advanced engineering, sustainability and commercial functions, its CHRO Sitaram Kandi said.“For niche roles in EV and advanced technologies, we have onboarded expats and specialists from Europe, EMEA, South Asia and the US; our focus remains on professionals who can strengthen capabilities, develop talent base, lead transformation, and accelerate our EV roadmap, regardless of geography,” Kandi told ET.

Indonesia urged to join global chip supply chain to boost AI ambitions

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia should position itself within the global semiconductor supply chain to strengthen its competitiveness in the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, Deputy Minister for Communication and Digital Affairs Nezar Patria said on Thursday.Speaking at a discussion in Central Jakarta, Nezar said Indonesia’s vast mineral resources could become a strategic advantage as global competition intensifies in AI-related industries.“To strengthen our bargaining position amid competition in the artificial intelligence industry, Indonesia, with its mineral wealth, must be able to enter the global supply chain of the AI industry,” he said.Nezar noted that Indonesia has an estimated 340 million tons of silica sand reserves, a key raw material used to produce silicon wafers, which form the foundation of chips and semiconductors.“This is our main capital. Silica sand is the primary raw material for making silicon wafers, which are the basis of chips. Today, this has become a strategic industry being aggressively pursued by advanced economies,” he said.Despite this potential, Indonesia has yet to become part of the global semiconductor supply chain. Domestic semiconductor manufacturing facilities, Nezar added, still rely heavily on imported components.To change that, he stressed the importance of downstream processing, warning that Indonesia should no longer remain merely an exporter of raw materials.“At the moment, we can only export raw silica sand to China, European countries, and Japan, where it is processed. This has to stop. We must pursue downstream processing so we can truly enter the global supply chain,” he said.Nezar said the government is now working to identify opportunities and map the natural resources needed by the semiconductor industry as part of a broader strategy to build domestic capacity.In parallel, Indonesia is actively exploring cooperation with countries that play strategic roles in the global semiconductor industry.“We are opening doors for cooperation with strategic countries that we can partner with to build a semiconductor industry, especially to strengthen artificial intelligence infrastructure,” he said.Nezar expressed optimism that Indonesia could achieve sovereignty in its AI ecosystem if it effectively harnesses its resources and industrial opportunities.“There are many opportunities we have overlooked. Only now are we realizing that all this capital exists in Indonesia and can be developed to achieve sovereignty in our artificial intelligence ecosystem,” he said.

Mumbai: The department of telecommunications (DoT) collected ₹79,121 crore from telecom operators between April and November, up 47% from the year-ago period, as per data on its website.Analysts said the jump in collection was driven by steady payments from telecom operators for licence fees and headline tariff increase, which increased the amount these companies pay to the government as revenue share "The surge in receipts is primarily due to the 'denominator effect', as operators raised tariffs in mid-2024 and mid-2025, their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) expanded significantly, automatically increasing the absolute value of the government's revenue share," said Peeyush Vaish, partner and TMT industry leader, Deloitte India. "Robust tax collections are actually a positive indicator of the sector's operational health," he said.Additionally, we are seeing the normalisation of the fiscal calendar. As the moratoriums on past auction payments conclude, operators are resuming standard deferred payment schedules, Vaish said."The increase in DoT receipts appears largely structural rather than operator specific," said Prashant Bawa, partner and telecom sector leader at PwC India."Regular licence fee and spectrum usage charge payments from the sector's stronger balance sheet operators continue to anchor collections, while stressed operators remain on defined repayment frameworks. The data suggests compliance stability across the sector, rather than a sudden step change by any single player," he said.Meanwhile, capital spending on telecom infrastructure more than tripled to ₹18,032 crore, up from ₹5,424 crore last year, as the government increased investment in BharatNet fibre rollouts. This rise in receipts pushed net cash flow to ₹55,290 crore, more than double the previous year's ₹26,060 crore."The acceleration in BharatNet capex reflects execution catch-up and a renewed push to translate past approvals into on-ground rollout. Large public digital infrastructure programmes typically see phased disbursements, and FY25 appears to be an execution-heavy year rather than a correction for missed targets," Bawa said.However, moving from "funding" to "fibre" involves last-mile challenges such as right of way clearances. While capital is actively flowing into BharatNet phase II, the "cash pile" narrative overlooks the complexity of physical execution, Deloitte's Vaish said.

[TITLE]A 10-Hour Data Center Outage Is Testing the Ambitions of KKR, GIP:
[TEXT]
Data center operators are fixated on the “five nines” — an expectation that they’ll keep the infrastructure behind financial markets, e-commerce and artificial intelligence running 99.999% of the time.

So as news rippled out last month that a CyrusOne facility in Aurora, Illinois, that handles trillions of dollars in trading volume each day went down for 10 hours, industry insiders were stunned.

To them, it was an eternity, and the failure at the data center outside Chicago is a black eye for CyrusOne’s backers.

KKR & Co. and Global Infrastructure Partners, now a unit of BlackRock Inc., announced their acquisition of CyrusOne in 2021 for $15 billion. They secured billions more in financing for the firm as they deepened their foothold in a booming industry increasingly dominated by the likes of Blackstone Inc. and Blue Owl Capital Inc.

Data centers, the physical embodiment of the AI revolution, are one of the hottest bets in private markets. But as the debate rages over whether the boom is a bubble — debt levels and valuations are climbing — the challenges for Wall Street can be much more tangible: from cooling the space to literally keeping the lights on.

KKR pursued the investment for years and was the driving force behind the deal as it worked to rope in various bidding partners.

CyrusOne touches several of the private equity firm’s major units. Last year, KKR led part of a $7.9 billion loan to the data center operator, co-arranged by its own capital markets team and funded by its Global Atlantic insurance arm alongside some of its clients. And KKR owns its CyrusOne stake through its infrastructure and real estate funds, as well as Strategic Holdings, a unit that holds long-term investments on the firm’s balance sheet.

All that cash wasn’t enough to stave off disaster at Aurora, an older property in CyrusOne’s portfolio of more than 55 operational data centers. A series of missteps by facilities workers at a site running on older systems led to a major outage for CME Group Inc. Such incidents typically require the data center operator to compensate the client, according to people familiar with the industry.

CME entered a 15-year lease at the Aurora data center in 2016, according to a prior announcement.

“They will need to double down on becoming a resilient data center because this is a failure that happened and shouldn’t have,” said Andrej Danis, head of AlixPartners’ Americas telecommunications and digital infrastructure practice.

KKR and GIP said they’re confident in CyrusOne’s strategy and that it’s poised to benefit from growing demand.

“Under our ownership, CyrusOne has accelerated its expansion, enhanced its competitive position while deepening its commitment to innovation, and reinforced its standing as a premier developer and operator of mission-critical data centers,” Waldemar Szlezak, KKR’s global head of digital infrastructure and a CyrusOne board member, said in an emailed statement.

Will Brilliant, GIP’s global head of digital infrastructure and a CyrusOne board member, echoed Szlezak’s remarks in a separate statement.

“We fully support CyrusOne, as we have done throughout our ownership, to invest significant resources to maintain a leading position as a provider of critical data center development and operations services for its customers,” Brilliant said.

Key Focus

For Wall Street, the stakes are high.

Data centers are a key focus for KKR’s infrastructure business, one of the fastest-growing and best-performing strategies for the firm, which is led by Co-Chief Executive Officers Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall. GIP, which announced in October that it was making a bet on developerAligned Data Centers, is central to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s ambitions to expand the $13.5 trillion money manager beyond its stock-and-bond roots into more lucrative realms.

n backing CyrusOne, KKR and GIP took on a dot-com-era company with a complex history.

Cincinnati Bell acquired the firm from Abry Partners, before spinning it off. CyrusOne then made strategic takeovers of data centers from other companies through deals with firms including Cervalis, Sentinel Data Centers and Zenium. The Aurora data center, acquired through a sale-leaseback transaction with CME, gave CyrusOne a foothold in financial services.

Knitting together assets from various deals was a complicated undertaking. As a public company, CyrusOne was wrestling with activist investor Jana Partners and leadership turnover.

After longtime CEO Gary Wojtaszek departed in 2020, the company was run by a variety of successors with short tenures. They include Tesh Durvasula, an interim CEO for less than a year; Bruce Duncan, who had no prior data center experience; and David Ferdman, a co-founder who was asked to return to lead the company through the latest ownership transition.

While CyrusOne received interest at various points from

[TITLE]SoftBank races to fulfill $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by year-end:
[TEXT]
By Echo Wang, Miho Uranaka and Krystal Hu

NEW YORK/TOKYO/SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group (SFTBY) is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) by year-end through an array of cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments, and could tap its undrawn margin loans borrowed against its valuable ownership in chip firm Arm Holdings (ARM), sources said.

The "all-in" bet ​on OpenAI is among the biggest yet by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, as the Japanese billionaire seeks to improve his firm's position in the race for artificial intelligence. To come up with ‌the money, Son has already sold SoftBank's entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA), offloaded $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile (TMUS) US stake, and slashed staff.

Son has slowed most other dealmaking at SoftBank's Vision Fund to a crawl, and any deal above $50 million now requires his ‌explicit approval, two of the sources told Reuters.

Son's firm is working to take public its payments app operator, PayPay. The initial public offering, originally expected this month, was pushed back due to the 43-day-long U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. PayPay's market debut, likely to raise more than $20 billion, is now expected in the first quarter of next year, according to one direct source and another person familiar with the efforts.

The Japanese conglomerate is also looking to cash out some of its holdings in Didi Global (DIDIY), the operator of China’s dominant ride-hailing platform, which is looking to list its shares in Hong Kong after a regulatory crackdown forced it to delist in the ⁠U.S. in 2021, a source with direct knowledge said. Investment managers at ‌SoftBank's Vision Fund are being directed toward the OpenAI deal, two of the above sources said.

SoftBank's scramble to marshal funds offers a window into the strain faced even by the world's biggest dealmakers as they scramble to finance ambitious AI data center projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

SoftBank declined to comment.

SoftBank has options

OpenAI has not ‍yet received the remaining funding, but expects the money to come in by the end of 2025, as stipulated in the contract, sources said.

SoftBank has multiple sources of capital it could tap, including margin loans, cash on its balance sheet, stakes in listed companies, and corporate bonds or bridge loans, sources said.

Son has strong reasons to draw on a range of funding mechanisms to fulfill those obligations. SoftBank secured a deal to invest in OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation in April. ​Since then, the valuation of OpenAI has risen dramatically and the company is in talks to raise additional funding from investors, including Amazon, tripling its valuation to close to $900 billion, one of the sources added, ‌which would give SoftBank a significant paper gain once the transaction is completed.

[TITLE]How AI Is Rewriting the Healthcare Playbook:

Health systems are turning to artificial intelligence as rising complexity and labor pressures demand faster, more reliable decisions.

They use AI to predict hospital operations, scale intelligence across networks and personalize cancer care. Digital twins, cloud platforms and multimodal models make that shift possible. PYMNTS looks at three ways AI is changing healthcare.

AI Turns Hospital Operations Into Predictive Systems

AI reshapes hospital operations by replacing hindsight with foresight. Hospitals operate as complex, interdependent systems where patient flow, staffing, bed availability and care pathways constantly shift. Traditional analytics flatten that complexity into averages. GE HealthCare’s purpose-built Digital Twin technology models real-world variation instead.

Digital twins create virtual replicas of hospital operations that allow leaders to test scenarios before acting. Health systems simulate seasonal surges, staffing changes and surgical scheduling adjustments without disrupting live care, exposing how small operational shifts cascade across departments.

At Children’s Mercy Kansas City, leaders use the technology specifically to prepare for spikes in demand.

“It’s important that we’re prepared for surges, and the Digital Twin has been remarkable in helping us do that,” Stephanie Meyer, senior vice president and chief nursing officer, said in a GE HealthCare article.

The simulations help teams surface bottlenecks early and adjust capacity before pressure hits frontline staff.

Hospitals can deploy these Digital Twins in months, not years, because the models rely on existing operational data and probabilistic simulation rather than custom-built pilots, the article said. They can further use them to optimize throughput, balance capacity across facilities and make capital planning decisions with greater confidence.

AI and Cloud Convergence Scales Intelligence and ROI

Cloud infrastructure gives health systems the ability to aggregate operational, staffing and clinical data into a single environment and run AI models continuously, not intermittently.

Providers now use cloud-based AI to project inpatient census, anticipate staffing shortages and manage bed capacity across networks in near real time. GE HealthCare’s Command Center and forecasting tools, for example, use machine learning to predict demand and staffing needs with accuracy rates that can exceed 90%, allowing hospitals to intervene before congestion and care delays surface, according to a separate article.

These deployments increasingly deliver financial and operational returns. Healthcare organizations now implement AI at scale across high-volume workflows, such as scheduling, capacity planning and care coordination, and executives increasingly evaluate ROI based on throughput gains, labor optimization and improved patient access rather than experimental efficiency metrics. As AI moves into production environments, its performance directly affects margins, workforce sustainability and service availability.

Cloud-based deployment lowers adoption barriers for mid-sized and community hospitals, giving them access to advanced analytics once limited to academic medical centers. As organizations embed AI directly into workflows, clinicians and administrators act on predictions instead of static reports. This shift turns AI investment into operational leverage.

Multimodal AI Expands Precision in Cancer Research and Care

AI reshapes clinical care most visibly through multimodal models in oncology. Cancer care demands interpretation across imaging, genomics, pathology and patient history. Single-input AI models fall short. Multimodal AI integrates these data sources into unified analytical systems.

Multimodal AI improves risk stratification and treatment planning in colorectal and prostate cancer. These models combine imaging data, molecular markers and clinical records to predict disease progression and treatment response with greater precision. Oncologists use these insights to identify which patients need aggressive intervention and which can avoid unnecessary treatment.

Multimodal AI uncovers patterns that clinicians cannot detect using traditional tools alone. It supports personalized medicine by aligning treatment decisions with individual risk profiles. However, scaling these models requires interoperable data infrastructure, strong governance and regulatory clarity.

Data center deals hit record $61 billion in 2025 amid global construction frenzy

CNBC ^ | 12/19/25 | April Roach

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Global data centers dealmaking surged to hit another record high this year, driven by a rush to build out the infrastructure required for energy-intensive AI workloads.

That surge came even as investors grew increasingly wary of inflated artificial intelligence valuations and the financing underpinning the rapid expansion of data centers. Global stocks sold off in November as worries of an AI-fueled bubble persisted.

But S&P Global reported that more than $61 billion has flowed into the data center market this year, up slightly from $60.8 billion last year, amid what it called a “global construction frenzy.”

A surge in debt financing contributed to the record high as hyperscalers increasingly tap private equity markets rather than funding the expensive infrastructure themselves.

That trend has sparked concerns from some investors as they question the value of the advanced tech that data centers house.

Shares of cloud company Oracle fell 5% on Wednesday following a report that Blue Owl Capital was pulling out of a deal to back a $10 billion data center in Michigan. Oracle has denied the report, but Broadcom, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices retreated after it was published. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.81% in its worst day in nearly a month.

Iuri Struta, TMT analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said his team expects market concerns around AI and Oracle to be temporary and unlikely to have a “massive impact” on data center buildout and M&A in the near future.

“The competitive dynamic among frontier AI model providers, like OpenAI, Alphabet and Anthropic, is changing quickly, and this can have an impact on investor sentiment in public markets. But overall, we see demand for AI applications continuing to grow strongly in 2026.”

Despite the recent pullback in AI stocks, many analysts remain bullish on the sector.

They need lots and lots of electricity and lots and lots of water to keep these AI data centers running. The kind of electricity that can only be provided in vast amounts by gas, oil and coal burning plants.

Despite the huge water resources needed to operate a data center, big tech continues to build these data center in the desert southwest where water resources are already overstressed. Follow the money.

Ai has real value, but it depends on who is controlling it. Better us than the China in the lead on it. Whether we like it or not, American based tech companies need to focus hard on it and spend everything they can to lead. Otherwise, we will definitely drown in the chaos AI could be used to create and sink even faster than we already are.

You’re taking a substantial risk by buying FRMI. It was recently revealed that a prospective anchor tenant for Fermi’s Project Matador (the company’s Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus at Texas Tech University) terminated an agreement that would have advanced $150 million to help fund construction. The tenant’s cancelation news and severe market reaction have prompted national shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman to open an investigation into whether Fermi may have previously misled investors about the strength of the First Tenant agreement. I hope this gets settled and you didn’t put too much money into FRMI.

the computers will be cooled by a anti-freeze type gel that controls the temperature of the systems. Water will not be required. However, these systems will make new cancer-causing agents, the likes of which we have never seen before. Just my 2cents.
