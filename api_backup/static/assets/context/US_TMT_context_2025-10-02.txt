[TITLE]Enfabrica’s ACF-S and EMFASYS architecture could change how AI clusters process tens of thousands of chips efficiently:
[TEXT]
Nvidia’s acquisition brings Enfabrica engineers directly into its AI ecosystem

EMFASYS chassis pools up to 18TB of memory for GPU clusters

Elastic memory fabric frees HBM for time-sensitive AI tasks efficiently

Nvidia’s decision to spend more than $900 million on Enfabrica was something of a surprise, especially as it came alongside a separate $5 billion investment in Intel.

According to ServeTheHome, “Enfabrica has the coolest technology,” likely because of its unique approach to solving one of AI’s largest scaling problems: tying tens of thousands of computing chips together so they can operate as a single system without wasting resources.

This deal suggests Nvidia believes solving interconnect bottlenecks is just as critical as securing chip production capacity.

A unique approach to data fabrics

Enfabrica’s Accelerated Compute Fabric Switch (ACF-S) architecture was built with PCIe lanes on one side and high-speed networking on the other.

Its ACF-S “Millennium” device is a 3.2Tbps network chip with 128 PCIe lanes that can connect GPUs, NICs, and other devices while maintaining flexibility.

The company’s design allows data to move between ports or across the chip with minimal latency, bridging Ethernet and PCIe/CXL technologies.

For AI clusters, this means higher use and fewer idle GPUs waiting for data, which translates into better return on investment for costly hardware.

Iconiq’s State of Software in 2025: Forward Deployed Engineers Up 12x; 55% of GTM is Now in Post-Sales; 2025 Is Crushing 2024 For Funding

ICONIQ Capital just dropped their annual State of Software report, and inside the 73 (!) pages are some data that shows just how much the software industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation.

Here are my top 5 take-aways (and 5 more bonus ones):

1. AI-Native Companies Are Hitting $100M ARR with Teams of Less Than 100-150 People

Traditional SaaS wisdom says you need hundreds of employees to reach $100M in ARR. AI-native companies are throwing that playbook out the window.

The numbers: Cursor reached $100M ARR in one year with approximately 19 employees. Lovable hit the milestone in 8 months with 45 people. ElevenLabs got there in roughly 2 years with around 150 employees.

At a practical level, they often have tiny GTM teams to start, and often for longer, and fairly tight dev teams. Perplexity got to 5,000 customers with just 5 folks on the sales team:

Compare that to traditional SaaS benchmarks where top-quartile companies took 5+ years and 500-700+ employees to reach $100M ARR. We’re talking

[TITLE]AI-Fixated Traders Pile Into Teradyne, Other Obscure Chip Stocks:
[TEXT]
With tech companies continuing to boost AI spending, the valuation of many chipmakers are increasingly expensive.

Chip stocks have become a favorite way to bet on artificial intelligence. But after big runups in companies like Broadcom Inc., investors are turning to an often overlooked group — suppliers of the gear used to make semiconductors.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Teradyne Inc., a provider of tools used for testing chips during the manufacturing process, has nearly doubled from an April low and is up more than 50% since late July. Meanwhile, Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. — two of the biggest US makers of machines used to produce semiconductors — are the fourth- and fifth-best performing stocks, respectively, in the 30-member Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index this year with gains of more than 69%.

Earlier this month, Lam went on a 14-session rally, its longest winning streak on record, during which the shares soared 36%. And peer Applied Materials Inc. just posted its own eight-session streak that added 20%.

With companies like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. continuing to boost spending on AI, and the valuations of many chipmakers looking increasingly expensive, equipment suppliers have become a destination for investors seeking growth at a more reasonable cost — although their valuations aren’t as enticing as they were now that investors are starting to pile in.

“The market’s clearly front-running the next AI capex wave, betting that fabs and cloud players keep spending aggressively,” said Haris Khurshid, chief investment officer at Karobaar Capital. “The catch is valuations have already run hard, so any pause in orders or delayed spend could hit fast.”

The gains follow a similar trend playing out in memory and storage hardware, another unsung corner of the tech sector.

Micron Technology Inc., which counts Lam Research and KLA as suppliers, has gained more than 90% this year amid soaring demand for high-bandwidth memory that’s critical in AI computing. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which compete with Micron in supplying memory, are Teradyne’s biggest customers.

A strong outlook for spending on testing gear in the memory market was a reason Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini raised his price target on Teradyne to $200 from $133 last week. The stock closed at $134.33 on Monday, implying upside of 49%.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

A $14 billion deal secured TikTok's American future — and analysts say it marks a unique compromise in Washington and Beijing's ongoing tech fight.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Thursday requiring TikTok's current owner, ByteDance, and its affiliates to own less than 20% of the new company.

The exact make-up of the new consortium has not yet been revealed. Trump said on Thursday that Oracle and Larry Ellison would be part of the deal, which would include "four or five world-class investors."

Analysts told Business Insider that while the deal shows it's still possible for the two rivals to bargain, TikTok is likely a one-off — not a template for future disputes.

The US-China tech rivalry has seen Washington clamp down on Chinese firms over security concerns — from banning Huawei's telecom gear in the US to cutting companies like SMIC off from advanced chips. Beijing, meanwhile, has been backing its own champions abroad, such as AI model DeepSeek.

TikTok became a high-profile flash point in that fight, thanks to its massive US user base and its ties to a Chinese-owned parent company — fueling fears that data could be accessed by Beijing.

TikTok deal is a 'strategic compromise'

Ray Wang, the research director for semiconductors and emerging technology at Futurum Group, said the agreement signals that the US and China can still carve out a "pragmatic middle ground" on critical tech issues — with the broader aim of stabilizing their fraught relationship.

It also shows Washington's willingness to use "market-based mechanisms" to manage sensitive technology disputes, said the analyst, who specializes in US-China tech statecraft.

That shift from a ban to a deal could influence how outsiders view China's role in global tech.

"Foreign governments and investors may begin to see Chinese technology expansion less as a binary yes/no issue and more as a negotiable process," Wang said.

While the countries continue to compete, the deal indicates that "there may be some scope for cooperation," said Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.

"Whether the cooperation ultimately benefits both sides more or less equally has yet to play out," he added.

Dylan Loh, an associate professor of public policy and global affairs at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, described the agreement as a "strategic compromise" on both sides: Trump repeatedly extended the deadline for a sale, and China eventually gave its assent.

"This has to be seen in the bigger context of both sides trying to reach some trade deal," Loh said.

Analysts cautioned against viewing the agreement as a blueprint for other Chinese firms looking to enter the US market.

"While companies may interpret it as a pathway for sustaining or entering US operations, TikTok remains a uniquely high-profile case," said Wang.

Chong said TikTok's sheer popularity with US users, the vast amount of personal data it collects, and ByteDance's alleged ties to Beijing make the case especially contentious — a dynamic few other Chinese apps could replicate.

TikTok itself remains banned in China, but ByteDance runs another short-form video platform, Douyin, there.

TikTok gets certainty — but questions remain

The deal gives TikTok something it hasn't had for over a year: certainty

[TITLE]Is Lam Research (LRCX) The Best AI Semiconductor Stock to Buy Now?:
[TEXT]
We recently published 10 Buzzing Tech and AI Stocks Everyone’s Talking About. Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.

Mehdi Hosseini, senior equity research analyst at Susquehanna, said in a latest program on CNBC that he likes Lam Research because the company is linked to spending on memory. The analyst believes memory spending will increase in the second half of 2026.

“I do like Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) because they’re overindexed to memory spend, and I think at some point in the second half of 2026, memory spend would have to pick up — just we’re not going to have enough supply. And then on top of that, what you get with Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) is increased market share. They have a new product; there’s a new material used in making semiconductor chill, and that’s the gravy on top of everything. I think Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) is well positioned.”

Artisan Value Fund stated the following regarding Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:

“Booking Holdings and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) were the top contributors in the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors, respectively. Lam Research is a global leader in wafer fabrication equipment used in the production of semiconductors. Lam was a new purchase, made on April 9 near depths of the post-Liberation Day market selloff. As value investors, conditions of fear and uncertainty are fertile ground for creating attractive long-term buying opportunities. Few areas of the market were under greater pressure than semiconductors & semiconductor equipment stocks to start the year. We had been researching Lam since 2023, so we knew the company well and were able to act quickly when the stock plunged. At our initial purchase, Lam was selling for ~$60, almost 50% below its July 2024 highs. Lam is one of the key global suppliers of chip equipment serving the memory (NAND and DRAM) and foundry/logic markets. The financial condition is rock solid as it has a net cash balance sheet, and the company returns 100% of earnings to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Shares were selling for a 17X P/E on cyclically depressed earnings at the time of initial purchase, which we believed was an attractive valuation given the compounding nature of the business.”

While we acknowledge the potential of LRCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Fewer households, businesses will get high-speed internet under revamped federal plan:
[TEXT]
By Madyson Fitzgerald and Amelia Ferrell Knisely, Stateline.org

LEFT HAND, W. Va. — The residents of Roane County, West Virginia, enjoy living among the rolling mountains and winding, two-lane roads. Situated between Charleston and Parkersburg, two of the state’s largest cities, the rural county is known for its small towns and historic buildings.

That’s how Sherry Husted, the director of the Roane County Public Libraries, described her native community as she worked at Geary Public Library in Left Hand, West Virginia. Each of the county’s three library branches has at least three public computers and free internet access, among other services.

These services are essential to residents living in Roane — where less than 32% of the county’s households, businesses and community buildings — have reliable internet connectivity, according to the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Map.

“We love our rural area,” Husted said. “But there’s always the catch. You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.”

Members of the library staff regularly help patrons fill out job applications and build resumes. They also help those who have never used a desktop computer before — many of the county’s residents rely on their cellular devices and spotty mobile service, Husted said. Most residents still use landline phones, she added.

And those with internet access at home are paying a steep price. Husted’s plan with Frontier, which includes fiber internet and a landline, comes to $170 a month.

“If you work from home, you need reliable internet,” she said. “Frontier does the best they can. But this is a very rural area, so the trees and terrain are constantly messing up the internet. And because of the demand on these older lines, your internet may not be reliable enough to host things like meetings or classes.”

Roane County is one of the areas federal officials hoped to support through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, or BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access. The $42.45 billion initiative, created under the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, aimed to close the digital divide — with a focus on rural communities.

The Trump administration’s changes to the program, however, have disqualified hundreds of thousands of locations — including homes, businesses and community buildings — from receiving internet access. And the program’s new technology-neutral approach will also shift a large portion of the federal funds toward satellite internet companies, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, that cost less to build but have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable. That means households and businesses that were looking forward to reliable, high-speed internet will no longer get support from the BEAD program.

While some experts were initially skeptical
