Trump Media & Technology to merge with fusion energy company TAE in $6 billion deal. Here's why.

CBS News ^ | 12/18/2025 | Alain Sherter, Aimee Picchi

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Trump Media & Technology is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in a deal worth more than $6 billion, aiming to harness the fledgling technology to power energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.

TAE, which is privately owned, is developing technology aimed at producing energy by fusing atomic nuclei. Trump Media & Technology owns President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.

The merger comes amid a difficult year for Trump Media shares, which trade under the ticker DJT — the same as Mr. Trump's initials. Through Wednesday, the stock was down 69% for the year, even as the S&P 500 had gained 14%.

After the merger was announced Thursday morning, Trump Media shares jumped $3.37, or 32%, to $13.84.

Trump Media's strategic shift

More recently, the company has pivoted beyond its roots as a tech business. Earlier this year, Trump Media struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency, and it has also rolled out investment funds with "America-first" strategies.

The merger with TAE represents a continuation of Trump Media's "America first" principles, former California lawmaker Devin Nunes, now chief executive of Trump Media, said in a Thursday conference call with investors.

"Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense and secure the energy needed to guarantee America's dominance of AI technology," Nunes said on the call.

He added, "This combination positions the combined company to help lead the global AI revolution and kickstart an American energy renaissance."

I think this is a bridge tooooo far Westinghouse already solved the problem Westinghouse isn't putting a big reactor in a trailer, but they're developing eVinci™ Microreactors, which are factory-built, small nuclear batteries about the size of a school bus or shipping container, designed for remote power, mining, data centers, and even space, offering clean energy for 10+ years without refueling, relying on heat pipes and passive safety for deployment in containerized units that can power off-grid locations or supplement grids, a key step towards mobile nuclear power

We have Fusion Power available locally on da Erf at night? Yeah, fusion exists on the Sun, and the Sun shares the power during the day, we grab it into batteries for night. The way I see it, the merger is Trump's quest to use fusion to create gold from lesser elements. He needs more to decorate his accomodations.

[TITLE]Technology M&A: AI infrastructure and regulation redefine the deal cycle:
[TEXT]
Deals are ramping up in the tech space, driven by trends like AI, cybersecurity and connectivity. Credit: Adobe/Creative-Touch.

A powerful rebound in tech dealmaking

Despite a forbidding backdrop of geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty, technology M&A has hit the accelerator. In the third quarter of 2025, transactions in the tech, media and telecom (TMT) sector reached $256 billion, a 51% jump on the previous quarter. The scale of the rebound is significant in a market that only recently seemed stuck in neutral.

The resurgence has been led by very large transactions. Deals worth $1 billion or more accounted for $220 billion of Q3 2025 value, spread across 37 mega-deals. The largest of these was the $55 billion takeover of Electronic Arts by a consortium including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, which alone absorbed more than a fifth of quarterly tech deal value. Buyers are once again prepared to commit serious capital. Yet, in an age of anxiety

[TITLE]LatentForce Raises $1.7M Seed Co-Led by Ideaspring Capital and Yali Capital to Accelerate Agentic AI-Driven Enterprise Software Modernisation:
[TEXT]
BENGALURU, India, Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- LatentForce, an AI-native platform for large-scale enterprise code migrations and software modernisation, has raised $1.7M in a Seed funding round co-led by Ideaspring Capital and Yali Capital. The funds will be used to strengthen its proprietary migration models and accelerate expansion across India and worldwide. Founded in 2024, LatentForce is building an Agentic AI platform for large-scale enterprise code migrations and software overhauls, a market estimated at US$22.7 billion today and projected to exceed US$50 billion by 2031.

While most AI coding tools focus on assisting individual developers, LatentForce is building specialised AI systems for large-scale enterprise modernisation. The company leverages efficient, task-specific Small Language Models (SLMs) purpose-built for legacy transformation, enabling organisations to upgrade decades-old software with higher accuracy, security, and control. By reducing the cost, risk, and time required for large migrations by up to 80%, LatentForce makes enterprise transformation commercially viable at a scale that was previously impractical.

Aravind Jayendran, Founder and CEO of LatentForce, said, “Most enterprises today are constrained by decades of accumulated technical debt. Code migration is not just a coding problem; it is fundamentally a system transformation challenge. At LatentForce, we are building the default enterprise platform for eliminating legacy tech debt through AI-driven modernisation.”

Reflecting on the deeper philosophy behind modernisation, Prathosh A P, Assistant Professor at IISc Bangalore and Co-founder of LatentForce, incubated at FSID, IISc, added, “For us, modernisation is not just rewriting code; it is continuity of intent, carrying forward the wisdom of the past into the architecture of the future without distortion. What excites me personally is the plethora of hard technical challenges this area brings in.”

Speaking on execution at scale, Vinay Kyatham, Co-founder and CTO of LatentForce, said, “Enterprise migration projects fail not because of lack of intent, but because of loss of engineering control at scale. We built LatentForce to give teams deterministic pipelines, security by design, and the ability to modernise mission-critical systems with confidence rather than guesswork.”

“Ideaspring Capital is excited to be a part of LatentForce AI’s journey in transforming enterprise code modernisation. A vertically integrated AI platform that combines custom LLMs with deep graph engines will bring a paradigm shift to the $5 trillion legacy code market. With enterprises needing absolute control and compliance, LatentForce’s audit-ready approach will surely pave the way for reliable, non-mainframe migrations at scale. Prathosh, Aravind, and Vinay bring a unique blend of deep-tech research and industry experience that bodes great for LatentForce”, added Naganand Doraswamy, Managing Partner, Ideaspring Capital.

Yali Capital’s Ganapathy Subramaniam, said, “AI-first deep-tech is central to Yali’s investment thesis, and LatentForce is a standout example of how specialised systems can deliver at enterprise scale. Aravind, Vinay and Prathosh bring exceptional depth in applied research and engineering. We’re excited to partner with them as they scale this category-defining technology.”

The company is already seeing encouraging traction by means of interest from enterprises and is currently used by developers across BFSI and SaaS enterprises in India and the US, helping overhaul highly critical and sensitive codebases.

About LatentForce

[TITLE]AI, Connectivity Shaping CEO Priorities: KPMG 2025 Technology & Telecommunications Outlook:
[TEXT]
In an unpredictable and fast-changing environment, technology and telecommunications CEOs retain strong optimism. As per the KPMG 2025 Technology and Telecommunications CEO Outlook survey, 80% are confident in their companies’ growth prospects, and 83% are positive about the sector’s growth prospects, up from 74% in 2024.

Most of the technology and telecommunications CEOs surveyed (89%) are pursuing inorganic avenues to growth, with 43% showing a “high” appetite for “transformative” acquisitions.

Almost three-quarters of CEOs across both sectors (73%) state their businesses have adapted growth strategies to meet changing market conditions, indicative of heightened exposure to regulatory, infrastructure, and geopolitical challenges.

When asked about top operational priorities to achieve growth, CEOs from telecommunications companies cite digitisation and connectivity (26%), indicating the need to modernise infrastructure to support as-a-service models and roll out 5G, satellite, and software-defined networks to improve global connectivity.

For technology sector leaders, the top aims are reevaluating and adapting business and operating models to enhance innovation (18%) and understanding and implementing generative/agentic AI (18%).

On December 17, Morgan Stanley lifted its price target on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to $91 from $82 and kept an Overweight rating on the stock. The firm said the AI trade widened beyond semiconductor stocks in 2025, giving a boost to infrastructure companies. Optical networking has been a clear beneficiary. The analyst expects that trend to carry into the first half of 2026. However, looking further out, the analyst noted that investors will “need to get more selective for full year returns given multiples.”

Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s long-standing strength in networking is becoming more relevant in the age of artificial intelligence, especially as agentic AI gains traction. Products like Nexus HyperFabric bring together Cisco’s networking capabilities with Nvidia’s computing and AI software, allowing companies to build infrastructure tailored for AI workloads. Cisco is also pushing into security, describing its Hypershield platform as a fully distributed, AI-native cybersecurity solution.

Those efforts are showing up in the numbers. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) posted 5% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2025, with sales reaching $56.7 billion for the year ended July 26. Growth picked up in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, ending October 25, when revenue rose 8% to $14.9 billion.

Management expects that momentum to continue. For fiscal 2026, Cisco is forecasting revenue between $60.2 billion and $61 billion.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) develops and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and a range of technology services used by enterprises, service providers, and governments worldwide.

While we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

AI infrastructure like data centers has drawn heavy investment as debate grows over whether valuations are sustainable. ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP via Getty Images

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The artificial intelligence boom is real — but there's more to the AI trade than chips alone, according to a credit investor.

"This is a super-duper micro cycle that will outlast many investing careers," said Scott Goodwin, the cofounder and managing partner of Diameter Capital Partners, a quote he attributed to his partner Jonathan Lewinsohn.

AI represents what Diameter Capital sees as a long-running, disruptive cycle — but buying the most obvious winners isn't the only way to play it, he said on the "Goldman Sachs Exchanges" podcast published on Friday.

Diameter Capital, which manages approximately $25 billion in assets, has focused on where AI demand could create less obvious bottlenecks — and where those bottlenecks show up in credit markets.

The AI opportunity beyond chips

That view led Diameter to buy the unsecured debt of a midsize telecommunications company in 2023.

Goodwin said the bet was rooted in the idea that as companies move from training AI models to actually using them, demand shifts away from chips alone and toward the networks that carry data.

"It had to leave the data center. How would it leave? It would leave on the commercial fiber, the pipes," he said.

The telco went on to sign more than $10 billion in contracts with hyperscale cloud providers, and the debt has rebounded to face value, Goodwin said.

Diameter Capital also made "a big bet" on a satellite company tied to the wireless spectrum — a wager that later paid off after the company sold spectrum assets and the debt returned to face value.

Goodwin's comments come amid growing debate over whether sky-high AI valuations are sustainable and whether investors are overlooking other opportunities tied to the technology.

Risks and rewards

Goodwin warned that parts of the AI-credit boom may be taking on risk that's hard to price, especially in chip finance.

Some investors, he said, are taking on "residual risk," or the riskiest slice of chip-financing deals — betting on what the hardware might be worth years from now. Cutting-edge firms refresh their technology often, so chips can quickly become outdated for some customers.

"We call up really smart people in Silicon Valley, we call up really smart people at Big Tech companies and ask them what the residual value is on these chips three, four, five, six, seven years forward," he said. "None of them have a clue."

Goodwin said the next phase isn't just about spending on infrastructure — it's about competitive disruption rather than capital expenditure.

"Who are the companies, who are the entities that are going to adopt AI and take a step forward versus their peers? And who are going to be the losers?" he asked.

"That is actually a longer cycle than the capex cycle, so that's really interesting," he said.

The company has built a stable technology foundation and customer base through large-scale deployments across the financial services, public sector, and telecommunications industries. When integrated with K Wave Media’s global entertainment platforms, Hansol Inticube’s AI and data capabilities are expected to drive significant innovation in customer experience, fan engagement, and IP monetization within the content and entertainment industry.

For the first nine months of 2025, Hansol Inticube reported KRW 51 billion (approximately USD $35 million) in revenue, which K Wave Media expects will meaningfully contribute to its consolidated financial performance and support its goal of doubling its revenue in 2026 following the transaction’s completion.

K Wave Media’s wholly owned subsidiary, Play Company, has executed a wide range of projects across the domestic and international entertainment markets over the past decade. Leveraging its proven track record in artist IP management, global K-pop and K-content production and distribution, and large-scale retail collaborations, K Wave Media plans to develop new content-centric AI service models and interactive communication platforms as part of the post-acquisition integration strategy.

Ted Kim, Chief Executive Officer of K Wave Media, commented:

“Play Company has built a strong record of commercial success in global markets such as Southeast Asia, the United States, and Japan, extending well beyond the Korean entertainment industry. By combining this practical experience and IP-driven business model with Hansol Inticube’s advanced technological capabilities, we believe K Wave Media can evolve into a new type of global platform company centered on enhanced customer experience.”

Mr. Kim added:

“This acquisition is more than a business combination, it is a strategic steppingstone to accelerate the digital transformation and global expansion of the K-culture industry. We anticipate meaningful synergies across new business areas, including AI-powered fan communities, customer-specific data analytics, and IP-based commerce monetization. We also expect this transaction to support K Wave Media’s return to profitability in 2026 and mark our full transition into an EnterTech company.”

Following the completion of the transaction, K Wave Media plans to expand its business scope to include AI solutions, fandom-based community platforms, chatbot applications, IP monetization, data-driven content distribution, and related services, further strengthening the global competitiveness and technology-driven value chain of the K-culture ecosystem.

[TITLE]Data centre certification push to be tailored to make it AI ready:
[TEXT]
The government is in favour of tweaking the certification framework it has been developing for data centres to suit the emerging requirement of facilities catering to the massive computational demands of artificial intelligence, officials told ET.The development takes place amid a booming investment cycle for data centres in India.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology ( MeitY ) is working on establishing national standards for operations and maintenance of AI data centres , which have vastly different requirements than traditional data centres. These facilities require five times higher power and 10 times more water, according to industry estimates. Also, the floor should support 20 times more weight per unit area than that of other data centres.The Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification Directorate under MeitY had been working on establishing standards for data centre operations and maintenance, an official said. "But the advent of AI-data centres has changed the physical metrics and security risks of these facilities. To accommodate these, consultations have been held with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Telecommunication Engineering Council and other central agencies." The industry is also seeking specific operational guidelines, he added."The government can implement a Make in India mandate for something as critical to national security as data centres. We would be open to guidelines that ensure there is optimal use of indigenous technology. We would also welcome a move by the government to prioritise operators who are using more renewable energy," an executive at a Mumbai-based data centre operator said, also on condition of anonymity.Some other industry insiders who took part in the latest consultations said while hyperscalers have their own playbook for setting up data centres, other players would benefit from fixed standards."In terms of security norms, there needs to be provisions for better protecting fibre lines connected to data centres. The facilities are connected systems, massively using Internet of Things allowing remote monitoring and operation of equipment. How we stop bad actors from accessing these is also an important question," an executive said."Given the changing technology of AI data centres, the certification guidelines may also be incorporated into an updated national data centre policy ," the first official said. Released back in November, 2020, the draft national policy is yet to be implemented.Until 2024, India received $60 billion in data centre investments, according to global commercial real estate advisory firm CBRE.

Moynihan said this while sharing that Bank of America expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.4% in 2026, up from 2% this year, Bloomberg reported Monday.

“AI is kicking in more and more, and so it’s not all attributable to AI, but that’s having a marginal impact that’s pretty strong,” Moynihan said, per the report.

The Bank of America Institute said in October that AI was fueling American economic growth, though its effect on employment was limited.

AI-related capital expenditures, especially in software and computing, were key drivers of GDP growth, the institute said in a report.

“After a slight decline in Q1, GDP growth rebounded in Q2 with 3.8% for an annualized rate of 1.6% in 1H,” the report said. “One major reason for the resiliency in growth to date is the investment being poured into technology- and AI-related categories.”

The report added that there was little sign that AI was causing steep job losses, contrary to the fears of some observers that such losses could occur.

Moynihan said in November that Bank of America has embedded AI in its day-to-day operations and that the technology is helping the bank personalize client experiences, streamline capabilities, identify new opportunities and make efficiency gains across underwriting, audit, legal and finance functions.

Speaking during the bank’s Nov. 5 investor day, Moynihan added that the bank’s virtual assistant Erica had handled 3 billion customer interactions since its launch and was allowing customers to manage their finances around the clock.

During his Monday interview with Bloomberg Television, Moynihan said that the number of questions that Erica can answer has increased from 200 to 800.

“We’ll be applying more and more of automated intelligence — or augmented intelligence, as we call it, with a person using AI, using that to be more effective — and that’ll affect all the businesses,” Moynihan said, per the report.

[TITLE]New York Times reporter sues Google, xAI, OpenAI over chatbot training:
[TEXT]
Dec ‌22 : An investigative reporter best known for exposing fraud at Silicon Valley blood-testing startup Theranos sued Elon Musk's xAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta Platforms and Perplexity on Monday for using copyrighted books without permission to train their artificial intelligence systems.

New York Times reporter and "Bad Blood" author John Carreyrou filed the lawsuit in California federal court with five other writers, accusing the AI companies of pirating their books and feeding them into the large ‌language models (LLMs) that power the companies' chatbots.

The lawsuit is one ‌of several copyright cases brought by authors and other copyright owners against tech companies over the use of their work in AI training. The case is the first to name xAI as a defendant.

A spokesperson for Perplexity said that the company "doesn't index books." Spokespeople for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.

Unlike other pending cases, the ‍writers are not seeking to band together in a larger class action - a type of lawsuit they said favors defendants by allowing them to negotiate a single settlement with many plaintiffs.

"LLM companies should not be able to so easily extinguish thousands upon thousands of high-value claims at bargain-basement rates," ​the complaint said.

Anthropic reached the first ‌major settlement in an AI-training copyright dispute in August, agreeing to pay $1.5 billion to a class of authors who said the company pirated millions of books. The ​new lawsuit said class members in that case will receive "a tiny fraction (just 2 per cent) of the Copyright Act’s ⁠statutory ceiling of $150,000" per infringed work.

Monday's complaint ‌was filed by attorneys at law firm Freedman Normand Friedland including Kyle Roche, whom Carreyrou ​profiled in a 2023 New York Times article.

During a November hearing in the Anthropic class action, U.S. District Judge William Alsup criticized a separate law firm Roche ‍co-founded for gathering authors to opt out of the settlement in search of "a sweeter deal." Roche ⁠declined to comment on Monday.

Carreyrou told the judge at a later hearing that stealing books to build its ​AI was Anthropic's "original sin" and ‌that the settlement did not go far enough.
