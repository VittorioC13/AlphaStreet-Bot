[TITLE]Verb Technology Company (Nasdaq: VERB) Successfully Closes $558 Million Private Placement to Launch First Publicly Listed TON Treasury Strategy Company, in Partnership with Kingsway Capital:
[TEXT]
LAS VEGAS, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verb Technology Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: VERB) (“the Company”), today announced the successful closing of its previously announced upsized and oversubscribed $558 million private placement (“PIPE transaction”), in partnership with Kingsway Capital (“Kingsway”). The completion of the PIPE transaction marks a critical milestone in the Company’s plans to become the first and largest publicly traded treasury reserve of Toncoin ($TON). $TON is the native cryptocurrency of TON blockchain, the blockchain integrated with Telegram, one of the world's most widely used messaging platforms.

The PIPE transaction, which priced approximately 58.7 million shares of common stock, included participation from over 110 institutional and crypto-native investors, led by Kingsway and anchored by Vy Capital, Blockchain.com, Ribbit Capital, and Graticule (GAMA). Additional investors include CMCC Global, Pantera, MEXC Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Luxor Capital, Arrington Capital, Animoca, Kraken, Primitive Ventures, BitGo, FalconX, Orbs Group, The Open Platform (TOP), TVM Ventures, Kenetic, Hivemind Capital, UNCAP, Pacific Coast Venture Partners, and several high-profile crypto founders like Guy Young, Founder of Ethena Labs.

“As the exclusive blockchain infrastructure powering Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem, we believe in the utility and potential growth in adoption of Toncoin,” said Manuel Stotz, incoming Executive Chairman. “With today’s completed placement and the backing of an exceptional list of investors, we are building a next-generation treasury platform to define a new category of digital asset reserves.”

Company Strategy

The Company plans to immediately begin using the majority of the net proceeds from the PIPE transaction to acquire $TON, which will serve as its primary treasury reserve asset. The strategy is expected to generate sustainable staking rewards to initiate, manage, and grow the Company’s $TON exposure in a cash flow positive manner. The Company intends to rebrand as TON Strategy Co. (“TSC”) to reflect its new direction. In addition, the Company will continue to operate its existing business units, each of which leverages its social commerce technology and video marketing expertise, which are expected to expand.

Company Leadership and Special Advisor

As previously announced, the Company will be led by a deeply experienced team driving its digital asset strategy:

[TITLE]Software firm MeridianLink to go private in $2 billion deal with Centerbridge:
[TEXT]
U.S. financial software provider MeridianLink said on Monday it would be acquired by investment firm Centerbridge Partners in a $2 billion deal, taking it private roughly four years after its New York debut.

Optimism around potential rate cuts and easing economic uncertainty amid progress on trade deals have laid the groundwork for a pickup in private-equity buyouts. Dealmaking appetite for software businesses has also remained robust this year.

MeridianLink shareholders will receive $20 apiece in cash for each share held, implying a 26 per cent premium to the stock's last close. Shares of the Irvine, California-based company, which powers digital lending and account opening for financial institutions, jumped 24 per cent in afternoon trading.

"Industry consolidation has been a key theme in fintech and we view the multiple as reasonable," said William Blair analyst Cristopher Kennedy.

"We have long held the belief that MerdianLink would represent an attractive asset as the company generates strong EBITDA margins at around 40 per cent."

The deal also highlights the growing trend of money managers seeking strategic control of technology companies driving digital transformation in financial services.

Centerbridge is also not new to the fintech space, having acquired bank tech firm CSI in a $1.6 billion deal in 2022.

"As the pace of change across the finance and tech sectors continues to accelerate, MeridianLink is uniquely positioned to help financial institutions enhance their digital lending and credit reporting capabilities," said Centerbridge's Jared Hendricks and Ben Jaffe.

Founded in 1998, MeridianLink caters to nearly 2,000 community financial institutions and reporting agencies. Its revenue rose 8 per cent to $84.6 million during the three months ended June 30, while net loss narrowed to $3 million.

Centerview Partners and J.P. Morgan are advisers to MeridianLink on the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Goldman Sachs is advising Centerbridge.

[TITLE]4 M&A trends keeping bankers busy this summer: JPMorgan:
[TEXT]

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Pie chart JPMorgan

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.

[TITLE]Satellite in the backpack: Indian armed forces look to partner with satcom firms:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: India is looking to give its defence forces a competitive edge in modern warfare and security through state-of-the-art satellite communications (satcom) in partnership with the private sector, four people with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The move will also open up new business vistas for satcom providers, which are yet to commence operations in the country. The department of telecommunications (DoT) is expected to conduct spectrum allocation sometime soon.

Multiple trials have been conducted by the Indian Army, Air Force and Navy with private satcom providers such as OneWeb and Jio-SES over the past two years, the people cited above said.

Trials with OneWeb, which is backed by Airtel’s parent firm Bharti Enterprises, have offered low-latency, satellite-based network connectivity with military-grade encryption on multiple occasions. Jio-SES, the second Indian satcom service provider with a licence from the DoT, has also held more than two defence-sector trials, two of the people cited above said.

Also Read | India's satcom vs telecom fight just refuses to die

The trials were conducted during the India-Vietnam joint military exercise in November last year, and Operation Brahma in Myanmar in April, among other occasions. The idea behind the trials is to see how old satellite communications standards can be overhauled for the armed forces, these people added.

The Centre’s move would see the gradual replacement of older, large very small aperture terminal (VSAT) receivers, which connect with Indian Space Research Organisation’s (Isro’s) geosynchronous earth orbit (Geo) satellites. Such receivers are typically bulky and need specialized transport, and their connectivity is also slow.

OneWeb and Jio-SES offer portable satcom terminals that are small enough to come in a backpack. They also deliver faster network connectivity that is critical for remote drones and other tech-heavy defence equipment in distant areas, by using low-earth orbit (Leo) satellites.

India is also exploring other global players. One of the people mentioned above – a senior government official speaking on condition of not being named – said initial talks have been held with Elon Musk-owned Starlink on how it can offer a massive satellite network for the defence forces while maintaining the necessary security protocols and silos that the technology will require.

Also Read | OneWeb seeks more time to meet satcom security norms as spectrum nears

Notably, Starlink has not installed its gateways and equipment in the country so far, and is yet to conduct network trials and acquire security clearance from New Delhi.

Emails sent to the DoT, ministry of defence, Airtel, Jio and Starlink did not receive responses until press time.

New business opportunity

“Defence, maritime and border security will be key focus segments for enterprise satellite communication providers in India," said Shivaji Chatterjee, chief executive and managing director of Hughes Communications India, which is a partner to Bharti's OneWeb that offers both Geo and Leo satellite services.

“Multiple trials have already taken place to evaluate the potential of some of our latest offerings, such as OneWeb, in these strategic sectors," Chatterjee added. “Other upcoming Leo offerings are also considered promising for rural broadband because of their extensive capacity enabled by large satellite constellations."

Anil Kumar Bhatt, director general of space industry body, Indian Space Association (ISpA), said satcom services for Indian defence forces have so far been used as a backup to terrestrial and radio communications, even in remote terrain.

“Now, new-age infrastructure and modernization mean that India’s defence forces need low-latency Leo satellite networks to make the most of cutting-edge technologies—and also to support operations far beyond Indian borders," Bhatt said.

A second senior official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the government sees these satcom services as a way to enhance connectivity in the country. “Even as there are use cases for the government and defence-related activities, these companies will be allowed to serve those sectors only after ensuring that national security norms are not compromised," this official said.

One of the officials cited above added that a use case that has been explored includes “providing small, durable and lightweight user terminals that can be carried by army personnel or installed on crewed and uncrewed vehicles—thus helping support communication, command, surveillance, and intelligence needs in fixed locations and on the move".

In September 2023, a report by The Times of India said that India’s defence forces had pilot-tested the use of suitcase-borne satcom terminals as part of modernized defence-grade satcom networks.

Chaitanya Giri, space fellow at global think-tank Observer Research Foundation, said that Starlink is “unlikely to get any imminent defence contract owing to the global geopolitics and the company catering to nations with which India might not be on the best of terms".

While agreeing that India needs to overhaul and modernise satcom in defence arms, Giri said, “But to do so, geostationary satellites that offer huge bandwidth of data and can be indigenized and concentrated on a solitary area could offer far greater security and faster network connectivity for defence applications. Companies would be encouraged if defence contracts included indigenization contracts—which would be critical for both ground-station and satellite infrastructure involved in defence."

ISpA’s Bhatt, a retired military secretary and lieutenant general of the Indian Army, further added that India will need to evaluate if the defence forces need their own Leo satellite constellation made indigenously, or acquire bandwidth from existing operators. “Based on this, they would then take measures to make the satcom networks more secure," he said.

Globally, too, instances of satcom service revamp are increasing. This June, Eutelsat, the global holding firm of Bharti’s OneWeb, signed a 10-year agreement with France’s ministry of the armed forces. The deal, worth up to €1 billion, sought to integrate military and civilian satellite resources for Europe to have secure space communications.

Eutelsat also has a deal with the UK to provide high-speed, low-latency connectivity for the country’s embassies, high commissions and consulates—as well as broader UK government activities globally.

[TITLE]AI Data Centers Are Massive, Energy-Hungry and Headed Your Way:
[TEXT]
From the outside, this nondescript building in Piscataway, New Jersey, looks like a standard corporate office surrounded by lookalike buildings. Even when I walk through the second set of double doors with a visitor badge slung around my neck, it still feels like I'll soon find cubicles, water coolers and light office chatter.

Instead, it's one brightly lit server hall after another, each with slightly different characteristics, but all with one thing in common — a constant humming of power.

The first area I see has white tiled floors and rows of 7-foot-high server racks protected by black metal cages. Inside the cage structure, I feel cool air rushing from the floor toward the servers to prevent overheating. The wind muffles my tour guide's voice, and I have to shout over the noise for him to hear me.

Outside the structure, it's quieter, but there's still a white noise that reminds me of the whooshing parents used to get newborn babies to sleep. On the back of the servers, I see hundreds of cords connected — blue, red, black, yellow, orange, green. In a distant server, green lights are flashing. These machines, dozens of them, are gobbling electricity. In all, this building can support up to 3 megawatts of power.

This is a data center. Facilities like it are increasingly common across the US, sheltering the machinery that makes our online lives not only possible, but nearly seamless. Data centers host our photos and videos, stream our Netflix shows, handle financial transactions, and so much more. The one I'm visiting, owned by a company called DataBank, is modest in scope. The ones coming in one after another to suburban communities and former farmlands across the US, riding the tidal wave of artificial intelligence's swift advances, are monstrous.

It's a building boom based on generative AI. In late 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, and within two months, it had approximately 100 million users and had spurred a frantic scramble among the biggest tech companies and a host of newborn startups. Now, it has nearly 700 million active users each week and 5 million paying business users. We are inundated with chatbots, image generators and speculation

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.
