[TITLE]Brent Hits $67 After Primorsk Strike:
[TEXT]
Oil prices jumped as Washington is now pushing for secondary sanctions on India and China.

12th September, 2025

The Russia-Ukraine war is back on the agenda as ICE Brent futures jumped up to $67 per barrel after Ukrainian drones attacked Russia’s Primorsk port, a key Baltic Sea loading terminal for its crude and product flows. With the Trump administration strengthening its pressure on the EU and others to implement secondary sanctions on India and China, geopolitics became the main bullish factor for prices.

IEA Sees Supply Surge on OPEC+ Boost. The International Energy Agency lifted its 2025 global demand growth forecast by 60,000 b/d to 740,000 b/d, however, this was more than offset by its supply outlook rising from 2.5 million b/d to 2.7 million b/d after this week's 137,000 b/d hike from OPEC+.

India Taps Myanmar Rebels for Rare Earths. According to media reports, India's Ministry of Mines asked state-owned companies to obtain rare earths from Myanmar, taking samples from territory held by the separatist Kachin Independent Army after China introduced export curbs.

Iran Agrees to Resume Nuclear Inspections. Iran and the UN's nuclear agency IAEA confirmed they had agreed to resume monitoring at all nuclear sites across the country, including the ones attacked by Israel and the US in June, ahead of a September 27 deadline set out by the EU.

Russia to Start Sending Gas to Iran. Russia's gas giant Gazprom will start supplying Iran with natural gas within a 'few weeks’, according to Iranian authorities, first at a rate of 2 bcm per year but potentially increasing to 55 bcm per year, if Moscow and Tehran agree to build a new pipeline.

Sudan's Oil Industry Spirals Down the Drain. Sudan's only refinery, the 100,000 b/d Khartoum plant, was debilitated again after it was struck by a wave of drone strikes this week, probably triggering an aggravation of fuel shortages across the country as the refinery met 70% of its needs.

Saudi Aramco Keeps on Borrowing More. Saudi national oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) raised $3 billion from a sale of Islamic bonds at a profit rate between 4.125% and 4.625%, using the raised funds for general corporate purposes, according to the offering's term sheet.

Phillips66 Doesn't Give Up on US Refining. Despite closing its Los Angeles refinery this month, US downstream major Phillips66 (NYSE:PSX) agreed to buy the remaining 50% stake in its WRB Refining joint venture with Cenovus Energy for $1.4 billion, taking full control of the Wood River, IL and Borger, TX refineries.

EU Mulls Its Options vis-a-vis Russian Major. France and Germany want to sanction Russia's largest private oil firm Lukoil and its Swiss trading arm Litasco as part of Brussels' 19th sanctions package against Russia, potentially disrupting refinery supply in Bulgaria, Romania, and the Netherlands.

Japan Inks Controversial Alaska LNG Deal. Japan's largest power generator JERA has signed a 20-year term LNG supply agreement with US energy developer Glenferne for gas from the $44 billion Alaska LNG project, despite concerns about the project's exorbitant capital costs.

US Nudges Europe to Expedite Russian Gas Cut. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the European Union could phase out Russian gas within the next 6 to 12 months, even if Hungary and Slovakia have so far rejected calls for a quicker regulated end to remaining flows.

Beijing Cracks Down on Teapots Tax Evasion. China's Ministry of Commerce introduced new rules for independent refiners across the country, forcing them to scrap paper tax Ledgers and report purchases, sales and inventories of products online, further jeopardizing runs that are already at historic lows of 47-48%.

Canada Wants to Fast-Track New LNG. Canada's new Carney government has proposed fast-tracking key LNG, nuclear and mining projects, singling out Phase 2 of the $32 billion LNG Canada project that could add an additional 14 mtpa of liquefaction capacity and become the second-largest LNG plant globally.

Lithium Prices Collapse on CATL Mine Restart. Chinese lithium carbonate futures have plunged to ¥70,000 per metric tonne ($9,900/mt) this week, marking a more than 5% weekly drop, on news that China's largest battery maker CATL could restart its Jianxiawo mine earlier than expected.

Activist Investors Haunt Japanese Power Generators. Activist investor Elliott Management stated that Japan's top nuclear power operator Kansai Electric (TYO:9503) could become a better long-term investment if it starts to shed non-core assets, with the US firm amassing a 4% to 5% stake in it.

[TITLE]Israel’s Qatar Strike Upends Gulf Assumptions on Sovereignty:
[TEXT]
An Israeli strike on Hamas targets in Doha, Qatar, this week, resounded rather loudly. Several Hamas members were killed in the strike during a meeting on a ceasefire proposal. Doha called it a violation of sovereignty; Netanyahu warned of further action unless Hamas leaders are expelled. Washington has used a few tough words, but is avoiding directly censuring Israel. Qatar’s hosting of Hamas has always been tolerated by its neighbors as part of Doha’s broader opportunism. The strike shatters the assumption that Gulf capitals are immune to direct targeting. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have no interest in defending Hamas, but neither do they want a precedent where a regional state carries out airstrikes in another Gulf capital without consequence. Egypt will use this chance to argue that its mediation channel is the only credible one. Washington, meanwhile, is desperately hoping no other Gulf states could be targeted, as Israel leapfrogs over the U.S. in terms of who is apparently in control here. U.S. equities in Qatar are rather too weighty (Al Udeid base, LNG contracting with U.S. majors, portfolio investments) to risk escalation.

Politics, Geopolitics & Conflict

An Israeli strike on Hamas targets in Doha, Qatar, this week, resounded rather loudly. Several Hamas members were killed in the strike during a meeting on a ceasefire proposal. Doha called it a violation of sovereignty; Netanyahu warned of further action unless Hamas leaders are expelled. Washington has used a few tough words, but is avoiding directly censuring Israel. Qatar’s hosting of Hamas has always been tolerated by its neighbors as part of Doha’s broader opportunism. The strike shatters the assumption that Gulf capitals are immune to direct targeting. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have no interest in defending Hamas, but neither do they want a precedent where a regional state carries out airstrikes in another Gulf capital without consequence. Egypt will use this chance to argue that its mediation channel is the only credible one. Washington, meanwhile, is desperately hoping no other Gulf states could be targeted, as Israel leapfrogs over the U.S. in terms of who is apparently in control here. U.S. equities in Qatar are rather too weighty (Al Udeid base, LNG contracting with U.S. majors, portfolio investments) to risk escalation. At the same time, Washington is unlikely to force Qatar to expel Hamas leadership entirely, as Doha remains a necessary conduit for hostage and ceasefire talks. For energy, the North Field expansion is still proceeding toward 126 mtpa by 2027, with trains already financed and contractors committed. The risk is more in the realm of perception: insurers, banks, and buyers may begin to build a sovereignty-breach premium into contracts. Watch for whether the Saudis or Emiratis lean toward treating the strike as an aberration or as a tolerated precedent. If they quietly normalize it, markets may read Doha as more exposed. If they close ranks around Qatar’s sovereignty, that reassures investors that the strike was a one-off shock. By Friday morning, Qatar was kicking the diplomatic posturing into overdrive. It’s a delicate balancing act. Doha’s posture has to be precisely calibrated. The foreign ministry denounced the strike as “state terrorism” and vowed legal action. Doha is explicitly putting itself in damage-control mode, trying to preserve its mediation legitimacy while positioning Israel as the aggressor. Qatar needs to show its domestic and regional audience that it will not be cowed, but it also cannot abandon the one role that keeps Washington and European capitals invested in its utility. Doha’s narrative is that hosting Hamas was always transparent and coordinated with the U.S. and Israel, shifting blame back onto Netanyahu. The calculation is to rally Gulf and Arab partners around sovereignty while reminding Washington that undermining Qatar also undermines hostage and ceasefire channels.

Adani Ports, which controls India’s largest private port network, has now barred any vessel under U.S., EU, or UK sanctions from calling at its facilities. Agents must certify that ships are clean of designations before berthing. Mundra, Adani’s flagship port, is a key entry point for Russian crude handled by IOC and HPCL-Mittal; those flows will now face new friction. Refiners can reroute via non-Adani ports or source non-designated tonnage, but costs will rise and scheduling will tighten. The move is significant because India’s formal policy has been to ignore unilateral Western sanctions and only respect UN mandates. A private operator is effectively tightening compliance on its own, underlining the liability calculus of global finance and insurers. Washington will interpret this as success based on Trump’s pressure. Moscow will see another crack in India’s ability to shield its imports. For India’s refiners, the adjustment is immediate: higher freight and insurance premiums, more reliance on gray-fleet tonnage, and the risk of cargo delays. Longer term, it marginally weakens Russia’s grip on India’s oil basket and nudges refiners to keep Middle East and African barrels in reserve.

Discovery & Development

Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) struck oil again in the Potwar region, chalking up its second big find in the Dhok Sultan Block, District Attock. The Dhok Sultan-03 well, spudded in January and drilled to 5,815m, is the second deepest oil strike in fractured carbonate formations in the area. Initial tests showed strong flows — 1,469 bpd oil and 2.56 mmscfd gas on a tighter choke, rising to 2,113 bpd and 4.13 mmscfd on a wider one. PPL holds 75% in the block with Government Holdings (Pvt) Ltd (GHPL) at 25%, calling the discovery a major milestone for both partners.

Shell has cut a farm-out deal offshore São Tomé & Príncipe, handing Petrobras big stakes in frontier ultra-deepwater Blocks 10, 11, and 13 while keeping 40% and operatorship. ANP-STP retains 15% across the blocks, with Galp holding 20% in Block 11. The acreage sits in the Gulf of Guinea, an emerging “elephant play” zone that’s drawing major attention despite its frontier risk. Petrobras sees the move as a way to rebuild reserves and diversify, while Shell trims exposure but stays in control of a potentially giant prize.

[TITLE]The Global Green Hydrogen Industry Moves On, US or No US:
[TEXT]
Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe

Napping, heck! The US government has gone practically comatose on the topic of decarbonization, beginning with the inauguration of US President Donald Trump on January 20 and leading right on up to today. So much for American Energy Dominance. Meanwhile, other nations have taken up the task of weaning the world off fossil fuels, one recent example being a new green hydrogen hookup between the Estonian startup Stargate Hydrogen and the government of Saudi Arabia.

Oil & Gas Producers Love Green Hydrogen

The newly announced green hydrogen partnership engages Stargate’s electrolyzer system with the Research, Development, and Innovation Authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It may seem odd for an oil and natural gas-soaked nation like Saudi Arabia to pursue alternative hydrogen pathways such as that offered by Stargate. Instead of squeezing hydrogen from natural gas, electrolyzers push hydrogen from water. Ideally, electricity to run the system comes from renewable resources, further cutting fossil fuels out of the picture.

Still, some oil and gas stakeholders have been pivoting into wind and solar energy as well as geothermal energy, so it’s no surprise to see green hydrogen in the mix. Consider these emerging trends in recent years:

— China is also leveraging the green hydrogen field to form new economic partnerships, including with hydrogen stakeholders in Europe.

— Both China and Saudi Arabia have begun to exploit their copious wind and solar resources, which can be deployed to run electrolyzer systems.

— Saudi Arabia is finally beginning to support a domestic battery-electric vehicle manufacturing industry and it is planning to upsize its hydrogen fuel cell vehicle profile, too.

— And, green hydrogen can replace gas-sourced hydrogen in industrial operations, including oil refining, providing oil refiners to claim a modicum of decarbonization, although greenwashing is a probably a more accurate description (looking at you, ExxonMobil).

The Stargate — RDI Green Hydrogen Deal

One need look no farther than ExxonMobil to explain why oil refiners and producers are pursuing green hydrogen. They can use green hydrogen in the refining process to burnish their sustainability image, such as it is. Another example is the Corporate Venture arm of the diversified Spanish energy firm Repsol, which nailed down a minority stake in Stargate earlier this year.

Saudi Arabia has expressed a more expansive decarbonization strategy, including an early focus on nuclear energy as an exportable technology. More recently, Saudi Arabia has been eyeballing new opportunities to export green hydrogen to Europe, leveraging its wind and solar resources.

The new Memorandum of Understanding between Stargate and RDI builds on that goal, with the aim of establishing Saudi Arabia as a leading producer and exporter of green hydrogen “This strategic partnership marks a significant milestone in advancing Saudi Arabia’s position as a global hub for green hydrogen and deep-tech innovation, aligning with the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, a long-term national transformation plan announced in 2016, designed to diversify the economy and build a globally competitive society,” Stargate explains.

“Both parties will also explore opportunities to strengthen the regional hydrogen value chain, drive industrial decarbonization, and position Saudi Arabia as a global hub for sustainable energy technologies,” Stargate adds, noting that support for local innovation is part of the plan alongside technology transfer, including research partnerships with KAUST and other institutions.

Along with Saudi Arabia’s intention to support domestic EV manufacturing, the new MOU also calls for Stargate to support a domestic electrolyzer fabrication industry in Saudi Arabia.

All Is Not Lost For US Hydrogen Stakeholders

The green hydrogen connection is also of apiece with Saudi Arabia’s plan to add hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles to its zero emission mobility profile. That could be a lifeline for FCEV manufacturers in the US, who were struggling to find a market even before this year’s abrupt shift in federal energy policy.

In May, the Arizona-based high performance motor vehicle firm RONN Motor Group announced that it is setting up shop in Riyadh under a three-year, $4 billion auto manufacturing agreement. The centerpiece of the venture consists of two factories that are expected to produce 10,000 hydrogen-electric logistics trucks.

That part of the program is consistent with the prevailing consensus on FCEV marketability. Battery-powered EVs have the edge in light-duty fleets, but FCEVs can offer a drop-in alternative for truck fleets.

RONN also anticipates edging into the high (very high) end consumer market. The new venture calls for 1,000 RONN Phoenix fuel cell sport vehicles to be manufactured in Saudi Arabia, which just goes to show that persistence pays off. RONN surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar back in 2020, when the company launched its MYST fuel cell supercar and indicated that plans were in the works for a fuel cell SUV inspired by the company’s Scorpion hydrogen-fueled ICE vehicle.

“The ‘PHOENIX’ is our second-generation supercar based on our original flagship eco-exotic design ‘SCORPION,” RONN explains.

“This zero-emission, Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (HFCEV) will feature hydrogen fuel cell/battery propulsion with an all-electric drive for stellar performance. PHOENIX is estimated to have a 400+ mile driving range with sleek, futuristic architecture, intuitive design, and exceptional performance,” the company adds.

The Green Hydrogen Dream Lives On, Elsewhere

RONN is also looking forward to showing off a limited (very limited) single-edition fuel cell hypercar to be produced in Saudi Arabia for one lucky client. No word yet on who the client is or what the new Halo Hypercar will look like, but RONN anticipates that the vehicle will serve as a technology transfer platform in accord with Saudi Arabia’s workforce development plans. “Initial engineering will be executed in the U.S., with training programs designed to upskill Saudi-based engineers,” RONN notes.

Meanwhile, other hydrogen-based businesses here in the US are also following the money to green hydrogen markets outside of the US. Another recent example is the Massachusetts electrolyzer manufacturing startup Electric Hydrogen. Last week the firm announced that it is leveling up its business plan with the acquisition of the hydrogen project developer Ambient Fuels.

Electric Hydrogen hasn’t quite given up on the US green hydrogen market yet, but it is on the prowl for business overseas. The Ambient Fuels acquisition also puts the investment firm Generate Capital into the Electric Fuels camp along with up to $400 million in financing for hydrogen projects around the world.

“Rising demand for clean hydrogen in both the US and EU is accelerating the already fast-growing market for US technology,” Electric Hydrogen says of its electrolyzers. That may be somewhat overly optimistic as applied to the US market, but keep an eye on New York State, where Stony Brook University has just received a grant of almost $5 million to test an onsite electrolyzer system to produce green hydrogen for use at a health care facility.

The onsite angle cuts the cost of green hydrogen by practically eliminating transportation costs and trimming down storage costs, with the help of a new solid-state storage system that traps green hydrogen in an expanding-contracting adsorbent without the need for extreme pressure or temperature.

[TITLE]World emissions hit record high, but the EU leads trend reversal:
[TEXT]
The report “GHG emissions of all world countries” presents trends from 1990 to 2024, together with emissions and removals from LULUCF and wildfires.

Human activities worldwide in 2024 sent a record 53.2 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions to the atmosphere, without counting emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF).

It is a 1.3% rise compared to the previous year (665Mt CO2eq - roughly the amount emitted by Germany in 2024), according to the latest data from the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR).

Over the same period, the EU’s GHG emissions, excluding LULUCF, shrank by 1.8%, that is by close to 60 Mt CO2 eq. GHG emissions from China and the US remained relatively stable.

EDGAR findings are published in the JRC report “GHG emissions of all world countries” compiled in cooperation with the International Energy Agency (IEA). The report presents trends from 1990 to 2024, together with emissions and removals from LULUCF and wildfires. It provides a factsheet for all the countries in the world and the EU, including sector-specific trends and trends per capita and GDP.

Human-made emissions over time around the globe

The EDGAR report shows that global GHG emissions from anthropogenic activities have increased by nearly 1.5% annually on average since 1990, and as a result are 65% higher in 2024 than in 1990.

In 2024, the eight highest emitting economies - China, USA, India, EU, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil and Japan - collectively contributed to 66.2% of global GHG emissions. Only the European Union and Japan decreased their emissions compared to the previous year (-1.8% and -2.8% respectively), while all others either kept them rather stable (China: +0.8%; USA: +0.4%; Brazil +0.2%) or increased them (India: +3.9%; Russia: +2.4%, Indonesia: +5% - the highest relative increase).

In absolute terms, India has the largest increase with 164.8 Mt CO2eq more emissions released in 2024 compared to 2023.

Nevertheless, all major emitters reduced their emission intensity in terms of GHG emissions per unit of GDP.

The EU has continued its decades-long decreasing trend of GHG emissions, briefly interrupted only in 2021 by the post-COVID rebound. On a longer perspective, data for the EU show the most significant percentage decrease of GHG among the top emitting economies since 1990, while GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) grew steadily in the same period.

Beyond the EU, other major economies also show signs of decoupling emissions from economic growth. While GDP PPP has grown strongly in all regions since 1990, the pace of emissions growth has been lower, leading to declining emission intensity.

The USA, Russia and Japan have gone further, achieving absolute decoupling: in 2024 their GDP PPP was significantly higher than in 1990, while their GHG emissions were lower.

By contrast, India and China experienced rapid GDP PPP growth accompanied by rising emissions, although at a slower rate than GDP PPP. These contrasting trajectories underline that while absolute decoupling remains challenging, it is already a reality in several major economies.

China, the US, India, the EU, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil and Japan were the eight largest GHG emitters in 2024, according to the report. Together they account for 54.6% of the global population, 68.3% of the global GDP PPP, 68.3% of the global primary energy consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and 66.2% of the global GHG emissions.

Only five of the 18 countries and regions that contribute more than 1% to the total global GHG emissions reduced their GHG emissions in 2024: the EU27, Japan, Mexico, Germany, and South Korea.

World GHG emissions by sector

According to the report, the power industry emissions showed the largest absolute increase (+235 Mt CO2eq or +1.5%) in 2024 as compared to 2023, whereas the fuel exploitation the largest relative increase (+1.6%). All other main economic activity sectors also increased their emissions or remained stable: industrial combustion and processes, buildings, transport, agriculture, and waste.

Text version The image displays Global GHG emission trends by sector (power industry, industrial combustion and processes, buildings, transport, fuel exploitation, agriculture, waste, all) and key years (2024 vs 1990, 2024 vs 2005, 2024 vs 2023)

The role of land use and forests

Atmospheric CO2 can accumulate as carbon in vegetation and soils, which act as sinks. Human activities have an impact on these sinks through the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector.

The EDGAR report provides estimates of GHG emissions from LULUCF: globally, this sector removed

[TITLE]World emissions hit record high, but the EU leads trend reversal:
[TEXT]
The report “GHG emissions of all world countries” presents trends from 1990 to 2024, together with emissions and removals from LULUCF and wildfires.

Human activities worldwide in 2024 sent a record 53.2 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions to the atmosphere, without counting emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF).

It is a 1.3% rise compared to the previous year (665Mt CO2eq - roughly the amount emitted by Germany in 2024), according to the latest data from the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR).

Over the same period, the EU’s GHG emissions, excluding LULUCF, shrank by 1.8%, that is by close to 60 Mt CO2 eq. GHG emissions from China and the US remained relatively stable.

EDGAR findings are published in the JRC report “GHG emissions of all world countries” compiled in cooperation with the International Energy Agency (IEA). The report presents trends from 1990 to 2024, together with emissions and removals from LULUCF and wildfires. It provides a factsheet for all the countries in the world and the EU, including sector-specific trends and trends per capita and GDP.

Human-made emissions over time around the globe

The EDGAR report shows that global GHG emissions from anthropogenic activities have increased by nearly 1.5% annually on average since 1990, and as a result are 65% higher in 2024 than in 1990.

In 2024, the eight highest emitting economies - China, USA, India, EU, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil and Japan - collectively contributed to 66.2% of global GHG emissions. Only the European Union and Japan decreased their emissions compared to the previous year (-1.8% and -2.8% respectively), while all others either kept them rather stable (China: +0.8%; USA: +0.4%; Brazil +0.2%) or increased them (India: +3.9%; Russia: +2.4%, Indonesia: +5% - the highest relative increase).

In absolute terms, India has the largest increase with 164.8 Mt CO2eq more emissions released in 2024 compared to 2023.

Nevertheless, all major emitters reduced their emission intensity in terms of GHG emissions per unit of GDP.

The EU has continued its decades-long decreasing trend of GHG emissions, briefly interrupted only in 2021 by the post-COVID rebound. On a longer perspective, data for the EU show the most significant percentage decrease of GHG among the top emitting economies since 1990, while GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) grew steadily in the same period.

Beyond the EU, other major economies also show signs of decoupling emissions from economic growth. While GDP PPP has grown strongly in all regions since 1990, the pace of emissions growth has been lower, leading to declining emission intensity.

The USA, Russia and Japan have gone further, achieving absolute decoupling: in 2024 their GDP PPP was significantly higher than in 1990, while their GHG emissions were lower.

By contrast, India and China experienced rapid GDP PPP growth accompanied by rising emissions, although at a slower rate than GDP PPP. These contrasting trajectories underline that while absolute decoupling remains challenging, it is already a reality in several major economies.

China, the US, India, the EU, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil and Japan were the eight largest GHG emitters in 2024, according to the report. Together they account for 54.6% of the global population, 68.3% of the global GDP PPP, 68.3% of the global primary energy consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and 66.2% of the global GHG emissions.

Only five of the 18 countries and regions that contribute more than 1% to the total global GHG emissions reduced their GHG emissions in 2024: the EU27, Japan, Mexico, Germany, and South Korea.

World GHG emissions by sector

According to the report, the power industry emissions showed the largest absolute increase (+235 Mt CO2eq or +1.5%) in 2024 as compared to 2023, whereas the fuel exploitation the largest relative increase (+1.6%). All other main economic activity sectors also increased their emissions or remained stable: industrial combustion and processes, buildings, transport, agriculture, and waste.

Text version The image displays Global GHG emission trends by sector (power industry, industrial combustion and processes, buildings, transport, fuel exploitation, agriculture, waste, all) and key years (2024 vs 1990, 2024 vs 2005, 2024 vs 2023)

The role of land use and forests

Atmospheric CO2 can accumulate as carbon in vegetation and soils, which act as sinks. Human activities have an impact on these sinks through the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector.

The EDGAR report provides estimates of GHG emissions from LULUCF: globally, this sector removed

[TITLE]It makes more sense to produce hydrogen with nuclear, not renewables * WorldNetDaily * by Ross Pomeroy, Real Clear Wire:
[TEXT]
Hydrogen is often thought to be linchpin of a future 100% renewable economy. To make up for wind and solar’s deal-breaking intermittency and to rid industry of energy-dense fossil fuels, the surplus cheap electricity that renewables produce during times of abundance would need to be channeled into electrolyzers that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could then be collected, stored, transported, and eventually combusted for on-demand energy.

But is this scenario really the most cost-effective and environmentally-friendly option? Would it make more sense, for instance, to produce hydrogen from another carbon-free source – nuclear power?

A trio of scientists in the Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering at the University of Pisa in Italy explored that question. Utilizing data from the International Atomic Energy Agency Hydrogen Economic Evaluation Programme, the group performed a feasibility assessment to compare various methods of producing hydrogen from futuristic Gen IV nuclear reactors. Their findings are published in the journal energies.

Two methods of producing hydrogen from nuclear power rose to the top. First, engineers could construct an attached electrolyzer system just like with renewable energy. Since a nuclear reactor is almost constantly running as “baseload” power, plant operators could simply divert power to the electrolyzers when grid demand wanes. The researchers estimate the cost of hydrogen with this setup would be 2.71 USD/kg with paltry carbon emissions of 0.3 kgCO2e/kgH2.

Second, the authors envisioned a system where futuristic Gen IV reactors operating at high temperatures (between 550 and 1000 °C) can produce hydrogen through the hot steam they emit. This high-temperature steam electrolysis is similar to how hydrogen is produced from steam reforming via natural gas. They predict costs here to be 3.57 USD/kg with slightly higher emissions of 0.8 kgCO2e/kgH2. Costs are higher because it a more novel system, even though it is “the most efficient coupling since it better exploits the electrical and thermal energy resources produced by the reactor,” the researchers write.

Costs and carbon emissions for both methods compare favorably with current costs of hydrogen produced from fossil fuels and renewables. In Europe in 2023, hydrogen made via methane reforming cost 3.76 EUR/kg (4.39 USD) and produced emissions of at least 11.6 kgCO2e/kgH2. Hydrogen made from a direct connection to renewables cost 6.61 EUR/kg (7.71 USD) with emissions similar to production from nuclear.

The researchers’ assessment is highly preliminary, of course. There’s only one commercial nuclear reactor in operation today that matches the reactor they modeled. It’s in China. Their cost estimates could also be overly rosy, and it’s likely that the cost to produce hydrogen with renewables will come down over time as solar panels grow more efficient.

The world currently produces 52.6 million tons of hydrogen per year, used mostly to make ammonia for fertilizer. The process of making this hydrogen accounts for two percent of the world’s total energy consumption and contributes roughly the same proportion of global carbon dioxide emissions. Even if hydrogen doesn’t find wider use in industry, transportation, and grid storage, we still need a lot of it to feed the world, preferably produced in a far cleaner manner than it is currently. Nuclear energy could provide it in abundance.

[TITLE]More than £1.1 billion investment to boost growth, jobs and skills in UK’s coastal towns and cities:
[TEXT]
government announces £448 million at London International Shipping Week to slash emissions from shipping, cementing the UK as a clean energy superpower and breaking down barriers to opportunity in coastal communities, as part of the Plan for Change

as a clean energy superpower and breaking down barriers to opportunity in coastal communities, as part of the Plan for Change comes as £700 million of private investment unveiled, which will turbocharge growth, innovation and jobs across the country

London International Shipping Week – a flagship event on the global maritime calendar – brings government and industry leaders together to power innovation, boost skills, create jobs and drive growth across the sector

Coastal communities across the UK are set to benefit from over £1.1 billion in joint government and industry investment for the maritime sector, which will unlock growth and jobs, including in the engineering, green technology and construction sectors.

Set to be announced on the first day (15 September 2025) of London International Shipping Week ( LISW ), the funding includes £700 million of private investment for major UK ports and leading industry players, as well as £448 million of public investment to reduce emissions from UK shipping.

The almost half a billion pounds will bolster the government’s UK SHORE programme, which supports the research and development of new clean maritime technologies and fuels, including electric, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, wind power and more.

Previous projects have included electric chargepoints at UK ports for vessels developed by Aqua Superpower and smart technology developed by Waterwhelm which can produce hydrogen from recycled wastewater to generate electricity. UK SHORE funding has already delivered £240 million to over 200 projects across the country, some of which are now in active use and have supported 750 jobs so far.

This new funding will be allocated to projects in due course.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, said:

Today’s £1.1 billion boost for the maritime industry will supercharge growth and jobs in our coastal towns and cities – making the UK one of the best places in the world to invest. We’re committing almost half a billion to cut carbon emissions from shipping – steering us towards net zero by 2050 and cementing Britain’s place as a clean energy superpower through our Plan for Change.

As part of the UK SHORE programme, the government provides funding to businesses and academia, enabling them to take forward innovative, green projects and leverage further investment from the private sector to deliver real-life technology, which reduces carbon emissions from shipping.

Today, the newly appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport, Keir Mather, will visit Cammell Laird dry dock at Birkenhead in Liverpool to see how £3.6 million of previous UK SHORE funding has driven a further £3.6 million in private investment for the installation of a zero-emission electric shore power system.

This system allows vessels at the site to plug into an electric grid source and run emission-free while docked, similarly to how electric vehicles plug into chargers to restore their battery. Cammel Laird estimates that once fully operational, the system aims to save the equivalent of the average annual fuel consumption of 20,000 cars and support 15 jobs.

David McGinley, Group Chief Executive Officer at APCL Group, said:

APCL Group is delighted to welcome the new Minister for Maritime. APCL Group is a critical supplier to the government, and as such, the meeting provides an opportunity to showcase the current shipbuilding and ship repair projects at our Birkenhead facility. APCL is proud to continue our long-standing partnership with the MoD , the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, with the Group supporting 100% of the RFA fleet. We will also showcase APCL Cammell Laird’s brand new state of the art shore to ship power technology, a £7 million project that has been part-funded by a £3.5 million grant from the Department for Transport’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition Round 4 ( CMDC4 ).

Another success story includes Aqua Superpower, which, through almost £6 million UK SHORE funding, has successfully installed a network of chargepoints across the South Coast of England and London. The project estimates the network could reduce emissions by up to 2,800 tonnes of CO2 per year with 8 75 kW chargers in full operation. Following UK SHORE funding, Aqua Superpower have successfully expanded, building local charging networks spanning 59 sites across Europe and the United States.

This is alongside £3.3 million for FastRig wingsails, built in Scotland by Smart Green Shipping, which can reduce fuel and emissions on vessels by up to 40% a year.

Overall, previous maritime decarbonisation funding has delivered over £110 million in direct private investment and benefitted over 500 UK companies, including 250 SMEs . This enables the UK to continue charting a course to carbon free shipping by 2050, while supporting skilled green jobs, breaking down barriers to opportunity for workers across the country.

The government has also been working closely with industry to facilitate greater investment in UK ports, supporting jobs, skills and innovation and centring Britain as a global hub for international shipping.

As part of this work, Peel Ports has today announced £300 million for its Liverpool, Hunterston and Great Yarmouth ports, while NatPower Marine has unveiled £250 million for shore side power, which is estimated to support over 2,000 skilled jobs in engineering, construction and green technology services across the UK , particularly within local port communities. Furthermore, the Port of Tyne’s £150 million North Side development site could potentially create up to 12,000 jobs in offshore wind and manufacturing.

To further propel prosperity for ports, the government will complete a revised national policy statement, covering England and Milford Haven in Wales, to help ports save time and money on planning applications to expand sites, opening up jobs and opportunities in coastal communities.

Proposals aim to streamline the planning process for ports in England and expedite planning applications by more clearly outlining the needs for port facilities and how to design applications to avoid process delays.

Claudio Veritiero, CEO , Peel Ports Group, said:

Peel Ports Group has invested £1.5 billion over the past decade, future-proofing our operations, strengthening vital supply chains and creating hundreds of jobs across the regions where we operate. Looking ahead, we plan to invest a further £1 billion over the next 5 years, with projects already underway that include new port-centric warehousing, steel and metals facilities and major upgrades at key ports. These developments underline our long-term commitment to building capacity and efficiency across our network, while supporting growth and productivity in the wider UK economy.

Matt Beeton, CEO at the Port of Tyne, said:

Accelerating offshore wind, renewable energy and advanced manufacturing is a national priority and requires decisive action. Boosted by Industrial Strategy Zone status, our 230-acre North-side expansion to the Tyne clean energy park will help the UK execute its 2030 clean power target. Located close to emerging North Sea wind arrays, this nationally strategic site offers deep-water access and a major development footprint to enable the creation of world-class infrastructure to support a growing supply chain offering.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine, said:

We are investing over £250 million in the UK over the next 5 years to accelerate the rollout of shore power infrastructure – a game-changer for both the maritime industry and our coastal communities. This investment is more than just ports and cables – it’s

[TITLE]A pragmatic and flexible 2040 climate framework for a competitive industrial future:
[TEXT]
Brussels, 15 September 2025 : We welcome the European Commission’s consultation on the proposal to amend the European Climate Law to include the 2040 climate target. This target marks a critical milestone in the EU’s climate ambition and will require a regulatory framework that is not only ambitious but also flexible and competitiveness-driven - one that enables innovation, encourages investment, and allows for the scale-up of all viable solutions. Only through such a pragmatic approach can the EU ensure both climate progress and the resilience of its industrial base.

The fuel manufacturing industry plays a critical role in ensuring energy security, enhancing industrial competitiveness, and achieving the objectives of the EU Green Deal - particularly by supporting the decarbonisation of transport and other key industries that rely on our products as raw materials.

As committed partners in the energy transition, we support the EU’s goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and the 2030 target of 55% emissions reductions.

However, ambition must be accompanied by pragmatism: achieving the proposed 2040 climate target requires an enabling regulatory framework that supports both climate goals and Europe’s competitiveness. Without this, the 2040 Climate Target risks becoming unrealistic.

While the 2040 target sets an ambitious destination, it lacks the enabling measures to ensure delivery. European industries need a viable business case to drive the scale of investment required for breakthrough technologies and low-carbon solutions.

Liana Gouta, Director General of FuelsEurope, states: “Europe must keep all options on the table to reach its ambitious 2040 target. If the EU wants to achieve its climate ambitions while maintaining industrial resilience and delivering on the Clean Industrial Deal and the Draghi Report recommendations, we need a more flexible and inclusive framework that recognises both high-quality international credits and domestic removals from the outset, while ensuring equal access to compliance options for all ETS sectors.” She added “We urge the EU to establish supporting infrastructure, enhance transparency on residual emissions, and stimulate lead markets for renewable and low-carbon products. Only by combining regulatory flexibility, robust safeguards, and demand-side measures can the EU achieve its ambitious climate goals while safeguarding industrial competitiveness.”

We stress the urgent need for the following key enabling measures:

Advance the integration of international credits beyond the 3% cap and from the outset of the post-2030 framework , as they can play a role in achieving net zero and contributing to market functioning.

, as they can play a role in achieving net zero and contributing to market functioning. Strengthen flexibility in the EU ETS through removals and international credits and ensure equal access to decarbonisation options across ETS sectors , as these solutions can contribute to market functioning, especially as the framework moves towards a period of expected market shortage.

, as these solutions can contribute to market functioning, especially as the framework moves towards a period of expected market shortage. Enhance policy integrity through greater transparency on residual emissions , enabling better understanding of where further decarbonisation efforts must be concentrated and what policy instruments will be necessary to reach the target.

, enabling better understanding of where further decarbonisation efforts must be concentrated and what policy instruments will be necessary to reach the target. Support the demand for renewable and low-carbon goods to provide for a business case to invest in decarbonisation at scale , to complement the existing focus on the supply side. To unlock the full potential of industrial decarbonisation, we must go further - by actively stimulating and supporting demand for renewable and low-carbon goods.

, to complement the existing focus on the supply side. To unlock the full potential of industrial decarbonisation, we must go further - by actively stimulating and supporting demand for renewable and low-carbon goods.

To make up for wind and solar’s deal-breaking intermittency and to rid industry of energy-dense fossil fuels, the surplus cheap electricity that renewables produce during times of abundance would need to be channeled into electrolyzers that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could then be collected, stored, transported, and eventually combusted for on-demand energy.

But is this scenario really the most cost-effective and environmentally-friendly option? Would it make more sense, for instance, to produce hydrogen from another carbon-free source – nuclear power?

A trio of scientists in the Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering at the University of Pisa in Italy explored that question. Utilizing data from the International Atomic Energy Agency Hydrogen Economic Evaluation Programme, the group performed a feasibility assessment to compare various methods of producing hydrogen from futuristic Gen IV nuclear reactors. Their findings are published in the journal energies.

Two methods of producing hydrogen from nuclear power rose to the top. First, engineers could construct an attached electrolyzer system just like with renewable energy. Since a nuclear reactor is almost constantly running as “baseload” power, plant operators could simply divert power to the electrolyzers when grid demand wanes. The researchers estimate the cost of hydrogen with this setup would be 2.71 USD/kg with paltry carbon emissions of 0.3 kgCO2e/kgH2.

Second, the authors envisioned a system where futuristic Gen IV reactors operating at high temperatures (between 550 and 1000 °C) can produce hydrogen through the hot steam they emit. This high-temperature steam electrolysis is similar to how hydrogen is produced from steam reforming via natural gas. They predict costs here to be 3.57 USD/kg with slightly higher emissions of 0.8 kgCO2e/kgH2. Costs are higher because it a more novel system, even though it is “the most efficient coupling since it better exploits the electrical and thermal energy resources produced by the reactor,” the researchers write.

Costs and carbon emissions for both methods compare favorably with current costs of hydrogen produced from fossil fuels and renewables. In Europe in 2023, hydrogen made via methane reforming cost 3.76 EUR/kg (4.39 USD) and produced emissions of at least 11.6 kgCO2e/kgH2. Hydrogen made from a direct connection to renewables cost 6.61 EUR/kg (7.71 USD) with emissions similar to production from nuclear.

The researchers’ assessment is highly preliminary, of course. There’s only one commercial nuclear reactor in operation today that matches the reactor they modeled. It’s in China. Their cost estimates could also be overly rosy, and it’s likely that the cost to produce hydrogen with renewables will come down over time as solar panels grow more efficient.

The world currently produces 52.6 million tons of hydrogen per year, used mostly to make ammonia for fertilizer. The process of making this hydrogen accounts for two percent of the world’s total energy consumption and contributes roughly the same proportion of global carbon dioxide emissions. Even if hydrogen doesn’t find wider use in industry, transportation, and grid storage, we still need a lot of it to feed the world, preferably produced in a far cleaner manner than it is currently. Nuclear energy could provide it in abundance.

[TITLE]German court slams Apple over misleading carbon-neutral Watch claims:
[TEXT]
Apple just got slapped with a reality check in Germany. A Frankfurt court ruled that the company can no longer advertise the Apple Watch as a “carbon-neutral product.”

Judges found the claim misleading and in violation of competition law, agreeing with the environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe, which accused Apple of greenwashing.

For Apple, which has spent years building a glossy image around environmental responsibility, the decision is more than a legal nuisance. It raises questions
