[TITLE]Why Analysts Say a Chrome Divestiture Could Hurt Alphabet (GOOGL):
[TEXT]
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the Must-Watch AI Stocks on Wall Street. On August 13, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan reiterated a Neutral rating on the stock with a $201.00 price target. The rating affirmation comes amid reports of an unsolicited acquisition bid from Perplexity for its Chrome browser.

The firm believes that a Chrome divestiture could lead to “material value destruction” for Alphabet both financially and operationally.

“Press sources reported that Perplexity has submitted an unsolicited bid to acquire Chrome browser from GOOGL for $34.5B… Although GOOGL doesn’t monetize Chrome directly, the value of the asset to GOOGL is very significant… Assuming Chrome as a standalone entity hypothetically captures 25% of current monetization, we believe Chrome could be generating $10-11B in EBIT and potentially valued near $140B at 15x PE."

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company wholly owning the internet giant Google, amongst other businesses.

While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Silicon Valley Startup Tensor Unveils $200K Luxury Robocar With 37 Cameras And Zero-Cloud Privacy For 2026 Launch:
[TEXT]
Silicon Valley startup Tensor plans to release the first personal Level 4 autonomous vehicle for consumers in the second half of 2026, challenging Tesla (NYSE:TSLA) and other self-driving hopefuls in a high-stakes race for autonomy, Forbes reports.

The vehicle, built by Vietnamese automaker VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS), will combine "eyes off" self-driving capability with a folding steering wheel and retractable pedals that transform the driver's seat into a lounge-like space, the report says.

Don't Miss:

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.

Tensor, rebranded from robotaxi operator AutoX, departs from the common industry path of launching ride-hailing services first, instead offering a luxury electric vehicle that owners can either drive themselves or allow to operate fully autonomously in approved zones. The company emphasizes privacy, allowing drivers to disable remote access and keep their travel data stored only in the vehicle.

A Sensor Suite Built to Maximize Safety and Autonomy

Tensor's robocar will feature one of the most extensive sensor arrays in the industry, with 37 cameras, five custom lidars, 11 radars, multiple microphones, ultrasonic sensors, collision detectors, water sensors, and more, many with self-cleaning systems for uninterrupted performance.

Forbes says cameras under the chassis can detect obstacles beneath the vehicle, addressing a flaw that has plagued other autonomous systems.

The fully drive-by-wire architecture includes triple-redundant braking and steering systems to meet strict safety requirements, paired with high-resolution lidar capable of dense environmental mapping. Interior features such as folding pedals, a retractable yoke, and a sliding central display maximize cabin space during self-driving mode.

AI Foundation Model and Supercomputer Power the Drive

The vehicle's intelligence will come from Tensor's proprietary "Foundation Model," a transformer-based AI system that Forbes says is similar in architecture to large language models like ChatGPT, designed for real-time decision-making and deep situational reasoning without relying on cloud servers. Tensor's AI blends rapid reflexive responses with slower, more deliberate analysis, enabling it to handle complex driving situations safely.

[TITLE]TDSAT to take a call on Trai fine on telcos for failing to curb spam:
[TEXT]

New Delhi: The Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) is likely to take a decision next week on whether telecom operators need to pay nearly Rs 141 crore as penalty to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for not curbing spam.The tribunal is hearing the matter after telcos challenged the Trai, arguing that they should not be penalised for the time when the anti-spam platform was being implemented.At the last hearing held on August 8, the regulator had filed an affidavit containing the requisite details sought by the tribunal, and the next hearing is scheduled for August 20. The telcos are also expected to submit their response to the affidavit.The regulator had levied penalties on all three private telcos - Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea - as well as state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) for failing to control spam.However, the operators challenged the levy arguing that the regulator should not have slapped the penalties when an anti-spam platform was still being developed.The TDSAT had stayed Trai's penalties in January.The fines were levied as part of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018.The telcos argued that the delay in implementation of spam control measures was caused due to Covid-19 and that they were not responsible for it. To support their point, they submitted details to the TDSAT stating that when Trai imposed the penalties, the digital consent acquisition (DCA) platform was still being deployed.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had already rejected the demand for Trai to encash bank guarantees of telcos for not paying the fine.While staying the penalties in its January 28 order, the TDSAT observed that telecom firms were not responsible for the delay in implementation of the regulations, including the DCA. "Thus, it is unfair and arbitrary on the part of the respondent to impose financial disincentives on the appellants (telcos) for something which was beyond their control," it said in the order.While the issue of spam has been tackled by multiple stakeholders, the results remain less than satisfactory. The telcos have been asking for telemarketers to be brought under regulatory control, a move supported by the DoT but so far, Trai is yet to move on the issue.Trai's current mechanism to curb spam communications puts the onus on telcos to check the menace, while telemarketers, who are at the heart of aggregating and disseminating commercial messages using telco channels, are not under any regulatory ambit, and practically not accountable, said industry experts.Trai currently levies fines on telcos for spam messages and calls on their networks. Telcos have commercial binding agreements with telemarketers and, as per Trai, operators should recover the penalty from telemarketers.

[TITLE]AI Data Centers Are Coming for Your Land, Water and Power:
[TEXT]
From the outside, this nondescript building in Piscataway, New Jersey, looks like a standard corporate office surrounded by lookalike buildings. Even when I walk through the second set of double doors with a visitor badge slung around my neck, it still feels like I'll soon find cubicles, water coolers and light office chatter.

Instead, it's one brightly lit server hall after another, each with slightly different characteristics, but all with one thing in common -- a constant humming of power.

The first area I see has white tiled floors and rows of 7-foot-high server racks protected by black metal cages. Inside the cage structure, I feel cool air rushing from the floor toward the servers to prevent overheating. The wind muffles my tour guide's voice and I have to shout over the noise for him to hear me.

Outside the structure it's quieter but there's still a white noise that reminds me of the whooshing parents use to get newborn babies to sleep. On the back of the servers, I see hundreds of cords connected -- blue, red, black, yellow, orange, green. In a distant server, green lights are flashing. These machines, dozens of them, are gobbling electricity. In all, this building can support up to 3 megawatts of power.

This is a data center. Facilities like it are increasingly common across the US, sheltering the machinery that makes our online lives not only possible, but nearly seamless. Data centers host our photos and videos, stream our Netflix shows, handle financial transactions and so much more. The one I'm visiting, owned by a company called DataBank, is modest in scope. The ones coming in one after another to suburban communities and former farmlands across the US, riding the tidal wave of artificial intelligence's swift advances, are monstrous.

CNET/Tharon Green

It's a building boom based on generative AI. In late 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT and within two months it had approximately 100 million users and had spurred a frantic scramble among the biggest tech companies and a host of newborn startups. Now, it has nearly 700 million active users each week and 5 million paying business users. We are inundated with chatbots, image generators and speculation

Melbourne-based CyberCX was formed in 2019 through the merger of 12 smaller cyber security firms backed by BGH Capital.

[TITLE]4 M&A trends keeping bankers busy this summer: JPMorgan:

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Pie chart JPMorgan

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.

[TITLE]AI boom in Australia: Amazon investment sparks debate on artificial intelligence and housing shortage – Jason Murphy:
[TEXT]
But what do we actually get for the money? Just data centres.

If I was making a list of things Australia should be doing with concrete and air-conditioning, it would not include making data centres. What we need desperately, what we are horribly short of, is homes.

House prices are zooming up, and not just from speculation.

We’ve had huge inflation in the cost of building. Building a house from scratch costs around A$500,000, depending on its size and location. Maybe as much as a million bucks. And the inflation data tell us that price is up 39% compared with 2020.

Even renovation costs a bomb. Chucking a renovation on a small old home is now an A$500,000+ activity.

Why is building houses expensive? For a lot of reasons.

One is the tradie shortage. Prices for getting the plumbing and wiring and framework of a house all put in are up sharply. Concrete slabs cost a fortune now.

When it comes to these data centres, Amazon is supplying the capital, the money, which is nice. But money is not something Australia is super short of.

We have trillions in the national superannuation fund that’s just plonked in the sharemarket. (In fact, we have more super funds than the whole sharemarket is worth, so we now have to invest in other countries’ sharemarkets too.)

What we are short of is skilled people. Unemployment is at a historically low 4.3% right now. Unemployment among trades workers (people whose last job was in the trades) is
