[TITLE]Novo Nordisk's top investor seizes board control in weight-loss drug battle:
[TEXT]
By Stine Jacobsen, Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Maggie Fick

COPENHAGEN/LONDON (Reuters) -Novo Nordisk's top investor moved to take control of the drugmaker's board on Tuesday, vowing a sharper focus on the key U.S. market to revive sales of blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy as Novo's chair and six independent board members quit.

The non-profit Novo Nordisk Foundation, which combines business ownership with philanthropy, said it would propose its own chair Lars Rebien Sorensen - a former Novo CEO - to lead the Danish drugmaker's board for the next two or three years.

Novo said current chair Helge Lund and six other independent board members would step down next month after a dispute with the foundation over the pace of change at the company.

The clash brings fresh upheaval to a company that soared to become Europe's most valuable company last year on the huge success of Wegovy, only for its shares to plunge more than 40% this year as rival Eli Lilly grabbed market share.

FOUNDATION BACKS NEW NOVO CEO DOUSTDAR

The foundation criticised the outgoing board for being too slow to recognise shifts in the key U.S. market and too cautious on management change. It flagged a need to put more focus on the growing direct-to-consumer and mass markets.

Sorensen said that it had wanted wholesale change on Novo's board, but backed new CEO Mike Doustdar who took over in August and has ushered in widespread job cuts and a drive to refocus the company on its key markets.

"We are fully aligned behind that," Sorensen said in a call after the news. "We believed in the foundation board that we needed a fresh set of eyes, new energy to support management on this very important process."

Novo said Lund and the other independent directors would step down at an extraordinary shareholder meeting on November 14 after it had been impossible to reach a "common understanding" over the make-up of the board.

The move is the latest by the foundation to increase control over Novo as it seeks to restore sales and investor confidence. It pushed for the early exit of previous CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen in May.

Sorensen played down the feud, saying in response to one question that he "preferred not to have it coined as a coup". Instead the shift would help Novo in its key U.S. market, which he said currently had a "very transactional model".

Novo, like many rivals, is facing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower drug prices.

The foundation proposed six new board members - all European, but five of them with long experience in pharmaceuticals and related industries such as biotech and health tech.

[TITLE]Revium Rx Advances Toward Phase 1 Clinical Development of Nano-Mupirocin to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Infections:
[TEXT]
TEL AVIV, Israel, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Revium Rx (formerly Revium Recovery Inc. (OTC: RVRC), a biopharmaceutical company developing advanced lipid-based therapeutics for infectious and oncologic diseases, today announced significant progress in its regulatory and manufacturing programs supporting the planned Phase 1 clinical trial of its lead product candidate, Nano-Mupirocin - a novel systemic formulation of the well-known and highly potent antibiotic mupirocin.

“Our novel formulation of Nano-Mupirocin is designed to overcome the inherent limitation of mupirocin’s instability in blood and to expand its use beyond topical applications into systemic treatment for severe bacterial infections”, says Amir Avraham, the CEO, - “the formulation aims to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the bloodstream and effectively target deep-tissue infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE), and Ceftriaxone-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae”.

Last month, the company submitted its clinical trial application to the Israeli Ministry of Health, marking a critical milestone toward the initiation of first-in-human studies in early 2026. Concurrently, Revium Rx, in collaboration with WuXi AppTec, one of the world’s leading global CDMOs, continues to advance the scale-up and production of its GMP clinical batch, with final release expected by the end of 2025.

Addressing the Urgent Threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)

In 2021, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) was estimated to have caused approximately 130,000 deaths directly attributable to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) — a sharp rise from 57,200 in 1990. According to the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project published in The Lancet in 2022, MRSA was responsible for over 100,000 AMR-attributable deaths in 2019, making it one of the deadliest pathogens that year. Broader GRAM data indicate that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million deaths globally in 2019. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Summit on AMR held in 2024 further underscored the escalating threat, warning that AMR-related fatalities may approach 2 million annually by 2050 without decisive global intervention. The GRAM study projects that without intervention, AMR will directly cause 39 million deaths between 2025 and 2050, with annual mortality expected to rise nearly 70 % by mid-century.

MRSA alone accounts for over 100,000 AMR-attributable deaths annually. These alarming data underscore the urgent medical need for new systemic antibiotics such as Nano-Mupirocin.

Significant and Growing Market Opportunity

The global AMR therapeutics market was valued at USD 8.7 billion in 2023 and is projected to exceed USD 12.5 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.3 %, according to Grand View Research, 2024.

Within this rapidly expanding global market, Nano-Mupirocin targets several high-value infectious disease indications, including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE), and Ceftriaxone-Resistant Gonorrhea (CR-Gonorrhea). If Nano-Mupirocin demonstrates favorable results in clinical trials, of which no assurance can be provided, the Company will seek to capture a meaningful share within this rapidly expanding market, reflecting both the urgent clinical need and the significant commercial potential of novel antibiotics effective against resistant pathogens. “By targeting these difficult-to-treat infections with a novel nano-liposomal formulation of a known highly-potent antibiotic, ReviumRx is positioned to play a meaningful role in the global fight against AMR”, adds Amir Avraham, the CEO of Revium Rx.

Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Therapy Need & Why This Report?

Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Therapy (TIL) therapy has proven to be one of the most promising treatments for solid tumors, particularly in patients who are no longer responsive to conventional treatments like checkpoint inhibitors. In contrast to other conventional immunotherapies, TIL therapy leverages a patient's own tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, already cancer antigen experienced immune cells, to execute a specific, individualized immune response.

This treatment is especially relevant for melanoma and other late-stage cancers when alternatives are exhausted and prognoses unfavorable. Recent US approval in February 2024 of Amtagvi (lifileucel), i.e., the only globally approved TIL therapy to date, has moved commercial interest and scientific impetus in the field ahead at an accelerated pace.

Clinical Trials Insight Included In Report

Data in this section includes specifically trial stages, sponsors, geographical distribution, technology providers, collaborators and license holders. For example, in China, Bennu Biotherapeutics is running a Phase I trial of BEN-101 in solid tumors under the auspices of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

In the US, a number of academic institutions and biotechnology companies are conducting early-stage trials extending TIL therapy to indications such as cervical, lung, and head and neck cancers. The data indicate an increasing global interest in TIL research, with the US, China, Australia, and regions of Europe leading trial activity.

Leading Companies Engaged In R&D Of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Therapy

Apart from Iovance Biotherapeutics, the global standard setter with its lifileucel product, other players such as Juncell Therapeutics (China), Biosyngen (Singapore), SunAct Cancer Institute (India), and Instil Bio (US) are also seriously involved in TIL R&D.

These companies are not merely trying to broaden the therapeutic applications of TIL therapy but also to overcome the several key challenges in scalability, affordability, and access to patients. Academic research hospitals like the National Cancer Centre Singapore and Loma Linda University Cancer Center in the US are also playing active roles through funded pilot programs and institutional partnerships.

Technology Platforms, Collaborations & Agreements

The report indicates a trend towards unified technology platforms that simplify the TIL therapy life cycle. Creative Biolabs, for example, provides an end-to-end platform for the profiling of tumor neoantigens and expansion of TILs. Additionally, Xcell Biosciences Australia has partnered with Royal Perth Hospital to establish an automated production process through the AVATART Foundry system.

Numerous licensing deals and cross-border collaborations are also accelerating innovation, such as the partnership between Malaysia's Abgentil Biomedical and India's SunAct Cancer Institute to localize manufacturing and access.

Report Indicating Future Direction Of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Therapy Segment

From trial results, company activity, and investment in infrastructure, the report determines that the TIL therapy market is poised for explosive growth. As Amtagvi became the first proven product, the market now is transitioning from academic and experimental to more extensive clinical use and commercialization. Important future trends are shorter manufacturing times, growth into non-melanoma indications, regional manufacturing centers, and middle-income country pricing models.

The coming years are expected to witness a shift from an individual-product market to a multi-player, competitive ecosystem providing various TIL solutions globally.
