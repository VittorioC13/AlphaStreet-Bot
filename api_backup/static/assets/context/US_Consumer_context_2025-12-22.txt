Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) surged on December 18 after announcing a $6 billion all-stock merger with fusion energy company TAE Technologies. But retail investors aren’t buying the hype. Reddit sentiment collapsed from 78 to just 22 out of 100 immediately following the announcement, with the main discussion thread on r/stocks drawing 972 upvotes and 164 skeptical comments.

24/7 Wall St.

The disconnect is striking. While the stock posted strong single-day performance, retail traders are treating the news with deep cynicism rather than celebration.

Reddit Calls It an “Old School Penny Stock”

The tone on Reddit tells the real story. User cheddarben, whose post received overwhelming support from the community, captured the prevailing sentiment:

In the post, cheddarben wrote: “Old school penny stock with bizarro news. I am sure it will be a wild ride.” The characterization of Trump Media as operating like a penny stock resonated widely with commenters expressing similar skepticism.

Top-voted comments echoed this skepticism. Reddit user Unlucky-Clock5230 commented: “This is the most obvious pump and dump I’ve ever seen. The fundamentals are absolutely terrible.” Reddit user techgeek72 added: “TAE has been ‘five years away’ from fusion for the last 27 years. This merger is a joke.” Reddit user InvestmentGrift questioned: “How is a social media company with declining revenue suddenly worth billions by merging with a fusion company that’s never produced commercial energy?”

Retail investors have legitimate concerns:

Trump Media trades at a staggering 797x price-to-sales ratio with just $3.68 million in trailing revenue

The company posted negative EBITDA of $175.8 million and a net loss of $54.8 million last quarter

Revenue declined 3.8% year-over-year, moving in the wrong direction

Technical indicators support the skepticism, with the stock showing high volatility and overbought conditions following the announcement.

Truth Social Meets Fusion Energy

Despite recent gains, Trump Media remains down significantly year-to-date. The stock hit a 52-week low of $10.18 just days ago and trades well below its $43.46 peak. TAE Technologies, founded in 1998, has raised $1.3 billion pursuing commercial fusion energy but has yet to demonstrate a working power plant. The merged company plans to break ground on a 50-megawatt facility in 2026, with co-CEOs Devin Nunes and Michl Binderbauer leading the venture. For investors watching peers, the broader market offers a stark contrast. The S&P 500 is up 15% year-to-date, highlighting the challenging performance of Trump Media stock.

[TITLE]Blum Holdings, Inc. Announces Closing of Acquisition of High-Volume Bay Area Cannabis Retail Dispensary:
[TEXT]
DOWNEY, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blum Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: BLMH) (the “Company,” “Blüm,” “Blüm Holdings,” “we” or “us”), a California-based publicly traded holding company, today announced the successful closing of its acquisition of a high-volume Bay Area cannabis retail dispensary through the purchase of all outstanding equity of the operating entity.

The acquired dispensary is a well-established, fully licensed retail operator located in a major Northern California market and has generated approximately $12.0 million in annual revenue with a long operating history and strong local customer base. The transaction further expands Blüm’s Northern California footprint.

“This acquisition reflects our continued focus on disciplined, opportunistic growth,” said Sabas Carrillo, Chief Executive Officer of Blüm Holdings. “We are acquiring durable retail assets with real revenue, real customers, and meaningful operating history, positioning the Company to benefit from both improved execution at the asset level and broader structural tailwinds impacting the U.S. cannabis industry.”

The transaction was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement and included a combination of cash and equity consideration. The Company noted that all required closing conditions have been satisfied.

Carrillo added, “As the regulatory backdrop continues to evolve at the federal level, including ongoing discussions around potential reclassification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act, we believe scaled, compliant retail operators are well positioned to benefit from broader market development.”

[TITLE]Inflation Cools Overall But Consumers Stay Value-Driven:
[TEXT]
Wage growth recently outpaced inflation, offering short-term relief that has yet to translate into sustained financial security.

Inflation is easing overall, but consumers are still paying more for food, beverages and everyday retail goods.

After weeks of a government shutdown, economic data continue to roll in, and the latest inflation figures sketch a picture that is far from definitive.

In a nutshell, and per Bureau of Labor Statistics data from Thursday (Dec. 18), price growth is cooling overall but leaving consumers still contending with higher costs for everyday essentials.

For households, the read-across is nuanced. Slowing inflation does not feel like falling prices, and for many consumers, budgets remain under pressure, as PYMNTS Intelligence has found. That disconnect is shaping spending decisions, payment choices and brand loyalty.

Headline Inflation Shows Signs of Cooling

The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7% year over year in November, signaling that inflation has continued to decelerate from earlier highs, as seen in the accompanying chart.

Measures that strip out more volatile components also showed moderation, pointing to broader cooling rather than isolated declines. Still, for consumers, inflation remains a lived experience measured less by percentages and more by grocery receipts and retail prices.

Food and Beverages Keep Budgets Tight

Food and beverage prices rose 2.6% over the past 12 months, continuing to weigh on household budgets. Food at home increased 1.9%, with meats, poultry, fish and eggs up 4.7%, even as egg prices fell sharply, underscoring uneven relief within the same category.

Dairy prices declined 1.6% and fruit and vegetable prices were nearly flat, but those modest offsets did little to change the overall perception that grocery shopping remains more expensive.

Food away from home rose 3.7%, reinforcing why dining out remains a discretionary choice many households are limiting, as recent earnings reports from the likes of McDonald’s and others have shown.

Retail Prices Reinforce Cautious Spending

Retail categories tell a similar story. Furniture and bedding prices rose 3% year over year, while motor vehicle parts and equipment increased 2.6%, keeping replacement and maintenance costs elevated. Appliances and apparel posted marginal increases of 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, while sporting goods declined slightly, extending a long stretch without annual price increases.

Value-Driven Consumers Redefine Spending Behavior

This pricing landscape helps explain why consumers remain firmly value-driven. Spending decisions are becoming more deliberate. Consumers are prioritizing essentials, scrutinizing price differences across channels and increasingly choosing where and how to pay based on perceived value.

The persistence of value-driven behavior is reinforced by savings data from the PYMNTS Intelligence Paycheck-to-Paycheck reports. Savings rates remain thin, leaving many households without meaningful buffers even as inflation cools. For these consumers, slower price growth does not translate into financial comfort, at least for the moment.

Our recent surveys indicate that that among struggling households more than 1 in 3 consumers (34%) who live paycheck to paycheck but struggle to pay their bills report spending more than usual in the past six months, which in turn has impacted savings.

As reported here, the cost of food has been a key stressor cited by 56% of consumers queried by PYMNTS Intelligence. “Additionally, 55% say the same of inflation, and 23% say rising costs are their greatest source of financial stress,” per that report.

Taken together, the latest inflation data suggest momentum in the right direction, but consumer behavior tells a more restrained story.

[TITLE]Numerator November Consumer Price Index Reveals Prices for Everyday Goods Up 2.2% vs. 2024:
[TEXT]
CHICAGO, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Numerator, a data and technology company providing insights into consumer behavior, released its November 2025 Numerator Consumer Price Index (CPI) with an advance read on inflation trends across everyday consumer goods. According to Numerator, prices for everyday household purchases increased 0.38% in November, following a 0.03% increase in October and a 0.66% increase in September. In November, prices for everyday goods are up 2.2% versus a year ago.

Similar to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Numerator CPI tracks prices and changes in consumer purchases over time. The data cover approximately 20% of the consumption basket captured in the overall PCE price index, and closely tracks the PCE Food & Beverage index, offering a reliable signal of retail price changes experienced by U.S. consumers.

“Inflation for everyday consumer purchases appears to be stuck between 2% and 2.5% per year, above the 0.5% to 1.5% inflation we were seeing prior to the pandemic,” said Leo Feler, Chief Economist, Numerator. “These are groceries and personal care items that consumers buy most frequently. It’s not surprising that inflation and affordability remain top of mind for consumers.”

Additional key findings from Numerator’s November CPI:

Prices for everyday household goods increased 0.38% month over month in November, following a 0.03% increase in October and a 0.66% increase in September.

Prices for everyday household goods are up 2.2% year over year.

November shows the 3rd highest monthly rate of inflation since the beginning of the year.

METHODOLOGY:

Numerator’s consumer inflation measure is constructed using both base-period and current-period quantity weights to combine item prices, an approach that is consistent with the structure of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ PCE Price Index.

The index is calculated from verified, item-level transactions provided by a panel of 200,000 geographically and demographically representative U.S. households. These data include purchases across categories such as grocery, household goods, and health and beauty. The data capture changes in consumer purchasing behavior when prices change, including brand switching, downsizing, and shifts in where consumers buy.

Values are aggregated monthly to produce index levels and month-over-month and year-over-year percent changes, providing a current view of inflation trends. The dataset uses verified household purchase data from the demand side, offering visibility into consumer behavior as prices evolve.

The Numerator CPI’s year-over-year inflation measure has a 0.93 correlation with the PCE Food and Beverage index since 2019.

About Numerator:

Numerator is a data and tech company bringing speed and scale to market research. Numerator blends first-party data from over 1 million US households with advanced technology to provide 360-degree consumer understanding for the market research industry that has been slow to change.

[TITLE]Apollo Funds to Acquire Prosol Group, a Leading French Fresh Food Retailer:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced that Apollo-managed funds (the “Apollo Funds”) have agreed to acquire a majority stake in Prosol Group (“Prosol” or the “Company”), the multi-specialist in fresh food businesses and food retail in France, from Ardian. Prosol’s existing shareholders and management team will reinvest alongside the Apollo Funds.

Founded in 1992, Prosol has differentiated itself by building a proprietary, vertically integrated supply chain, sourcing fresh, quality products resulting in a highly loyal and fast-growing customer base. Prosol operates nearly 450 stores across France under two main banners: Grand Frais, where it provides the fruits, vegetables, dairy and fish; and Fresh., a fully owned chain of stores that sell fruits, vegetables, dairy, fish, and meat. By working with over 2,300 partners to source premium produce and focusing on best-in-class in-store experiences, Prosol’s retail concept has developed a leading position among customers, with Grand Frais achieving high consumer sentiment in France. Prosol’s portfolio of retail brands also includes La Boulangerie du Marché, mon-marché.fr, BioFrais, and Banco Fresco in Italy.

Alex van Hoek, Lead Partner for European Private Equity at Apollo, said, “Prosol is a clear category leader in fresh food retail, with a powerful customer proposition and outstanding sourcing model. Under the leadership of Jean-Paul, the Company has demonstrated consistent organic growth over time, providing shoppers with exceptional quality products, breadth of assortment and strong value for money. As Prosol looks to expand its estate both in France and internationally, Apollo will draw on our extensive retail expertise to support the management team’s growth plans while maintaining the distinctive identity beloved by customers.”

Jean-Paul Mochet, Chief Executive Officer at Prosol, said, “This investment marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Prosol and is testament to not only the strength of our business, but also the deep relationships we have formed with our suppliers and customers. With the support and expertise of such a strong partner in Apollo, we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term growth ambitions and bring our distinctive retail concept to more customers across Europe.”

Apollo’s private equity business has a long and successful track record of transforming businesses spanning more than 35 years, including significant experience in the retail and consumer sector. Apollo has been actively investing in France for more than two decades and today has

[TITLE]Capital One Lounge DFW: Grab n Go Now On Request, Hot Food Weaker — Maintenance Cited:
[TEXT]
Has the food at the Capital One lounge at DFW decline a lot? I’ve noticed on several visits that the food isn’t as good as it was when they first opened. And across lounges I’ve seen strategies to cut back on grab ‘n go as well.

There doesn’t seem to be as much as there used to be. At the outset they had these large bags – which just served to encourage guests to fill the bags. Their most recent lounge, JFK, has staff getting guests the food items – this discourages anyone that experiences shame from asking for scores of items. My most recent visit to DFW had less than ever before. The hot items were also pretty mid.

Irregular operations meant that I had nearly a 2.5 hour connection at the Dallas A gates.

My Austin to Dallas flight was delayed, and I was going to misconnect.

So I first got backed up both on a later Austin – Dallas flight and a later connecting flight. And then I confirmed the later connection.

All that was available was a non-extra legroom middle seat in economy and I took it. Fortunately the guy next to me at the aisle got an upgrade after boarding, and nobody was brought on to replace him even though the flight was full. So I shifted over to the window and had an empty middle. That made for a perfectly fine flight, even though it’s still a tight space for working on my laptop.

In the air I checked the wait time for the Capital One lounge and it surprisingly said just ‘5-10 minutes’. So I didn’t join the wait list then. Instead, I waited until I landed and joined through the app as I walked off the aircraft – for both the American Express lounge and for the Capital One lounge (and figured if both took a long time I’d use my Royal Jordanian status for American’s Flagship lounge). I headed over to the D concourse.

Capital One came back in one minute . I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case.

. I was pretty impressed with this! So I had a total of 11 minutes to make it over there, which is about right, and there’d be a grace period in any case. American Express took 27 minutes. I didn’t remove myself from the list because they don’t give you a wait time estimate, and I wanted to compare how long it would take (plus I considered that I might want to switch for variety’s sake0.

When I checked in at Capital One, the woman at the desk seemed a bit bored, and was terse in checking me in. In the past, large tables were reserved for larger parties, but that didn’t seem to be the case today and staff weren’t proactively seating people as I’d seen in the past.

The only open spot in the lounge was a larger table that hadn’t been cleared. I took it, but I felt badly, because I was solo and it could have accommodated a party of four. I needed to use the bathroom but there was an 8-person deep line for that, so I waited and managed to return once the line had dwindled.

What was striking, though, was the food service on this visit.

The grab ‘n go section was closed.

Grab ‘n go items replaced at least half the hot food.

Pastries were simpler.

The ice machine by the self-serve soda was gone.

A sppkesperson shared,

We are working to resolve a small temporary maintenance issue at our grab-and-go station. During this time, some of those offerings have been temporarily relocated to the hot food service area however the entire grab and go menu is available upon request. This is not our standard operating procedure, and we anticipate the station will be operational soon.

I was there for a pass by the ‘rituals cart’ which in this case was jasmine tea and a macaron cookie. It seems like the cookie might have been a bit more nicely presented than in a shrink-wrapped package? And maybe some options for teas? Still, having some personal service rather than just buffet is a really nice experience.

National airport’s ‘Landing’ which is really a complimentary sit-down restaurant remains my favorite in the Capital One portfolio. JFK is the best lounge – based on size, experiences and offerings. DFW was first, and is now four years old. Recent visits haven’t been as good as earlier ones, and like Denver it is frequently very very busy. I want to see it getting a little love.

[TITLE]Leaked Memo Reveals Why TikTok's New US Owners May Have Less Power Than Expected:
[TEXT]
TikTok has finalized a deal with new US owners including Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake. However, these investors will not have significant control over key business areas, according to an internal memo.

What Happened: TikTok has reached an agreement with Oracle, Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, and private-equity firm Silver Lake for a joint-venture agreement. These new investors will focus on national security-related tasks, such as data management and algorithm training.

However, TikTok’s current owner, ByteDance, will retain control over key business lines, including e-commerce and advertising.

TikTok CEO Shou Chew has stated that the new investors will not be in control of core business lines like TikTok Shop or ad sales, but they may still participate in the profits of the business.

“The US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance, while TikTok global’s US entities will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” as quoted by Business Insider Chew wrote in the memo.

Also Read: One in Five Americans Gets News From TikTok — Up From Just 3% In 2020

The deal, expected to close in late January, will give Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX a combined 45% stake in the US joint venture.

ByteDance will maintain ownership of just under 20% of the US business, but retain oversight of the rest of the world and manage TikTok US’s e-commerce, advertising, and marketing strategies.

Why It Matters: This deal signifies a significant shift in the ownership structure of TikTok’s US operations. While the new investors will have a substantial stake in the company, their control over key business areas will be limited.

This arrangement ensures that ByteDance, the original owner, retains control over crucial business lines, thereby maintaining its influence over the company’s strategic direction. The focus of the new investors on national security-related tasks aligns with the US government’s concerns about data privacy and security on the platform.

This deal could potentially pave the way for similar arrangements in other tech companies where national security concerns are paramount.

[TITLE]Wells Fargo Reiterates Overweight Rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN):
[TEXT]
Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is among the 14 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Now. On December 17, Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $295. This is a reaffirmation of the firm’s earlier update on December 2.

Wells Fargo Reiterates Overweight Rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)

This follows BMO Capital’s adjustment a day earlier when it lifted the price target on the stock to $304 from $300, while keeping an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm said it had conversations with two former AWS employees, with the discussions providing insights into increased cloud commitments, which became the basis for the revision.

As of the close of business on December 17, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock, with a one-year average share price target of $296.12, representing an upside of 33%.

In other news, press reports on Wednesday said that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in negotiations with OpenAI over a potential $10 billion investment that could see an agreement to use its AI chips. However, sources familiar with the matter described the talks as ‘fluid’ at this point.

The reports come at a time when the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an IPO as early as the second half of next year. If the deal goes through, the company could be valued at over $500 billion, reported Reuters.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital streaming.

While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
