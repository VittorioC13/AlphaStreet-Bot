[TITLE]Woolworths and Coles hit back at new price gouging laws, label it an ‘uneven playing field’:
[TEXT]
The Albanese government has officially announced a ban on supermarket price gouging following a damning report from the country’s competition watchdog.

Sunday’s announcement comes after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) earlier this year released its findings from its 2024 inquiry into the big supermarkets.

It found Coles and Woolworths had “limited incentive to compete vigorously with each other on price, and that their dominance of the sector seems set to continue”.

[TITLE]US crypto exchange constructs “regional triangle” that unlocks the one thing US regulators won’t permit:
[TEXT]
Robinhood has spent the past few years trying to outgrow its meme-stock reputation, and the clearest sign that it is thinking differently now sits far from Menlo Park.

In early December, the company said it would buy PT Buana Capital Sekuritas, a small Indonesian brokerage, and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto, a licensed digital asset trader, with closing scheduled for the first half of 2026 once regulators agree.

On paper, the targets are modest. But, in practice, they plug Robinhood straight into a country with more than 19 million capital-market investors and roughly 17 million people already trading crypto, all reachable through the same phone in their hands.

That combination signals where the next stage of growth for brokers with a crypto angle is meant to come from.

Instead of filing a fresh license application from the US and waiting in line, Robinhood is buying its way into Indonesia’s regulatory perimeter. Buana Capital gives it a conventional securities license and a seat in the domestic stock market.

Pedagang Aset Kripto is already within the country’s current crypto regime as one of the supervised digital financial asset traders.

The company is also keeping majority owner Pieter Tanuri on as a strategic adviser, which means the foreign entrant arrives not just with paperwork but also with local relationships and context.

For a company that has already had long conversations with regulators in the UK and Europe, walking into Jakarta backed by a pair of approved entities and a local fixer is a deliberate choice, not a quirk of deal flow.

Buying a regulatory foothold in Indonesia

Indonesia is attractive because its core ingredients align almost perfectly with Robinhood’s design.

The country has a young population that lives on Android phones and treats the brokerage app as another social icon.

Equity investing has become part of everyday financial life for millions of people, helped by low minimums and highly online marketing. Crypto arrived on the same rails but moved even faster.

Penetration for digital assets now sits close to equity penetration, which is not a sentence you can write

Whisky industry faces bleak midwinter as tariffs bite and exports stall

3 days ago Share Save Douglas Fraser Scotland business and economy editor Share Save

Scotch whisky is facing a sharp downturn in production as it adapts to tough market conditions around the world. Tariffs for export to the USA, introduced under the Trump administration and adding 10% to importers' costs, have hit sales in the industry's biggest export market. American tariffs on single malts, which were suspended four years ago, are on course to return next spring with a further 25% charge, unless a deal can be done with the Trump administration. Single malts, which sell at premium prices, are a particularly important part of exports to the US. However, the downturn is not only in the American market. There is also weakening demand in other markets due to squeezed growth and consumer spending, increased tax and costs, including packaging regulation, and because of trade disruption. Shipments to China last year fell by 31%, moving it from THE fifth biggest market to the tenth biggest. The first half of this year shows a 1% increase in the value of Scotch exports, to £2.5bn, while volumes were down nearly 4%. And the negative effects of US tariffs may not become clear for some months, as distillers moved swiftly to build up stocks in the country ahead of the frontier tax being introduced.

Getty Images The full impact of Donald Trump's tariffs is not yet clear as stocks were built up in the US before they took effect.

One of the brightest prospects for distillers is the sharp tariff reductions in India, the world's biggest whisky market which last year replaced France as the biggest importer of Scotch by volume. Currently at 150% of the value of each bottle, the trade deal between the London and Delhi governments includes a staged reduction to 40% tariffs. But with ratification in both countries expected to take time, that is seen as too far off to avoid the slump being felt in the shorter term.

Companies that supply the industry are also feeling the pressure. Distillers' demand for malted barley has slumped. Expectations for next year are of a cut from the range of 900,000 to 1 million tonnes to the lower range of 600 to 700,000 tonnes. Grain farmers are finding it hard to secure contracts for their barley harvests next year. Many are planting other crops such as wheat and rapeseed, or plan to do so. According to Jack Stevenson, chair of the crop committee of the National Farmers Union in Scotland, who runs Brangan farm between Portsoy and Banff: "A lot of the merchants are struggling to find contracts. The end users are cutting them back hugely. "It's the same story the length and breadth of Scotland. We're trying to keep the dialogue open with the Scotch whisky industry, and it'll come back. It's a huge market for Scotland." But for now he says: "There's doom and gloom in the cereals sector. And costs have been getting out of control on the machinery side of things."

Getty Images The downturn affects not just distillers but their suppliers including farmers who grow barley

He says the break-even point for barley is more than £200 per tonne, and around half of it is sold in contracts for future delivery. But the spot price, without a future contract, fell during September to £160 per tonne. According to data compiled by market intelligence agency AHDB, use of barley for distilling and brewing during July to October was down 14% on last year. One farmers' co-operative in Aberdeenshire is facing a halving of its 70,000 tonne barley contract this year with Chivas Brothers, one of the largest whisky distillers, owned by French drinks giant Pernod Ricard. A maltings plant, supplying distilleries with processed barley, is being permanently closed at Pencaitland in East Lothian, with the loss of around 20 jobs. Julian South, executive director of the Maltsters' Association of Great Britain (MAGB), says that is partly because the sector has grown its processing capacity elsewhere in recent years, with plans for more expansion. "Whisky has its ups and downs, while brewing is more consistent," he says. "Some people are quite surprised how quickly demand dropped off. Maltsters are having to look at their own production and contracts for barley in the coming season." A key signal to farmers is the industry's forecast of its demand for all malted barley, including around 40% of it used for brewing beer. The MAGB estimated demand next year is down from 1.8m tonnes to 1.4m.

Some firms are forecasting reduced demand and are adjusting production

Diageo, the biggest producer of Scotch whisky, has halted work at one of its main maltings, at Roseisle in Moray, until at least next June. A Diageo spokesperson said: "We have temporarily paused production at Roseisle Maltings as we look to balance capacity against current demand. We continue to assess production volumes and will communicate future plans as part of the normal planning cycle." The firm has reduced production in some distilleries and has paused distilling at Teaninich, near Alness in Easter Ross. Glenmorangie, at Tain in Easter Ross, is among distilleries where production has been halted for several months. Along with Ardbeg, it is a subsidiary of French luxury goods firm LVMH. A spokeswoman says this is a "short term adjustment" to production based on forecast demand for Glenmorangie: " There was a temporary pause in distillation early in the summer and another pause over the winter, with production scheduled to resume in spring 2026. This is part of the strategy to grow the value of the brand, she said. That reflects the risk that over-production could force down prices, and not only the profit margins but the premium status built up over years.

Man distilleries combine production with some kind of visitor experience that offers staff alternative roles

In most cases, the small number of people required to run a distillery are being redeployed, and visitor centres remain open, though there are knock-on effects for hauliers and other suppliers. The large US distilling firm that owns the smaller Glenglassaugh and Benriach distilleries in north-east Scotland has been operating only one of them since the start of this year, shutting down Glenglassaugh until autumn. As it started up again, Benriach was closed for two years. Brown-Forman, based in Kentucky and owner of Jack Daniels whiskey, also operates the Glendronach distillery near Huntly, and says it has slowed production there, "based on demand planning". That is despite its output of single malt having to wait at least 12 years before it is bottled and available for sale. The whole industry has to forecast where demand will be at least three years from now - the minimum length of time for Scotch whisky to mature in casks.

Bourbon barrels

A recent update for investors from Brown-Forman warned about global markets: "We continue to anticipate the operating environment to be challenging, with low visibility due to macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility as we face headwinds from consumer uncertainty and lower non-branded sales of used barrels". The main customer for used bourbon barrels is the Scotch industry, which has been importing around £200m-worth each year. The downturn suggests the forecast is for a prolonged downturn in demand, though it may also be due to warehousing, or whisky bonds, being full from high production levels in recent years. There is criticism in the industry at slow planning decisions holding back investment in extra capacity. Brown-Forman's global brand director for malts, Adip Agarwal, emphasised that slowing production, and the two-year closure of Benriach, does not alter availability of its Scotch produce. "This strategic decision aligns our production with the current market, allowing us to manage our resources effectively and optimise operations," he said.

Analysis: Consumers now navigate a marketplace where trends, novelty and online influence mean safety and quality can slip as speed and low costs dominate

By Catarina Marvão, UCD

Trust is an invisible ingredient in every purchase. We assume that what we buy is safe, that descriptions are accurate, and that companies play by the rules. But a series of investigations, product recalls and concerns around online shopping platforms suggest that this trust is coming under pressure

Recent enforcement actions by Ireland's Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)—including cases involving Boots Ireland and Lifesyle Sports, and warnings to fast-fashion retailers such as Shein —have put a spotlight on a growing question for shoppers: how confident can we really be in what we’re buying?

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package Monday — a boost to farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war.

He unveiled the plan Monday afternoon at a White House roundtable with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers from farm states, and farmers who thanked him for the help.

“With this bridge payment, we’ll be able to farm another year,” Iowa farmer Cordt Holub told Trump during the event.

Rollins put the immediate value of the program at $11 billion — money that the White House said will offer one-time payments to row-crop farmers. Another $1 billion will be put aside for specialty crops as the administration works to better understand the circumstances for those farmers, Rollins said. The aid will move by the end of February, she said.

“We looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,” Trump said, explaining how the administration came up with the size of the package. Trump said the money for the program will come from tariff revenue.

Later this month, the USDA will use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. Payments will be capped at $155,000 per farm or person, and only entities that make less than $900,000 a year will be eligible for aid. That will limit payments to large farms, which was a criticism of farm aid Trump delivered in his first term.

Farmers have backed Trump politically, but his aggressive trade policies and frequently changing tariff rates have come under increasing scrutiny because of the impact on the agricultural sector and because of broader consumer worries.

The aid is the administration’s latest effort to defend Trump’s economic stewardship and answer voter angst

[TITLE]The Age of Stagflation?:
[TEXT]
From attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence to high and unpredictable tariffs, Donald Trump has pursued a slew of misguided policies that threaten to fuel stagflation, trigger financial instability, and end US dollar dominance. Emerging-market and developing economies must take action to protect themselves.

Project Syndicate: Despite an overwhelming consensus on the importance of central-bank independence, politicians still seek to shape monetary policy, with populist strongmen often favoring low interest rates. This is certainly the case for US President Donald Trump, who will undoubtedly seek a pliant successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after his term ends next year. Given that the United States is not subject to the same trade-offs as emerging economies, how do the risks to the US economy compare to those in Turkey during its disastrous monetary-policy experiment that culminated in 2022?

Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan: While monetary policy is subject to political pressures in both the US and Turkey, the macroeconomic consequences of politically motivated interest-rate cuts would differ sharply, owing to structural and institutional factors, especially disparities in financial dominance, policy credibility, and global linkages.

When political interference drives policy rates below equilibrium levels in an emerging economy like Turkey – which holds debt in a foreign currency, has shallow domestic financial markets, and suffers from weak investor confidence – the blow to central-bank credibility is severe, and quickly triggers currency depreciation, capital flight, and inflationary spirals. As we saw in 2022, such economies face endogenous amplification: mounting global risk or domestic policy uncertainty creates a vicious cycle of rising risk premia, accelerating capital outflows, and balance-sheet deterioration.

The US, by contrast, enjoys global financial hegemony: it issues the world’s dominant reserve currency, and dollar-denominated “safe assets” remain in demand globally, despite intensifying political pressure on the Fed. This provides significant insulation from the effects of premature or excessive interest-rate cuts. But this insulation has its limits. Global production and financial networks feed rising economic and geopolitical risks back into the US economy, driving up inflation and weakening asset prices.

Because of its entrenched financial dominance and long-standing institutional credibility, the US should be able to sustain below-equilibrium interest rates for longer than Turkey did before the worst effects materialized. Nonetheless, the prolonged politicization of US monetary policy almost certainly would erode the Fed’s credibility, distort risk pricing, and weaken the dollar’s global role over time.

SPILLOVERS AND SPILLBACKS

PS: US monetary policy has significant spillovers. Given the limitations of conventional tools in managing capital-flow volatility, how should emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs) prepare for, or respond to, US interest-rate cuts?

SKO: US monetary policy produces powerful global spillovers, because it anchors global financial conditions – a result of the dollar’s dominant role in international borrowing and asset pricing. US interest-rate movements are transmitted internationally not only through trade, but also through balance-sheet channels, because cross-border credit, corporate bonds, and syndicated loans are largely denominated in dollars.

When US rates fall, the risk appetite of global banks and non-bank investors rises, leverage expands, and capital flows into EMDEs surge. These inflows can temporarily ease financing constraints, but they raise systemic vulnerabilities, particularly in countries with weak economic fundamentals or low policy credibility, as any tightening of US monetary conditions is likely to trigger a sharp capital-flow reversal, which can generate exchange-rate pressure and financial instability. Using micro-level data across Europe, Latin America, and Asia, I have shown that firms in countries with stronger financial institutions, credible monetary frameworks, and deeper local-currency markets experience smaller output and credit contractions following US policy reversals.

Conventional monetary tools – such as short-term interest-rate adjustments or foreign-exchange (FX) interventions – are often insufficient to manage these cycles. But EMDEs can use macroprudential tools to counter excessive borrowing and risk-taking in the financial system and address currency mismatches in times of US monetary easing.

They can also deepen local-currency bond markets, in order to reduce dependence on dollar funding, and develop credible monetary frameworks that anchor expectations and reduce risk premia. Global coordination – supported by International Monetary Fund facilities, multilateral currency-swap arrangements, and transparent policy communication from the Fed – can also go a long way toward mitigating spillovers.

US interest-rate cuts are a double-edged sword for EMDEs – stimulative in the short run, but destabilizing in the long run. By fostering policy credibility and pursuing a proactive macroprudential policy, however, EMDEs can mitigate the downside risks.

PS: While Turkey’s recent experiment vindicated long-standing monetary-policy orthodoxy, the global economy – and America’s role within it – is changing fast. Do developing economies need to pursue new thinking to deliver growth and stability, or at least reshuffle their priorities?

SKO: EMDEs should not abandon this orthodoxy, but they should pursue an “orthodoxy-plus” approach, in which credible macro anchors are augmented by tools that target the specific vulnerabilities created by interconnected global financial networks.

Turkey’s experiment showed that violating the basic policy trinity – price stability, fiscal discipline, central-bank autonomy – is ruinous. Far from lifting these “hard” anchors, EMDEs should reinforce them, with transparent inflation targeting, rules precluding fiscal dominance, and legal safeguards for central-bank independence.

But in a world of dollar dominance, non-bank intermediation, and geopolitical shocks, this is not enough. EMDEs must pursue a policy mix that reduces balance-sheet risk and limits the amplification effects of the activities of global intermediaries. To this end, FX mismatches across banks, firms, and the sovereign must be monitored and capped. Sufficient state-contingent liquidity and capital buffers must be maintained – and they must increase during booms. Local-currency bond markets and hedging instruments should be developed, so that external financing shifts from dollar liabilities to domestic-currency claims. And the base of domestic institutional investors (pension funds and insurers) should be broadened, in order to absorb shocks. Diversifying trade and funding partners would also help to build resilience.

Finally, the credibility of data and communication is key. Transparent data on high-frequency external short-term debt, corporate FX gaps, and banks’ non-bank financial-intermediation linkages would help to anchor exchange-rate expectations and compress risk premia when global conditions change.

This “orthodoxy-plus” approach represents EMDEs’ best chance for achieving growth and stability in this new phase of globalization.

PS: Beyond monetary policy, the Trump administration is using tariffs – and the threat of tariffs – to advance political ends, reshaping the global economy in the process. What are the macro effects of Trump’s tariff threats, and how do they compare to the effects of implemented tariffs?

SKO: The impact of tariffs is shaped by agents’ expectations and by global production and finance networks.

As my co-authors and I showed in a recent paper, credible tariff threats raise tail risks and undermine domestic demand. Unsure

[TITLE]Trump admits he can't tell if the GOP will keep the House despite massive investment pledges:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump admitted that he’s not sure if his economic policies will pay off for Republicans at the ballot box in 2026.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal that was published late Saturday, he pointed to massive investment pledges that he’s secured since returning to the White House.

But when asked if Republicans will lose control of the House in next year’s midterm elections, Trump replied, “I can’t tell you. I don’t know when all of this money is going to kick in,” adding that forecasts say the second quarter.

Trump has previously touted as much as $21 trillion of investments pouring into the U.S., though recent commitments don’t come close to adding up to such levels.

Still, under trade deals Trump has negotiated, the European Union has vowed $600 billion in investment, Japan $550 billion, and South Korea $350 billion. Separately, Saudi Arabia has promised $1 trillion. Companies have also announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars, though some of that includes money planned during the Biden administration.

While the timing of all the money is uncertain, not to mention how much will actually be spent, companies have expressed the need to diversify supply chains with more domestic production. Apple has said its $600 billion pledge to build U.S. factories will create a “domino effect” that ignites manufacturing across the country.

At the same time, Wall Street expects Trump’s tax cuts from his One Big Beautiful Bill Act to deliver a significant jolt of fiscal stimulus to the economy next year, potentially reaccelerating GDP growth.

That would come as voters made clear in last month’s off-year elections that affordability is their top priority. Inflation has cooled from its 2022 high, but prices are up sharply from pre-pandemic levels, and consumers are revolting over higher insurance, electricity and grocery bills. Even most Trump voters say the cost of living is bad.

Trump has dismissed the affordability issue as a Democratic “hoax” and insists prices are down. He told the Journal that he will lower prices.

Influencers have changed the way we shop, quite literally influencing the trends that hit, the brands we buy, and the items we covet.

Affiliate marketing — a way to drive sales through links posted by creators or publishers — is expected to drive $216 billion in US e-commerce sales this year, according to data from EMARKETER.

These links are a direct way to track the shopping that is actually inspired by influencers.

ShopMy, a social commerce platform, enables creators to build shoppable landing pages and earn commissions from sales driven by their links on social media.

More than 185,000 creators use the platform, and their recommendations drive more than $1 billion in sales annually, according to the company. In October, ShopMy raised $70 million in a Series B funding round, a testament to the belief that the model will continue to grow.

"Affiliate has become a core part of brand building," Tiffany Lopinsky, cofounder and president of ShopMy, told Business Insider over email. "The top brands now treat creators as cultural partners."

A total of 1,200 brands use ShopMy.

The platform gave Business Insider an inside look at the best-selling brands on the platform this year as part of ShopMy's year-end report.

1. J. Crew

At the end of last year, retailer J. Crew named a new chief marketing officer, Julia Collier, who previously built out clothing brand Skims' very successful influencer marketing arm. She has made creators a key part of J. Crew's strategy; its holiday campaign featured popular influencers, like "Subway Takes" host Kareem Rahma and TikToker Delaney Rowe, who created shoppable wishlists.

2. CurrentBody

Redlight masks are all over social media, and CurrentBody has won customers through influencer partnerships.

In job descriptions, CurrentBody's parent company, The Beauty Tech Group, has said influencer marketing is a "growth engine." Its masks are featured on the ShopMy profiles of reality star Bethenny Frankel and fitness instructor Melissa Wood-Tepperberg.

3. Tory Burch

Fashion brand Tory Burch's social media marketing has stood out this year. In addition to being a best-selling brand on ShopMy, it had the most engagement of any brand at New York Fashion Week earlier this year, according to social analytics firm ListenFirst. Its social posts featured influencers like TikToker Alex Consani and celebrities like Sydney Sweeney, Lana Condor, and Chloe Fineman.

4. Tuckernuck

A multibrand e-commerce retailer, Tuckernuck's executives have discussed the importance of creators to its brand. Cofounder September Rinnier Votta told EMARKETER last year that the company looks for influencers who are already touring Tuckernuck, as well as microinfluencers with an authentic following.

5. Veronica Beard

Women's contemporary label Veronica Beard is favored by big-name influencers like Tinx and Valeria Lipovetsky, who have posted in the brand's clothing for years.

[TITLE]With a $35 billion push, Amazon puts e-commerce rivals on notice:
[TEXT]
Amazon.com Inc.’s plan to invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030 is expected to intensify competition in the online commerce and prompt rivals to increase their spending on infrastructure, supply chains, and consumer acquisition.

The US tech giant, which has already deployed $40 billion in the country, will invest money in all of its businesses—its core e-commerce operations, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services, entertainment businesses including Prime Video and MX Player, and its devices segment.

“Other players will be pushed to accelerate investments of their own, spurring faster innovation, deeper regional penetration, and more nuanced strategies for tier-II and tier-III markets," said Naveen Malpani, partner and retail and e-commerce industry leader, consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat.

Deeper penetration

Amazon, which has millions of Prime subscribers in the country, has been stepping up its promise of quicker deliveries.

For instance, this festive season, Prime members drove demand from tier-II and tier-III cities across key categories, including appliances, fashion and beauty, smartphones, and furniture. Prime members experienced faster deliveries, with over 3 million products delivered in metro cities within the same day or the next day, and more than 5 million products reaching customers in tier-II and -III cities within two days.

Although a late entrant in the quick-commerce play, it is also expanding its presence through Amazon Now, its 10-minute delivery service that now operates in three cities with more than 300 micro-fulfilment centres. The company is adding two centres a day as it scales its shorter delivery-window model.

Udit Madan, senior vice-president, worldwide operations at Amazon, said speed remains a central focus for the business. “We’re going to get to faster speeds—not just our fastest speeds with Amazon Now, but by expanding into more and more areas. This is a significant area of investment for us and one that will shape the business and demand patterns in India. A large part of our investment this year went towards speeding up and improving reliability in tier II-III markets, something we are now doing in parts of the US and Europe."

India’s online commerce ecosystem has expanded significantly over the last decade, dominated by companies such as Walmart-backed Flipkart, Amazon, Meesho, Nykaa, Swiggy, and Eternal Ltd.

While the overall retail market is expected to grow from $1 trillion in 2024 to $1.7 trillion by 2030, according to estimates from consulting firm Deloitte, online retail is projected to grow much faster—from $75 billion in 2024 to $260 billion by 2030—doubling its share of total retail to 14%.

Quicker response

Young shoppers are increasingly comfortable buying everything from cosmetics to apparel on their smartphones. This is especially true post-covid with the entry of new quick-commerce players such as Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, Zepto, etc.

Food aggregator and quick-commerce platform Swiggy plans to raise

Influencers have changed the way we shop, quite literally influencing the trends that hit, the brands we buy, and the items we covet.

Affiliate marketing — a way to drive sales through links posted by creators or publishers — is expected to drive $216 billion in US e-commerce sales this year, according to data from EMARKETER.

These links are a direct way to track the shopping that is actually inspired by influencers.

ShopMy, a social commerce platform, enables creators to build shoppable landing pages and earn commissions from sales driven by their links on social media.

More than 185,000 creators use the platform, and their recommendations drive more than $1 billion in sales annually, according to the company. In October, ShopMy raised $70 million in a Series B funding round, a testament to the belief that the model will continue to grow.

"Affiliate has become a core part of brand building," Tiffany Lopinsky, cofounder and president of ShopMy, told Business Insider over email. "The top brands now treat creators as cultural partners."

A total of 1,200 brands use ShopMy.

The platform gave Business Insider an inside look at the best-selling brands on the platform this year as part of ShopMy's year-end report.

1. J. Crew

At the end of last year, retailer J. Crew named a new chief marketing officer, Julia Collier, who previously built out clothing brand Skims' very successful influencer marketing arm. She has made creators a key part of J. Crew's strategy; its holiday campaign featured popular influencers, like "Subway Takes" host Kareem Rahma and TikToker Delaney Rowe, who created shoppable wishlists.

2. CurrentBody

Redlight masks are all over social media, and CurrentBody has won customers through influencer partnerships.

In job descriptions, CurrentBody's parent company, The Beauty Tech Group, has said influencer marketing is a "growth engine." Its masks are featured on the ShopMy profiles of reality star Bethenny Frankel and fitness instructor Melissa Wood-Tepperberg.

3. Tory Burch

Fashion brand Tory Burch's social media marketing has stood out this year. In addition to being a best-selling brand on ShopMy, it had the most engagement of any brand at New York Fashion Week earlier this year, according to social analytics firm ListenFirst. Its social posts featured influencers like TikToker Alex Consani and celebrities like Sydney Sweeney, Lana Condor, and Chloe Fineman.

4. Tuckernuck

A multibrand e-commerce retailer, Tuckernuck's executives have discussed the importance of creators to its brand. Cofounder September Rinnier Votta told EMARKETER last year that the company looks for influencers who are already touring Tuckernuck, as well as microinfluencers with an authentic following.

5. Veronica Beard

Women's contemporary label Veronica Beard is favored by big-name influencers like Tinx and Valeria Lipovetsky, who have posted in the brand's clothing for years. Long-term relationships with creators are key to the company's strategy, Veronica Beard execs have said in multiple interviews, and the brand brings them in to launch products and at other key moments.

6. Jenni Kayne

Direct-to-consumer home and apparel brand Jenni Kayne understands the power of influencers. Its first hit product, a pair of flats, went viral thanks to one.

The global Health and Wellness Products Market is projected to reach a valuation of over $1.2 trillion by 2026, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.8%. This surge is driven by increasing consumer awareness around preventive healthcare, rising adoption of personalized wellness solutions, and a shift towards holistic health approaches. Emerging trends such as digital health integration, plant-based formulations, and sustainability initiatives are reshaping the landscape. As stakeholders prepare for this dynamic environment, understanding the strategic drivers and technological innovations shaping the market becomes essential for capitalizing on upcoming opportunities and mitigating risks.

Several recent factors are fueling growth in the Health and Wellness Products Market during 2024–2025. First, technological advancements—particularly in AI, IoT, and data analytics—are enabling personalized health solutions, enhancing consumer engagement, and improving product efficacy. Second, regulatory shifts aimed at transparency and safety are fostering consumer trust and encouraging innovation, especially in dietary supplements and functional foods. Third, supply chain transformations, driven by digitalization and regional diversification, are reducing costs and increasing agility amid geopolitical uncertainties. Additionally, rising ESG pressures are compelling companies to adopt sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly packaging, aligning with consumer values. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation and changing healthcare policies, are also influencing purchasing behaviors and market dynamics.

Technology Appraisal: Innovation remains at the core of market evolution. Key technological trends include the integration of AI-driven personalization engines, wearable health devices, and advanced nutrigenomics, which enable tailored product offerings. These innovations are lowering costs and improving performance, making premium wellness solutions more accessible. The adoption of digital platforms for consumer engagement and direct-to-consumer sales channels is accelerating, providing data-driven insights that refine product development and marketing strategies.
