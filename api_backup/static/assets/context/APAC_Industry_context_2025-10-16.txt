[TITLE]HSBC proposes privatisation of Hang Seng Bank:
[TEXT]
HSBC said today it planned to privatise Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank in a deal worth HK$106.1 billion ($13.63 billion) after its majority-held subsidiary has come under fire for its performance and exposure to faltering property markets in the city and mainland China.

HSBC will offer HK$155 per share for the 36.5% of shares it does not already own, giving Hang Seng Bank a total valuation of $37 billion.

Hang Seng Bank shares surged to as high as HK$168 in early trading before retreating to HK$150.3 by midday, up 26.3% but below the offer price.

HSBC's Hong Kong-listed stock fell 6.2% to HK$103.7 by the break, a far worse performance than the 0.15% decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.

HSBC said the offer was made at a 30.3% premium to Hang Seng Bank's closing price of HK$119 yesterday.

The transaction marks the largest banking acquisition in Hong Kong in more than a decade, since OCBC purchased Wing Hang Bank in 2014 via a $5.3 billion deal, according to Michael Makdad, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

"This is an investment for the medium to long-term in what is a leading local bank in Hong Kong, an iconic franchise, distinct and unique customer proposition and a strong financial standing with very good liquidity ratios and capital ratios," HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery told reporters today.

The move contrasts with a string of market exits by HSBC after Elhedery took the helm last year and launched a global overhaul that saw the lender sell off or wind down businesses across Europe, North America and some Asia Pacific markets.

But Hong Kong emerged as a stand alone division after the restructuring, along with three other key operations.

The offer, which will maintain Hang Seng Bank's separate brand, also represented a significant investment in Hong Kong's economy, underscoring HSBC's confidence in the market and its future as a leading global financial centre, the CEO said in a separate statement.

Elhedery told reporters "additional streamlining and simplification" are expected at Hang Seng, and the banks would seek to align in areas of product manufacturing and international networks.

HSBC would pause its share buybacks for about three quarters to build up the capital required for the acquisition, according to Elhedery.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said it had been in talks with the banks on the proposal and would maintain dialogue during the process.

"We take note of HSBC Holdings' stated rationale for the transaction being investing significantly into Hong Kong," it said in a statement.

Morningstar's Makdad said the move was "positive and long-overdue" as parent-subsidiary double listings were inherently problematic in terms of governance.

"HSBC will need to pay a premium, but there should be some opportunities for cost synergies," he added.

Rising bad loans

The privatisation move comes as Hong Kong's debt-laden property developers and their creditors are set to face intensifying financial pressure as bond maturities are slated to jump by nearly 70% next year.

Hang Seng Bank has reported rising bad loans over the last few years due to its relatively high exposure to the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese property markets.

Impaired loans reached 6.7% of its gross loans as of June 2025, up sharply from 2.8% at the end of 2023.

Reuters last year reported that due to worries about a potential rise in bad loans amid growing economic headwinds and the property sector crisis in China, HSBC in early 2024 started planning to tighten risk management at Hang Seng Bank.

When asked if the move to privatise Hang Seng Bank was a bailout considering its worsening loan book, Elhedery said that was "absolutely not the case" and added both banks had communicated about Hang Seng Bank's commercial real estate exposure.

"We remain constructive on the outcome for the sector in the medium to long term. So we see this as a short term credit cycle, which in part is normalising," he said.

HSBC said the privatisation would have a negative impact of about 125 basis points on its common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio, which stood at 14.6% at end-June.

But it expected to restore its CET1 ratio to its target operating range of 14% to 14.5% through organic capital generation and by pausing share buybacks.

The offer price is final, HSBC said, adding that it does not reserve the right to revise it.

[TITLE]HKEX's new Hang Seng Biotech Index Futures to debut next month:
[TEXT]
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) plans to launch the Hang Seng Biotech Index Futures next month, as offshore investors show heightened interest in mainland Chinese biopharmaceutical stocks listed in the city.

The new futures contracts platform, which is expected to commence trading on November 28, aims to offer investors a risk management tool for "one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic sectors", the exchange operator said on Tuesday.

Built on the Hang Seng Biotech Index, the platform will track the performance of the 30 largest Hong Kong-listed Chinese pharmaceutical and medical device companies, whose shares can be bought and sold by mainland investors through the southbound Stock Connect scheme.

"The introduction of this new futures product reinforces HKEX's commitment to strengthening Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading derivatives trading and risk management centre," said Gregory Yu, head of markets at HKEX. He expected the platform to add "breadth and diversity to meet the evolving needs of global investors".

"Driven by innovation and strong global healthcare demand, the biotech industry is one of the most exciting frontiers in capital markets today," Yu said.

Beyond expanding investors' access to the sector's potential, the Hang Seng Biotech Index Futures reflect the city's efforts to contribute to the development of the region's biotech ecosystem.

Trading under the code HBI, the Hang Seng Biotech Index Futures will use a contract multiplier of HK$50 (US$6.40) per index point.

The Securities and Futures Commission's transaction levy will be waived for the first six months of trading of the new contracts. Margin rates would be announced in due course, according to the HKEX.

"Futures contracts enable institutional investors to hedge and manage risk effectively," said Mike Leung Kit-man, director at Wocom Securities. "A diverse range of derivative products, in turn, helps attract more investors to participate in equity trading, enhancing overall market liquidity."

[TITLE]China's stocks pare losses after early sell-off on fresh US trade war salvo:
[TEXT]
By Samuel Shen and Summer Zhen

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -A sharp sell-off in China stocks faded in choppy trading on Monday, allowing the market to trim early losses, as investors reassessed the impact of a renewed trade war between Washington and Beijing after taking profit to cut risks.

Analysts and fund managers believe the market downside will be limited compared to the panic-selling seen in April, when U.S. President Donald Trump kicked off a global trade war with sweeping tariffs across the board.

The Shanghai Composite <.SSEC> closed down 0.2%, after falling as much as 2.5% in early trade. The blue-chip CSI300 Index was 0.5% lower.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng benchmark tumbled as much as 3.5% before recovering some losses to end down 1.5%. The Hang Seng Tech index lost 1.8%.

Defying the broader selloff, however, China's rare earth sector, which is at the centre of revived trade tensions, jumped more than 6% to a record high, while semiconductor stocks also gained 2.6%.

Trump on Friday unveiled additional levies of 100% on China's U.S.-bound exports, along with new export controls on critical software by November 1, in a reprisal against China curbing its critical rare earth exports.

Later he softened tones on Sunday, posting that everything would be fine and the U.S. did not want to "hurt" China.

"President Trump reminded everyone that there are lots of uncertainties for markets," said Ben Bennett, head of investment strategy for Asia at L&G Asset Management, based in Hong Kong.

He expects near-term wobbles in Chinese stocks after the strong rally of the past few months.

The Shanghai composite hovered around a decade high level before the Monday retreat. The Hang Seng index has jumped 30% so far this year.

"We believe this is a tactical escalation (by Beijing) to shape pre-summit bargaining, not a strategic decoupling," Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note, referring to a potential meeting between President Xi Jinping and Trump at an upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.

An upbeat surprise in China's exports and imports data also helped lift investment sentiment.

Investors should not be distracted by political headlines, said Yeang Cheng Ling, DBS's chief investment officer for North Asia. "We believe rationality will prevail at the end of it," he said.

VOLATILITY SPIKES

To be sure, markets are likely to remain anxious in the short term given the rising geopolitical tensions.

An index tracking expected 30-day volatility in the benchmark Hang Seng surged 30% at one point on Monday to its highest level since April 2025, before easing slightly.

[TITLE]China markets under threat from risk of renewed U.S. trade war:
[TEXT]
The prospect of a revived trade war between Beijing and Washington threatens to undermine this year’s blistering rally in Chinese stocks and weigh on the yuan.

Global equities took a hit in U.S. hours on Friday after President Donald Trump warned he would impose a "massive” increase of tariffs on Chinese goods. He later said he would put an additional 100% tariff on China from Nov. 1, as well as place export controls on critical software. He spoke out after Beijing unveiled curbs on the export of rare earths earlier in the week.

While Chinese markets will get their first chance to respond on Monday, any following of the U.S. selloff may be tempered by weekend signals from the White House that it’s open to a deal and Trump declaring the U.S. wanted to help, not hurt China.

[TITLE]Is HSBC's US$13.6 billion buyout offer good enough for Hang Seng Bank investors?:
[TEXT]
HSBC Holdings' US$13.6 billion bid to take full control of Hang Seng Bank could be enticing enough for investors to cash out as the deal creates long-term value for the London-based bank, although some analysts said the offer could be sweeter.

On Thursday, HSBC offered to acquire the remaining 36.5 per cent stake in Hang Seng Bank it does not own at HK$155 per share, a 30 per cent premium over the previous closing price. The bank owns 63.5 per cent of Hong Kong's largest domestic bank.

The proposal valued Hang Seng Bank at HK$290 billion (US$37.3 billion), representing 1.8 times its book value - "significantly higher" than comparable Hong Kong peers, according to HSBC. The book value offers insights into whether a stock is over or undervalued.

The generous offer propelled Hang Seng Bank's stock to log its biggest intraday surge on record.

However, Mike Leung Kit-man, director of Wocom Securities, said a "reasonable" price-to-book ratio should be between 2.3 and 2.5 times.

"I'm more optimistic about Hang Seng Bank's prospects given that the worst may be over," Leung said. "The Hong Kong stock market has advanced so much this year, and property prices, especially commercial real estate, may rise a bit next year."

He added that property prices would at least stabilise while the bank dealt with sour loans. Leung compared HSBC's proposal to Chong Hing Bank's privatisation by Yuexiu Group in 2021 and China Merchants Bank's acquisition of Wing Lung Bank in 2008 - both deals carried a price-to-book multiple of more than two.

Other analysts said HSBC's move reflected the new management's priorities and was aimed at creating long-term value for shareholders.

The valuation fit the British financial giant's calculation, said Andrew Coombs, Citigroup's equity research analyst, in a note on Thursday.
