[TITLE]Longeveron New MRI Biomarker Data Linking Neuroinflammation to Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Mild Alzheimer’s Disease Presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Conference (CTAD 2025:
[TEXT]
Results obtained in the Phase 2 placebo-controlled CLEAR-MIND clinical trial showed that treatment with stem cell therapy laromestrocel was associated with a reduction in MRI measured neuroinflammation compared to placebo across multiple key brain regions, including key Alzheimer’s disease-associated regions, most notably in the hippocampus

Reduction in hippocampal neuroinflammation, measured using MRI assessed free water, correlated strongly with preservation of hippocampal volume and with clinical outcomes

Findings suggest a sustained anti-inflammatory effect of laromestrocel, reinforcing its proposed mechanism of action in the treatment of mild Alzheimer's disease

MIAMI, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Longeveron Inc. (NASDAQ: LGVN), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing cellular therapy for life-threatening, rare pediatric and chronic aging-related conditions, today announced that its submission entitled “Reduced brain neuroinflammation after laromestrocel treatment in mild AD: results from the CLEAR MIND study” is being presented in a poster presentation at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Conference (CTAD 2025) being held December 1-4, 2025 in San Diego, CA.

“Laromestrocel, a stem cell therapy that has multiple potential mechanisms of action to address inflammatory responses in the brain, offers the potential to address the underlying pathology of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Joshua Hare, M.D., Co-founder, Chief Science Officer, and Executive Chairman at Longeveron. “This data expands on the positive clinical information from the Phase 2a CLEAR MIND clinical trial that showed laromestrocel improved cognitive function, quality of life, and brain volume in the treatment of mild Alzheimer’s disease. We are very encouraged by the safety profile and efficacy evidence that support the differentiated therapeutic potential of laromestrocel in Alzheimer’s disease.”

Longeveron has conducted phase 1 and 2 clinical trials testing laromestrocel as a potential therapeutic for mild AD and has received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this clinical program.

From the Poster:

A hallmark feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is neuroinflammation, which is a principal driving factor in disease pathogenesis, gliosis, and neuronal death. In the CLEAR MIND study, we demonstrated that laromestrocel treatment improved clinical scores and reduced brain atrophy in multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus as well as the temporal and frontal lobes. To extend these findings, we sought mechanistic evidence of an effect on neuroinflammation in core AD-associated regions, particularly the hippocampal and temporal regions.

We examined the effects of laromestrocel treatment in patients of our CLEAR MIND Phase 2a trial on inflammation in the AD brain using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and free water analysis. In DTI imaging, although mean diffusivity provides some indication of inflammation, free water is considered a more precise measure and is used in assessing hippocampal AD pathology, although no clinically meaningful difference in free water has yet been defined. Laromestrocel is a novel, bone marrow-derived, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based investigational therapeutic that targets neuroinflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and has the potential to stimulate endogenous tissue regeneration, and has received RMAT and fast-track designations from the US FDA for mild AD.

Results:

Patients receiving laromestrocel exhibited a durable reduction in free water fraction compared with placebo (N=11) at week 39 for several brain regions, including hippocampus (Group 4: p=0.004, N=8; Group 3: p=0.037, N=8), which showed a dose response, and also temporal cortex (Group 3: p=0.032, N=8), occipital cortex (Group 3: p=0.003, N=8), and parietal cortex (Group 3: p=0.038, N=8). This new result was accompanied by clinical benefit as wells as reduced brain atrophy, as demonstrated in our study. Of the 14 brain regions, 13 (all but frontal) showed pooled treatment group responses (Groups 2, 3, and 4 combined) in the direction of improvement (reduction in free water) by week 39.

Poster Conclusion:

Overall, treatment with laromestrocel was associated with a reduction in neuroinflammation as assessed by free water compared to placebo across multiple brain regions, including key AD-associated regions—most notably in the hippocampus and temporal lobe. Importantly, rising free water was found in the placebo group, representing continued disease progression, while inflammation was stabilized with laromestrocel treatment. These findings suggest a sustained anti-inflammatory effect of laromestrocel, reinforcing its proposed mechanism of action in the treatment of mild Alzheimer's disease. This evidence supports continued clinical development of laromestrocel for this indication.

[TITLE]€150 million agreement between EIB and Angelini Ventures to finance European startups:
[TEXT]
This is the first agreement signed by the EIB with a corporate venture capital in the healthcare sector, and is part of the EU strategy to support the development of innovative companies across the continent.

Angelini Ventures and the EIB will each invest €75 million in the biotechnology, medtech, and digital health sectors.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Angelini Ventures – Angelini Industries’ corporate venture capital fund – have signed an agreement to provide a total of €150 million in financing for European biotechnology, medtech and digital health startups. This is the first agreement the EIB has signed with a corporate venture capital in the healthcare sector, and states that Angelini Ventures and the EIB will each invest €75 million over the next six years.

Under the agreement, the EIB and Angelini plan to co-invest in a total of seven to ten European startups developing innovative solutions particularly suited for market launch, in areas such as biotechnology, medical technology and digital health.

“Initiatives like this strengthen Europe’s ability to lead technological innovation and generate tangible benefits for people, patients and businesses,” said EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti. “Investing in biotechnology, medtech and digital health is vital, as it accelerates research, improves the quality of care, and supports the growth of companies able to bring cutting-edge solutions to market.”

Presented at the Angelini Ventures head office in Rome today, the initiative is aligned with TechEU, the EIB Group’s investment programme to strengthen the growth of innovation and technological leadership in Europe. Via TechEU, the EIB Group aims to invest €70 billion in equity, quasi-equity, loans and guarantees over the three-year period from 2025 to 2027, with the goal of mobilising €250 billion of investment in the real economy. The agreement also strengthens Angelini Ventures’ position in the sector. Founded in 2022 with €300 million from Angelini Industries (an Italian multinational in the health, industrial technology and consumer goods sectors), the company has already invested €125 million in 22 startups.

“This important agreement with the EIB enables us to bring our group’s commitment to innovation through venture capital to a European strategic context,” said Angelini Industries CEO Sergio Marullo di Condojanni. “Being chosen by the EIB for an ambitious project aiming to consolidate Europe’s role in innovation and health is an opportunity to work towards the common goal of turning researchers’ excellent ideas into products and services with a positive impact on people’s lives and the economic development of European countries.”

“The agreement with the EIB is a key step in strengthening our international presence and global vision,” explained Angelini Ventures CEO Paolo Di Giorgio. “This development path is essential to accelerating market access for talent and for innovative projects, facilitating strategic partnerships in health and offering scaling opportunities for investments and partners. These elements are fundamental to speeding up growth and creating value in the healthcare and biotechnology sector, promoting European innovation, competitiveness and social impact on an international level.”

As a first step in the new partnership, Angelini Ventures and the EIB intend to co-invest in the second financing round of Adcytherix, a French biopharmaceutical company that develops innovative ADCs (Antibody-Drug Conjugates), with the investment agreement currently being finalized. These targeted therapies combine antibodies with next-gen cytotoxic payloads, to enhance precision, reduce toxicity and address resistance to current treatments. The first round, which closed in October of this year, was led by Bpifrance through its Large Venture and InnoBio investment strategies, and co-led by Kurma Partners, Andera Partners and Angelini Ventures.

Startups in Europe and Italy

The European Commission Startup and Scale Up Strategy aims to more effectively overcome the two main obstacles that startups face as they grow: the transition from research to development and the market, and the leap from startup to established company. In this domain, the work of the European Investment Bank Group (EIB Group) with corporate venture capital companies helps to facilitate the identification and financing of innovative businesses, with the potential to accelerate the growth, scalability and competitiveness of European startups via greater availability of capital. Another goal is to stimulate a potential European initial public offering (IPO) market, which would help increase the business relevance of European stock exchanges and help to keep value generated within Europe, in Europe. This could be a particularly useful tool, given that, as the European Commission states in The EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy Choose Europe to start and scale, almost 30% of European unicorn companies moved outside the European Union between 2008 and 2021 and only 8% of global scale-ups are based in Europe.

In 2024, there were 15 000 funding rounds in the United States totalling €210 billion in investment, while there were 11 000 in Asia for a total of €70 billion. Europe, meanwhile, had 9 600 rounds with total financing of €57 billion, with the number of deals falling by 16% and total value by 8% compared to 2023.*

The United States saw a 4% increase in the number of deals and a 29% rise in total funding over the same period.

Venture capital investment in Italy in 2024 totalled €1.5 billion over 417 rounds, up 31% vs. 2023.

The Italian venture capital market is mainly focused on deeptech, software and life sciences, with €300 million invested over 62 rounds in 2024 in life sciences alone. A €12 million investment in Serenis, co-led by Angelini Ventures, was the biggest deal in the life sciences sector (and among the top five overall) in the third quarter of 2025.

Expansion of Safety & Specificity: What are the Ongoing Approaches in the U.S. CAR T-cell Therapies?

Primarily, CAR T-cell therapies are a type of immunotherapy that prominently uses a patient's genetically modified T-cells to find and kill cancer cells. Whereas the overall U.S. CAR T-cell therapies market is fueled by a rise in cancer instances, particularly of hematologic cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, and the progression of therapeutic applications beyond blood cancers. Consistent developments in this era include novel designs, like bispecific CARs that target two antigens simultaneously to mitigate cancer immune escape, and "logic-gated" CARs with built-in safety switches or "on-off" controls, are in transformation to enhance safety and lower side effects.

What are the Major Drivers in the U.S. CAR T-Cell Therapies Market?

Along with the increasing cancer cases, the market possesses significant factors, including robust investments in research & development, resulting in the development of innovative and more efficacious CAR T-cell therapies. Nowadays, US researchers are fostering groundbreakings in genetic engineering, diagnostics, and manufacturing to optimize the efficiency of CAR T-cell therapies. On the other hand, the emergence of regulatory bodies is helping to raise the number of product approvals for different applications.

Segmental Insights

By drug type analysis

Which Drug Type Led the U.S. CAR T-Cell Therapies Market in 2024?

The axicabtagene ciloleucel segment accounted for a dominant share of the market in 2024. Its widespread adoption is driven by its greater efficacy in treating particular, often previously intractable, types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), specifically in patients whose cancer has relapsed or is refractory to other treatments. In October 2024, the FDA authorised RMAT designation for axicabtagene ciloleucel as an efficient first-line treatment for adults with newly diagnosed, high-risk large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL).

Moreover, the tisagenlecleucel segment is anticipated to witness rapid expansion. It is mainly approved for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and certain B-cell lymphomas. Currently, the US scientists are continuing analysis of real-world data for both its approved indications (pediatric/young adult B-ALL and adult DLBCL/HGBCL), and persistent research into new CAR-T technologies, including site-specific integration and probably wider applications.

By indication analysis

Why did the Lymphoma Segment Dominate the Market in 2024?

By capturing the biggest share, the lymphoma segment led the U.S. CAR T-cell therapies market in 2024. A prominent driver is a rise in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Recent studies are leveraging improvements in delivery methods, such as direct intrathecal administration is being promoted for lymphomas affecting the central nervous system. In May 2025, a study demonstrated that an "armored" CAR T-cell therapy (huCART19-IL18) that secretes the cytokine IL-18 gained a 52% complete remission rate in heavily pre-treated lymphoma patients. By 2030, there will be a rise in nearly 108,000 new NHL cases in the U.S. is predicted.

Whereas the acute lymphocytic leukemia segment will expand rapidly. In 2024, the American Cancer Society anticipated that
