Financial Summary:

Three Months Ended

October 31, $ in millions 2025 2024 % Increase Revenues $ 47.3 $ 31.5 50.0 % Gross Profit $ 11.1 $ 7.1 56.6 % Operating Expenses $ 10.3 $ 6.6 57.5 % Net Income $ 0.5 $ 0.4 31.7 % Earnings per Share (Diluted) $ 0.01 $ 0.01 24.1 % Adj. EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 3.8 $ 1.7 118.0 %

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 & Subsequent Operational Highlights:

Acquired the business of Crown I Enterprises (“Crown 1”), a full-service manufacturer of value-added proteins and ready-to-heat meals, from Sysco Corporation for $17.5 million. All-cash, accretive acquisition fully funded through a $20.0 million private placement, further supported by an amended $27.4 million long-term credit facility with M&T Bank. Adds $56.8 million in revenue (12 months ended June 28, 2025) with a recently upgraded and expanded 42k sq. ft. USDA facility ~10 miles from the Company’s existing Farmingdale, NY facility. Brings premium, incremental customers where the Company did not yet maintain a presence as well as meaningful cross-selling potential. Significant new operational capabilities, including incremental grill capacity and MAP technology, and potential manufacturing cost synergies.

Secured new tier-one national placements at Target and Food Lion. At Target, two branded sleeved items are to begin shipping in February with a staged rollout to 1,995 stores and additional items in the final set up stages for later distribution, with Food Lion shipments to 1,100 stores starting later this month.

The Company’s first ever National Costco Multi-Vendor Mailer (MVM) with branded Beef Meatballs is underway, driving a meaningful potential increase in sales and brand awareness.

Invited to attend leading investor conferences nationally, including the Lake Street 2025 BIG9 Conference, 16th Annual Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference, Stephens NASH25 Conference, and 14th Annual ROTH Deer Valley Event.

Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025 totaled $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025. The change in cash and cash equivalents was driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of Crown 1.

Management Commentary

Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “Our third quarter demonstrated meaningful momentum in scaling the business. With the integration of the business of Crown 1 underway, we delivered broad-based growth across our protein portfolio, deployed high-return trade and marketing investments, leveraging newly added retail doors and cross-selling. We also implemented targeted price increases across both our beef and chicken portfolios to help offset commodity headwinds, while improvements in chicken operations enhanced throughput and lowered overtime, helping us meet our margin objectives.

“With the acquisition of Crown 1’s assets, we began a straightforward integration supported by proximity and shared grill platforms. Crown’s initially lower gross margins weighed on the quarter, but we are executing a clear plan to lift the acquired Bay Shore facility’s margin performance through procurement scale, throughput and overhead efficiencies, shared services, and best-practice sharing – which we expect to lift consolidated corporate gross margins from the low-20% range to the mid-20% range over the next year.

“We continue to see strong sales momentum across the portfolio, with Crown opening access to hard-to-penetrate customers and creating new cross-sell channels using its premium product offerings, while expanding SKU penetration across its base remains a core priority. This traction is reinforced by new tier-one wins at Target and Food Lion; at Target, we expect first shipments to begin in February, while our products should hit Food Lion’s shelves this month. This, paired with our ongoing National Costco collaboration, positions us for significant growth in the coming quarters.

“As we look ahead, our strategic path toward becoming a $1 billion deli prepared foods company is becoming even clearer. We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and maintain strict discipline around capital allocation, prioritizing integration ahead of a new acquisition. With expanded capacity, access to premium retail accounts and ongoing grandma-quality innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and improved margins in the quarters to come,” concluded Michaels.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50.0% to $47.3 million, as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to both the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as robust double-digit growth in the core business on a pre-acquisition basis.

Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to operational efficiency improvements across the organization and stabilized chicken commodity prices, partially offset by higher beef commodity prices as well as the addition of lower-margin Crown 1 sales, which the Company expects to bring in-line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year.

Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as $1.0 million in non-recurring professional fees and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses remained below 20% of revenue.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118.0% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter.

Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025, primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of the Crown 1 business. As of October 31, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $6.3 million as of October 31, 2024.

Douglas C. Yearley, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, stated: “Fiscal 2025 proved to be another strong year for Toll Brothers, as we executed well in a choppy environment. We delivered 11,292 homes at an average price of $960,000, generating a record $10.8 billion of home sales revenues, and posted an adjusted gross margin of 27.3%, an SG&A margin of 9.5%, and earnings of $13.49 per diluted share. We grew our community count by 9%, continued to produce strong operating cash flows of $1.1 billion, returned approximately $750 million to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends, and generated a return on beginning equity of 17.6%. In our fourth quarter, we met or exceeded guidance across all of our core home building metrics, generating $3.4 billion in home sales revenue with an adjusted gross margin of 27.1% and an SG&A margin of 8.3%. We earned $4.58 per diluted share, which was modestly below guidance due to the delayed closing of the sale of our Apartment Living business that we announced in September.

“Given soft demand across many markets, we remain focused on running our business in a disciplined manner and consistent with our long-term strategic objective of maximizing returns for stockholders. We continue to balance price and pace and are actively managing our spec starts and inventory on a community-by-community basis to best match local demand conditions. We control sufficient land to support continued community count growth over the next several years, including 8% to 10% growth in fiscal 2026, and we remain highly disciplined and selective in new land acquisition as we continue to focus on capital efficiency.

“Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate that our luxury business is differentiated, as we serve a more affluent customer who is less impacted by affordability pressures. These results also underscore the resilience of our business model, which includes a healthy balance of build-to-order and spec homes, a broad geographic footprint, the widest variety of home offerings and price points in the industry, and improved operating efficiency. Combined with our tremendous luxury brand, solid balance sheet, healthy liquidity and premier land holdings, we are well positioned to deliver strong financial results, achieve long-term growth and continue returning capital to stockholders.”

[TITLE]AI UltraProd Announces U.S. Market Entry with Strategic Focus on High-Growth ADU Sector:
[TEXT]
SecureTech Backing Enables AI UltraProd’s U.S. Accessory Dwelling Unit Beachhead; 2026 Rollout and Expansion Strategy

Roseville, Minnesota, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AI UltraProd, Inc. ("Ai UltraProd", AIUP", or "the Company"), a global leader in AI-driven industrial solutions specializing in robotic 3D printing and advanced intelligent manufacturing systems, and a wholly owned subsidiary of SecureTech Innovations, Inc. (“SecureTech”) (OTCQB: SCTH), today announced its official entry into the United States market, beginning with a focused strategy centered on the rapidly expanding Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) sector.

The decision follows extensive market analysis, emerging regulatory alignment, and growing nationwide demand for faster, more sustainable, and more affordable residential construction solutions. This groundwork was led by the SecureTech executive and consultancy team, whose research, strategic modeling, and capital-planning framework identified the ADU sector as a credible, viable, and fastest path for AI UltraProd to establish its U.S. beachhead and generate early cashflow from market entry endeavors. The U.S. ADU market, valued across multiple studies at between $20–30 billion by 2034 with annual growth projections ranging from 9% to 19%, presents what management describes as an ‘immediate, scalable, and velocity-driven opportunity’ for AI-powered construction technology.

AI UltraProd’s U.S. "beachhead" strategy is built on its proprietary blend of deep-integration AI, multi-domain construction robotics, and patented high-performance materials such as Geo Mix and Geo Add . Together, these technologies enable printing of vertical wall systems for a 2,000 sq. ft. home in just days. This can reduce labor needs by up to 70%; cutting material waste by up to 80% and significantly shrinking project timelines impacted by traditional permitting and labor bottlenecks.

The company aims to address the nation’s mobility, affordability, and housing shortages by first demonstrating its capabilities through the ADU marketplace, which offer fast deployment cycles and lower permitting friction in forward-thinking states such as California, Oregon, and Washington.

“Our entry into the United States begins with a clear and highly intentional focus: the ADU market,” said Xing YunZhu, Director of AI UltraProd. “We believe that ADUs are the perfect proving ground for our robotic construction technology. They are high-demand, high-velocity projects that allow us to demonstrate tangible advantages—speed, cost efficiency, design intelligence, and sustainability—while building trust with developers, municipalities, and communities. This is the first step in a long-term plan that we firmly believe will scale into multiple sectors across the U.S.”

The company is already generating revenue (just over $3.7M during the three months ended September 30) and is positively contributing to SecureTech’s financials (as reported). Anticipated to reach roughly eight figures by the close of 2025 and likely to exceed this in 2026, management is executing what they believe to be a sharp, multi-layered market entry and rollout strategy. Management presumes that in this way, the Company would be on path to unlocking its ability to efficiently build emergency medical facilities, disaster relief housing, critical infrastructure, and even off-planet construction in the most viable, reliable and expedient way.

Mr. J. Scott Sitra, President and CEO of SecureTech Innovations, Inc., added, “AI UltraProd’s technology represents a transformational shift in how construction can be executed at scale. The U.S. housing market has reached a critical point where traditional methods cannot keep up—creating a perfect environment for AI-driven manufacturing and 3D printing. Beginning with ADUs gives us a strategic foundation to expand into larger residential, commercial, and industrial applications in the coming phases.”

A Strategic Launch with Future Milestones Planned

Today's announcement marks the first in a series of milestones related to AI UltraProd’s U.S. market entry and expansion. The company, with the support of SecureTech’s executive and consultancy team, is already in the process of developing its first U.S.-based “Lighthouse Project” (a compact, high-impact deployment designed to showcase the full capabilities of its AI-integrated robotic construction system in a real-world American environment). Details on the Lighthouse Project, partnerships, and deployment locations will be released in upcoming communications.

Management Encourages...

Banks in the Asia-Pacific region, including those in India, have built stronger capital positions compared to their counterparts in the United States and Western Europe, Moody's highlighted in its latest survey report.The survey pointed out that a comparison of the largest banks in Asia-Pacific systems with peers in the US and Western Europe shows they generally have built strong capital positions under prudent regulatory supervision.Further, it noted that large Asia-Pacific banks' risk-weighted asset (RWA) densities reflect their underlying asset risks, consistent with their credit losses for the past 10 years. It also added that the banks' RWA densities vary across the Asia-Pacific.Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) represent a bank's assets adjusted for risk levels, meaning loans or investments considered riskier are assigned higher weights. A bank with higher RWA density indicates that a larger part of its assets carries higher risk.Explaining the capital strength, Moody's highlighted, "Large private sector banks in India have high CET1 capital adequacy and leverage ratios because their internal capital generation has outpaced their RWA growth in the past couple of years, and they can raise equity easily from capital markets when needed."CET1, or Common Equity Tier 1 capital, refers to a bank's core capital, primarily common shares and retained earnings, which serves as the first line of financial protection against losses. A higher CET1 ratio indicates a stronger ability to absorb shocks without affecting depositors.The report mentioned that as of the end of 2024, the average reported CET1 capital adequacy ratios of the large banks in Hong Kong, India, Korea in the sample stood at 18.0 per cent, 14.7 per cent, and 14.5 per cent, respectively, all above 13.5 per cent for the four largest banks in the US and 13.8 per cent for the top six banks in Western Europe.According to the survey, these banks can also raise equity easily from the capital markets when required. However, it stated that their government-owned peers remain weaker than private banks in both metrics.The report attributed the higher RWA densities in India, Vietnam and among certain Chinese banks to the use of the standardized approach, a regulatory method that assigns fixed risk weights rather than relying on banks' internal risk assessment models.It added that regulators in India have announced plans allowing banks to transition to the more advanced IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) approach by 2028, a move expected to lower RWA densities if successfully implemented.For India, the sample included State Bank of India ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank , together accounting for approximately 50 per cent of system assets.Overall, the report assessed a total of 35 banks across eight key Asia-Pacific banking systems, representing 75 per cent of total assets of all rated banks in these markets.

Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) represent a bank's assets adjusted for risk levels, meaning loans or investments considered riskier are assigned higher weights. A bank with higher RWA density indicates that a larger part of its assets carries higher risk.

Explaining the capital strength, Moody's highlighted, "Large private sector banks in India have high CET1 capital adequacy and leverage ratios because their internal capital generation has outpaced their RWA growth in the past couple of years, and they can raise equity easily from capital markets when needed." CET1, or Common Equity Tier 1 capital, refers to a bank's core capital, primarily common shares and retained earnings, which serves as the first line of financial protection against losses.

A higher CET1 ratio indicates a stronger ability to absorb shocks without affecting depositors.The report mentioned that as of the end of 2024, the average reported CET1 capital adequacy ratios of the large banks in Hong Kong, India, Korea in the sample stood at 18.0 per cent, 14.7 per cent, and 14.5 per cent, respectively, all above 13.5 per cent for the four largest banks in the US and 13.8 per cent for the top six banks in Western Europe.

According to the survey, these banks can also raise equity easily from the capital markets when required. However, it stated that their government-owned peers remain weaker than private banks in both metrics.The report attributed the higher RWA densities in India, Vietnam and among certain Chinese banks to the use of the standardised approach, a regulatory method that assigns fixed risk weights rather than relying on banks' internal risk assessment models.

It added that regulators in India have announced plans allowing banks to transition to the more advanced IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) approach by 2028, a move expected to lower RWA densities if successfully implemented. For India, the sample included State Bank of India, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, together accounting for approximately 50 per cent of system assets.

Overall, the report assessed a total of 35 banks across eight key Asia-Pacific banking systems, representing 75 per cent of total assets of all rated banks in these markets.

[TITLE]EU plan would boost ESMA powers over crypto and capital markets:
[TEXT]
The European Commission has proposed expanding the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) over crypto and broader financial markets in a bid to narrow the competitive gap with the United States.

Published Thursday, the package would transfer “direct supervisory competences” for key pieces of market infrastructure, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), trading venues and central counterparties, to ESMA and strengthen its coordination role in the asset management sector.

The proposal still needs approval from the European Parliament and the Council, where it is under negotiation.

If adopted, ESMA’s role in overseeing EU capital markets would more closely resemble the centralized framework of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

EU proposal aims to streamline markets and strengthen ESMA’s authority. Source: finance.ec.europa.eu

In September, France became the third European country to call for the Paris-based ESMA to take over supervision of major crypto firms, joining Austrian and Italian securities regulators.

The move followed growing criticism of Malta’s crypto licensing regime. In July, ESMA released a peer review of the Malta Financial Services Authority’s authorization of a crypto service provider, saying that the regulator only “partially met expectations.”

Due to concerns over more lenient regulations in some jurisdictions, France has also threatened to block the “passporting” of European licenses obtained from member states, raising enforcement gaps

In our fourth quarter, we met or exceeded guidance across all of our core home building metrics, generating $3.4 billion in home sales revenue with an adjusted gross margin of 27.1% and an SG&A margin of 8.3%. We earned $4.58 per diluted share, which was modestly below guidance due to the delayed closing of the sale of our Apartment Living business that we announced in September.

“Given soft demand across many markets, we remain focused on running our business in a disciplined manner and consistent with our long-term strategic objective of maximizing returns for stockholders. We continue to balance price and pace and are actively managing our spec starts and inventory on a community-by-community basis to best match local demand conditions. We control sufficient land to support continued community count growth over the next several years, including 8% to 10% growth in fiscal 2026, and we remain highly disciplined and selective in new land acquisition as we continue to focus on capital efficiency.

“Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate that our luxury business is differentiated, as we serve a more affluent customer who is less impacted by affordability pressures. These results also underscore the resilience of our business model, which includes a healthy balance of build-to-order and spec homes, a broad geographic footprint, the widest variety of home offerings and price points in the industry, and improved operating efficiency. Combined with our tremendous luxury brand, solid balance sheet, healthy liquidity and premier land holdings, we are well positioned to deliver strong financial results, achieve long-term growth and continue returning capital to stockholders.”

[TITLE]AI UltraProd Announces U.S. Market Entry with Strategic Focus on High-Growth ADU Sector:
[TEXT]
SecureTech Backing Enables AI UltraProd’s U.S. Accessory Dwelling Unit Beachhead; 2026 Rollout and Expansion Strategy

Roseville, Minnesota, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AI UltraProd, Inc. ("Ai UltraProd", AIUP", or "the Company"), a global leader in AI-driven industrial solutions specializing in robotic 3D printing and advanced intelligent manufacturing systems, and a wholly owned subsidiary of SecureTech Innovations, Inc. (“SecureTech”) (OTCQB: SCTH), today announced its official entry into the United States market, beginning with a focused strategy centered on the rapidly expanding Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) sector.

The decision follows extensive market analysis, emerging regulatory alignment, and growing nationwide demand for faster, more sustainable, and more affordable residential construction solutions. This groundwork was led by the SecureTech executive and consultancy team, whose research, strategic modeling, and capital-planning framework identified the ADU sector as a credible, viable, and fastest path for AI UltraProd to establish its U.S. beachhead and generate early cashflow from market entry endeavors. The U.S. ADU market, valued across multiple studies at between $20–30 billion by 2034 with annual growth projections ranging from 9% to 19%, presents what management describes as an ‘immediate, scalable, and velocity-driven opportunity’ for AI-powered construction technology.

AI UltraProd’s U.S. "beachhead" strategy is built on its proprietary blend of deep-integration AI, multi-domain construction robotics, and patented high-performance materials such as Geo Mix and Geo Add . Together, these technologies enable printing of vertical wall systems for a 2,000 sq. ft. home in just days. This can reduce labor needs by up to 70%; cutting material waste by up to 80% and significantly shrinking project timelines impacted by traditional permitting and labor bottlenecks.

The company aims to address the nation’s mobility, affordability, and housing shortages by first demonstrating its capabilities through the ADU marketplace, which offer fast deployment cycles and lower permitting friction in forward-thinking states such as California, Oregon, and Washington.

“Our entry into the United States begins with a clear and highly intentional focus: the ADU market,” said Xing YunZhu, Director of AI UltraProd. “We believe that ADUs are the perfect proving ground for our robotic construction technology. They are high-demand, high-velocity projects that allow us to demonstrate tangible advantages—speed, cost efficiency, design intelligence, and sustainability—while building trust with developers, municipalities, and communities. This is the first step in a long-term plan that we firmly believe will scale into multiple sectors across the U.S.”

The company is already generating revenue (just over $3.7M during the three months ended September 30) and is positively contributing to SecureTech’s financials (as reported). Anticipated to reach roughly eight figures by the close of 2025 and likely to exceed this in 2026, management is executing what they believe to be a sharp, multi-layered market entry and rollout strategy. Management presumes that in this way, the Company would be on path to unlocking its ability to efficiently build emergency medical facilities, disaster relief housing, critical infrastructure, and even off-planet construction in the most viable, reliable and expedient way.

Mr. J. Scott Sitra, President and CEO of SecureTech Innovations, Inc., added, “AI UltraProd’s technology represents a transformational shift in how construction can be executed at scale. The U.S. housing market has reached a critical point where traditional methods cannot keep up—creating a perfect environment for AI-driven manufacturing and 3D printing. Beginning with ADUs gives us a strategic foundation to expand into larger residential, commercial, and industrial applications in the coming phases.”

A Strategic Launch with Future Milestones Planned

Today's announcement marks the first in a series of milestones related to AI UltraProd’s U.S. market entry and expansion. The company, with the support of SecureTech’s executive and consultancy team, is already in the process of developing its first U.S.-based “Lighthouse Project” (a compact, high-impact deployment designed to showcase the full capabilities of its AI-integrated robotic construction system in a real-world American environment). Details on the Lighthouse Project, partnerships, and deployment locations will be released in upcoming communications.

[TITLE]Europe Fast-Tracks Industrial Electrification With €1B Auction:
[TEXT]
The European Commission’s announcement of the first-ever EU-wide industrial electrification auction marks more than a new funding mechanism; it represents a philosophical shift in how Europe intends to decarbonize its industries, and a signal that, at least for now, electrons are pulling ahead of molecules in the energy transition race.

With a budget of €1 billion under the Innovation Fund, the pilot auction will subsidize the direct electrification of industrial process heat, one of the most stubborn and carbon-intensive parts of the industrial value chain. This is the world’s first auction of its kind, and its implications stretch far beyond factory walls.

Electrifying the hardest heat

Process heat is the silent giant of industrial emissions. It powers furnaces, reactors, dryers, and kilns in sectors ranging from steel and cement to chemicals, glass, and food production. It accounts for roughly one quarter of Europe’s industrial CO2 footprint, yet remains largely fossil-fueled.

The new auction directly targets that problem. Eligible technologies include industrial heat pumps, electric boilers, resistance and induction systems, plasma torches, as well as solar thermal and geothermal systems. In essence, it opens the door for any system that replaces fossil heat with clean electricity or direct renewable heat.

Projects will compete for a fixed premium subsidy per tonne of CO2 abated, paid for up to five years. This results-based model rewards measurable carbon reduction rather than theoretical potential, an important distinction. By tying payments to verified performance, the EU hopes to attract bankable projects and bridge the economic gap between conventional and electrified heat.

The auction is expected to open in December 2025, giving the industry a year to configure systems, partnerships, and monitoring plans. That may sound distant, but in industrial planning terms, it is the blink of an eye.

A test of scale and speed

The significance of this auction goes beyond the €1 billion headline. It signals that electrification has matured from an efficiency measure to a pillar of industrial decarbonization policy.

While Europe has spent years debating hydrogen backbones, carbon capture networks, and cross-border CO2 storage, electrification is quietly emerging as the fastest-moving front. The technologies exist, the supply chains are mostly domestic, and the emissions benefits are immediate.

Industrial heat pumps and electric boilers can be installed within existing plants, often with minimal permitting. They integrate naturally with renewables and with the grid, especially when paired with flexibility measures that shift demand away from peak hours. In a system increasingly constrained by intermittency, these grid-friendly industrial assets are valuable not only for emissions reduction but for balancing electricity supply and demand.

By contrast, molecule-based pathways such as hydrogen, synthetic fuels, or CCS remain hampered by high costs, infrastructure bottlenecks, and fragmented policy support. Hydrogen production still depends on expensive electrolysers and clean power availability. CCS requires transport and storage capacity that remains scarce and politically sensitive.

In short, electrons can move faster than molecules.

The economics of momentum

The economics reinforce this trend. Electrified heat is capital-intensive but relatively simple to finance once policy provides a predictable premium. The auction’s pay-per-ton model mimics the logic of the U.S. 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, reward verified abatement, de-risks investment, and lets the market find the most efficient projects.

Hydrogen and CCS, meanwhile, remain hostage to system-level costs. Producing, transporting, and storing molecules, whether hydrogen or CO2, demands massive, integrated infrastructure that no single project can justify alone. Without a guaranteed offtake market or a predictable price for avoided carbon, private investors stay cautious.

That difference in scalability may define the next decade of European decarbonization. Electrification can move incrementally, one boiler, one line, one plant at a time. Molecule-based systems need a whole ecosystem to move together.

Europe’s strategic rebalancing

The timing of this policy pivot is not accidental. High gas prices, volatile ETS costs, and tightening climate targets have forced policymakers to confront industrial exposure to fossil fuel volatility. By electrifying heat with locally sourced renewables, Europe strengthens both energy security and industrial competitiveness.

There is also a deeper strategic message. The electrification auction is a prototype for what the Commission calls the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank, a permanent facility to finance low-carbon industrial investment. If the pilot succeeds, it could expand into a much larger platform, channeling billions into technologies that reduce industrial CO2 at source.

In that sense, this is more than a funding call, it is a stress test for Europe’s ability to move from rhetoric to replication.

The coming divergence, electrons vs. molecules

This growing divergence between electron-based and molecule-based approaches reflects a broader philosophical split in Europe’s transition planning.

Hydrogen and CCS have long dominated headlines, political speeches, and national strategies. They are indispensable for deep decarbonization, no one doubts that, but their deployment remains slow, costly, and infrastructure-heavy. Electrification, on the other hand, advances quietly because it relies on existing systems.

In practice, a factory can replace a fossil boiler with an electric one far faster than it can install a CCS unit or switch to hydrogen combustion. The capital costs may be comparable, but the regulatory and infrastructure complexity is not. That simplicity could make electrification Europe’s bridge technology for the 2030s, cutting emissions now, while hydrogen and CCS catch up.

The danger, of course, is overcorrection. A Europe that bets everything on electrification could still hit limits, grid capacity, renewable intermittency, and high industrial electricity prices. The challenge will be to use auctions like this not as an endpoint, but as a learning mechanism to optimize system integration, combining the immediacy of electrification with the longer-term flexibility of low-carbon molecules.

A quiet revolution in industrial policy

For decades, industrial decarbonization was seen as a future problem. The Innovation Fund’s electrification auction brings it into the present tense. It rewards results, not roadmaps, and signals that Brussels is finally willing to spend serious money on proven solutions.

It also marks a new chapter in industrial policy, Europe is starting to back winners based on technological readiness, not political symmetry. Where hydrogen and CCS still depend on frameworks under construction, electrification now has a launchpad.

Whether this becomes a model for future auctions covering cooling, storage, or low-carbon feedstocks will depend on its success in attracting viable bids and delivering measurable CO2 reductions. But the direction of travel is clear, Europe wants to move from blueprints to building sites.

The transition’s next inflection point

In the end, the auction’s real importance lies in its symbolism. For years, Europe has talked about industrial decarbonization as a long-term challenge. This initiative says something different, the technologies are ready, the money is available, and the political case is undeniable.

Electrons may not solve everything, but they are solving something now. Molecules will follow, eventually. The race is no longer between technologies, but between time and temperature.

Europe’s first industrial electrification auction may not make headlines like hydrogen valleys or CCS hubs, but in terms of tangible progress, it might just prove the most consequential.

[TITLE]Boeing completes acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems:
[TEXT]
Boeing says it has completed an acquisition of aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems, saying the move will allow for more seamless operations and enhance quality control.

Closure of the deal, first announced in July 2024, comes at a "pivotal" moment for the aviation giant, said Boeing Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg. The deal is worth $8.3 billion, including Spirit debt assumed by Boeing.

"As we welcome our new teammates and bring our two companies together, our focus is on maintaining stability so we can continue delivering high quality airplanes, differentiated services, and advanced defense capabilities for our customers and the industry," Ortberg said.

Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit manufactures fuselages for commercial planes, as well as key parts for defense and space projects.

The deal includes most of its Belfast manufacturing operation, which will now operate as an independent subsidiary of Boeing under the name Short Brothers.

Its 2,400 workers will also now become part of Boeing's workforce.

The remainder of the Belfast operation have transferred to European rival Airbus as part of the deal. This followed competition approvals in the United States and Europe, which required the transfer of any of Spirit's business that currently supplies Airbus.

Boeing announced Monday that it completed an acquisition of aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems, saying the move will allow for more seamless operations and enhance quality control.

Closure of the deal, first announced in July 2024, comes at a “pivotal” moment for the aviation giant, said Boeing Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg. The deal is worth $8.3 billion, including Spirit debt assumed by Boeing.

“As we welcome our new teammates and bring our two companies together, our focus is on maintaining stability so we can continue delivering high quality airplanes, differentiated services, and advanced defense capabilities for our customers and the industry,” Ortberg said.

Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit manufactures fuselages for commercial planes, as well as key parts for defense and space projects.

The deal’s closure follows antitrust approvals in the United States and Europe that included the sale to Airbus of all Spirit’s businesses that currently supply the European aerospace group — Boeing’s main competitor.
