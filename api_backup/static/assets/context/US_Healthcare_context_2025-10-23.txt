[TITLE]Muhurat Trading: Piramal Pharma, Blue Jet Healthcare In Focus — Check New Stock Rating, Price Target:
[TEXT]
Kotak Institutional Equities has upgraded Blue Jet Healthcare to a 'buy' rating while increasing the target price for Piramal Pharma, as the brokerage firm cited big opportunities for both the pharmaceutical companies in the rapidly evolving global market for high-cholesterol drugs.

In its latest note, Kotak noted that the market for cholesterol drugs is going through significant innovation. New oral therapies are coming up to challenge traditional treatments, which in turn could serve as an opportunity for domestic players such as Blue Jet and Piramal Pharma.

Kotak has maintained its 'buy' rating on Piramal Pharma while increasing the target price from Rs 305 to Rs 325, citing the company's manufacturing contract agreement with New Amsterdam for a fixed-dose combination of Obicetrapib and Ezetimibe.

Obicetrapib and Ezetimibe are two separate medications, which, when used together, form a dual-action therapy to lower cholesterol levels.

Piramal's deal with New Amsterdam is expected to general annual sales of $50 million, likely starting somewhere around FY28.

Kotak believes this deal will help Piramal Pharma make use of an under-utilised facility in Sellersville, potentially helping the company offset a projected FY24 Ebitda loss of $15 million at the site.

As for Blue Jet Healthcare, Kotak Institutional Equities has made a contradictory move by upgrading the stock from 'add' to 'buy' while lowering the target price significantly.

Kotak has lowered the target price for Blue Jet from Rs 900 to Rs 825, citing the lowering of long-term earnings estimates for its key drug, Bempedoic acid.

At the same time, the brokerage firm believes the recent drawdown in the Blue Jet stock - around 34% in the last three months - is overdone and therefore, Kotak believes this has created an attractive entry point for investors. This is why the firm has upgraded the stock to a 'buy' whilst lowering the target price.

[TITLE]Healthcare Personal Protective Equipment Research Report 2025: A $13.1 Billion Market by 2030 Dominated by 3M, Ansell, Top Glove, Molnlycke, O&M Halyard, Cardinal Health, Hartalega and Winner Medical:

The global market for healthcare PPE equipment is expected to grow from $10.3 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $13.1 billion by the end of 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030.

PPE, including gloves, gowns, aprons and masks, is vital in mitigating HAI-related risks. PPE functions as a frontline defense by protecting healthcare workers and patients from infectious agents during care delivery. Employers at healthcare organizations or institutions, such as hospitals, clinics, care homes, or other medical facilities, are legally obligated under health and safety laws to conduct risk assessments and implement control measures, including the provision and correct use of PPE, to reduce patient harm from exposure to infectious agents. As essential medical devices, PPE also falls under broader regulatory frameworks designed to ensure safety and efficacy. The routine use of PPE is reducing the incidence of HAIs and preventing the spread of infectious diseases in healthcare settings.

Gloves and protective clothing such as surgical gowns and isolation gowns are the most widely used PPE equipment in healthcare settings. The leading companies in the healthcare PPE market are 3M, Ansell Ltd., Top Glove Corp. Bhd, Molnlycke Health Care, O&M Halyard Inc., Cardinal Health, Hartalega and Winner Medical.

[TITLE]MOH SECURITIES NEWS: Molina Healthcare, Inc. Faces Securities Fraud Allegations after Stock Drops 16% -- Contact BFA Law by December 2 Class Action Deadline:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in Molina, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/molina-healthcare-inc-class-action.

Investors have until December 2, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Molina securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and is captioned: Hindlemann v. Molina Healthcare, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-9461.

Why Was Molina Sued Under the Federal Securities Laws?

Molina is a health insurance company that provides managed healthcare services to low-income individuals under Medicaid and Medicare programs. During the relevant period, Molina stated that the Company’s “earnings growth profile” was “solid heading into 2025.” The Company also told investors that it “continuously monitor[ed] utilization patterns” and that it was able to “mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation.” In truth, as alleged, Molina faced increased medical costs pressures that it could not mitigate due to increased utilization in all three of its business lines.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On July 7, 2025, Molina revealed that its Q2 2025 adjusted earnings were approximately $5.50 per share, which was “below its prior expectations” due to “medical cost pressures in all three lines of business.” The Company announced it “expects these medical cost pressures to continue into the second half of the year” and cut guidance for expected adjusted earnings per share by 10.2% at the midpoint to a “range of $21.50 to $22.50 per share.”

Then, on July 23, 2025, Molina revealed that it “now expects its full year 2025 adjusted earnings to be no less than $19.00 per diluted share.” Molina stated this was due to a “challenging medical cost trend environment,” including increased “utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services.” On this news, the price of Molina stock fell $32.03 per share, or 16.8%, from $190.25 per share on July 23, 2025, to $158.22 per share on July 24, 2025.

Key Factors Driving the Growth of the Emphysema Market

Rising Prevalence of Emphysema and COPD

The increasing prevalence of COPD, including emphysema, is a primary driver. Factors such as smoking, air pollution, and genetic predispositions contribute to this rise. In 2024, DelveInsight estimated that the 7MM had around 31 million diagnosed cases of COPD, including approximately 8.5 million cases of emphysema, with prevalence projected to grow throughout the forecast period (2025–2034).

Advancements in Emphysema Treatment Options

Innovations in pharmacological treatments, including bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and biologics, have improved patient outcomes. Notably, drugs like DUPIXENT and OHTUVAYRE have shown efficacy in treating COPD and are expanding the therapeutic landscape.

Launch of Emerging Emphysema Drugs

Some of the emphysema drugs in clinical trials include SAR447537 (Sanofi), Alvelestat (Mereo BioPharma), BEAM-302 (Beam Therapeutics), itepekimab (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals/Sanofi), depemokimab (GSK), tozorakimab (AstraZeneca), and others. The anticipated launch of these drugs will drive the emphysema market forward in the coming years.

Emphysema Market Analysis

Current emphysema management involves the use of bronchodilators (both short- and long-acting β2-agonists and anticholinergics), inhaled corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, biologics such as OHTUVAYRE (Verona Pharma) and DUPIXENT (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals/Sanofi), combination therapies like TRELEGY ELLIPTA (GSK), along with supportive interventions including pulmonary rehabilitation and oxygen therapy.

Despite these options, significant unmet needs remain in emphysema treatment. Challenges include limited disease-modifying therapies, inadequate control of exacerbations, variable patient responses, and a lack of long-acting therapies targeting the underlying inflammation and disease progression.

To address these gaps, new therapies such as itepekimab (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals/Sanofi), depemokimab (GSK), tozorakimab (AstraZeneca), and others are in development. These emerging treatments feature novel mechanisms of action and the potential for improved tolerability, potentially providing more durable benefits for patients who do not respond sufficiently to current therapies.

[TITLE]Novo Nordisk's top investor seizes board control in weight-loss drug battle:
[TEXT]
By Stine Jacobsen, Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Maggie Fick

COPENHAGEN/LONDON (Reuters) -Novo Nordisk's top investor moved to take control of the drugmaker's board on Tuesday, vowing a sharper focus on the key U.S. market to revive sales of blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy as Novo's chair and six independent board members quit.

The non-profit Novo Nordisk Foundation, which combines business ownership with philanthropy, said it would propose its own chair Lars Rebien Sorensen - a former Novo CEO - to lead the Danish drugmaker's board for the next two or three years.

Novo said current chair Helge Lund and six other independent board members would step down next month after a dispute with the foundation over the pace of change at the company.

The clash brings fresh upheaval to a company that soared to become Europe's most valuable company last year on the huge success of Wegovy, only for its shares to plunge more than 40% this year as rival Eli Lilly grabbed market share.

FOUNDATION BACKS NEW NOVO CEO DOUSTDAR

The foundation criticised the outgoing board for being too slow to recognise shifts in the key U.S. market and too cautious on management change. It flagged a need to put more focus on the growing direct-to-consumer and mass markets.

Sorensen said that it had wanted wholesale change on Novo's board, but backed new CEO Mike Doustdar who took over in August and has ushered in widespread job cuts and a drive to refocus the company on its key markets.

"We are fully aligned behind that," Sorensen said in a call after the news. "We believed in the foundation board that we needed a fresh set of eyes, new energy to support management on this very important process."

Novo said Lund and the other independent directors would step down at an extraordinary shareholder meeting on November 14 after it had been impossible to reach a "common understanding" over the make-up of the board.

The move is the latest by the foundation to increase control over Novo as it seeks to restore sales and investor confidence. It pushed for the early exit of previous CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen in May.

Sorensen played down the feud, saying in response to one question that he "preferred not to have it coined as a coup". Instead the shift would help Novo in its key U.S. market, which he said currently had a "very transactional model".

Novo, like many rivals, is facing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower drug prices.

The foundation proposed six new board members - all European, but five of them with long experience in pharmaceuticals and related industries such as biotech and health tech.

[TITLE]Revium Rx Advances Toward Phase 1 Clinical Development of Nano-Mupirocin to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Infections:
[TEXT]
TEL AVIV, Israel, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Revium Rx (formerly Revium Recovery Inc. (OTC: RVRC), a biopharmaceutical company developing advanced lipid-based therapeutics for infectious and oncologic diseases, today announced significant progress in its regulatory and manufacturing programs supporting the planned Phase 1 clinical trial of its lead product candidate, Nano-Mupirocin - a novel systemic formulation of the well-known and highly potent antibiotic mupirocin.

“Our novel formulation of Nano-Mupirocin is designed to overcome the inherent limitation of mupirocin’s instability in blood and to expand its use beyond topical applications into systemic treatment for severe bacterial infections”, says Amir Avraham, the CEO, - “the formulation aims to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the bloodstream and effectively target deep-tissue infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE), and Ceftriaxone-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae”.

Last month, the company submitted its clinical trial application to the Israeli Ministry of Health, marking a critical milestone toward the initiation of first-in-human studies in early 2026. Concurrently, Revium Rx, in collaboration with WuXi AppTec, one of the world’s leading global CDMOs, continues to advance the scale-up and production of its GMP clinical batch, with final release expected by the end of 2025.

Addressing the Urgent Threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)

In 2021, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) was estimated to have caused approximately 130,000 deaths directly attributable to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) — a sharp rise from 57,200 in 1990. According to the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project published in The Lancet in 2022, MRSA was responsible for over 100,000 AMR-attributable deaths in 2019, making it one of the deadliest pathogens that year. Broader GRAM data indicate that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million deaths globally in 2019. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Summit on AMR held in 2024 further underscored the escalating threat, warning that AMR-related fatalities may approach 2 million annually by 2050 without decisive global intervention. The GRAM study projects that without intervention, AMR will directly cause 39 million deaths between 2025 and 2050, with annual mortality expected to rise nearly 70 % by mid-century.

MRSA alone accounts for over 100,000 AMR-attributable deaths annually. These alarming data underscore the urgent medical need for new systemic antibiotics such as Nano-Mupirocin.

Significant and Growing Market Opportunity

The global AMR therapeutics market was valued at USD 8.7 billion in 2023 and is projected to exceed USD 12.5 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.3 %, according to Grand View Research, 2024.

Within this rapidly expanding global market, Nano-Mupirocin targets several high-value infectious disease indications, including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE), and Ceftriaxone-Resistant Gonorrhea (CR-Gonorrhea). If Nano-Mupirocin demonstrates favorable results in clinical trials, of which no assurance can be provided, the Company will seek to capture a meaningful share within this rapidly expanding market, reflecting both the urgent clinical need and the significant commercial potential of novel antibiotics effective against resistant pathogens. “By targeting these difficult-to-treat infections with a novel nano-liposomal formulation of a known highly-potent antibiotic, ReviumRx is positioned to play a meaningful role in the global fight against AMR”, adds Amir Avraham, the CEO of Revium Rx.

[TITLE]Healthcare Personal Protective Equipment Research Report 2025: A $13.1 Billion Market by 2030 Dominated by 3M, Ansell, Top Glove, Molnlycke, O&M Halyard, Cardinal Health, Hartalega and Winner Medical:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Healthcare Personal Protective Equipment: Global Markets" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for healthcare PPE equipment is expected to grow from $10.3 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $13.1 billion by the end of 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030.

PPE, including gloves, gowns, aprons and masks, is vital in mitigating HAI-related risks. PPE functions as a frontline defense by protecting healthcare workers and patients from infectious agents during care delivery. Employers at healthcare organizations or institutions, such as hospitals, clinics, care homes, or other medical facilities, are legally obligated under health and safety laws to conduct risk assessments and implement control measures, including the provision and correct use of PPE, to reduce patient harm from exposure to infectious agents. As essential medical devices, PPE also falls under broader regulatory frameworks designed to ensure safety and efficacy. The routine use of PPE is reducing the incidence of HAIs and preventing the spread of infectious diseases in healthcare settings.

Gloves and protective clothing such as surgical gowns and isolation gowns are the most widely used PPE equipment in healthcare settings. The leading companies in the healthcare PPE market are 3M, Ansell Ltd., Top Glove Corp. Bhd, Molnlycke Health Care, O&M Halyard Inc., Cardinal Health, Hartalega and Winner Medical.
