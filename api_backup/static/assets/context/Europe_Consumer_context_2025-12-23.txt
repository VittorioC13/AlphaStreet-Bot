[TITLE]6 Big Changes Coming To Walmart In 2026:
[TEXT]
We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.

As 2026 barrels toward us, we're making resolutions to improve ourselves, and Walmart is no different. The company is starting off the year with a change in leadership at the very top. Doug McMillon, CEO and President of Walmart Inc., is retiring on January 31, 2026, after nearly 12 years in the job and more than 40 years with the company, although he's staying on in an advisory capacity for another 12 months. McMillon is being replaced by John Furner, who, like McMillon, started with Walmart as an hourly employee. Furner worked his way up to become President and CEO of Walmart U.S. in 2019, so it's safe to say he knows what he's getting into.

This leadership move marks a new era for Walmart, one in which it's doubling down on the use of technology and AI, from the warehouse all the way to the checkout counter. It's not throwing down the gauntlet to Amazon just yet, but the company is signaling its commitment to leveling up its tech with another major move. In December 2025, it transitioned its shares from the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq, the largest company ever to do so. The Nasdaq is the more tech-focused exchange, so Walmart's shift is sending a very public message about the direction it's taking going forward. Speaking with CNBC, McMillon stated, "Walmart's changed a lot, and we're trying to make sure everybody knows it." So what changes will we actually see from the company in the year ahead?

[TITLE]Can money buy Americans happiness?:
[TEXT]
is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.

Ordinary Americans today enjoy a living standard that would have awed kings for most of human history.

We live in homes conditioned to our ideal temperature in any season; drive vehicles that pack the power of 250 horses into a 100-square-foot metal frame; carry six-ounce rectangles that offer instant access to virtually any loved one, book, song, fact, or pornography; inhale gases that take the pain out of any surgery; replace our worn-out hips with titanium; glide 40,000 feet above the Earth in pressurized aluminum tubes; and eat ground beef wrapped in tacos made of Doritos.

But we don’t seem that jazzed

[TITLE]How this 30-year-old turned her junk journaling hobby into a business after being laid off from her dream job:
[TEXT]
Nandi Owolo is the founder of Junk Journal Club, through which she hosts in-person crafting events and supports an online community worldwide.

Nandi Owolo's first foray into junk journaling came by accident. One day in June 2024, Owolo fell while walking her dog. "I started junk journaling because I broke my foot on my birthday, of all days," she tells CNBC Make It. She was homebound on doctor's orders for two months of recovery. Then, by way of some TikTok scrolling, junk journaling came into her life. The L.A. resident says junk journaling, described as "as a cross between scrapbooking, creative journaling and collage art," made her feel crafty for the first time in her life. "I personally think that I have no artistic skill," says Owolo, now 30. "I can't draw; I can't knit; I can't paint." Arranging and gluing down souvenirs, photos and stickers into chaotically colorful spreads? That she could do. Junk journaling, also considered "Gen Z's version of scrapbooking," has taken off in recent years. Enthusiasts say they like that the hobby keeps them off their phones. It taps into the nostalgia of collecting and displaying physical media. And there are no rules in arranging personal mementos from the grand, like concert tickets or birthday cards, to the everyday, like a restaurant napkin or coffee sleeve. The hobby is "one man's trash is another man's treasure" come to life, and its embrace of imperfection is part of the appeal, Owolo says: "It's an artistic medium in which you can do whatever you want with the page," she says.

Add in an element of in-person gathering, which many young people are craving post-pandemic, and Owolo says she felt she had a hit on her hands. Two months after beginning her own crafting journey, Owolo launched the social media handles for Junk Journal Club and hosted her first meetup through a local social club where she was a member. The event quickly reached maximum capacity at 35 people, which Owolo says signaled to her that there was a big demand. Owolo soon held her second event at a park with 60 people. A year and a half later, she now regularly hosts ticketed events for 20 to 30 guests at $35 to $50 a pop between one and three times per month. Owolo says she believes her Junk Journal Club is the first U.S. club dedicated to hosting real-life events for the hobby. She also launched a Discord channel for users around the world to connect, share inspiration, post their pages and send each other care packages via a pen pal program. The group now boasts nearly 2,000 members around the U.S. and internationally, including Canada, Germany, Australia and beyond.

From job loss to entrepreneurship

May 2025 marked a turning point for Owolo and her Junk Journal Club. The entertainment professional lost what she calls her "dream job" working to turn books and comics into TV shows and movies. While grieving the "heartbreaking layoff," Owolo says she recognized an opportunity in Junk Journal Club. "As cliche as it is, it's like I had this other thing that I had more control over," she says. "No one can lay me off from Junk Journal Club. It is mine." Owolo got to work figuring out how she wanted to grow the business and decided to go after branded events. She set a goal to collaborate with two brands by the end of 2025.

Nandi Owolo launched Junk Journal Club in August 2024 and turned it into her full-time business in 2025. She hosts one to three events each month, which often sell out quickly. Courtesy of Nandi Owolo

[TITLE]From Farming to Fashion, the Trends Shaping the Cotton Industry for 2026:
[TEXT]
A year drawing to a close marks a time of reflection for many. And for two of the industry’s relentlessly hopeful sectors—farming and retail—it’s also a time to take stock and consider the outlook for next year.

In the farming branch, cotton prices have been stable but low, which has made it a tough time for growers. But this stability could benefit apparel makers and retailers that take advantage of the lower pricing.

“This stability in raw material pricing may be one bright point in the sea of uncertainty that has been facing the industry over the past year,” said Cotton Incorporated’s Jon Devine, senior economist, in an interview with the Lifestyle Monitor™.

By working with cotton instead of synthetic apparel, brands can both win over consumers and help their bottom lines after facing a host of challenges in 2025. Consider that nearly three-quarters of shoppers (74 percent) say their favorite fiber or fabric to wear is cotton, denim or a cotton blend, according to Cotton Incorporated’s 2025 Lifestyle MonitorTM Survey. The survey completes 500 interviews per month with U.S. consumers between the ages of 13 and 70. Further, nearly six in 10 consumers (59 percent) say they would pay more for natural fibers such as cotton.

Devine explains that crop prices declined after surging during the pandemic and are now as low as they were pre-Covid. This puts growers in a bind though, since the cost of inputs have increased with inflation. The USDA estimates that costs have risen
