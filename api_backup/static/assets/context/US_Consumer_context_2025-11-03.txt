[TITLE]AIG to acquire the majority of renewal rights to Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio in $2 billion deal:
[TEXT]
Insurance giant AIG is set to acquire the renewal rights for the majority of Everest Group’s global retail insurance portfolio worth $2 billion in premiums, sources with intimate knowledge of the deal told Fortune.

The agreement with Everest, one of the world’s largest reinsurance and insurance solutions firms, is part of AIG CEO Peter Zaffino’s transformation effort at the century-old insurance company. It will also ease Everest’s loss reserve management issues after it underestimated claim costs in its U.S. casualty insurance business, leaving the firm in need of capital.

Insiders say that AIG expects to begin writing policies for existing North America Everest clients by the start of 2026. As for clients in the European Union, AIG is positioned to begin working on that portfolio during Q1 of 2026, depending on regulatory approvals.

AIG, a $44 billion insurance company, already serves more than 88 million commercial and personal customers worldwide​, operating in more than 200 countries and jurisdictions​. Everest also serves millions of policy holders, but is substantially smaller, valued at approximately $14.5 billion.

Meanwhile, Everest has hired multiple senior executives from AIG in recent years including the company’s former legal chief Anthony Vidovich, who was named executive vice president and general counsel of Everest on Oct. 16.

The Everest deal, insiders say, did not require AIG to seek out external capital or take on debt. And while AIG will obtain the portfolio and client relationships within the deal, all existing liabilities and prior exposures will remain with Everest. This specification will allow AIG to gain access to customers and future business without inheriting responsibility for claims and obligations from policies written before the transaction closed.

The move will significantly advance AIG’s portfolio growth in general insurance, a facet which, under Zaffino’s leadership, has demonstrated consistent growth. In 2024, the company wrote $23.9 billion in insurance premiums, up 6% year over year on a comparable basis. New business in 2024 reached $4.5 billion, a 9% increase. The company’s Q1 and Q2 earnings show potential further promise. New premiums written in Q1 were up 8% on a comparable basis, bringing in $4.5 billion, with Q2 premiums generating $6.9 billion.

Growth potential and avoidance of additional financial risk are particularly important to Zaffino’s vision and turnaround of AIG. The company has faced an uphill battle following its involvement in the 2008 global financial crisis. Leading up to 2008, AIG entered into enormous volumes of largely unhedged credit default swaps, insuring more than $440 billion in assets, including $57.8 billion backed by risky subprime mortgages.

When the subprime mortgage market collapsed, AIG faced huge losses and had to pay out on the credit default contracts. As investors and counterparties demanded collateral, the company’s liquidity evaporated, requiring a $182 billion government bailout, in exchange for an equity stake.

In the decade that followed, the insurer lost more than $30 billion in underwriting—a sign of excess capital, poor risk controls, and a lack of accountability for underwriting outcomes—and endured several CEO changes.

When Zaffino became CEO in 2021, AIG had undergone massive downsizing, asset sales, and management churn, but lingering operational inefficiencies and poor profitability, especially in underwriting, remained.

Since taking over, Zaffino has led an aggressive transformation strategy focused on disciplined underwriting, operational streamlining, and technological modernization. AIG has divested non-core units, reduced its risk exposure by over $1 trillion, and invested in AI capabilities. Those include partnerships with Anthropic and Palantir to build AI-driven risk assessment and operational tools aimed at improving underwriting precision and claims efficiency.

AIG’s financial performance has markedly improved, with analysts describing it as a “different company” compared to past years. In Q2 2025, the firm reported a $1.1 billion profit, reversing a $4 billion loss a year earlier which mainly reflected the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial, a life insurance and retirement solutions provider, and other portfolio changes. Adjusted after-tax income rose 56% year over year, and AIG’s earnings per share of $1.81 beat the forecast of $1.60, while revenue of $6.88 billion surpassed the expected $6.78 billion.

[TITLE]Alison Loehnis Joins JP Morgan’s Consumer and Retail Investment Banking Team:
[TEXT]
LONDON — Alison Loehnis has joined JP Morgan as a senior adviser in the consumer and retail investment banking team and will focus on luxury and lifestyle brands sector.

She was tapped by Jeannette Smits van Oyen, global head of consumer and retail investment banking at JP Morgan, and began work earlier this month. She is based in London.

Smits van Oyen said Loehnis’ “extensive leadership experience, global network and industry relationships will provide invaluable insight as we continue to strengthen our investment banking franchise across brand sub-verticals.”

She added that the bank has been advising “across a range of industry-defining transactions across sub-verticals over the past 24 months, including the take-private of Skechers; sale of Valentino to Kering, and sale of Rhode to E.l.f. While each transaction and each sub-vertical carries its own specific dynamic, the interconnectivity between them has become increasingly apparent.”

Smits van Oyen continued: “We look forward to working with Alison to enhance our sector expertise, deepen our network and relationships across the industry and accelerate idea generation for future opportunities.”

As reported, Loehnis left her role as president and ad interim chief executive officer of Yoox Net-a-porter group earlier this year. She spent 18 years at YNAP, which has since become part of Mytheresa’s publicly quoted parent company, LuxExperience.

LuxExperience picked up Yoox Net-a-porter for 555 million euros and a 100 million-euro credit facility from Compagnie Financière Richemont. In return, it handed Richemont a 33 percent stake in the wider luxury ecommerce company.

Loehnis’ tenure at YNAP was long — and eventful — with launches, mergers and corporate deals that went through — and fell through.

Loehnis, who cut her creative and commercial teeth at companies as diverse as Thomas Pink and The Walt Disney Co., joined Net-a-porter in 2007 as vice president of sales and marketing. She rose to the role of president in 2011.

During her long tenure she spearheaded some of the digital retail group’s biggest projects, heading the development of Mr Porter in 2011 and playing a key role in the launch of The Outnet, the group’s discount site.

She also introduced new categories, such as fine jewelry, expanded the group’s markets, and was celebrated as a leader in the digital luxury world.

As ad interim CEO she helmed YNAP as it prepared to be sold to Farfetch and Mohamed Alabbar. That deal was supposed to be completed by the end of 2023, but Richemont killed it after Farfetch was placed into administration, and later rescued by Coupang.

After the deal fell through, Loehnis stayed on until another buyer for YNAP could be found.

[TITLE]Is the goods economy in a recession? Freight data suggests so:
[TEXT]
As someone who’s spent decades immersed in the freight and logistics industry, I’ve learned that freight data often tells the story of the broader economy long before traditional indicators catch up. Right now, that data is painting a stark picture: The U.S. economy is entrenched in a goods recession. While consumer spending on services might be holding steady, the movement of physical goods—the lifeblood of manufacturing, retail, and industrial sectors—has ground to a halt. This isn’t speculation; it’s evident in the high-frequency data we track at FreightWaves through our SONAR platform.

Let me break it down using a key visualization from SONAR that overlays truck driver employment (in yellow) against freight demand, measured by our Outbound Tender Volume Index (OTVI.USA, in blue). This chart spans from 2018 to the present, highlighting the delicate balance—or imbalance—between supply and demand in the trucking sector.

A Turbulent Ride: Freight Markets Since 2018

Starting in 2018, the freight market was already showing signs of strain. By 2019, we entered what we’ve called the “trucking blood bath” recession—a period of overcapacity and plummeting rates that wiped out many smaller carriers. Truck driver employment hovered around 1.5 million, but demand dipped sharply, creating a surplus of trucks chasing too few loads.

Then came 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial lockdown caused a “capacity crunch” as supply chains froze, but this quickly flipped into a boom. Stimulus checks, e-commerce surges, and inventory restocking drove OTVI to unprecedented highs in 2021-2022. Driver employment spiked to over 1.6 million as carriers scrambled to meet the frenzy. It was a gold rush for trucking, but as we all know, booms don’t last forever.

Enter the “Great Freight Recession” from March 2022 onward. As inflation bit and consumer habits shifted back toward services, freight volumes cratered. OTVI plunged, bottoming out in 2023, while driver employment began a slow but steady decline. Carriers parked trucks, brokers slashed staff, and the industry braced for a prolonged downturn. By the second half of 2024, however, green shoots appeared. I prematurely declared the freight recession over, thinking that capacity had left the industry enough to move the market into balance. OTVI started ticking above truck driver employment, signaling what looked like a recovery. Volumes rose modestly, and spot rates showed signs of stabilization. For a moment, it seemed the worst was behind us.

The 2025 Plunge: Killing the Recovery

But 2025 has delivered a gut punch. As the chart clearly shows, freight demand has nosedived again, dropping to levels not seen since the depths of the pandemic. OTVI currently sits at around 9,420—far below peak levels and down 18% year-over-year. Meanwhile, truck driver employment has reverted to pre-pandemic norms, around 1.523 million, reflecting ongoing capacity adjustments but also highlighting persistent overcapacity.

Gross collections of goods and services tax ( GST ) rose 4.6% on-year to Rs 1.95 lakh crore in October, reflecting robust local consumption that helped offset potential tax revenue shrinkage after the biggest cuts to the levy in eight years.Data published on Saturday showed indirect tax revenues edged up despite the Centre's decision to largely abolish a cess and lower taxes from September 22 on 99% of regular goods and services. Collections overshadowed the impact of a 40% growth in GST refunds through the month."The fact that the GST collections have grown, though marginally, with significantly reduced rates indicates that consumption remains robust, as borne out by other economic indicators as well," said MS Mani, tax partner at Deloitte India. He said abolition of levy on two-wheelers, cars, air-conditioners and television sets reduced the quantum of incident tax on these items that saw robust consumption demand.Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were at the vanguard of demand growth through the month.“October GST data would affirm that India’s growth story is both broadening and deepening, founded on robust local demand, rising industrial momentum, and sustained fiscal resilience in a challenging global environment,” Manoj Mishra, tax partner at Grant Thornton Bharat.Early retail indicators show broadbased demand across autos, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), apparel and electronics, reflecting renewed consumer confidence, Mishra said.Gross import collections stood at ₹50,884 crore, up 12.84%.“Higher gross GST collections reflect a strong festive season, higher demand and a rate structure that has been well absorbed by businesses," said Abhishek Jain, indirect tax head and partner, KPMG.November collections should also show similar trends.Collections, however, are anticipated to soften from December onward, when festival-driven consumption slows.That run rate should show the full impact of GST rate rationalisation on both collection and consumption, a run rate expected to be keenly tracked both by the Centre and economists.Through the month, the Centre issued ₹26,934 crore as refunds, 40% higher than last year."A consistent increase in GST refunds (domestic as well as exports) shows confidence of tax administration that GST collections would show positive trend in the future as well," said Pratik Jain, partner at PwC LLP.The collection net of refunds stood at ₹1.69 lakh crore, up 0.6%, against the same period last year.“Crucially, the government’s unwavering commitment to resolve working capital issues for exporters and address concerns around the inverted duty structure are significant positive developments,” said Saurabh Agarwal, tax partner at EY India.Agarwal added that certainty in the tax regime and reduction of working capital leakages are vital confidence boosters for the investor community, reinforcing India’s ease of doing business credentials.

[TITLE]Judges Order White House to Keep Funding Food Stamps:
[TEXT]
Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Trump's administration must to continue to fund SNAP, the nation's biggest food aid program, during the government shutdown, per the AP . The rulings came a day before the US Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.

The administration has said it wasn't allowed to use a contingency fund with about $5 billion in it for the program, but the judges rejected that. A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds—and asked for an update on progress by Monday. A Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.

It wasn't immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling, a process that often takes one to two weeks. The rulings are likely to face appeals. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks, and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.

On Saturday, some 42 million people in the U.S. who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could lose the ability to afford food because of the ongoing government shutdown.

The Trump administration has warned that the debit-like EBT cards that hold an individual's SNAP funds won't be refilled when the money runs out on Nov. 1 — despite millions in emergency contingency money being available.

On Friday, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits. But it was unclear how much assistance may be provided or when it might come.

This comes as more than 700,000 federal workers are furloughed without pay or continue to work without their regular paychecks also because of the government shutdown.

These crises have placed immense pressure on food banks and food pantries across the country to fill in and provide much needed supplies for hungry families.

[TITLE]Funding approved for food, nutrition access amid government shutdown:
[TEXT]
The Colorado General Assembly's Joint Budget Committee (JBC) approved two requests Thursday morning for low-income food and nutrition support amid federal government shutdown disruptions.

"We are getting $10 million out the door, as the federal shutdown continues, to help food banks meet record demand and continuing to fund WIC so that no parent or child goes hungry in Colorado," Gov. Jared Polis said in a news release. "It’s also important for families with school-aged children to know that students can still receive two free meals a day at school."

Denver

DPS preparing for increase in school meal participation amid SNAP benefit pause

The JBC approved $10 million in one-time funding to expand grants for food banks and pantries statewide. A spokesperson for the Colorado Republican Party told Denver7, the GOP wanted the funding to come from state emergency funding, but it's coming from the state's General Fund instead. The Colorado Republicans told Denver7 they disapprove of the decision.

"The governor's office came in and asked for a $10 million supplemental for a program that's costing $120 million a month, and it's a $1,331 supplemental, which means it's for an emergency type situation. So the only thing basically that the Joint Budget Committee do is we can either approve it or not. We can't increase the dollar amount. We can't change the funding source, that type of thing. We're pretty limited in what we can do," Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, R-Larimer and Weld Counties, said.

It also continued the $7.5 million previously approved for the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition access program.

Only $775,000 of the $7.5 million allocated for WIC was used in October, according to the governor's office. The JBC's approval of continued funding will ensure coverage for November benefits and Colorado WIC operations for the month. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) will repay the funds once the shutdown ends and normal operations resume, according to the governor's office.

Under the plan that the JBC approved, the $10 million in funding will be distributed through the Community Food Assistance Grant Program in three installments. The Trailhead Institute administers the Community Food Assistance Grant Program, making it possible to get resources directly to food banks and pantries more quickly.

Given the possibility that the federal government shutdown continues for a while, the funding distribution will be spaced out over Saturday, November 1, Saturday, November 15 and Monday, December 1.

State

Polis requests $10M to support food banks after lapse in November SNAP benefits

Gov. Polis previously said the $10 million is “certainly not enough” to fill the $120 million gap left by the federal government support for SNAP. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps low-income families purchase food.

Sen. Kirkmeyer agreed with the governor's assessment, but disagreed with the approach.

"It's a $120 million a month program to provide SNAP, a supplemental nutrition assistance program, to 600,000 people in the state of Colorado, and the governor's putting $10 million towards it," Sen. Kirkemeyer said. "We could have put together an incident management plan which we do in all other emergencies, and he could have already been planning for that and he could have brought in his Department of Human Services, Department of Education, the Department of Health Care,Health Departments,and the Agriculture Department and whatever other departments needs to bringing and his Office of Emergency Management and started saying, 'OK,what resources can we truly bring to the table?'"

"Half of the 600,000 Coloradans who benefit from SNAP are children; this emergency budget request pushes past the dysfunction in Washington to help families access food pantries and food banks,” JBC Vice Chair Shannon Bird, D-Westminster, said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had been warning for weeks that SNAP funding would dry up if the federal shutdown stretched into the November. Gov. Polis called on Coloradans to help support those in need by donating to Feeding Colorado.

[TITLE]Judge questions the Trump administration's plan to suspend SNAP benefits for millions:

BOSTON – A federal judge in Boston on Thursday seemed skeptical of the Trump's administration's argument that SNAP benefits could be suspended for the first time in the food aid program's history because of the government shutdown.

During a hearing over a request by 25 Democratic-led states to keep the funding flowing, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani told lawyers that if the government can't afford to cover the cost, there's a process to follow rather than simply suspending all benefits. “The steps involve finding an equitable way of reducing benefits," said Talwani, who was nominated to the court by then-President Barack Obama.

Talwani said she expects to issue a ruling later Thursday and seemed to be leaning toward requiring the government to put billions of dollars in emergency funds toward SNAP. That, she said, is her interpretation of what Congress intended when an agency's funding runs out.

“If you don't have money, you tighten your belt,” she said in court. “You are not going to make everyone drop dead because it’s a political game someplace.”

Talwani acknowledged that even ordering emergency funds to pay for SNAP might still be painful for some SNAP recipients because it could mean they get less money and that the money they do get could be delayed. “We are dealing with a reality that absent a 100% win for you, the benefits aren't going to be there on Nov. 1,” she told the plaintiffs.

The hearing came two days before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it can't continue funding it due to the shutdown.

Other lawsuits have been filed over the program's suspension, including one filed Thursday in Rhode Island by a coalition of eight cities and community, business and union organizations.
