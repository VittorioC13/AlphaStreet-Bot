Spain's commitment to renewable energy may be in doubt

1 day ago Share Save Guy Hedgecoe Aragón, north-eastern Spain Share Save

Juan Antonio Domínguez Spain gets more than half of its electricity from wind and solar

On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby. It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms. Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles. Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as "one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen". Luis Bertol Moreno, mayor of the town, says the area was a logical choice for the project. "We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels," he says. "Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas."

Luis Bertol Moreno says the new battery factory will transform the town of Figueruelas

The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%. By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel "Dig, baby, dig" slogan. "Green, baby, green," said the Socialist, as he pointed to the benefits of renewable energy. However, in recent months, Spain's all-in commitment to renewables has come under scrutiny. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours. With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of "fanaticism" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident. Feijóo and others on the right advocated a rethink of the national energy model.

The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims. Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain. "We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system," says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. "Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment." Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an "unknown event" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations. However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. A cyber-attack has repeatedly been ruled out. Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads.

Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035. With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. That request is currently under consideration. Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible with the green energy transition. "It's prudent to have a mix of renewables and nuclear energy," he says. Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable. "How can you produce energy in those hours when the renewables are not producing?" he asks. The answer, he added, is "with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year". The political opposition is staunchly opposed to the nuclear shut-down. The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as "a crucial source of stability".

[TITLE]NCC moves to resolve Abuja telecom disruption:
[TEXT]
Telecommunications services in parts of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, were disrupted last week after a diesel supply shortage cut power to several mobile base stations, the country’s telecoms regulator said in an email.

The Nigerian Communications Commission stated the disruption stemmed from difficulties in delivering diesel to critical telecom infrastructure, degrading service quality for mobile subscribers in the affected areas.

The regulator said the crisis was triggered by actions of the National Oil and Gas Suppliers Association, which disrupted diesel supply to sites operated by IHS Nigeria Ltd., a tower company that provides power to base stations used by mobile operators including MTN Group Ltd. and Airtel Africa Plc. The emailed statement was signed by NCC Head of Public Affairs, Nnenna Ukoha.

“The NCC is actively engaging with relevant stakeholders to address the diesel supply issues and explore sustainable solutions,” the commission said.

“The Commission urges all parties to work together collaboratively to resolve these challenges swiftly by removing the diesel supply bottlenecks affecting critical telecommunications infrastructure, arising from NOGASA’s actions.”

The NCC urged all stakeholders to work together to resolve the crisis swiftly, assuring subscribers that it remains committed to fostering a conducive environment for the growth and sustainability of telecommunications services nationwide.

The regulator said it would continue to update the public on progress towards the full restoration of services in Abuja, while thanking subscribers for their understanding and patience during the period of disruption.

While diesel remains one of the major bottlenecks for telecoms companies, the sector has so far averted potential crises, particularly this year, that could have led to widespread service disruption.

In July, this publication reported that Nigeria’s telecoms industry grapples with mounting operational costs, spending over $350m annually on diesel-powered generators.

According to the State of Africa’s Infrastructure Report 2025 by the Africa Finance Corporation, telecoms operators in Nigeria consume more than 40 million litres of diesel every month.

This growing reliance on diesel generators adds significant financial pressure on telecoms operators, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

The report stated, “A growing number of tower sites going off-grid or relying on diesel generators is a cause for concern for several reasons. First, it increases CAPEX and OPEX costs for operators, making investments in rural and remote areas even more prohibitive.

“In fact, GSMA Intelligence estimates that the energy cost of a mobile base station in rural areas could be 37 per cent higher than in urban areas. In Nigeria, for instance, telecoms operators consume over 40 million litres of diesel per month, representing a yearly spending of over $350m.

“Mobile broadband costs are further exacerbated by the higher amount of energy required to power data traffic in Africa (0.24 kWh/GB compared to a global average of 0.17 kWh/GB), where lower traffic volumes and the use of older technologies like 3G are energy-inefficient.

“Second, tower sites that rely on generators and batteries report frequent theft of battery equipment and diesel.”

[TITLE]Major Decision in The Insurance Sector, Foreign Investment Limit Increased to 100%:
[TEXT]
Insurance Amendment Bill: A major and important decision was taken on Friday at the Union Cabinet meeting chaired by PM Modi. The government approved a historic bill related to the insurance sector, which now increases the limit for foreign direct investment (FDI) in insurance companies to 100%. This decision also approved several structural reforms to further strengthen the insurance sector. The government hopes this will increase foreign investment in India’s insurance market, intensify competition, and provide better customer services. To date, approximately ₹82,000 crore has been invested in the insurance sector through FDI.

What is the purpose of the bill?

The main objective of this bill is to amend three key insurance laws: the Insurance Act, the LIC Act, and the IRDAI Act. These changes will make it easier for companies to raise capital, simplify the licensing process, and strengthen governance across the sector. This proposal was first proposed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in February when she presented the budget for the financial year 2025-26. She stated that foreign investment regulations would be reviewed and simplified. The new FDI limit will only benefit companies that invest their entire premium in India.

MNREGA Renamed

Another major decision was taken at the Cabinet meeting. The renaming of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) has been approved. The scheme will now be known as the Pujya Bapu Grameen Rojgar Yojana (Pujya Bapu Grameen Rojgar Yojana). This scheme is one of the largest rural employment schemes in the country.

SHANTI Bill Related to Nuclear Energy Also Passed

In addition, the central government has also approved the Atomic Energy Bill, 2025, a key law related to nuclear energy, called SHANTI. SHANTI stands for Sustainable Harnessing of Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India. This bill is being considered an important step towards achieving India’s target, under which the country wants to achieve 100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047.

[TITLE]Trump loves a deal, but these two are not going to plan:
[TEXT]
Not surprisingly, Russia has immediately filed a lawsuit in Moscow seeking damages from Euroclear and has threatened to sue for damages in other jurisdictions and use all available legal and other mechanisms to protect its interests. It has also looked at seizing assets held by Euroclear and other Western interests – funds and businesses – within Russia. The EU was aware of the likely Russian response when it decided to freeze the funds indefinitely. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. After dithering for two years over what to do with the Russian assets, the EU has invoked emergency powers to pass legislation that freezes them indefinitely. Credit: AP Trump’s willingness to trade Ukraine’s sovereignty for cash has echoes within the Nvidia deal. In 2022, the Biden administration, as part of its “small yard, high fence” strategy of limiting China’s access to strategic technology, banned sales of America’s most advanced semiconductors – critical to artificial intelligence technologies – to China. The decision was made on national security grounds.

Trump partly lifted the ban earlier this year, allowing Nvidia to sell a specially created custom chip to China, the H20, which was much less sophisticated than Nvidia’s most powerful chips. China, however, didn’t buy the H20 chips and the Trump administration hasn’t collected any revenue from the 15 per cent share of sales of the chips to China that it negotiated with Nvidia. Then, last week, Trump shocked the US security establishment by announcing that he would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to China in return for 25 per cent of the revenue. He was willing to trade Ukrainian land, including territory its forces hold, for a profit-sharing deal with Russia. He was prepared to set aside national security concerns for a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia. Nvidia had argued that, with China throwing its entire system behind development of chips that are competitive with Nvidia’s, including subsidies, cheap electricity and mandated procurement by government agencies, the best strategy for the US was to make China and other countries dependent on US technology and its Nvidia-centric hardware and software ecosystem.

In effect, Trump traded the prohibition of sales of a technology where the US has a material competitive advantage over China to its main technological, economic and geopolitical rival for dollars. It’s not clear that he has the power to do that. Loading The administration doesn’t have the authority to levy export taxes, which is why it appears it is trying to construct a work-around, with the chips being made in Taiwan, shipped to the US, subjected to a 25 per cent tariff as if they were imports and then, ostensibly after a security review, shipped to China. China, however, while it has advocated for access to the latest US chips, isn’t exactly swooning at the opportunity Trump has presented.

As happened earlier this year in relation to the H20 chips, it would seem China may ban, or at least limit access for its companies, to the H200. That may be because of its own national security concerns – it has expressed fears that US chips might come with embedded kill switches or (and Nvidia has been developing this) a location tracker – but it is more likely driven by the flip side of the US argument that making China more reliant on US technology would hinder the development of its homegrown chips. Nvidia isn’t including any revenue from sales of the chip to China in its own forecasts. Credit: AP China is pursuing self-sufficiency across its economy, including the tech sector. It wants its national champions like Huawei to continue to invest in the research and development that might close the gap with the US. It doesn’t want those R&D funds siphoned off by Nvidia and Trump. China has used a less efficient approach to AI than the US, linking hundreds of processors to offset the lower performance of its chips and subsidising the energy required because the chips are less energy-efficient, to close some of that gap and, according to Bloomberg, is considering a new $US70 billion ($105.4 billion) package to support its domestic chipmakers.

It is almost inconceivable that China would allow its tech sector to become reliant on US chips or take their foot off the pedal in developing domestic alternatives, although it is possible it might selectively allow some purchases of the H200 to help fast-track the training of its AI models. The H200 is

[TITLE]Trump plans envision major U.S. investment in Russia, restoring oil flows to Europe, WSJ says:
[TEXT]
MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

The Woodlands, Texas--(ANTARA/Business Wire)--Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PPIH) announced today financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025.“For the three months ended October 31, 2025, net sales were $61.1 million, an increase of $19.5 million, or 46.9%, compared to $41.6 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Growth was driven by higher sales volumes in both the Middle East and North America. Gross profit was $21.0 million, up $6.9 million from $14.1 million last year, reflecting higher activity levels. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $8.3 million from $7.3 million, primarily due to higher payroll and professional fees, including approximately $0.5 million relating to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance in connection with our transition from a small reporting company to an accelerated filer. The Company’s effective tax rate (“ETR”) was 27%, compared to 32% in the prior-year quarter, reflecting the impact of product mix in various tax jurisdictions. As a result, net income attributable to common stock was $6.3 million, an increase of $3.8 million, or 152.0%, compared to $2.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024,” noted President and CEO Saleh Sagr.“For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, net sales were $155.8 million, an increase of $42.4 million, or 37.4%, compared to $113.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in both the Middle East and North America. Gross profit was $52.2 million, compared to $38.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting increased activity levels during the current year. General and administrative expenses were $26.1 million, up from $19.5 million, due to higher payroll and professional fees, including approximately $1.0 million relating to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance in connection with our transition from a small reporting company to an accelerated filer. This also includes a one-time compensation charge of approximately $2.0 million related to the departure of the previous CEO. The Company’s effective tax rate was 29%, compared to 28% in the prior-year period. The increase in the Company's tax rate was impacted due to product mix in various tax jurisdictions and as a result of a tax limitation relating to the one-time charge in connection with the previous CEO's departure. Net income attributable to common stock increased to $12.1 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 68.1%, compared to $7.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2024,” Mr. Sagr commented.President and CEO Saleh Sagr added: “As of October 31, 2025, our backlog totaled $148.9 million, representing an increase of $10.8 million, or 7.8%, compared with the $138.1 million reported as of January 31, 2025. Our current backlog levels continue to demonstrate substantial growth; in particular, backlog at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2025 reflects an increase of more than 30% over the backlog recorded at the end of the prior year’s third quarter. This expansion is evident across both North America and the MENA region, underscoring the sustained strength of demand for our solutions.”“As of October 31, 2025, our year-to-date revenues approximate the revenues reported for the full-year fiscal 2024. Current year-to-date net income attributable to common stock was $12.1 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 34.4%, compared to approximately $9.0 million in fiscal 2024. The fact that year-to-date net income has exceeded full-year fiscal 2024 results with one quarter remaining in fiscal 2025 reflects continued operational and financial improvement. In addition, net income attributable to common stock for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, represents the highest level of earnings since the Company's transition from MFRI to Perma-Pipe in 2017," Mr. Sagr continued.“We have continued to experience solid financial performance, supported by sustained activity in our core markets and improved operating leverage. Our operations in the Middle East and North America delivered strong results, further evidencing the ongoing strengthening of our global platform. This performance is reflected in our quarterly and year-to-date results as well as in the growth of our backlog. These results also align with our strategic initiatives, including our investment in the new Qatar facility, which has secured more than $5.0 million in awards scheduled for execution during the remainder of the year. We remain focused on driving profitable growth and enhancing our competitive position within the markets we serve,” Mr. Sagr concluded.Net sales were $61.1 million and $41.6 million in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase of $19.5 million was a result of increased sales volumes in the Middle East and in North America.Gross profit was $21.0 million and $14.1 million in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase of $6.9 million was driven primarily by increased volume of activity in the quarter.General and administrative expenses were $8.3 million and $7.3 million in the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Spain's commitment to renewable energy may be in doubt

Juan Antonio Domínguez Spain gets more than half of its electricity from wind and solar

On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby. It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms. Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles. Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as "one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen". Luis Bertol Moreno, mayor of the town, says the area was a logical choice for the project. "We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels," he says. "Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas."

Luis Bertol Moreno says the new battery factory will transform the town of Figueruelas

The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%. By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel "Dig, baby, dig" slogan. "Green, baby, green," said the Socialist, as he pointed to the benefits of renewable energy. However, in recent months, Spain's all-in commitment to renewables has come under scrutiny. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours. With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of "fanaticism" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident. Feijóo and others on the right advocated a rethink of the national energy model.

The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims. Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain. "We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system," says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. "Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment." Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an "unknown event" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations. However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. A cyber-attack has repeatedly been ruled out. Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads.

Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035. With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. That request is currently under consideration. Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible with the green energy transition. "It's prudent to have a mix of renewables and nuclear energy," he says. Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable. "How can you produce energy in those hours when the renewables are not producing?" he asks. The answer, he added, is "with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year". The political opposition is staunchly opposed to the nuclear shut-down. The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as "a crucial source of stability".

[TITLE]Trump wants the U.S. shipbuilding industry to be great again. Here's what it will take, and what's at stake:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump has vowed to lead a revival in U.S. shipbuilding, but the success of this manufacturing renaissance in a key sector for national security will rely on the expertise from overseas. The administration's goal of a shipbuilding boom is a part of Trump's "Make America Great" policy agenda. Trump signed an executive order in April to bolster the shipbuilding industry, but many industry executives have warned it won't be easy given the current state of the domestic industry, and foreign investment and collaboration are key. The Trump administration's "Make American Shipyards Great Again" initiative is looking to build out liquified natural gas tankers, polar ice-breakers, and Navy vessels. "The American shipbuilding industry saw a boom twice in the past 110 years," Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Xeneta, tells CNBC. "The first boom was during World War I, the second, World War II," he said. China, which has roughly 232 times the shipbuilding capacity of the U.S., dominates the global commercial shipbuilding industry. The U.S. presently has eight active shipyards. China has over 300. The Trump administration's shipbuilding plan is an extension of an investigation into Chinese shipbuilding by the United States Trade Representative under the Biden and Trump administrations. The USTR 301 investigation found the Chinese government has bolstered its shipbuilding dominance through the use of significant subsidies and designating the industry as strategic. The investigation said the acts, policies, and practices were "unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce." The U.S. recently began to charge fees on ships built in China visiting U.S. ports, which led to retaliatory measures from China, but the two nations agreed to a one-year pause as part of a November trade truce. In 2008, China surpassed Japan in shipbuilding output. In 2010, China overtook South Korea to become the world's largest shipbuilder, both in production capacity and new orders. Since then, China's lead has continued to grow. Its global market share in shipbuilding stands at 53%, followed by South Korea and Japan. The 2025 order book for new vessels shows China accounts for 75 percent of orders, with South Korea at 19 percent, and the U.S. at 0.2 percent, according to data shared by Sand. "When you look at the orders, making American shipbuilding great again is a tall order. Foreign expertise needs to be brought in," Sand said.

Key foreign companies involved in U.S. shipbuilding To bolster the country's shipbuilding and training of U.S. workers, the Trump administration has inked deals with foreign shipbuilders. Three shipbuilding affiliates of South-Korean based Hanwha Group, the third-largest shipbuilder in the world, are playing a key part in this plan. During July trade negotiations, South Korea and the United States announced a $350 billion investment deal, with $150 billion of that money to be allocated to maritime investment. The overall trade deal was finalized in November, with auto tariffs on U.S. imports from Korea reduced to 15 percent (from 25 percent). "Why should you reinvent the wheel? There is a good reason for friends and allies to work together and capitalize on a company's expertise and experience," Sand said. South Korea began to increase its presence in the U.S. maritime industry in 2024, with the $100 million acquisition of Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia from Norwegian industrial investment group Aker ASA. The yard was then renamed Hanwha Philly Shipyard.

Vessel construction at Hanwha Philly Shipyard Shawn Baldwin

In August, Hanwha Group announced a $5 billion infrastructure plan, part of the $150 billion investment, for Hanwha Philly Shipyard to bring the site up to speed so it can expand its vessel-making capacity from 1-1.5 vessels a year, eventually to 20 vessels. Hanwha Philly Shipyard received its first order for a U.S.-built, export-ready LNG carrier from Hanwha Group's shipping arm, Hanwha Shipping, in July. It was the first order in nearly 50 years. A second order for an LNG vessel was made in August. Deliveries are expected around 2028 and are being made possible through a joint-build model with Hanwha Ocean's Geoje Shipyard in South Korea. The joint-build model is a necessity due to the the lack of vessel-building capacity at the shipyard in Philadelphia and staffing. Hanwha Ocean makes 50-60 vessels a year.

"One of the challenges the industry faces is the workforce," said David Kim, CEO of Hanwha Philly Shipyard. The biggest bottleneck in training that workforce, says Kim, is the lack of U.S. instructors. To remedy this, Hanwha will train employees by rotating the U.S. workforce from Philadelphia to the yard in South Korea. "It's our greatest advantage," said Kim. "The people who are good and you want to train U.S. workers are the people working in the yard," he added. The company is also looking to expand its apprenticeship program. "We have 1,700 workers to date," Kim said. "If you look at our aspirations to deliver those 20 ships a year, our staff down the road is going to be closer to 10,000 plus," he added. Oil, LNG, and creating demand for U.S. freight vessels The LNG vessel orders are not the only Hanwha company-generated orders on the books for the Philly shipyard. Hanwha Shipping has also ordered 10 medium-range tankers used for oil and chemical transport, the largest U.S. commercial vessel order in more than two decades. The first ship is expected to launch in 2029. "There are currently 55 Jones Act oil tankers in the world, and 7,500 oil tankers in the world," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. The Jones Act requires vessels that transport goods between U.S. ports to be U.S.-built, owned, crewed, and flagged. "In LNG, the U.S. shipbuilding industry for all intents and purposes is not participating," Lipow said. There are roughly 750 LNG tankers in the world, and there's only one LNG tanker that is flagged in the United States, "and it was built in France," he said. But the lack of U.S.-built tankers has not impacted the growth of U.S. LNG exports or crude. "The United States LNG market is not at a disadvantage. We're currently exporting nearly 30% of our crude oil production and not having any trouble finding tankers," Lipow said. Nuclear maritime ambitions During Trump's recent Asia tour, the president announced Hanwha would make its first nuclear-powered sub at the Philly Shipyard. Hanwha makes large naval submarines in South Korea. "The U.S. needs its own ability to make ships and submarines for its own security and resiliency," said Alex Wong, global chief strategy officer for Hanwha Group. "God forbid, in times of war, you need the ability to regenerate and make a naval vessel," Wong said. "That's the way you not only win a war, but you deter a war." In August, Trump ordered the movement of two nuclear submarines in response to threats from Russia. The timing of the submarine being built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard is dependent on the ongoing discussions between the South Korean and U.S. government. "Also important to the time is the availability of technology and the resources," Kim said. The U.S. Navy continues to build out its technological infrastructure. The Navy and Palantir Technologies recently announced "ShipOS," software that they said will help build and maintain American submarines. The software down the road might also be used for aircraft carriers and jets. Italian shipbuilder with Wisconsin ties also playing a role In addition to South Korea, Finnish and Italian companies are also being tapped to expand U.S. shipbuilding. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni reconfirmed in a joint statement with Trump the country's commitment to U.S. shipbuilding in an April meeting. The key Italian company in this initiative is Fincantieri Marinette Marine (FMM), which was founded in Wisconsin in 1942 as Marinette Marine to build naval vessels for World War II before later being acquired by the Italian company. President Trump toured the company's Wisconsin shipyard during his first term. The company recently laid off 93 employees,

[TITLE]Green California to Keep Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant Open 5 More Years:
[TEXT]
Essay by Eric Worrall

h/t mleskovarsocalrrcom – Some Californians question why they need a nuclear plant, given all their renewable and battery investments.

California environmental regulators on Thursday struck a landmark deal with Pacific Gas & Electric to extend the life of the state’s last remaining nuclear power plant in exchange for thousands of acres of new land conservation in San Luis Obispo County.

…

The Coastal Commission voted 9 to 3 to approve the plan, settling the fate of some 12,000 acres that surround the power plant as a means of compensation for environmental harm caused by its continued operation.

…

“This plan supports the continued operation of a major source of reliable electricity for California, and is in alignment with our state’s clean energy goals and focus on coastal protection,” Paula Gerfen, Diablo Canyon’s senior vice president and chief nuclear officer, said in a statement.

…

A key development for continuing Diablo Canyon’s operation came in 2022 with Senate Bill 846, which delayed closure by up to five additional years. At the time, California was plagued by rolling blackouts driven extreme heat waves, and state officials were growing wary

[TITLE]Drax plans up in smoke as it chops carbon capture unit in half:
[TEXT]
Drax, the owner of Britain’s biggest power station, is cutting more than half of its global division specialising in the controversial green technology known as carbon capture and storage.

The company, which switched its North Yorkshire power plant from burning coal to wood pellets in the 2010s, is scaling back its carbon capture operations as critics have become increasingly sceptical about their viability.

A cull of about 100 staff will hit jobs at both the main Drax group and its Elimini carbon capture business in the UK and America.

• What does Drax do and why is it controversial?

It marks a significant climbdown from Drax’s hopes that by now it would be the world leader in the technology. In 2022 the company said it could be creating “tens of thousands” of jobs in carbon capture from 2024.

[TITLE]80% of data centre energy must come from renewables - CRU:
[TEXT]
Data centres will be required to meet at least 80% of their annual energy demand with additional renewable electricity projects generating in the Republic of Ireland.

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has today published its decision on a new electricity connection policy for data centres.

Under the rules, data centre developers will be allowed a six-year "glide path" for renewables to be developed and start generating.

The CRU said that new data centres connecting to the electricity network will continue to be required to provide generation and/or storage capacity, either onsite or local in proximity to match the requested data centre maximum import demand capacity.

"This generation will be required to participate in the wholesale electricity market to support overall system adequacy, while providing a potential revenue stream to the developer.," the CRU said in its decision.

When it comes to the location of data centres, the CRU said that electricity system operators must consider whether a requested data centre connection is in a constrained or unconstrained location on the electricity network.

"This will require system operators to focus on the details of the specific application and its location on the electricity network instead of the current broader regional approach," the CRU said.

"The system operators will also be required to regularly publish information in relation to the availability of capacity on the electricity network, identifying current and future constraints to provide accessible information for all stakeholders," it added.

Electricity demand from data centres has grown from 5% of national electricity demand in 2015 to 22% in 2024.

Digital Infrastructure Ireland, which represents the data centre sector, said it was pleased that the policy has finally been released by the CRU.

"We are hopeful this will end the four-year de facto moratorium on data centres and begin to reset the digital infrastructure industry here in Ireland," the group said.

Cloud Infrastructure Ireland, the Ibec trade association that represents digital infrastructure providers, welcomed the publication of the connection policy, which it said provides the needed clarity for new sustainable data centre investments in Ireland.

"The policy will also support Ireland's wider digital economy and the hundreds of Irish firms supporting the digital infrastructure sector," it said.

Wind Energy Ireland also welcomed the publication of the connection policy.

"This new policy gives certainty to large-energy users and to the renewable energy industry," said Noel Cunniffe, CEO of Wind Energy Ireland.

"It will unlock investment into Ireland, support new wind farms and help to accelerate the electrification of our energy system," he added.

The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland (AmCham) said the publication of the CRU's decision provides much-needed clarity for investors and energy users.

"Vital digital infrastructure is foundational to Ireland's ability to attract and retain investment, support high-value jobs, and enable the continued growth of the wider digital economy, all of which rely on dependable access to electricity for large energy users," said AmCham CEO Paul Sweetman.

Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said it may be a good decision for data centres and renewables developers, but added that it is not a good day for climate, or for households and communities dependent on expensive fossil fuels.

"Requiring data centres to 'match' at least 80% of their annual demand with new renewables does not guarantee actual reductions in emissions," said Jerry Mac Evilly, Campaigns Director at Friends of the Earth.

"This is merely an accounting exercise and data centres’ colossal energy demand inevitably means more use of fossil fuel power plants."
