[TITLE]Johnvents, Ondo reaffirm investment in agribusiness, manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Johnvents Group has reaffirmed its commitment to deepening partnerships, investing in capacity, and building industries that will accelerate Nigeria’s economic transformation and boost Africa’s global competitiveness.

The resolve came as the Ondo State Government restated its ambition to position the state as a competitive hub for agribusiness, manufacturing, technology, and energy.

According to a statement, the Johnvents Group’s leadership gave the assurance during the company’s 2025 End-of-Year Celebration held at The Dome, Akure, where industry leaders, international partners, traditional rulers, including the Deji of Akure, and senior government officials gathered to review what the firm described as “a transformative year.”

Delivering the welcome address, Group Executive Director of Johnvents, Tarun Chawla, stated that the organisation had strengthened its operations and expanded its global presence. He noted that the company’s growth was made possible by a supportive business environment provided by the Ondo State Government.

He said, “This year reshaped us as a business. We strengthened our operations, expanded our relevance, and demonstrated what a committed team can achieve when purpose and discipline align. The stability and clarity your administration provides form the foundation on which organisations like ours continue to grow and innovate.”

Chawla appreciated the confidence of partners such as British International Investment, the International Finance Corporation, AFRIEXIM Bank, and other financial institutions in the Group’s long-term vision. He said Johnvents had now become “a global value-chain participant with investments and collaborations spanning Africa, the UAE, Asia, and Europe.”

In his keynote address, the Executive Governor of Ondo State, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, described Johnvents Group as a model of how homegrown enterprises can become global powerhouses without losing touch with their host communities.

Aiyedatiwa noted: “Johnvents stands today as a monument to what focused investment and structured institutional support can achieve. With over ten factories, more than 1,500 direct employees, thousands of benefiting households and an ecosystem of over 5,000 farmers, Johnvents is living proof that prosperity becomes inevitable when ingenuity meets institutional support.”

He listed reforms in ease of doing business, digitisation of government processes, security enhancement, infrastructure expansion, and the work of the Ondo State Development and Investment Promotion Agency as critical pillars of the state’s strategy to strengthen private-sector competitiveness.

The governor noted that the success of companies like Johnvents aligns with the administration’s vision of an inclusive, opportunity-driven economy. “The Johnvents story assures every investor here and across the world that Ondo State is ready for investment, ready for expansion and ready for global competitiveness,” he emphasised.

The event also celebrated the resilience of Johnvents’ workforce and the company’s widening contributions to community development, including education, youth empowerment and agribusiness initiatives.

Johnvents added that it is committed to partnering with local and global institutions, scaling capacity, and building industries that deliver value across Nigeria’s agricultural and manufacturing value chains.

The Group operates seven businesses, including Johnvents Cocoa Factory, Johnvents Trading, Johnvents Foods, Johnvents Industries DMCC, Johnvents Farms, Premium Cocoa Product (Ile-Oluji), and Haven Hauling, spanning production, processing, manufacturing, and trade of commodities and food products in Nigeria and other regions.

[TITLE]Big 12 Nears $500M Private Capital Deal With RedBird-Backed CAS:
[TEXT]
The Big 12 is in advanced talks to partner with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, on a deal that could make up to $500 million available to its schools, according to multiple people familiar with the details.

An outline of the arrangement was shared Friday with athletic directors, according to the people, who were granted anonymity because the details are private. Under the proposed plan, CAS would put $25 million into a new entity called Big 12 properties that would house some of the league’s commercial rights, then make hundred of millions more available for the league’s schools, one source said.

Schools will be able to opt into the funds, with participants conceding future conference distributions for the upfront cash, a source said. In other words, CAS would share in revenue generated under the partnership with the involved schools. There is no equity involved in the current proposal, and no grant of rights would be signed by the conference’s 16 members as part of the deal because it is time-limited to the league’s current media deals, according to the source. Those media deals are up in 2031.

Big 12 athletic directors met Friday with executives from both the conference and Moelis & Co., the bank running the process, the sources said. A representative for CAS declined to comment; a rep for Moelis couldn’t immediately be reached.

The Big 12 confirmed in a statement that it is in talks with RedBird and Weatherford Capital on a deal that would include both revenue-generating opportunities for the league and “an opt-in capital solution for our member institutions to take advantage of up to $500 million of capital.”

“To date, the RedBird ecosystem has delivered over $145 million of contracted revenue to the Big 12 and its member institutions,” the statement said. “This partnership would provide the conference with a world-class strategic and capital partner, while preserving 100% of the member institutions’ equity in the Big 12.”

University of Kansas chancellor Doug Girod, who is chair of the Big 12’s board of directors, said in an interview that CAS has been “incredibly patient” in talks that started

Transportation Secretary Duffy Launches “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” Campaign, Announces $1B in Funding to Support Initiative

Posted on by Miami Rebel

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy today launched his “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” campaign ahead of a busy holiday travel season. The goal of the campaign is to address a common refrain from the public – it can be challenging to travel as a family. From needing more dedicated spaces for young children and exercise equipment, to finding places for mothers to nurse their children, to staying fit on the go, or struggling to find more healthy food options, the Trump Administration is committed to making every stage of the travel journey more seamless.

To improve families’ experiences in airport terminals, Secretary Duffy announced $1 billion in funding to incentivize more family-friendly resources in airport terminals. This can include:

Creating more children’s play areas or exercise areas Adding mothers’ rooms or nursing pods Reconfiguring security checkpoints to create family screening lanes Building sensory rooms for children with special needs Other creative terminal projects that focus on enhancing the family travel journey As part of the campaign launch, Secretary Duffy was joined by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Paul Saladino, a double board-certified Physician Nutrition Specialist, Isabel Brown, a content creator and young mom, and Luke Saunders, the CEO and Founder of Farmer’s Fridge.

In addition to the federal funding USDOT is providing to enhance physical infrastructure, the group also emphasized the administration’s interest in collaborating with airports and private sector partners to improve access to nutritional food options.

[TITLE]Kennedy Wilson, Affinius Provide $384M Construction Financing Package for Jersey City Multifamily Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
New Jersey developer Panepinto Properties has landed a $384 million financing package to develop the first building in its two-tower multifamily project on the Jersey City waterfront, Commercial Observer can first report.

Kennedy Wilson provided a $306 million senior loan, while Affinius Capital supplied $78 million of preferred equity for the planned 678-unit Harborside 8 project.

“We are proud to play a role in bringing this high-impact multifamily project to fruition in Jersey City, which continues to experience low vacancy levels and consistent rent growth,” Thomas Whitesell, head of Kennedy Wilson’s debt investment group, said in a statement.

The property is scheduled for completion in 2028. Units in Harborside 8 will have views of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline, and amenities will include a rooftop terrace, a pool, a fitness center and coworking spaces.

“Harborside 8 will address the significant demand for premium multifamily housing in one of the region’s most dynamic and fastest-growing markets,” David Greenburg, Affinius Capital’s co-head of credit originations, said in a release. “Panepinto Properties brings proven execution capabilities and extensive New Jersey market knowledge, critical advantages for a development of this scale in Jersey City.”

Panepinto Properties, led by founder and CEO Joseph A. Panepinto Sr., acquired the development site that will be utilized for Penepinto’s Harborside 8 and Harborside 9 projects from Veris Residential — formerly Mack-Cali Realty — for $75 million, Real Estate NJ reported. Veris has been busy divesting properties, also recently selling The James in Park Ridge, according to NJ Biz.

The towers will have a combined 1,267 units. Harborside 8 will reach 65 stories and comprise 678 rental units, 8,578 square feet of retail space, a 350-space parking garage and a 40,000-square-foot public park along the Hudson River, according to Real Estate NJ.

JLL’s Tom Didio negotiated the financing.

[TITLE]Kawa Capital Provides $79M Construction Loan for Boston-Area Life Sciences Project – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, a Boston-area developer specializing in transportation projects, has secured $79.3 million to build The Bolt, a 180,000-square-foot life sciences lab, office and manufacturing complex in Woburn, Mass., a suburb 10 miles outside Boston.

Kawa Capital Management provided the construction financing for a project that is expected to require a total of $125 million of investment capital. Aries Capital served as the capital markets advisor on the transaction.

Jeremy Lash, director at Kawa Capital Management, described The Bolt in a statement as a “high-quality asset” in a popular market near Boston.

“We are confident The Bolt will draw interest from energy, manufacturing, life sciences and technology companies looking for prime space in an optimal location,” he said.

Located at 216 New Boston Street in Woburn — which has become a minor hub for life sciences development in recent years — The Bolt is part of a larger $400 million investment project by Cabot, Cabot & Forbes.

These other projects include the development of Emblem 120, a 289-unit luxury multifamily complex with ground-floor retail, and Zero New Boston, a planned building that would bring 250 apartments and 1,200 square feet of retail to Woburn.

In a statement, Daniel Nagler, chief investment officer at Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, called Woburn “an ideal location,” noting that the suburb is accessible from both Boston and Cambridge via two highways and a commuter rail station, positioning it as a regional destination for life sciences and other CRE development.

“We believe it will continue to attract innovative companies, and it is why we are so bullish on the location,” Nagler added.

The Bolt is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2027.

[TITLE]Mexico’s aerospace sector is growing. Will it be undercut in USMCA review?:
[TEXT]
A North America trade deal helped Mexico get into aeroplane manufacturing. Now that is under threat with Trump.

Monterrey, Mexico – In April, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the country’s aerospace industry could see sustained annual growth of as much as 15 percent over the next four years, and attributed the sector’s expansion to a robust local manufacturing workforce, increasing exports, and a strong presence of foreign companies.

But with the review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) coming up – the free-trade treaty between the three countries that helped Mexico’s aerospace sector to grow and flourish – the industry’s future is no longer certain.

Stakeholders warn that ensuring investment stability and strengthening labour standards are essential to protecting the sector’s North American supply chain.

Mexico is striving to become one of the top 10 countries in aerospace production value, a goal outlined in Plan Mexico, the country’s strategic initiative to enhance global competitiveness in key sectors.

As the sixth-largest supplier of aerospace parts to the US, the industry has benefited significantly from the USMCA, which fostered regional supply chain integration, said Monica Lugo, director of institutional relations at the consulting firm PRODENSA.

However, the integration is no guarantee of business continuing to grow as the country is at an “unprecedented moment” with US President Donald Trump and his wide-ranging tariff policies.

Lugo, a former USMCA negotiator, said that recent tariffs on materials like steel and aluminium — critical to the aerospace sector— have eroded trust in the US as a reliable partner. She predicts that if current conditions continue, the sector risks losing capital, investments and jobs.

“Having this great uncertainty – one day it’s on, the next it’s off, who knows tomorrow – and based on no specific criteria, but rather on the president’s mood, creates chaos and severely damages the country and the economy,” she said.

On December 4, Trump suggested the US might let the USMCA expire next year, or negotiate a new deal. This follows comments by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to US news outlet Politico that the administration is considering separate deals with Canada and Mexico.

A booming aerospace sector

The Mexican aerospace market is valued at $11.2bn, and is expected to more than double to $22.7bn by 2029, Sheinbaum said, citing data from the Mexican Aerospace Industry Federation (FEMIA). Home to global companies like Bombardier, Safran, Airbus, and Honeywell, Mexico has established itself as a key player in the global aerospace market and is now the world’s twelfth-largest exporter of aerospace components.

Marco Antonio Del Prete, secretary of sustainable development in Queretaro, attributes this success in part to heavy investment in education and training. In 2005, the Queretaro government promised Canada’s Bombardier that it would invest in education and set up the Aeronautical University, which now offers programmes ranging from technical diplomas to master’s degrees in aerospace manufacturing and engineering.

“Since Bombardier’s arrival, an educational and training system was created that allows us to develop talent in a very efficient way, let’s say, fast track,” Del Prete told Al Jazeera.

Bombardier has served as an anchor, propelling Queretaro’s rise as a high-skilled manufacturing hub for parts and components.

While the Bombardier plant in Queretaro originally focused on wiring harnesses, it has evolved to specialise in complex aerostructures, including the rear fuselage for the Global 7500, Bombardier’s ultra-long-range business jet, and key components for the Challenger 3500, the mid-sized business jet.

Marco Antonio Carrillo, a research professor at the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ), pointed out that the area’s wide educational offerings have cultivated a powerful workforce, which has gained significant attention from aeroplane makers, mainly from the US, Canada and France.

“This development [of Queretaro] has been, if you look at it in terms of time, truly explosive,” Carrillo said.

Mexico also aims to join France and the US as the third country capable of fully assembling an engine for Safran.

But the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Union, which represents more than 600,000 workers in Canada and the US, is worried that progress could lead to more advanced manufacturing and assembly work to eventually shift to Mexico, given the local investment in aeronautical universities and training.

“Right now they’re [Mexican workers] doing more entry-level type things, but our concern is that later on, larger pieces of the aerospace operation will go to Mexico,” Peter Greenberg, the IAM’s international affairs director, told Al Jazeera.

High-skilled, low-cost workforce

Of the three countries in the USMCA agreement, Mexico’s biggest attraction has been its low-cost manufacturing.

Edgar Buendia and Mario Duran Bustamante, economics professors at the Rosario Castellanos National University, cite Mexico’s low labour costs and geographical proximity to the US as the country’s key advantages. This is partly why the US has intensified pressure on the Mexican government, including during the initial USMCA negotiations in 2017, to raise wages to level the playing field and reduce unfair competition.

“Most US companies have incentives to move their production here in Mexico, given the [low] wages and the geographic location. So, to prevent that from happening, the United States is pressuring Mexico to raise labour standards, ensure freedom of association, and improve working conditions,” Buendia told Al Jazeera, things that will benefit Mexican workers even as employer-dominated labour groups worry that they may lose their advantage.

The IAM originally opposed the USMCA’s predecessor, NAFTA. Greenberg said that while they acknowledge USMCA will continue, US and Canadian workers “would probably be perfectly happy” if the agreement ended as the NAFTA deal had led to plants being shuttered and workers being laid off as jobs moved from the US and Canada to low-cost Mexico.

“There is a need for stronger incentives to keep work in the United States and Canada. We want to see the wages in Mexico go up so that it doesn’t become automatically a place where companies go to because they know they will have lower wages and workers who do not have any bargaining power or strong units,” Greenberg added.

Under Sheinbaum’s Morena party, Mexico has raised the minimum wage from 88 pesos ($4.82) in 2018 to 278.8 pesos ($15.30) in 2025, with the rate in municipalities bordering the US reaching 419.88 pesos ($23). On December 4, Sheinbaum announced a 13 percent rise in the minimum wage — and 5 percent for the border zone— set to begin in January 2026.

Despite these increases and the competitiveness of wages in the aerospace sector, researchers agree that a significant wage gap persists between Mexican workers and their US and Canadian counterparts.

“The wage gap is definitely abysmal,” said Javier Salinas, a scholar at the UAQ Labor Center, specialising in labour relations in the aerospace industry. “The [aerospace] industry average is between 402 [Mexican pesos] and 606, with the highest daily wage being 815. [But] 815, converted to US dollars, is less than $40 for a single workday.”

By contrast, Salinas estimates that a worker in the US earns an average of

[TITLE]A Challenging and Volatile Year for U.S. Shale:
[TEXT]
The US shale exploration and production (E&P) and Lower 48 midstream sectors experienced a volatile and challenging 2025, likely a far cry from what operators envisioned this time last year as the second Trump administration’s ‘energy dominance’ agenda was taking shape. With WTI languishing below $60 for much of the year, oil E&Ps moderated activity, with the oil-directed rig count dropping from 415 in January to 386 by Thanksgiving. In contrast, Henry Hub gas prices remained supported throughout much of the year, with the front month now north of $5 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). In short, there is more long-term gas bullishness in the US oil and gas industry than perhaps at any time in recent memory, while even the most ardent oil bulls seem to recognize the short-term challenges.

Year of gas and LNG

In the broader US energy conversation, 2025 brought natural gas into focus. The end of the Biden administration’s LNG pause unleashed around 7.6 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) of future feedgas demand from newly sanctioned US Gulf Coast LNG export projects, driving total feedgas demand to double its 2024 level by 2030. However, when the 2025 Gulf Coast LNG FIDs enter service later this decade, market conditions will not resemble the previous wave of LNG projects (2016-2021). Lower 48 dry gas breakevens, and therefore Henry Hub, will be materially higher. At the same time, LNG prices will be facing downward pressure due to global supply additions, shrinking the spread between Henry Hub and international benchmarks.

The short-term market may be previewing some of these dynamics. The Title Transfer Facility (TTF)-Henry Hub differential in early December is around $4 per MMBtu, the lowest since early 2021. This will be one of the most important spreads to watch in 2026, as Golden Pass LNG aims to begin operations shortly and aim to ramp up to its full capacity of 2.3 Bcfd.

Costs and timelines require close monitoring, as nine projects are currently under construction in a tightening labor and supply chain environment. The capital investment required to build LNG liquefaction plants continues to increase, with standard capex now rising to near $1,100-$1,200 per ton, roughly 20% higher than the projects sanctioned in 2022-23. EPC contractors are also becoming more rigid with contract terms to pass more cost overrun risk to the developers.

In the broader political and tech world, gas has come to the forefront not via LNG but rather the race for AI supremacy and the surge in plans to develop data centers fueled by dedicated gas-fired power generation plants (as well as with renewables). The amount of data center capacity that is actually built and the corresponding gas demand it ultimately represents will warrant close scrutiny in the years ahead. Rystad Energy will continue to closely monitor data center projects globally in 2026 in order to refine our outlook for the gas and power demand they will drive.

US oil outlook steady as long as WTI holds above $55

Public US oil-focused E&Ps in 2025 defied expectations – including their own guidance updates in May – of slowing production, while the nation’s oil output repeatedly hit record. We estimate that most US oil E&Ps have a ‘corporate breakeven’ of near $60 per barrel, a level at which they can maintain dividends, buybacks, interest and general and administrative (G&A) expenses while drilling breakeven wells (NPV10). Even so, in our estimation, it would require prices to fall closer to $50 per barrel to initiate capex cuts that would spur outright production declines. Triggering production declines is unpalatable for several reasons. For one, sliding output raises per-unit operating costs and potentially leads to suboptimal utilization of midstream assets. Second, due to steep shale well decline rates, cutting capex too sharply leaves a dent in PDP (proved, developing and producing) volumes that generate cash flow and underpin valuations. And third, when prices return to higher levels, ramping up drilling to reach previous output levels is a steeper climb, requiring a sharper jump in spending.

As a result, we would expect operators to be willing to slightly reduce payout ratios in the short term to protect output. There is a historical precedent in the capital discipline era. When oil prices fell from their 2022 highs, operators, having proven their ability to remain disciplined, reduced payout ratios to preserve and deploy cash for longer-term inventory acquisitions through mergers and acquisitions (M&A). With potential contributions from G&A and operational synergies from M&A in 2026, a lower payout ratio could see E&Ps defend corporate breakeven and maintain volumes at $55 per barrel WTI.

Efficiency gains still have room to run

Regardless of the macro environment, it’s clear that shale operators will continue to adopt new technologies and generate further operational efficiencies to drive down unit costs. Drilling and completions (D&C) efficiencies continued to improve in 2025 as operators pushed the envelope to reduce overall costs in a softer oil macro environment. The potential ceiling for efficiency gains has been debated for several years, but we believe there is still room for meaningful improvements. Ultra-long lateral wells remain a relatively new space for Lower 48 operators, and best practices for drilling and completing these wells will continue to evolve.

Simul-fracs have gained a greater market share over the past several years, and we expect operators to accelerate efforts toward trimul- and even quattro-frac designs to capture further economies of scale. A key bottleneck is sourcing and delivering the large frac water volume required within a short period of time to execute on trimul and quattro fracs. Still, the growing prevalence of contiguous acreage positions – particularly among larger operators – will enable bigger pad development. This will lead to longer laterals and the execution of simul, trimul and quattro fracs at scale using continuous-pumping techniques. Taken together, these trends support another step-change in efficiency over the coming years.

Separately, ExxonMobil’s recent use of petcoke blended with conventional proppant to enhance well performance has renewed industry interest in lightweight proppant alternatives. With Tier 1 inventory concerns increasingly top-of-mind, operators are likely to intensify experimentation with novel proppant blends to improve recoveries.

US E&Ps on an international shopping spree?

In 2026 we will also be watching for US E&Ps reversing the retrenchment trend of the 2010s and adding international exposure. Privately-held Oklahoma-based Continental Resources acquired a block in Argentina’s massive Vaca Muerta shale last month, just a few months after forming a joint venture with TPAO to explore and develop shale resources in Turkiye. EOG also entered a shale exploration license in the UAE, conventional exploration in Bahrain and potentially Alaska (yet to be confirmed). While moves such as these are indicative of a more mature US shale industry, they are not necessarily indicative of the often-discussed short-term challenge of limited Tier 1 inventory. Rather, these serve as potential medium-term growth options that are perhaps not as obvious in the Lower 48 as they once were under the prevailing macro conditions.
