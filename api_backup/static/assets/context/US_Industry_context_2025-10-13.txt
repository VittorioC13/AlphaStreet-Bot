[TITLE]Trump announces “TrumpRx” website and Pfizer deal to slash drug prices, boost U.S. manufacturing:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with Pfizer to implement “most-favored-nation” pricing for Medicaid, ensuring the U.S. pays no more than the lowest prices offered to other developed nations.

The new TrumpRx direct-to-consumer platform, launching in 2026, will allow Americans to purchase prescription drugs at steep discounts (averaging 50 percent off retail prices), bypassing traditional pharmacy markups.

Pfizer committed to investing $70 billion in domestic research, development, and manufacturing, aligning with Trump’s push to bring pharmaceutical production back to America.

While the deal marks progress, experts caution that discounts may still leave expensive drugs unaffordable for many, and the full impact remains unclear due to Pfizer’s confidential terms.

The administration leveraged tariff threats to secure the deal and hinted at similar agreements with other drugmakers. Critics argue systemic affordability issues persist, while Democrats and Republicans remain divided on broader healthcare reforms.

In a major move aimed at lowering prescription drug costs, President Donald Trump announced a landmark agreement with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. that includes deep discounts for Medicaid, a new direct-to-consumer drug purchasing website called “TrumpRx,” and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing.

Speaking alongside Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the White House, Trump declared the deal a “historic” step toward ending America’s role in subsidizing global pharmaceutical research while paying the highest prices for medications. Under the agreement, Pfizer will adopt “most-favored-nation” pricing for Medicaid, ensuring that the U.S. government pays no more than the lowest price offered to other developed nations. As stated by Brighteon.AI‘s Enoch engine, Medicaid is a government-run health insurance program primarily for low-income individuals, disabled persons and families with dependent children, funded jointly by federal and state governments.

The decentralized engine adds that while Medicaid covers essential medical services, including dental care (as seen in cases like Isaac Gagnon’s unauthorized treatments), it disproportionately allocates two-thirds of its budget to long-term care for the elderly, blind, and disabled—raising concerns

Tata Capital’s Rs 15,512 crore initial public offering (IPO), one of the most anticipated listings of the year, is set to debut on the stock exchanges on Monday, October 13. Despite the hype, grey market signals suggest a muted start, with the GMP slipping to zero, hinting the stock may open around its issue price of Rs 326 per share.The Tata Group’s flagship non-banking financial company (NBFC) saw its IPO subscribed 1.95 times, led by strong institutional participation. Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) oversubscribed their quota 3.42 times, while the non-institutional investors’ (NIIs) portion was booked 1.98 times. Retail investors were more cautious, subscribing 1.10 times.Priced between Rs 310 and Rs 326 per share, the issue was offered at a 56% discount to Tata Capital’s unlisted market value. With the latest grey market premium (GMP) dropping from Rs 8 earlier this week to Rs 0 as of Sunday morning, analysts say the listing is likely to be flat.Ahead of its IPO, Tata Capital raised Rs 4,642 crore from anchor investors, attracting interest from major domestic and global institutions. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was the largest anchor, acquiring 2.15 crore shares worth nearly Rs 700 crore. Other key domestic participants included ICICI Prudential, HDFC Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life, DSP, Axis, Kotak, and Nippon Life AMC.On the global front, investors such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Nomura, and Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global took significant allocations, reflecting strong confidence in the Tata Group’s financial arm.A wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, Tata Capital is the group’s flagship financial services arm, offering retail, SME, and corporate lending, along with wealth management and investment banking. With total assets of Rs 2.52 lakh crore and a loan book of Rs 2.33 lakh crore as of June 2025, it ranks as India’s third-largest diversified NBFC, trailing only Bajaj Finance and Shriram Finance.The company’s gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio of 2.1% is among the lowest in the industry, supported by an 80% secured book and a broad network of 1,516 branches across 27 states and union territories. Between FY23 and FY25, Tata Capital’s revenue rose 56%, while profit after tax climbed 10% to Rs 3,655 crore.“Our ambition is to strengthen our position as a leading player in the financial services sector. We see significant opportunities to expand our loan book and leverage our investments in technology,” said Rajiv Sabharwal, Tata Capital’s CEO. He added, “Our strategy has been to build a portfolio of multiple hero products rather than depend on a single offering.”At the upper end of the price band, Tata Capital is valued at 4.1 times its FY25 book value and 33 times its earnings, slightly below the sector average. Analysts believe this offers a fair entry point.“Given current market sentiment, Tata Capital’s management has wisely priced the IPO below the industry average, providing room for a healthy listing gain,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities.Brokerages including Aditya Birla Money, Anand Rathi, and Canara Bank Securities have recommended a “Subscribe – Long Term” rating.Antique Stock Broking noted that “normalization of credit costs in the vehicle finance portfolio, along with realization of business synergies, would be key to achieving higher return ratios of around 15% RoEs—similar to peers like HDB Financial, currently trading at 3.5x June 2025 BVPS.”According to ICICI Direct Research, Tata Capital’s assets under management (AUM) surged to Rs 2,33,363 crore in FY25, reflecting a 37.3% CAGR over FY23–25. The brokerage noted that while the company’s risk management framework remains strong, declining provisioning buffers are a concern, with the provision coverage ratio (PCR) falling to 58.5% in FY25.The brokerage also highlighted the rising share of unsecured loans (~20%) and new-to-credit customers (~3.5%), which could lead to more volatile performance.Canara Bank Securities noted that Tata Capital enjoys AAA domestic and BBB international credit ratings, with credit costs below 1% and net NPAs near 0.5%. “Daily return on equity and operating metrics outperform year-end figures by roughly 250 bps,” the brokerage said.Anand Rathi Research valued Tata Capital at a post-issue market capitalization of Rs 1,38,382.7 crore, terming the IPO fully priced but maintaining a long-term positive stance.Also read | Explained: Reliance Industries is India’s most valuable company but why isn’t it No.1 in Nifty50 weight? Funds raised will be used to bolster Tata Capital’s Tier-I capital and meet regulatory requirements, while supporting retail lending, digital initiatives, and infrastructure financing.Antique Stock Broking noted that the company benefits from top-tier credit ratings from CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, and India Ratings, with an average borrowing cost of 7.8%. The debt mix is evenly split between floating (45%) and fixed-rate (55%) instruments, sourced primarily from banks and non-convertible debentures.As the company readies for its market debut, all eyes will be on whether Tata Capital can match the blockbuster listing of Tata Technologies last year, or if a flat grey market is an early signal that investors are keeping expectations in check.Also read | Tata Motors demerger: Will it unlock value or more volatility for investors next week?

[TITLE]Affinius Capital Supplies $170M Construction Loan for Philly Apartments – Commercial Observer:
[TEXT]
Post Brothers has landed $170 million of construction financing to build a multifamily project in Philadelphia, Commercial Observer can first report.

Affinius Capital originated the loan for the developer’s planned 431-unit rental apartment development in Philadelphia’s Northern Liberties neighborhood. It will mark the second phase of Post Brothers’ Piazza Alta development with two buildings scaling 16 and eight stories.

“Piazza Alta will be among Philadelphia’s premier multifamily projects, building on the retail and amenities completed as part of phase one of development,” Perry Katz, senior vice president at Affinius Capital, said in a statement. “This project aligns with our strategy of financing exceptional multifamily assets with top-tier sponsorship.”

Ackman-Ziff’s Russell Schildkraut arranged the financing.

Located at 1099 Germantown Avenue around two miles from Philadelphia’s Center City area, the second phase of Piazza Alta will feature a mix of apartment units ranging from studios to three-bedrooms, all slated for completion in 2027. Community amenities will include a rooftop pool, grilling stations, fire pits, a fitness center, a yoga studio, dry saunas, steam rooms and coworking spaces.

“We have known the group at Affinius for many years and are pleased to do business together for the first time,” Matt Pestronk, co-founder and president of Post Brothers, said in a statement. “The entire team operated with confidence and professionalism and we are excited to do business in the future.”

Firefly Aerospace to Acquire SciTec in $855M Deal Expanding National Security Portfolio

by Clarence Oxford

Los Angeles CA (SPX) Oct 07, 2025

Firefly Aerospace (Nasdaq: FLY) has announced a definitive agreement to acquire SciTec, Inc., a recognized leader in advanced national security technologies, in a transaction valued at approximately $855 million. The deal combines $300 million in cash and $555 million in Firefly shares, issued to SciTec's owners at $50 per share.

"The acquisition of SciTec enhances our ability to support a growing number of defense missions and provides us with a significant operational advantage," said Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. "SciTec's mission-proven software and big data processing capabilities provide warfighters with rapid, accurate information to enable informed decisions that protect our homeland from emerging threats. These capabilities significantly enhance our ability to deliver integrated, software-defined solutions for critical national security imperatives, particularly Golden Dome. We are excited to welcome the SciTec team to the Firefly family and look forward to working together to continue to deliver leading edge solutions to advance our country's strategic advantage in space."

The acquisition strengthens Firefly's end-to-end space and defense offerings by incorporating SciTec's expertise in remote sensing, data analytics, and multi-phenomenology fusion. SciTec's proven competencies - ranging from missile warning and tracking to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), space domain awareness, and autonomous command and control - will complement Firefly's launch, lunar, and in-space services. The addition of ground and onboard data processing and AI-driven systems will expand Firefly's ability to provide rapid, low-latency operational solutions across multiple defense domains.

For the twelve months ending June 30, 2025, SciTec reported revenues of roughly $164 million, supported by key contracts with intelligence, defense, and national security agencies. Earlier this year, SciTec secured a $259 million contract from the U.S. Space Force to advance the Future Operational Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) program, enhancing the missile warning and tracking mission with cyber-secure, scalable ground processing systems.

"We believe Firefly is the best home for our business and people," said Jim Lisowski, CEO of SciTec. "In addition to the strong strategic fit, our cultures are similar. Both teams are empowered, rapid innovators who are passionate
