[TITLE]Flotation Reagents Industry Research Report 2025: Market to Reach $7.53 Billion by 2030, Driven by Rising Demand for Critical Minerals and Need for Higher-Efficiency Ore Processing:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Flotation Reagents Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Flotation Reagents Market, valued at USD 5.56 Billion in 2024, is projected to experience a CAGR of 5.18% to reach USD 7.53 Billion by 2030

Flotation reagents are chemical compounds essential for the froth flotation process, which separates and concentrates minerals based on their surface properties, enabling efficient extraction from various ores.

The global market's expansion is fundamentally driven by the escalating demand for metals and minerals, particularly those critical for rapidly growing sectors such as renewable energy technologies and electric vehicle manufacturing. Furthermore, the imperative for improved mineral processing efficiency, especially with increasingly complex and lower-grade ore bodies, substantially propels the adoption of advanced reagent formulations to optimize recovery rates.

Key Market Drivers

The global flotation reagents market is primarily driven by the increased global demand for metals and minerals, alongside the expansion of mining activities and mineral processing. The escalating need for metals and minerals, fueled by rapid industrialization, urbanization, and particularly the accelerating clean energy transition, necessitates efficient extraction processes. For instance, the demand for critical minerals remains robust as industries transition to sustainable technologies.

According to the International Energy Agency, May 2024, Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2024, global lithium demand alone surged by 30% in 2023, while demand for nickel, cobalt, graphite, and rare earth elements also increased significantly, ranging from 8% to 15%. To meet this rising demand, mining operations are expanding globally, often requiring the processing of lower-grade or more complex ore bodies.

This expansion directly increases the consumption of flotation reagents, which are essential for selectively separating valuable minerals from gangue material. According to the International Wrought Copper Council, October 2024, Short-Term Forecasts for Copper, global copper mine output is projected to increase by 1.6% in 2024 compared to 2023, with a further 2.2% increase forecast for 2025, underscoring the ongoing growth in mineral extraction efforts.

Key Market Challenges

Stringent environmental regulations and the imperative to mitigate the ecological footprint associated with certain flotation reagents represent a challenging factor for market expansion. These regulations impose substantial burdens on the global flotation reagents market by increasing operational complexities and compliance costs for manufacturers and mining companies alike. The necessity for continuous innovation in developing more sustainable chemical alternatives demands considerable research and development investment. This directly hampers market growth by increasing the cost of reagent production and limiting the commercial viability of less environmentally friendly yet often more cost-effective conventional reagents.

This regulatory pressure shifts focus and capital towards green chemistry, a process that can be both time-consuming and expensive, potentially slowing the introduction of new products to the market. For instance, according to the International Council on Mining and Metals, its members collectively invested $1.5 billion in community and social programs in 2024, reflecting broad efforts by the mining industry to enhance its sustainability profile and address environmental concerns. Such investments, while vital for long-term social license, divert resources that might otherwise be allocated to expanding production or reducing costs of existing reagent lines, thereby moderating market expansion.

Key Market Trends

This shift is driven by increasing environmental regulations and a growing emphasis on corporate social responsibility within the mining industry. Manufacturers are actively developing and deploying eco-friendly alternatives to traditional chemicals to mitigate the ecological footprint of mineral processing.

For instance, according to Clariant, February 2023, the company expanded its sustainable flotation reagents portfolio with a new range of biodegradable flotation chemicals designed for non-ferrous metal extraction, which demonstrated a 30% reduction in environmental impact compared to conventional products. This transition not only addresses regulatory compliance but also enhances the industry's sustainability profile, leading to increased demand for such innovative formulations.

In brief A Bonk ETP has begun trading on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, issued by Bitcoin Capital.

The product lets retail and institutional investors access Solana-based meme coin BONK through standard brokerage platforms.

BONK is currently the seventh-largest meme coin by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Solana-based meme coin Bonk (BONK) has begun trading on Switzerland's third-largest stock exchange, through a newly launched exchange traded product, adding another regulated crypto offering to Europe's expanding digital asset market.

Swiss-based crypto ETP issuer Bitcoin Capital issued the BONK ETP on SIX Swiss Exchange, allowing investors to gain exposure to the token through traditional brokerage accounts, according to an announcement shared with Decrypt.

As a subsidiary of Swiss asset-management boutique FiCAS AG, Bitcoin Capital launched the world's first actively managed Bitcoin ETP in 2020.

Switzerland's regulatory framework and market infrastructure for admitting crypto ETPs made it the “preferred venue for the launching a BONK ETP,” Marcel Niederberger, Chief Executive Officer at Bitcoin Capital & FiCAS told Decrypt.

"Europe, and specifically the SIX Swiss Exchange offers a highly developed regulatory environment with consistent supervisory practices," he said.

“The product will reach both institutional and retail investors through established broker platforms,” Niederberger said, noting that regulated ETP access tends to boost investor confidence and liquidity, with most inflows across Bitcoin Capital’s existing products still coming from institutional desks.

He anticipates “continued expansion of regulated products referencing BONK” next year, as maturing European infrastructure and rising appetite for thematic digital assets open the door to “additional ETPs and structured notes.”

BONK sits near $0.0599, up 3.5% on the day, ranking as the seventh-largest meme coin by market value per CoinGecko data.

﻿

Dogecoin leads activity

The Bonk listing follows a surge of meme coin products entering regulated markets mainly in the United States, dominated by Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market cap.

In September, the Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF became the first U.S. fund to hold DOGE, while asset manager Grayscale launched its spot GDOG product last week, generating approximately $1.4 million in first-day trading volume.

REX Shares also filed for a BONK ETF in January, alongside other meme coin products.

Meanwhile, 21Shares unveiled a 2x leveraged Dogecoin ETF on the Nasdaq last week, while Bitwise's Dogecoin ETF, BWOW, received approval from NYSE Arca on Tuesday for listing and registration.

[TITLE]Vanguard caves on crypto to retain clients as rivals win flows — opens $9.3T platform to crypto ETFs:
[TEXT]
On Dec. 2, Vanguard will reportedly open its massive brokerage platform to spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

This strategic volte-face ends the asset manager’s steadfast isolation from the $3 trillion digital asset market.

For years, Vanguard stood as the most prominent holdout of the crypto space, driven by a philosophy that viewed the high volatility of digital assets as fundamentally incompatible with the principles of long-term, diversified portfolio construction.

This reversal, therefore, represents one of the most significant capitulations in the traditional finance sector’s gradual embrace of the crypto economy.

Crucially, Vanguard said it is not deviating from its core manufacturing philosophy. So, it would not be launching its own proprietary crypto funds.

Instead, it will serve as a critical gateway, allowing its conservative client base to access regulated products managed by rival issuers such as BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and Bitwise Asset Management.

Speaking on the broader significance of the move, Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, noted the stark contrast between the magnitude of the policy shift and the market’s muted reaction, a sign of the asset class’s maturity.

He noted:

“The 2nd largest brokerage in America flips its policy from sell-only to allowing crypto ETF purchases. And no one is fired up. Whether people are stoked right now or not — crypto is rapidly entering the mainstream.”

Why is Vanguard changing its decision

The firm’s restrictions on crypto ETFs had remained firmly in place even after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin funds in early 2024 and the first Ethereum products later that year.

Notably, Vanguard’s internal client guidelines and platform eligibility rules kept those ETFs from its self-directed brokerage system, citing regulatory ambiguity and investor protection concerns.

However, the calculus changed following a sweeping shift in the regulatory environment under the current US administration.

The SEC’s pivot toward a pro-innovation stance, combined with years of court decisions, effectively evaporated the regulatory uncertainty that Vanguard had long cited as a barrier.

Indeed, the approvals of spot crypto ETFs were underpinned by robust frameworks that establish how surveillance-sharing agreements, custody arrangements, and disclosure standards apply to digital assets.

These frameworks, first battle-tested with Bitcoin ETFs, became the template for subsequent products, significantly reducing the operational risk for brokers offering access through retail platforms.

Furthermore, the move is an acknowledgment of irrefutable market realities. A recent study found that 35% of younger, wealthy Americans have left their financial advisors because they do not allow access to crypto.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the fastest-growing ETFs in US history, demonstrating that demand for crypto exposure had decisively shifted from niche trading platforms to mainstream asset managers.

Today, spot Bitcoin funds manage approximately $120 billion in assets across issuers, while Ethereum ETFs collectively hold nearly $20 billion.

At the same time, newer products tracking Solana and XRP are succeeding, thanks to strong market demand.

Beyond regulation, the absence of crypto access had become a burgeoning competitive liability for Vanguard.

Notably, many clients already held crypto ETFs in accounts outside Vanguard while maintaining traditional holdings on the platform. This bifurcation forced advisors to route trades through separate institutions, complicating processes such as tax-loss harvesting and model portfolio management.

So, this decision acknowledges that clients seeking exposure through regulated ETFs should be able to execute those trades within their primary Vanguard accounts rather than migrating capital to outside brokers.

Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, reportedly said:

“Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity. The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured, and investor preferences continue to evolve.”

How will this impact the crypto ETF market?

The direct impact on ETF flows will depend on how Vanguard’s unique client base responds.

Vanguard manages more than $9.3 trillion in assets, but the addressable market for these products is narrower because only self-directed brokerage and IRA accounts are authorized to trade them. Institutional mandates, defined benefit plans, and other pooled vehicles generally remain restricted from such allocations.

Moreover, Vanguard clients exhibit behavior distinct from the active traders who drove early crypto ETF inflows. This demographic favors passive, long-dated index products over thematic or tactical funds.

As a result, initial allocations are expected to be modest. Still, a penetration rate of roughly 0.1% to 0.2% of eligible brokerage assets would imply early flows in the low-single-digit billions, spread across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP funds.

Meanwhile, the significance of Vanguard’s entry lies not in the velocity of the flows, but in the stickiness of the capital. Unlike the “mercenary capital” of hedge funds or the reactive flows of retail day traders, Vanguard inflows tend to be price-agnostic and permanent.

So, in a standard “60/40/1” portfolio—allocated to equities, bonds, and crypto respectively—automated systems maintain target weightings by selling outperforming assets and buying underperforming ones. If the price of Bitcoin or Solana drops, the portfolio algorithmically buys more to restore the 1% weighting.

This creates a structural “buy the dip” mechanism that could dampen volatility and raise floor prices over a full market cycle.

Moreover, broader distribution typically improves liquidity.

The influx of Vanguard’s diversified volume is expected to narrow bid-ask spreads and reduce execution costs for all investors, further tightening the efficiency of ETF arbitrage mechanisms and the responsiveness of pricing to underlying market movements.

As a result, even a conservative adoption curve could have outsized impacts. So, if only a fraction of Vanguard’s client base allocates a standard 1% to 2% “satellite” position to crypto ETFs, it represents tens of billions of dollars in net new demand.

India plans to call bids by January for setting up manufacturing facilities for rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) under a ₹7,280-crore incentive scheme, officials said.The government will notify the scheme this month and soon start pre-bid consultations, they said."We are hoping to call bids by January-end," a senior official told ET. The scheme's draft guidelines would be put up for stakeholder comments before notification, the official said.India is seeking to achieve self-reliance in manufacturing of permanent rare earth magnets, vital to meet rapidly growing demand from sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defence.The scheme, approved by the Union cabinet in November, was firmed up after extensive consultations with stakeholders involved in the permanent magnet supply chain. It aims to establish 6,000 metric tonnes per annum of integrated REPM manufacturing in the country.The official said indigenous technology for REPM manufacturing has been developed under a dedicated programme run by the Department of Science and Technology.To tie-up raw material supplies, the Centre is in talks with several suppliers of rare earth oxides from South America, Africa, the UK, and Australia who have offered to supply these chemical compounds.A tonne of rare earth oxide can be used for producing

[TITLE]Rare earth magnet sops to lift India’s EV, chip plans: Industry:
[TEXT]
The Union Cabinet’s approval of a Rs 7,280 crore scheme to promote manufacturing of sintered rare earth permanent magnets ( REPM ) will help address a crucial missing link in India’s electric vehicle (EV) and chip supply chains, electronics and semiconductor industry executives said.The programme aims to create 6,000 metric tonnes per annum of integrated REPM capacity through five globally bid projects, backed by sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy over a seven-year period.Under the scheme, India will, for the first time, support end-to-end REPM manufacturing, from rare earth oxides to metals, alloys and finished magnets, in order to cut import dependence and serve fast-growing demand from EVs, renewables, industrial electronics and defence.The government has earmarked Rs 6,450 crore for sales-linked incentives over five years and Rs 750 crore as capital support to set up the targeted 6,000 metric tonnes per annum capacity, with each of the five selected players expected to get up to 1,200 metric tonnes per annum.Officials expect India’s REPM consumption to roughly double between 2025 and 2030, driven primarily by EVs and clean energy, making domestic capacity critical to supply chain security and the country’s Net Zero 2070 roadmap.The scheme’s seven-year timeline includes a two-year gestation period for plants to come up, followed by five years of incentive disbursal linked to magnet sales.The REPM scheme complements ongoing semiconductor and electronics initiatives by addressing a core upstream vulnerability in India’s EV and chip ecosystem, said industry executives.Mayank Shrivastava, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and cofounder of AGNIT Semiconductors that specialises in gallium nitride semiconductor technology, said the programme is “as critical as building fabs”. This is because advanced electronics depends on magnetic materials as much as on silicon, and the initiative shores up a key weak link in the country’s electronics supply chain.Rajoo Goel, secretary-general of the Electronic Industries Association of India , called the government scheme a first of its kind initiative focused on the core of the supply chain for electronics. Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet available, making them critical for emerging technology applications like electric motors for vehicles, defence and aerospace, renewable energy, computer hard drives and smaller electronics such as smartphones, he said.These magnets are efficient, long-lasting, and have higher resistance to corrosion and high temperatures, he explained. With rapidly growing demand for electronic products and technology, magnets and inputs made of rare earth materials have become critical, he added.The electronics industry is becoming increasingly dependent on the same and the countries which control their supply chain and technology have a geopolitical advantage and can dictate terms to the rest of the world, Goel said. Vivek Tyagi , executive council member at the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, said the scheme could quickly reduce import dependence for two- and three-wheeler manufacturers while also benefiting four-wheeler players over time.Several executives view the move as a logical follow-on to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's India Semiconductor Mission, aligning magnet manufacturing incentives with policies to attract chip fabs and advanced packaging units.The policy push comes as Andhra Pradesh emerges as a hub for downstream electronics and semiconductor manufacturing linked to EVs and industrial applications.Advanced System in Package (ASIP) Technologies is setting up an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility in the state in partnership with South Korea’s APACT, with an initial investment of Rs 468 crore.Chennai-based Syrma SGS, through its unit Syrma Strategic Electronics, is also building a Rs 765 crore multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) plant in Andhra Pradesh under the Centre’s electronic component manufacturing scheme, strengthening local PCB availability for automotive and industrial original equipment manufacturers.ASIP Technologies chief executive Venkata Simhadri said the rapid transition to EV two-wheelers and four-wheelers makes it “very important for India to create the local ecosystem and supply chain”, pointing to both semiconductors and REPMs as key components in the new mobility stack.He highlighted that the REPM scheme, along with ISM incentives for fabs and advanced packaging, addresses crucial elements of the EV supply chain, from permanent magnet motors on the mechanical side to compound semiconductor-based motor control and battery charging systems on the electronics side.While many electronics manufacturing services (EMS) players do not directly process rare earth materials, they expect second-order benefits from improved magnet availability.Syrma SGS managing director Jasbir Singh Gujral said REPMs are critical inputs for EV and semiconductor industries, and a domestic magnet ecosystem will indirectly help EMS companies by making the supply of magnet-based components more predictable and reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions.Syrma’s own operations rely on components made using REPMs, rather than raw magnets themselves, so greater upstream resilience should translate into smoother sourcing for finished parts, he said."It's a very well curated scheme that is coming at the apt time. It's going to take some time for these capacities to get created but the reactions I'm getting from my peers are quite positive," an EMS company executive said on the condition of anonymity."There is a belief that the investments are going to come in. And this is again de-risking from the borderland country which is absolutely prudent," he said.For fabless firms such as BigEndian Semiconductors, which designs custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions from its Bengaluru base while partnering with a foundry in Taiwan, the scheme stresses India’s intent to build deeper hardware value chains.Cofounder and chief executive Sunil Kumar cautioned that gestation-heavy incentive schemes tend to favour already established large organisations. However, innovation often comes from smaller challengers, making it important for policy to be calibrated to company size, he argued.Academia and skill-development experts expect the REPM scheme to catalyse new electronics manufacturing clusters, particularly for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and startups in advanced materials and magnet-based components.T Senthil Siva Subramanian, who heads the Institute Industry Interface programme at Hindustan College of Science and Technology in Mathura, said the scheme can help create MSME-focused electronics clusters that bridge lab-to-market gaps, generate new job roles through skilling, and encourage startups in REPM and related applications.He added that such clusters can feed into broader initiatives like “Vocal for Local” and “One District One Product” by nurturing “swadeshi” proof-of-concepts, while also advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals related to industry, innovation, infrastructure and climate action.Experts argue that domestic REPM capacity carries strategic weight beyond EVs, given its applications in defence, medical devices, nuclear research reactors and precision agriculture equipment.Subramanian pointed out that magnets such as samarium-cobalt and neodymium-iron-boron are critical across defence security systems, electronic traction motors, therapeutic medical equipment, nuclear research reactors and electronic farm machinery, and that local design and production capabilities can enhance India’s strategic autonomy and global ranking in high-tech manufacturing.He also expects the scheme to spur intangible investments in design tools, miniaturised products, software and intellectual property around rare earth magnets, boosting India’s standing in global innovation indices and helping domestic products progress across technology, customer, manufacturing and investment readiness levels.For policymakers and industry, the REPM push is increasingly seen as a foundational layer that strengthens everything from chip packaging and compound semiconductors to EVs, robotics and flexible electronics.(With inputs from Dia Rekhi in Chennai)
