[TITLE]Catamaran Ventures to follow patient capital route in bets on India's manufacturing push:
[TEXT]
Billionaire N R Narayan Murthy's family office Catamaran Ventures plans to make more growth stage equity bets in manufacturing, a top executive at the firm said on Wednesday.

“Our thesis is based on the view that over the next 5-10 years in India, from a wealth and job creation perspective, the country needs to develop its supply chain for precision manufacturing," Deepak Padaki, president at Catamaran Ventures told Mint.

Murthy, a co-founder of information technology services bellwether Infosys Ltd, is chairman emeritus of Catamaran.

Over the last year, several funds have been deepening their focus on manufacturing as a sector, with some launching new funds to narrow down on the industry's potential. Much of this is backed by private equity and venture capital's belief that manufacturing and supply chain companies are going to be what pushes India to become an export-led economy.

“Themes like import substitution (for EMS), rising domestic consumption (for packaging, building materials) and India’s emergence as an export hub (for chemicals, auto, engineered solutions, aerospace and defense) are providing structural long-term impetus to companies," said Koushik Bhattacharyya, managing director and head of industrials investment banking at Mumbai investment bank Avendus Capital. (EMS is short for electronic manufacturing services.)

So far, Catamaran has two precision manufacturing investments: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker. Both companies are headed for IPOs.

Catamaran has so far made two investments in the manufacturing space, both of which are headed for the public markets: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker looking to raise up to Rs1,000 crore through an offer for sale. Catamaran has also invested in point-of-care medical diagnostics company Achira Labs.

The family office's sees supply chain manufacturing companies as not a good fit with typical venture capital bets given the long gestation period for such businesses. Most generalist VC funds look for exits in a five to six year horizon.

Manufacturing, which is considered a sub-sector of deeptech given the changing nature of the activity and patents around it, take as long as 10-15 years to come of some scale. For private equity to back such startups, on the other hand, they need them to be more mature businesses.

“We're more mid-market private equity when it comes to manufacturing. We thought about how we as a family office can put money into companies that is patient capital," said Padaki.

Sectors of opportunity

Catamaran is focused on a few areas within manufacturing: aerospace, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the electric vehicle space, medical devices and semiconductor companies.

The family office sees defence as “interesting" while on the lookout for companies that have achieved some scale and can be taken global — of which it has seen very few. Even on the aerospace side, apart from Aequs, despite Catamaran's desire to do more in the coming year, the pipeline is looking thin.

There's more action in electric vehicle OEMs, however. “There's a lot of small component manufacturers in places like NCR (Delhi region) and Coimbatore that are promoter-owned who are switching to EVs because we already have a strong base in auto component manufacturing," said Padaki. “We're more interested in EV supply chain components like motors, electronic systems, that kind of thing."

Catamaran is also looking to back battery recycling companies that are looking to claw back the rare earth materials used to make EV batteries.

In the electronics and semiconductor space, there are two burgeoning ends like a dumbbell. On the one end, there are plenty of startups but they're still very early in their journey, and on the other, there's fabrication companies which require very large investments to build out factories. Catamaran is scouting for those in the middle. “We're looking for companies that are in the semiconductor or data center space that are looking for growth capital support," said the Catamaran president.

Cheques from Catamaran would range from ₹50 crore to ₹250 crore and in some exceptional cases, the family office is willing to go up to ₹400-500 crore, especially when companies from outside India are looking to build joint-ventures for strategic partnerships in the country.

Previously, Catamaran had a joint venture with e-commerce behemoth Amazon back in 2014 called Cloudtail. In 2021, Amazon acquired the family office's stake due to stricter rules for e-commerce marketplaces with foreign investments.

The firm has traditionally been selective in how it makes investments and that's not changing going into 2026. "Our run rate is typically two to three investments, for which we have to look at 10-12 companies" said Padaki. “These are long gestation in terms of companies because we have to understand the promoters for some time to build relationships. Even next year, we're looking to do maybe two or three."

Manufacturing maturity in 2026

India saw some large deals by risk capital players in manufacturing this year. VIP Industries raised $206 million in a round led by Multiples. Euler Motors secured $75 million from GIC and British International Investments, while Scimplify raised $40 million in a deal led by Accel and Omnivore Partners. Rangsons Aerospace also raised capital in a round led by ValueQuest.

Many of the manufacturing startups that cropped up between 2018-2020 are also now on the lookout for their growth rounds. “Valuations need to see a shift," said Padaki. “The reason many of these companies don't get high valuations is because people don't understand that these are ROCE businesses and not growth-at-all-costs businesses."

ROCE stands for return on capital employed and is a ratio used to assess a company's profitability and capital efficiency, essentially giving insight into how well it is doing based on the money it is spending.

Aequs and SEDEMAC are both heading for the public markets and Catamaran hopes their debut will set the precedent for IPOs by other manufacturers. “Today, you don't have that many precedents of small promoter-owned companies that have suddenly gone public," Padaki said.

Given how the various themes are playing out across manufacturing and precision manufacturing, both venture capital and private equity players have their ears perked for companies that are growing sustainably. “While some near-term factors like tariff might lead to temporary uncertainty, we see large amounts of private capital entering this sector in the next 3-5 years," said Avendus' Bhattacharyya.

[TITLE]Core inflation in Japan's capital brings BOJ closer to a rate hike:
[TEXT]
TOKYO :Core consumer inflation in Japan's capital stayed well above the central bank's 2 per cent target in November as firms continued to pass on rising costs mainly for food, data showed on Friday, reinforcing the case for a near-term interest rate hike.

Separate data for October showed retail sales and factory output rose while the jobless rate was steady at 2.6 per cent, suggesting the world's fourth-largest economy was weathering the impact of higher U.S. tariffs at least for now.

The slew of indicators will be among factors the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will scrutinise in deciding whether to raise interest rates in December, or hold off until next year.

"With the labour market still tight and inflation excluding fresh food and energy set to remain above 3 per cent for now, the Bank of Japan will resume its tightening cycle over the next couple of months," said Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics.

The Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.8 per cent in November from a year earlier, steady from October and roughly matching a median market forecast for a 2.7 per cent gain.

A separate index for Tokyo that strips away both fresh food and fuel costs - closely watched by the BOJ as a measure of demand-driven prices - rose 2.8 per cent in November from a year earlier, unchanged from the pace in October.

The increase in Tokyo CPI, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, was driven mostly by continued gains in food prices with the cost of rice up 38.5 per cent year-on-year, a bag of coffee beans 63.4 per cent higher and chocolate up 32.5 per cent.

Service-sector inflation stood at 1.5 per cent in November, largely unchanged from 1.6 per cent in October and much more moderate than a 4.0 per cent year-on-year gain in goods prices, the data showed.

The BOJ has said price rises must be driven by solid wage gains and robust domestic demand for inflation to durably hit its 2 per cent target, and meet the conditions for further rate hikes.

But recent renewed declines in the yen may further push up food prices and broader underlying inflation, a point BOJ board member Asahi Noguchi made on Thursday in warning of the risk of waiting too long before raising rates.

YEN FALLS PUT FOCUS ON BOJ POLICY

Separate data released on Friday showed Japan's factory output unexpectedly rose 1.4 per cent in October from the previous month due to robust automobile production.

But manufacturers surveyed by the government expect industrial output to fall 1.2 per cent in November and shrink 2 per cent in December, suggesting the hit from U.S. tariffs could intensify in coming months.

The BOJ exited a decade-long, massive stimulus last year and raised interest rates to 0.5 per cent in January on the view Japan was on the cusp of sustainably hitting its 2 per cent inflation target.

While it has kept rates steady since then to gauge the economic impact of U.S. tariffs, stubbornly high inflation has shifted opinion in the BOJ board to increasingly favour a hike.

Reflationist advisers of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi have warned against an early rate hike, pointing to weak consumption and data showing Japan's economy shrank in the third quarter.

But the yen's recent slump to 10-month lows could help the BOJ make the case to hike rates soon, as doing so could prop up the currency and ease the burden on households from rising import costs, some analysts say.

What Is The Role Of Iron And Steel In Clean Energy Transitions?

Steel production is highly reliant on coal, which is primarily used as a reducing agent to extract iron from iron ore and to provide the carbon content needed in steel. Over the past decade, total CO2 emissions from the iron and steel sector have risen, largely owning to increases in steel demand. The direct CO2 intensity of crude steel production has decreased slightly in the past few years, but efforts need to be accelerated to get on track with the pathway in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.

Why Is Iron and Steel Important?

Driven by population and economic growth, global demand for steel has been growing strongly in recent years and is expected to continue to increase, especially because of economic expansion in India, ASEAN countries and Africa, even as demand in China gradually declines.

Types of Iron

As previously said, pure iron isn’t really useful since it’s very soft and reactive. However, its properties are greatly enhanced when it’s alloyed with other metals and non-metals. Thus, all materials that people broadly refer to as iron are actually different types of iron-based alloys. There are several types of iron:

Pig Iron — Pig iron is iron in its basic, raw form, which is molded into blocks, otherwise known as pigs.

— Pig iron is iron in its basic, raw form, which is molded into blocks, otherwise known as pigs. Cast Iron — cast iron is an alloy with very high carbon content, which is melted, poured, and allowed to cool and harden. It’s often used for producing structural shapes.

— cast iron is an alloy with very high carbon content, which is melted, poured, and allowed to cool and harden. It’s often used for producing structural shapes. Wrought Iron — wrought iron has a lower carbon content and plenty of impurities, which makes it softer than cast iron, allowing you to reheat and reshape the metal.

History of Iron Production

Iron was undoubtedly known to the ancient world, and one of the earliest examples is beads made from meteoritic iron ore dating back to 3,500 BC Egypt. Mankind didn’t extract iron from the Earth due to a lack of technological knowledge, so they associated this metal with heavenly origins. Egyptians continued to work with meteoritic iron until 2,500 BC.

At the same time, samples of smelted iron can be found in Asmar, Mesopotamia, and Syria, dating between 3,000 and 2,700 BC. The Hittites were among the first to smelt iron between 1,500 and 1,200 BC, and it’s likely that the practice of iron smelting spread throughout the rest of the ancient world, ushering in the Iron Age.

Cast iron first appeared in the 5th century BC in China but was hardly used in Europe until the medieval period. Cast iron eventually replaced wrought iron towards the end of the 18th century, when its use became incredibly widespread, furthering the development of construction, transportation, and numerous other industries.

Types of Steel

As an alloy, steel can be enhanced with different amounts of different chemical elements, resulting in more than 3,500 different steel grades, each with its unique properties. However, these grades are typically grouped into four different types of steel:

Carbon Steel : Carbon steel got its name because it’s primarily made of iron and carbon, with a minute and negligible traces of other elements. The resulting material is exceptionally strong but very susceptible to corrosion. Carbon steel is further categorized according to its carbon content into low-carbon or mild steel, medium-carbon steel, and high-carbon steel.
