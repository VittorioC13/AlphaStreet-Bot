Senior U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie threw out criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James yesterday. Currie said Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who led the indictments, was invalidly appointed. Both cases were dismissed "without prejudice," meaning the charges could be filed again. The rulings mark a loss for President Donald Trump, who pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against his political foes. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNBC that "this will not be the final word on this matter."

Amazon became the latest tech company to throw eye-popping sums behind AI buildout initiatives. The e-commerce giant said it will invest as much as $50 billion to expand its capacity to provide AI and high-performance computing capabilities for its cloud unit's U.S. government customers. The project is expected to begin in 2026 and will add close to 1.3 gigawatts of capacity. With the investment, government clients will also have access to Anthropic's Claude models and Nvidia chips, in addition to Amazon hardware and software. Also yesterday, Amazon said it will let businesses test its internet-from-space service, which was recently renamed Leo from Project Kuiper. As CNBC's Annie Palmer notes, the product competes with SpaceX's Starlink.

5. Power play

CNBC Sport is out this morning with its new NHL team valuations for 2025. The average franchise has seen its value rise 15% to $2.2 billion, driven by pricier media rights deals. The Toronto Maple Leafs remained at the front of the pack with a valuation of $4.3 billion, up 8% from last year. The New York Rangers is the runner-up, rising by 9% year over year to $3.8 billion.

Microsoft faced vocal community opposition to a data center plan in Caledonia, Wisconsin, leading the tech giant to scrap its plans and look elsewhere. CNBC's Jordan Novet broke down the local reaction.

[TITLE]Palworld publisher picks up Vision Quench, a co-op dark fantasy looter shooter set in a consumer goods conglomerate mega dungeon:
[TEXT]
Set in the underbelly of a consumer goods conglomerate mega dungeon, Vision Quench is now being published by Palword's Pocketpair Publishing. From WizMUD, this is their first game on Steam and it's going to release sometime in 2026.

More about it: "The last remnant of a vanished bargain lies yet unclaimed atop the Green Tower, where the Sweepstakes Code endures as both a promise and a curse. To redeem it, you and your 3 companions, drawn together by the distant memory of a memory, must fight your way up the tower through a sprawling labyrinth of hidden designs, metaphysical phenomena, and all manner of foul creatures."

Check out the trailer:

Some Highlights:

Features 3D voice chat that’s reactive to the environment, allowing you to connect with your teammates on a spiritual level.

Fight enemies using an arsenal of medieval weapons and contemporary tech scattered throughout the dungeon, ranging from torches and morning stars to fireworks and GloweeZ© guns

One player can carry a backpack allowing everyone to stay mobile while they loot. Items can be easily tossed in and out of the bag. Protect the backpack carrier at all costs, or at least the backpack.

Be mindful of your party’s status, even in this altered state players can become ill and pass it on to others.

Easily throw bandaids and fizzy drinks to your friends in need, but be careful when throwing things like fireworks and cinderblocks

Upon death you’ll become a Freakopop, a plastic toy that can be picked up and thrown around. Assist the living with your newfound Freako Vision.

Your presence may become noted by the Entity: A shadowy creature that takes on different forms. It will try and disconnect you from your vision quest if you don't play by its rules.

A breadth of customization options will allow you to become the adventurer you always wanted to be. Wizard hats, chain gauntlets, Tru Religions – endless possibilities

It's not clear if it will have a Native Linux version or if you'll need Proton for it. There's Linux system requirements on Steam, but they don't make it clear right now as it's not fully filled.

[TITLE]Performance Food Group, US Foods end merger talks:
[TEXT]
Performance Food Group and US Foods have ended talks that would have created the largest domestic foodservice company and one of the nation’s largest private fleets.

Both companies operate more than 6,000 tractors. A combination would have created the biggest food distributor in the U.S. with over $100 billion in annual net sales. Richmond, Virginia-based Performance Food Group (NYSE: PFGC) has approximately 155 distribution centers and Rosemont, Illinois-based US Foods (NYSE: USFD) has over 70.

The combined market capitalization would have been north of $30 billion, rivaling the largest food distributor, Houston-based Sysco (NYSE: SYY), which has a $36 billion market cap.

Sysco generates over $80 billion in net sales annually through its 337 distribution centers in 10 countries. It has a fleet of over 19,000 delivery vehicles.

“Our Board of Directors is unanimous in its belief that the clearest and best path to long-term stockholder values is executing our standalone strategic plan, leveraging our diverse business segments to drive consistent revenue and profit growth,” said PFG Chairman and CEO George Holm in a news release. “The strength of our recently reported fiscal first quarter results and continued momentum supports the confidence in our ability to drive value for stockholders independently.”

PFG reaffirmed its full-year fiscal 2026 guidance of $67.5 billion to $68.5 billion in net sales and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion.

Dive Brief:

US Foods and Performance Food Group will no longer pursue a potential merger, the companies announced Monday.

The food distributors stopped discussions after formally considering the matter for months, which included analyzing synergies and regulatory matters.

“Our Board of Directors is unanimous in its belief that the clearest and best path to long-term stockholder values is executing our standalone strategic plan, leveraging our diverse business segments to drive consistent revenue and profit growth,” PFG CEO George Holm said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

US Foods CEO David Flitman said in early August that the Illinois-based company had initiated the process and probed the combination potential with PFG even earlier.

Flitman’s company has continued to have investment capital available. Its board in recent years approved billions of dollars for share repurchases.

With the merger discussions ending, US Foods’ board approved another $1 billion share repurchase program, the company said.

“We have concluded that our best path to long-term value creation is executing our Long-range Plan, including our disciplined capital allocation framework,” Flitman said in a statement.

The two companies already control major markets. US Foods has approximately 30,000 workers, and Virginia-headquartered PFG has around 43,000 workers, according to company figures.

The pair follow behind Sysco in their tractor count, per Transport Topics’ list of the largest private carriers.

[TITLE]Upbeat Start to Holiday 2025 Seen on Black Friday:
[TEXT]
Though no blockbuster or as frenetic as in years past, Black Friday 2025 was nevertheless a good day for the retail industry.

Consumers sensing that on Black Friday price promotions would peak and that the most desired gifts could sell out closer to Christmas, as well as the cold but sunny and clear weather, combined to fuel the business. So did all the new tools available to make shopping easier, such as agentic commerce, chatbots, and buy now, pay later programs.

According to reports from tech and research firms and mall executives, the crowds and purchasing on Black Friday were big enough to bolster expectations for mid-single-digit gains this season and mollify concerns that higher prices and economic uncertainties would put a big dent in holiday spending. They said crowd sizes, and the promotional intensity, seemed on par with last year. Price promotions were widely at 30 to 50 percent off, and are not likely to go significantly higher in the weeks ahead, except on an item basis with slow movers, industry sources said.

“It’s not a breakout year, but not a bad year. Growth is decent. Traffic is decent. It’s almost like a return to normalcy,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. “There’s low-to-mid-single digit velocity in terms of year-over-year growth in transactions.”

[TITLE]CardCash.com Announces Black Friday Savings Availability, Offering Up to 35% Discounts Across 1,100+ Major Retailers:
[TEXT]
Discount Gift Card Marketplace Highlights Black Friday Offerings as Consumers Navigate Elevated Prices and Constrained Discretionary Spending

SCHAUMBURG, IL, Nov. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Giftify, Inc. (NASDAQ: GIFT) (the "Company"), the owner and operator of CardCash.com, Restaurant.com, and Takeout7.com, and a leader in the incentives and rewards industry, today announced the availability of Black Friday gift card savings through its CardCash.com platform, offering consumers cost-effective shopping solutions with discounts of up to 35% on purchases from over 1,100 major retailers during the Black Friday shopping period.

Recent economic indicators demonstrate continued consumer budget constraints, with retail sales growth below consensus expectations, core retail metrics showing sequential deceleration, and major retailers acknowledging discretionary spending pressure due to economic conditions. These market dynamics are driving increased consumer focus on maximizing purchasing power during the critical holiday shopping season, creating favorable conditions for platforms that deliver immediate, measurable savings on everyday purchases.

CardCash.com's Black Friday offerings provide consumers access to the Company's leading secondary gift card exchange platform, with savings of up to 35% on purchases from over 1,100 major retailers. The platform's value proposition becomes particularly relevant during promotional shopping periods when consumers seek to maximize purchasing power amid constrained budgets. The discount gift card marketplace addresses the dual consumer need for cost savings and brand selection by enabling purchases at preferred retailers while reducing out-of-pocket spending at the point of sale.

The Company's operational capabilities position CardCash to efficiently serve anticipated increased Black Friday shopping activity. The platform delivered nearly $150 million in gift cards over the past year, including close to 1 million digital cards, demonstrating scalable infrastructure capable of handling elevated transaction volumes. CardCash maintains a 99.5% instant fulfillment rate for digital orders, with proprietary automation technology enabling rapid order processing during peak demand periods. The platform's recent enhancement to fraud detection systems, which improved new customer approval rates by over 10%, ensures security standards remain robust while supporting customer acquisition during high-traffic shopping events.

"Economic data clearly shows consumers are more budget-conscious than in prior periods, and Black Friday represents a critical opportunity for CardCash to demonstrate the immediate value our platform provides," said Ketan Thakker, Chief Executive Officer of Giftify, Inc. "Our secondary gift card marketplace directly addresses consumer demand for cost savings without compromising shopping preferences or brand selection. The convergence of promotional Black Friday discounts with our existing gift card savings creates compelling value for consumers seeking to stretch their purchasing power during what remains a challenging economic environment for many households."

Thakker continued, "We've strengthened our operational capabilities to serve increased demand efficiently through recent infrastructure improvements including enhanced fraud detection and automation systems. The same economic pressures impacting traditional retail create opportunities for platforms like CardCash that deliver measurable savings at the point of sale. We expect to see strong consumer engagement as shoppers seek to maximize the value of every dollar spent during the holiday shopping season."

Tom Ochoa, Head of Sales and Business Development at CardCash, added, "The platform's ability to stack discounted gift cards with retailer promotional pricing creates one of the most effective savings strategies available to consumers during Black Friday. Our digital-first model, with instant fulfillment and our 45-day fraud guarantee, aligns with how consumers increasingly prefer to shop while providing the security and convenience they expect. We anticipate strong performance across our retail categories as consumers leverage our marketplace to access preferred brands at reduced costs."

The discount gift card marketplace serves an increasingly important role in the retail ecosystem as consumers seek cost-effective purchasing alternatives during periods of economic uncertainty. Industry trends supporting CardCash's Black Friday opportunity include sustained elevation in gift card usage as a preferred payment method, growing consumer acceptance of secondary marketplaces for everyday shopping, increasing digital adoption for holiday shopping activities, and heightened price sensitivity driving demand for immediate savings solutions.

CardCash.com's Black Friday offerings include access to major retailers across categories including electronics and technology, fashion and apparel, home goods and department stores, toys and entertainment, and travel and hospitality. This breadth of brand selection ensures consumers can access savings across their priority purchase categories while maintaining shopping preferences established with trusted national retailers. The Company expects the Black Friday period to demonstrate continued momentum in the discount gift card marketplace as economic conditions support sustained consumer focus on value-oriented shopping strategies.

While social media and influencer marketing increase company reach and customer engagement, e-commerce expansion has spurred adoption.

Rising demand for sustainable and eco-friendly packaging further boosts market innovation. Better client targeting is also made possible by technology developments in data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), which boost customer happiness and retention and fortify the subscription box ecosystem as a whole.

Growth Drivers for the United States Subscription Box Market

E-commerce Expansion

A major driver of the U.S. subscription box market's expansion has been e-commerce, which has produced a smooth online environment for discovery, buying, and delivery. Subscription models capitalize on consumers' growing comfort level with online shopping by providing predictability and convenience through regular deliveries.

Consumer adoption is increased by simple access to digital platforms, smartphone apps, and safe online payments. Subscription box businesses may reach a larger audience because to e-commerce's scalability, and integrated logistics networks facilitate prompt and economical delivery. Long-term consumer dependence on digital retail was further exacerbated by the spike in online purchasing during and after the pandemic, establishing e-commerce as the cornerstone of the subscription box market's expansion.

Personalization and Curation

Customers' growing need for distinctive, customized experiences is driving the U.S. subscription box market's rise in large part due to personalization and curation. Brands may create boxes that suit consumer tastes in areas like food, wellness, fashion, and beauty by utilizing customer data, surveys, and AI-driven analytics.

Customers are kept interested and product fatigue is decreased by this element of surprise and discovery. Additionally, curated offers foster emotional bonds that increase client retention and loyalty. Subscription services differ from typical retail in that they can provide products that are tailored to the preferences of their customers. Curated subscription boxes continue to draw a variety of consumers looking for value, novelty, and relevance in their purchases as personalization becomes more extensive thanks to cutting-edge technology.

Social Media and Influencer Marketing

The U.S. subscription box business is experiencing significant growth because to social media and influencer marketing, which are revolutionizing the way customers find and interact with brands. Visually captivating, shareable unboxing experiences that inspire enthusiasm and trust are made possible by platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. By presenting products to highly targeted audiences, influencers increase brand visibility and encourage both trial and recurring subscriptions.

Social media platforms also give brands the opportunity to communicate with customers directly, get their opinions, and create communities centered around their products. Authentic recommendations and viral campaigns save marketing expenses while increasing consumer acquisition. Social media will continue to be a key component of the industry's growth because to this convergence of digital engagement with subscription arrangements.

Challenges in the United States Subscription Box Market

High Customer Acquisition Costs

High client acquisition costs, which are a result of fierce competition and aggressive marketing, are one of the main issues facing the U.S. subscription box market. With hundreds of participants in the culinary, wellness, lifestyle, and beauty sectors, brands substantially invest in influencer relationships, digital advertisements, and promotions to draw in new members. Free trials and introductory discounts aid in customer acquisition but can lower profitability, particularly when turnover rates are still high.

Additionally, margins are further strained by the growing expenses of social media advertising. In order to achieve sustained customer growth in a competitive market, businesses must strike a balance between acquisition spending and retention efforts, utilizing value-added services, loyalty programs, and personalization.

Sustainability Pressures

In the U.S. subscription box business, sustainability has become both a must and a difficulty. Businesses are being forced to rethink their supply chains as a result of consumers' growing demands for ethical sourcing, eco-friendly packaging, and less waste. However, because recyclable packaging and eco-friendly materials are more costly than conventional ones, implementing sustainable practices frequently results in higher operating costs.

It can be particularly challenging for smaller subscription businesses to strike a balance between affordability and environmental requirements. Furthermore, social and regulatory constraints are only increasing, necessitating increased compliance and openness. Although sustainability can set subscription box companies apart, it's still quite difficult for them to satisfy these standards without compromising their profit margins in the US.

Recent Developments in United States Subscription Box Market

Chicago Sports Network (CHSN): For Chicago sports lovers, CHSN announced in November 2024 the debut of a new subscription streaming service.

[TITLE]Global e-commerce startup funding hits 2020s low, while 2025 U.S. holiday spending could break records:
[TEXT]
The Retail Super Bowl is upon us: Black Friday through Cyber Monday is here.

And 2025 is expected to be record-breaking: The National Retail Federation anticipates that, for the first time, U.S. holiday spending will cross $1 trillion. Now, a seeming contradiction—funding for e-commerce startups is at a low.

In 2021, global e-commerce-related startup funding peaked (along with so much else) and reached more than $94 billion, according to Crunchbase. Fast-forward to 2025. That number has come crashing down, lingering around $7.3 billion. (For context, in 2020, e-commerce-related startup funding came in around $31 billion.)

So, what’s going on here? I spoke to Indy Guha, general partner at VMG Partners, as we headed into Thanksgiving. First thing you need to understand, said Guha, is that the 2021 boom was buoyed by the peaks of the ZIRP era, but at the center of it all was a bet on real behavioral shifts spurred by COVID-19, some of which have stuck (like curbside pickup and increased comfort with more inventive forms of online shopping and food delivery), but many of which haven’t.

“As it turns out, as human beings, we all really enjoy experiential retail,” said Guha. “When you walk into any sort of retail location, mall or otherwise, that’s doing well today, they have a lot of pop-up shops and fun arcades… So, I think some of that explains the pullback.”

Since then, a pattern has emerged: less funding for online shops themselves (save for truly exceptional cases), and more funding for backend technologies and infrastructure.

“What’s happening with e-commerce funding, in short, is the destination side is down, enabling technology is up,” said Guha. “If you were a founder and you went to a VC today saying ‘I build email marketing for Shopify’… There’s no funding for that. But if you’re solving supply chain sell-through for the enterprise, there’s lots of funding for that, because your underlying market is just enormous.”

This year has featured some massive e-commerce-related rounds. Consider Wonder—Marc Lore’s takeout and delivery startup—which raised $600 million in May and acquired Grubhub. Then, October was a crucial month for VC-backed e-commerce funding: live shopping juggernaut Whatnot raised its $225 million Series F, while India-based Zepto raised a $450 million round at a $7 billion valuation. Simultaneously, there’s also an expanding world of AI-powered e-commerce tools, like Julie Bornstein’s Daydream.

This all gets at a natural question, one paralleling a question I’ve often asked about AI: What even is an e-commerce startup? The answer, I suspect, will over time continue to blur. In the meantime, looking into next year, VMG’s Guha expects the trends we see in the data this year to more or less continue.

“It’s going to be the same pattern,” he said. “Enterprise-focused AI applications, which definitionally will serve large retailers and brands—there will be lots of funding for that. But destination sites, you’ve got to have a really crisp reason to exist.”

See you tomorrow,

[TITLE]United States Buy Now Pay Later Business Report 2025: A $184.05 Billion Market by 2030, Driven by Consumer Demand for Flexible Payments, Strong E-commerce Momentum, and High-value Financing Agreements:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "United States Buy Now Pay Later Business and Investment Opportunities Databook - 75+ KPIs on BNPL Market Size, End-Use Sectors, Market Share, Product Analysis, Business Model, Demographics - Q3 2025 Update" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The BNPL payment market in United States is expected to grow by 12.2% on annual basis to reach US$122.26 billion in 2025. The BNPL market in the country experienced robust growth during 2021-2024, achieving a CAGR of 20.3%. This upward trajectory is expected to continue, with the market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 8.5% during 2025-2030. By the end of 2030, the BNPL sector is projected to expand from its 2024 value of USD 109.00 billion to approximately USD 184.05 billion.

This report provides a detailed data-centric analysis of the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) industry in United States, covering market opportunities and risks across a range of retail categories. With over 75 KPIs at the country level, this report provides a comprehensive understanding of BNPL market dynamics, market size and forecast, and market share statistics.

The BNPL market in the U.S. is on a strong growth trajectory, driven by increasing consumer adoption, the expansion of e-commerce, and the diversification of BNPL applications beyond retail. As more consumers seek flexible payment solutions, BNPL providers are forming strategic partnerships with merchants and service providers to meet this demand.

The BNPL market in the U.S. is expanding rapidly, driven by consumer demand for flexible financing options and strong e-commerce growth. Leading players such as Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna continue to dominate the space, forming key partnerships with retailers to increase accessibility. Recent strategic moves, including Affirm's multi-billion-dollar financing agreements and Apple's integration of Klarna into Apple Pay, highlight the market's competitive nature. These developments indicate that BNPL providers are securing long-term capital and strengthening their presence in digital payment ecosystems.

However, with increased regulatory scrutiny from the CFPB, BNPL providers must adhere to stricter consumer protection standards, including dispute resolution and refund processing requirements. While regulations aim to create a more secure and responsible BNPL ecosystem, they may also challenge providers to adapt their business models. As competition intensifies and regulations evolve, BNPL firms must innovate while maintaining compliance, ensuring long-term sustainability in the U.S. market.

Current State of the BNPL Market

The BNPL market in the U.S. has expanded significantly, fueled by increasing consumer demand for flexible payment options and the continued rise of e-commerce. As shoppers look for alternatives to credit cards, BNPL has become a mainstream payment option, particularly among younger consumers and online shoppers.

Leading providers such as Affirm, Afterpay (owned by Block, Inc.), and Klarna have established a strong foothold by partnering with major retailers to integrate BNPL options at checkout. These companies continue to expand their offerings across multiple sectors, including travel, electronics, and fashion. As competition intensifies, new entrants and traditional financial institutions are also exploring BNPL solutions, further shaping the industry's future.

Key Players and New Entrants

The U.S. BNPL market is dominated by key players such as Affirm, Afterpay (owned by Block, Inc.), and Klarna, each securing strong partnerships with major retailers to offer installment payment solutions. These companies have expanded their services beyond traditional retail, integrating BNPL options into the travel, healthcare, and electronics sectors. Their widespread adoption has fueled the growth of BNPL as a mainstream payment method, particularly among younger consumers who seek flexible financing options.

New entrants and financial institutions are increasingly entering the BNPL space to compete with established players and capture a share of the growing market. Traditional banks such as American Express and Citibank have introduced BNPL-style installment plans for credit cardholders, while fintech startups and payment platforms such as Apple Pay (through Klarna) and PayPal's "Pay in 4" continue expanding their BNPL offerings. As competition intensifies, providers focus on differentiating their services through lower fees, extended repayment periods, and seamless digital integration to attract and retain customers.

Recent Launches, Mergers, and Acquisitions

Affirm's Financing Agreements: In January 2025, Affirm expanded its partnership with Liberty Mutual Investments, securing up to $750 million to bolster its consumer lending activities. This follows a $4 billion commitment from Sixth Street Partners in December 2024 to enhance Affirm's lending capacity over the next three years.

Apple's Integration of BNPL Services: In October 2024, Apple incorporated Klarna's BNPL service into Apple Pay, providing users with interest-free installment options. This move came after Apple discontinued its Pay Later service, signaling a strategic shift towards partnering with established BNPL providers.

Outlook

This rapid growth will likely drive increased competition among existing providers, leading to further innovation in BNPL offerings. Established players such as Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna will continue to scale their services, while new entrants and traditional financial institutions will seek opportunities to capture market share.

As BNPL adoption rises, providers are expected to diversify their offerings across industries such as travel, healthcare, and education to appeal to a broader consumer base. The market's expansion will also attract greater regulatory oversight, ensuring responsible lending and consumer protection. Over the next few years, BNPL firms must balance growth, compliance, and evolving consumer preferences to maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded marketplace.

Regulatory Changes

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) introduced new regulations in May 2024, applying credit card-like protections to BNPL providers. One of the key provisions is dispute resolution, which requires BNPL lenders to investigate consumer disputes and temporarily pause payment obligations during the investigation process. This change ensures that consumers have greater protection against fraudulent or incorrect charges, bringing BNPL services in line with traditional credit card protections.

Another critical regulatory update focuses on refund processing, mandating that BNPL providers credit refunds to consumers for returned products or canceled services. This requirement addresses a growing concern among BNPL users who previously faced challenges obtaining timely refunds, particularly when dealing with multiple parties, such as merchants and lenders. These measures aim to enhance transparency and create a more consumer-friendly BNPL ecosystem.

The CFPB's approach to enforcement includes a transition period, during which BNPL lenders will not face penalties if they make a good faith effort to comply with the new regulations. This allows providers time to adjust their systems and policies while ensuring a smoother consumer transition. Over the coming months, the regulatory landscape for BNPL is expected to continue evolving, with further oversight likely as the industry expands and becomes a more significant part of the U.S. financial ecosystem.
