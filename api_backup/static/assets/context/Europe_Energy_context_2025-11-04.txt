[TITLE]Carbon capture pipelines have struggled to advance. A project in Nebraska found success:
[TEXT]
BISMARCK, N.D. — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it's released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that," said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. "And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn't easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn't been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don't want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota's legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company's agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass' cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass' line crosses his family's land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously," he said, "and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of."

[TITLE]Colorado Rep. Jeff Hurd asks U.S. Energy Department to order that coal plant stay open:
[TEXT]
Colorado Congressman Jeff Hurd has asked Energy Secretary Chris Wright to issue an emergency order that the two units at the Comanche power plant keep operating because there’s a risk of an energy shortfall if the coal facility in Pueblo County is shut down when planned.

The Republican who represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Pueblo County, said in a letter Thursday to Wright that “the state’s politically driven rush to decommission otherwise safe, reliable, and efficient generation” could leave Colorado short of reliable sources of electricity.

Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, closed a unit of the coal facility in 2022 and plans to close another by the end of this year. The third and last unit at the site is scheduled to shut down by the end of 2030.

Comanche 3 is Xcel’s largest generating unit in Colorado, but one plagued by chronic malfunctions and breakdowns. And it’s one that hasn’t run since mid-August and might not be operational again until next summer.

Comanche will be Xcel’s last coal plant in Colorado when it closes. The company decided to shut the plant earlier than planned as questions

[TITLE]Z Energy apologises for 2022 ad campaign after legal action:

Fuel retailer Z Energy has apologised for any confusion caused by a 2022 advertising campaign that said it was in the business of getting out of the petrol business.

Consumer NZ and two environmental groups took legal action claiming the campaign was misleading and greenwashing.

During 2022 and 2023 a large scale 'Moving With The Times' campaign was conducted through print, television, billboards and social media outlined Z Energy's commitment to alternative fuels and emission reductions.

But in 2023 Consumer NZ, Lawyers for Climate Action New Zealand, and the Environmental Law Initiative sought High Court declarations that Z Energy had misled New Zealanders with its messaging in the campaign.

All parties have now agreed to settle the action with an agreement to disagree, but with no admission of liability nor payments.

Z's chief executive, Lindis Jones, said the campaign was meant to be provocative but not misleading.

He said the company would keep selling fuel, but was working to be a lower carbon business such as extending its electric vehicle charging network.

A shared statement from each party was published in the Sunday Star Times and New Zealand Herald on Sunday.

"Z apologises for any confusion caused by parts of its campaign and to any customers who thought Z was going to stop selling petrol any time soon," a joint statement said.

All parties said they were concerned

[TITLE]Oil prices dip as investors brace for OPEC+ output hike:
[TEXT]
Oil prices dipped on Friday morning, ahead of an anticipated output hike by OPEC and its allies (OPEC+).

Brent crude (BZ=F) futures fell 0.2% to $63.75 per barrel at the time of writing, while West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) declined by the same margin to $60.47 a barrel.

OPEC+ is due to meet on Sunday, with reports that the group are set to announce a modest output hike of 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) for December, having decided to increase production in November by the same amount.

ING's head of commodities strategy Warren Patterson and commodities strategist Ewa Manthey said: "The uncertainty surrounding sanctions on Russia also supports this increase.

"However, the move will only reinforce the bearish outlook for the market, adding to the substantial surplus expected through 2026. Obviously, this is assuming no supply shocks from Russia."

The US announced sanctions against two of Russia's biggest oil companies last week, accusing Moscow of a lack of commitment to the peace process to end its war in Ukraine.

The US Treasury announced sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, which it said were aimed at increasing pressure on Russia's energy sector and impeding its ability raise revenue to fund the war and support its economy.

Oil prices soared following the announcement, on expectations that this could disrupt and tighten supply in the market. However, prices have since declined slightly, amid overriding concerns about declining demand and oversupply.

Gold prices rose on Friday morning, as investors digested the outcome of the meeting between US president Donald Trump and China's president Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday.

Gold futures (GC=F) edged 0.2% higher to $4,022.10 per ounce at the time of writing, while spot gold advanced 0.4% to $4,011.91 an ounce.

The two leaders agreed to a one-year trade truce until November 2026, with the US lowering its tariffs related to fentanyl, while China promised to delay restrictions on rare earth exports.

Stocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio

Jim Reid, head of macro and thematic research at Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE), said: "Despite this stabilisation, structural differences persist, and it’s easy for there to be some scepticism of the deal’s scope due to the lack of concrete commitments."

"The sense that we are seeing more of an extended truce rather than a de-escalation was added to by US trade representative [Jamieson] Greer confirming last night that the US will continue a recently opened probe into China’s compliance with the limited trade agreement reached during Trump’s first term."

[TITLE]Trump Skips Russian Oil in Xi Talks:
[TEXT]
In his high-profile meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, Trump said 'we didn't really discuss the oil'.

President Donald Trump gave the world an early glimpse of just how loosely he was planning to enforce new US sanctions on Moscow when it comes to China, the single-largest buyer of Russian crude.

In his high-profile meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, Trump said “we didn’t really discuss the oil.”

“We discussed working together to see if we could get that war finished,” he added.

The lack of meaningful pressure on Beijing means oil will continue to be a major source of revenue for President Vladimir Putin’s war effort, despite Trump’s move to unveil his first sanctions on Russia last week — blacklisting state-run oil giant Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, Russia’s biggest oil producers.

“If Trump won’t raise Russian oil with Xi, it undermines the entire sanctions narrative — you can’t claim to be tough on Moscow while ignoring one of the largest buyers keeping their economy afloat,” said Brett Erickson, a sanctions expert and managing principal at Obsidian Risk Advisors. “Trump’s sanctions so far feel performative. If he’s unwilling to confront Xi on energy flows, then the enforcement side of this policy will remain a paper tiger.”

While Trump’s sanctions initially jolted oil markets, declining to even raise the issue with Xi suggests Trump prioritized stabilizing US-China ties and securing what he called an “amazing” trade deal with the world’s second-largest economy over strict enforcement.

Trump had initially said he would raise Chinese oil buying with Xi as part of a renewed bid to end the fighting in Ukraine after he helped secure a fragile truce in Gaza. Ukraine and its allies in Europe had called on Trump to lean on Xi to cut support for Russia’s ongoing invasion.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged that “Russian oil came up” during the “wide-ranging” Trump-Xi talks, while declining to elaborate on next steps for sanctions.

Treasury “has imposed sanctions, and that’s had real effect,” Greer said in an interview on Fox Business Thursday. “I won’t go into further detail on on the content of that, but it certainly is something that was discussed at the table between the two leaders, and both agreed that we need to find a way to end the war in Russia.”

After the meeting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy struck an optimistic tone despite expressing hope that Trump and Xi could find agreement on curbing Russian energy revenue. In a post on X, he said oil sanctions were already causing “significant losses” and that “principled and consistent pressure” could still deprive Moscow of $50 billion per year.

“It is important that China contribute to efforts aimed at stopping Russia’s ongoing attempts to expand and prolong the war,” Zelenskiy wrote.

But applying significant pressure on Chinese buyers of Russian oil could have spurred intense retaliation from Beijing, imperiling efforts for a broader deal.

“Given they had so much to get through in a relatively short period, it’s not surprising this was not a major focus,” said Chris Kennedy, a senior geo-economics analyst at Bloomberg Economics. “In an escalation scenario, China would probably pull multiple levers.”

China has been a vital lifeline for Moscow’s energy industry as Putin’s grinding war in Ukraine prompted rounds of western sanctions. While China has maintained it does not recognize unilateral US restrictions, its larger companies are wary of getting tangled in secondary sanctions and fear losing access to US financial markets.

The challenge for Trump is that for the sanctions to have any impact, they will need to be enforced. And enforcing them will mean punishing the main buyers — China and India.

“It’s always in the implementation — they get to choose whether they’re going to apply it,” Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations this week.

Trump’s new sanctions have already spooked big players in both countries. The US could still increase the pain for Xi by targeting major Chinese oil refiners and trading firms, going after the so-called shadow fleet carrying Russian crude to foreign markets, or by hitting Chinese banks handling the transactions.

Washington has taken similar measures in efforts to target Iranian oil exports, but going hard at China presents more risk if Beijing chooses to hit back. It’s also not clear that lobbying Beijing to halt its economic support for Russia would even be successful, given the previous Biden administration tried and failed.

“The key here is going to be signaling to market participants that the United States and its partners are serious about enforcement,” said Eric Van Nostrand, who was an assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department during the Biden administration.

[TITLE]Report alleges Phil Mickelson received inside information on offshore company:
[TEXT]
A report from the financial publication Hunterbrook alleges Phil Mickelson received inside information on an offshore oil company and distributed that information to a private group of company shareholders. Mickelson responded on X Friday afternoon, calling the report “slanderous.”

On Friday, Hunterbrook published a story that included a series of private messages allegedly shared by Mickelson with a group of investors for the Houston-based oil startup Sable Offshore. In the messages, Mickelson, according to the report, shared material non-public information gleaned from interactions with Sable Offshore CEO Jim Flores — a decision that could have legal ramifications for Mickelson, the company’s chief executive, or both.

The article centers on the latest actions of the embattled oil company Sable Offshore, which reportedly paid $988 million to assume control of a troubled oil field from Exxon off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif., and quickly attracted investors seeking a potential moonshot.

From the beginning, according to multiple reports, the Sable business was predicated on a calculated gamble: If Flores could restart production from the Santa Ynez offshore oil infrastructure — a collection of three offshore platforms, a processing facility and a pipeline system that were shuttered after an environmental disaster in 2015 — the near-billion-dollar investment would look like a steal.

But the 20 months since the company’s creation have been far rockier than investors hoped. Sable Offshore’s efforts to protect against future environmental disasters have hit a series of regulatory snags in the last year and a half. To date, the company has failed to restart production on the oil infrastructure, causing Sable Offshore’s stock price to tumble more than 50 percent over the last 12 months.

Mickelson’s involvement in the company has been highly publicized. The LIV Golf star has tweeted more than 100 times about Sable Offshore over the 20 months, with many of those messages aimed at California legislators and regulators involved in keeping oil production shuttered.

Mickelson’s own past with insider trading is well-documented. In 2016, he paid more than $1 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle allegations that he had traded on inside information gleaned from the legendary gambler Billy Walters.

The Hunterbrook story alleges Mickelson was more than just a disgruntled investor, revealing the contents of an X group (previously Twitter) that allegedly shows the six-time major champ sharing information taken from Flores before it was made public.

[TITLE]High stakes at Cop30: ‘Climate denialism is back at a point we thought we’d moved on from’:
[TEXT]
As a backdrop to optimism, Belém has plenty to offer.

The waterside city in northern Brazil is the gateway to Amazonia and the rivers and rainforests that represent all that is rich, vibrant and vital in the natural world.

Host to the Cop30 climate summit, which begins next week, Belém is supposed to be a reminder to thousands of international delegates of what is at stake in their talks.

The global climate negotiation process was initiated in Brazil with the Rio Earth Summit in the hopeful 1990s. This is to be its homecoming.

It will be the 30th Cop convened since then and it takes place on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, formulated to strengthen resolve and ambition for the process.

You could pluck symbolism in handfuls from the mango trees.

But just days from the start of the gathering, the mood is subdued and Belém’s capacity to act as a beacon of hope for action on the climate crisis is uncertain.

“There isn’t a huge amount of optimism heading to this Cop from a political or scientific standpoint,” says Ross Fitzpatrick, who will be attending Cop30 for Christian Aid Ireland.

[ ‘They’re behaving like gangsters’: Will the rest of the world stand up to the US at Cop30?Opens in new window ]

The science is alarming, with recent reports from the World Meteorological Organisation and leading research institutes reiterating how perilous Earth’s position is.

Map of Brazil

Despite three decades of climate agreements, the concentration in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, the main warming gas, is now the highest humans have ever encountered and still rising.

This year, 2024 and 2023 are set to become the three hottest years on record. The litany of worsening heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods, storms and loss of life and livelihoods keeps growing.

Politically, the temperature is also febrile.

“Climate denialism is back at a point we thought we’d moved on from,” Fitzpatrick says.

He refers to US president Donald Trump’s address to the United Nations General Assembly last month in which he claimed climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”.

The US isn’t the only problem. Brazil has just issued an oil exploration licence to Petrobras, the state-controlled energy company, to work offshore from the state neighbouring Belém.

“The host country’s own climate credentials are already in doubt,” Fitzpatrick says. “So who do we look to for leadership on climate? Many would look to the EU, but the signals coming from the EU are not reassuring.

“The dominant narrative is that nothing can come at the expense of competitiveness. That rhetoric has become mainstream.

“So it’s very hard to identify who the climate champions are going to be heading into Cop.”

Presuming there are indeed countries and leaders willing to fly the flag for climate action at Cop30, they will have multiple causes to champion.

First there are the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that each country must adopt, revise and update every five years. NDCs are climate action plans that set out how each country will reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions in the immediate future and longer term.

Collectively, NDCs are meant to keep global temperature rise to well below two degrees, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees, above the average that prevailed in pre-industrial times before the burning of fossil fuels accelerated.

The five-year review falls this year but the numbers can’t be crunched yet as most countries have not yet submitted their revised NDCs despite a deadline of last February.

Ireland, which submits individually and under the EU banner, is among the foot-draggers.

The EU has tenuously agreed a revised emission reduction target of 90 per cent by 2040 but has not submitted it because negotiations are ongoing on the conditions attached to it.

Some member states want a guarantee the goal will be reviewed every two years and adjusted – which means lowered – if economic circumstances change.

A last-ditch attempt at agreement will be made when EU environment ministers meet on November 4th, two days before heads of state and government arrive in Belém.

Even if there are 11th-hour NDC submissions by laggard countries, their level of ambition is what really counts.

“We already know that they are not collectively going to be 1.5 degrees-aligned,” says Dr Sinéad Walsh, former head of the climate unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs and now principal researcher with the think tank ODI Global.

“One of the big questions for Cop30 is: what can Brazil do

[TITLE]Princes Group unveils London listing in major vote of confidence in UK economy:
[TEXT]
Princes Group - leading manufacturer known for producing tinned tuna and Napolina tomatoes - lists on London Stock Exchange in major vote of confidence in UK’s capital markets.

The IPO will help drive growth and investment in key sectors – reflecting the Government’s modern Industrial Strategy and Plan for Change.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle calls Princes Group a ‘Great British success story’ and calls for more firms to follow in their footsteps.

In a major vote of confidence in UK capital markets, Princes Group has listed today on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in a move that cements the City’s position as a leading hub for global capital.

Today, Business Secretary Peter Kyle joined Princes Group at the LSE for its market debut, where he delivered a speech and championed the long-established company as a “great British success story”.

The listing on the LSE of the manufacturer of some of Britain’s best loved brands is a boost for the government’s modern Industrial Strategy and will help leverage further investment into the UK, in particular the food and drink and advanced manufacturing sectors.

The news builds on Make UK and RSM UK’s positive findings this week that more than a third of manufacturing firms will accelerate investment projects as a direct result of the government’s modern Industrial Strategy.

London is making a strong comeback following the government’s capital market reforms, which includes modernising UK listing rules to provide firms more flexibility to raise capital, reforming the rulebook for wholesale markets to improve liquidity for UK listed companies, as well as cutting paperwork and making it easier for companies to raise larger sums.

It follows a trend of more companies turning to the City to list and raise capital, including Shawbrook, Metlen, Fermi and The Beauty Tech Group - and more expected to follow.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

The London Stock Exchange is a renowned global trading hub and the Princes Group is a great British success story. The firm’s decision to list is not only a huge vote of confidence in this Government’s reforms to capital markets but in British business. With the FTSE 100 continuing to trade close to all-time highs, we’re making sure the UK is the best place in the world for businesses to start, scale, list and stay. I want this to just be the start – with more firms following in their footsteps and choosing London as the financial home for their thriving futures.

Angelo Mastrolia, Executive Chair of Princes Group said:

Choosing to list in London is a natural step for Princes group. Around 70% of our revenues come from the UK, which remains our largest and most dynamic market. London offers deep liquidity, a world-class regulatory environment, and access to a broad international investor base, making it the ideal home for our next stage of growth.

London remains the first listing choice for UK and international companies, with 91% of UK-incorporated public company IPOs listing in the UK between 2017–2022. London is also a leading hub for global capital and the largest equity capital market in Europe, consistently ranking among the world’s top exchanges and outperforming all other European centres every year for the past two decades.

With thousands of employees working at Princes Group facilities across the UK, including its HQ at the iconic Royal Liver Building in Liverpool, today’s announcement delivers a significant boost for the workforce and reinforces support for local communities and future growth.

Since entering office, the government has been focused on restoring economic stability and encouraging British businesses to grow and expand to reach their full potential, backing the Plan for Change.

[TITLE]British Businesses to Save over £400m a Year as Government Slashes Electricity Costs:
[TEXT]
Government slashes electricity costs to save British businesses over £400m a year from April 2026 through landmark support under the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy.

UK industry including steel, chemicals, cement, glass and paper employing around 400,000 people to benefit from 90% discount on their electricity network charges.

Unprecedented support brings UK industrial energy costs in line with European competitors to protect jobs and attract new investment, helping drive growth and deliver Plan for Change.

Around 500 of the UK’s most energy-intensive businesses are set to save up to £420 million per year on their electricity bills from next April, as the Government takes decisive action to slash industrial energy costs.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle has today (31 October) announced that government will power ahead with plans to increase the discount on electricity network charges for businesses in sectors like steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, which employ around 400,000 people in total across the UK, from 60 percent to 90 percent.

Some of these businesses currently pay the highest industrial electricity prices in the G7, making it harder to stay competitive on the international stage, which is why the Government has taken decisive action to deliver this relief and level the playing field for industry.

The landmark support, which is being delivered at no extra cost to taxpayers, fulfils a crucial promise in the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy launched in June, and follows a four-week consultation on the plans for the increased discount which ran between July and August this year.

The increased discount will also slash costs for a range of businesses across Scotland and Wales to help them support local jobs and deliver growth, including Tata Steel at Port Talbot and INEOS in Grangemouth, ensuring the benefits are felt right across the country.

It comes on top of the Government’s landmark British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme announced in the modern Industrial Strategy, which will slash energy costs by 25 percent for over 7,000 businesses from 2027 in sectors like aerospace, automotive and chemicals, supporting hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs in these industries.

The Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will be funded through reforms to the energy system. The Government is reducing costs within the system to free up funding without raising household bills or taxes.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

British industry deserves a level playing field – and this government is delivering it. We’ve heard businesses loud and clear, and this landmark support will help them stay competitive on the global stage so they can invest and grow here in the UK. This is our Modern Industrial Strategy in action: practical, targeted support that secures jobs, attracts investment and drives our economy forward, as part of our Plan for Change.

Encirc Glass Managing Director Sean Murphy said:

This will be a major boost for our industry and will help British glass manufacturers compete with cheaper imports from regions that do not bear the same level of cost and regulation. By cutting the costs of energy in this way, the government is helping our industry to support thousands of jobs across the country whilst we make the transition to renewable sources of power. We welcomed the opportunity to engage with the Minister on the pressing challenges facing our sector. Continued government support for vital industries like glass manufacturing is essential to safeguarding jobs and unlocking investment across all regions of the UK.

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce said:

Our research shows energy costs remain a major concern, forcing many businesses who are struggling to pay their bills to raise prices. Energy is a business essential not a luxury. The promise of cheaper bills for hundreds of energy-intensive firms through increasing the discount on electricity network charges is welcome.

Community Union Assistant General Secretary Alasdair McDiarmid said:

We welcome the government’s determination to reduce the industrial energy costs which are such a huge burden on energy-intensive industries like steel. Whilst there is still more to do, the decision to increase the level of compensation for network charging costs from 60% to 90% is a huge step in the right direction. This will help avert carbon leakage, and will go some way towards boosting the competitiveness of our steel producers in line with European counterparts. After long years of neglect, our members in the steel sector know that they now have a government which is on their side.

The increased discount under the Network Charging Compensation (NCC) Scheme will bring down electricity bills for businesses by slashing the prices they pay to access the UK’s electricity network.

This will help bring industrial energy prices in line with other major European economies to keep the UK competitive on the global stage, protect local jobs in the UK’s foundational industries, and attract new investment, delivering on the Government’s Plan for Change.

The Government is also driving forward plans to have a new Connections Accelerator Service in force by the end of 2025, which will streamline access to the UK’s electricity grid.

This will make it easier for major investment projects to speed up delivery, bringing new high-quality jobs and growth to local communities and boosting the UK’s investment attractiveness further.

[TITLE]£55 billion R&D funding boost to unlock UK breakthroughs from health to clean energy:
[TEXT]
Funding boost for science and tech breakthroughs that improve lives, create jobs and grow our economy

£55 billion long-term backing for the UK’s research agencies and bodies is a real-terms rise, with DSIT making its largest-ever investment in R&D

making its largest-ever investment in Every £1 spent by government on R&D delivers £8 of wider economic benefit – from the invention of new cancer treatments, to new ways of harnessing renewable energy – delivering national renewal

From the tech that screens airport luggage to keep us safe, to life-changing new medical treatments, the inventors and innovators behind Great British breakthroughs that drive growth and improve our daily lives are in line for a £55 billion funding boost to take their work to the next level.

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has today (Thursday 30 October) confirmed long-term R&D funding for the UK’s research agencies and bodies, with bumper investment for the bodies that are making science and tech breakthroughs that improve lives and grow our economy. These allocations give visibility and clarity on the development of DSIT ’s plans for R&D budgets, with the Department’s overall R&D budget growing in real terms.

New analysis published today shows the value of public investment in R&D to the UK – with every £1 spent delivering £8 in net economic benefits over the long-term. Crowding in private investment is a key part of this, with every £1 of public money invested in R&D crowding in a further £2 in private investment, on average.

The Science and Tech Secretary announced today’s allocations while visiting IBM’s London base, to see first-hand how private investment is supporting the strength of the UK’s public offer on R&D , boosting work from quantum to robotics. Publicly-funded UK research has already resulted in some of the most important breakthroughs of recent years, including the first cutting-edge antibody products which have transformed some cancers from a guaranteed death sentence to manageable chronic conditions.

IBM is also working in partnership with publicly-funded researchers through UKRI ’s £210 million Hartree Centre, to bring AI , quantum computing and supercomputing to bear to discover new medicines, and breakthroughs in clean energy. While the company is also one of several technology vendors providing access to cutting edge quantum computing resource via the National Quantum Computing Centre - which will benefit from a first-of-its-kind 10-year government funding commitment.

By investing in R&D now, the government is putting a down-payment on Britain’s future that will deliver dividends for decades to come and put money in people’s pockets – delivering on our Plan for Change. We know businesses grow faster because of public R&D . In the 6 years after receiving their first R&D grant funding, employment increases in the average business by 21% and turnover grows by 23% relative to similar firms who didn’t get support. Some of the UK’s most innovative businesses have had public R&D funding help springboard them to success.

Oxford Nanopore, who are developing the world’s first pandemic early warning system, and Cobalt Light Systems, who make the tech that’s used to screen liquids at airports, have both benefitted from UKRI funding in previous years. Today, Oxford Nanopore is a FTSE 250-listed company, while Cobalt Light Systems’ equipment is used in over 170 airports worldwide.

Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said:

Backing our best and brightest researchers and innovators is essential. They are making the impossible, possible, from health to clean energy and beyond. Their ideas will create tomorrow’s industries, boosting growth and transforming public services now and in the future. By investing in their work, we are backing the long-term success of the UK, by paving the way for breakthroughs that will help us all to live and work better.

Publicly-funded research makes a difference to everyone’s health, wealth and wellbeing, with examples from the last year including:

£129 million in government support for BioNTech, who are setting up UK R&D centres to advance innovative cancer medicines and in turn unlocking £1 private billion investment over 10 years

centres to advance innovative cancer medicines and in turn unlocking £1 private billion investment over 10 years £80 million for 100 nationwide research projects ranging from better prosthetics, to better tests for blood clots

£44 million to put technologies like AI and engineering biology to work, to make manufacturing cleaner, less wasteful, and less reliant on fossil fuels

and engineering biology to work, to make manufacturing cleaner, less wasteful, and less reliant on fossil fuels £32 million for novel medical scanners which are up to 40 times more sensitive and up to 10 times faster than existing machines, to help diagnose cancer and heart conditions

£19.6 million for developing cutting-edge materials for the next generation of computers and medical scanners

Over £22 million for work to make usable quantum computers a reality, which can discover new medicines and treatments in a fraction of the time and cost it takes today

R&D is also at the heart of around 3 million jobs in the UK, with the power to create many more as discoveries advance.

British quantum firm Oxford Quantum Circuits, meanwhile - founded off the back of public-funded research - has gone on to raise $100 million Series B and deploy the first ever quantum computer in New York City.

The R&D funding being confirmed today, covering the Spending Review period ending 2029/2030, includes:

UKRI , the UK’s national funding agency for science and research, will deliver more than £38 billion across the period, including nearly £10 billion in 2029/2030 alone

, the UK’s national funding agency for science and research, will deliver more than £38 billion across the period, including nearly £10 billion in 2029/2030 alone The budget for ARIA – the UK’s agency backing bold, long-term breakthroughs – to rise from £220 million a year to £400 million a year by 2029/2030. One area that ARIA is supporting, is how robots could potentially help meet the growing need for adult social care

Over £900 million total backing for the UK’s prestigious National Academies

Over £550 million for the National Measurement System, and £240 million for the AI Security Institute

Security Institute All these allocations will support vital investment in universities, research institutes, and businesses across the UK

DSIT ’s overall R&D budget will grow in real terms over the Spending Review period, totalling £58.5 billion from 2026/2027 to 2029/2030.

The funding being confirmed today comes from the transformative £86 billion for public R&D confirmed by the Chancellor at the Spending Review, £55 billion of which is being detailed today. Funding for some further R&D programmes will be confirmed in due course.

Notes to editors

Further information will be published later this year, including more detail on UKRI ’s budgets and more information on the outcomes the funding will support.

[TITLE]Google and NextEra to Restart Iowa’s Duane Arnold Nuclear Plant to Power AI Era:
[TEXT]
NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) and Google have announced a landmark agreement to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa—the state’s only nuclear facility—to help meet soaring U.S. electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and data center growth. The 615-MW plant, located near Cedar Rapids, is scheduled to return to full operation by the first quarter of 2029, pending regulatory approval.

Under the 25-year agreement, Google will purchase a significant portion of the plant’s output as a 24/7 carbon-free energy source to power its cloud and AI infrastructure. The remaining capacity will be bought by Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO) on equivalent terms. NextEra Energy will assume full ownership of the facility after acquiring CIPCO and Corn Belt Power Cooperative’s combined 30% stake.

The Duane Arnold restart—shut down in 2020 after nearly five decades of service—marks a major return of nuclear generation to Iowa and underscores the growing convergence between Big Tech and clean baseload power. NextEra said the project will create around 400 permanent jobs and generate more than $9 billion in total economic benefits for Iowa, including $3 million annually in new tax revenue.

“This partnership with Google not only brings nuclear energy back to Iowa—it accelerates the development of next-generation nuclear technology,” said NextEra CEO John Ketchum, highlighting the collaboration’s role in strengthening U.S. grid reliability and advancing national energy independence.

Google, which has invested more than $7 billion in Iowa since 2007, framed the deal as essential to its AI-driven growth strategy. “Reopening Duane Arnold delivers reliable, clean power and hundreds of new jobs in the Hawkeye State,” said Ruth Porat, president and CFO of Alphabet and Google, calling it a model for similar clean energy investments across the country.

The companies also announced a strategic agreement to explore new nuclear generation projects nationwide, positioning nuclear power as a cornerstone of the AI and data economy. This comes amid growing concern that U.S. electricity demand—expected to rise sharply through 2035 due to AI, electrification, and manufacturing—will outpace renewable and grid expansion without firm, low-carbon generation sources.

[TITLE]The impact of urban low-carbon incentive policy on enterprise transformation and upgrading: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in China:
[TEXT]
As carbon emissions in China continue to rise and the cost advantage in the global value chain diminishes, enterprise transformation and upgrading has emerged as a new engine for economic growth. By implementing low carbon incentive policies, the government aims to spur corporate self‑innovation and phase out obsolete capacity, thereby boosting resource use efficiency and curbing environmental pollution. This paper examines the impact of China’s low carbon incentive policies on enterprise transformation and upgrading, with a particular focus on the role and mechanisms of urban environmental policy in this process. Employing a multi-period difference in differences approach, we analyze how the low carbon city policy affects the transformation and upgrading of Chinese listed firms. The results show that the low carbon city policy significantly enhances enterprise transformation and upgrading at the 1% level: participation in the low carbon city policy raises the composite index of enterprise transformation and upgrading by 0.012. We further explore the moderating role of enterprise green development level by incorporating it into our model of low carbon city policy effects. The findings reveal that firms exhibiting higher green total factor productivity, as well as those adopting green innovation and green management practices, display stronger adaptability to the low carbon city policy. Finally, both heterogeneity and dynamic analyses indicate that, over the medium to long term, the low carbon city policy continues to promote enterprise transformation and upgrading. In sum, the low carbon city policy not only provides exogenous momentum for enterprise transformation and upgrading but also interacts synergistically with firms’ green development to guide them toward more efficient and sustainable transformation and upgrading.

1. Introduction

China’s economic growth has decelerated, and its low cost advantage in the global value chain has progressively weakened. The challenges arising from the deterioration of China’s ecological environment have constrained the continuation of an extensive economic structure [1]. Therefore, seeking new growth requires the optimization and upgrading of the economic structure. At the micro level, a key factor in this process is the ability of enterprises to undergo transformation and upgrading. As a critical participant in the global value chain, China’s approach to optimizing its economic structure cannot simply be to eliminate low-end and highly polluting enterprises. In critical sectors like food and energy, China must continue to depend on its production capabilities to secure a stable supply of these essential resources. Due to geopolitical tensions and trade barriers, simply eliminating low-end enterprises can cause instability in the prices and supply of crucial products like energy and resources, threatening people’s livelihoods and national security. Therefore, it is crucial to help enterprises align with the trends of economic structural optimization and upgrading. This will enable them to achieve transformation and upgrading successfully. The notion of enterprise transformation and upgrading was first advanced by Gereffi (1999) [2]. However, a unified and explicit definition remains lacking [3]. In this study, enterprise transformation and upgrading are defined as a multidimensional, dynamically evolving developmental process whose core lies in enhancing firms’ market competitiveness through technology-driven innovation, improved resource allocation efficiency and value chain advancement [4–6]. Against the backdrop of macro level structural optimization and upgrading, supporting enterprises in realizing such transformation from a micro perspective is not only a pivotal strategy for bolstering corporate competitiveness. It is also a crucial practice for ensuring China’s sustainable development.

However, notwithstanding the macro level emphasis on the necessity of transformation and upgrading, firms are struggle to independently advance their own upgrading due to the dual constraints of low value chain positioning and insufficient transformational impetus. On the one hand, in the process of integration into global value chains, the “captivity effect” has emerged. This effect occurs when lead firms assume gatekeeping roles, leading Chinese enterprises to over rely on imported intermediate inputs for assembly and processing [7]. As a result, they confront persistently high energy consumption and low product value addition [8]. At the same time, they exhibit limited upstream value creation capacity and bearing the environmental costs associated with pollution displacement [9]. On the other hand, in international markets most Chinese firms occupy the supplier tiers of global value chains (i.e., GVC suppliers) and thus have little incentive to pursue innovation or develop new demand as a means of transformational upgrading [10]. Consequently, the high financial costs and significant risks associated with upgrading further diminish enterprises’ motivation to embark on such processes.

Within this context, the extant literature from Chinese firms’ lack of sufficient impetus for transformation and upgrading has systematically examined the factors influencing their transformation and upgrading. These factors are explored from both endogenous and exogenous driving force perspectives. At the endogenous level, technological capability, marketing capability and interaction with upstream value chain actors [11], full utilization of resources and skills [12], digital transformation [13], external learning mechanisms in networks [14], intra firm knowledge spillover [15], and entrepreneurial competence [16] are all important factors promoting enterprise upgrading. At the exogenous level, market demand in developed economies and the import of high-quality intermediate products [17], blockchain technology [4], energy infrastructure [18], and the business environment ecosystem [19] likewise drive upgrading. Policy instruments further constitute a vital exogenous impetus: vulnerability shocks induced by national policy can trigger enterprise transformation and upgrading [10]; robust government regulation and legislation can achieve process and product upgrading [20]; and environmental regulation policies can similarly promote upgrading [5,21]. For example, China’s green credit policy and its implementation of cleaner production standards have both facilitated enterprise transformation and upgrading [22,23]. However, few studies have integrated LCCP with enterprise transformation and upgrading. Given LCCP’s role as a key urban environmental regulation measure, its potential as a critical exogenous driver of firm-level upgrading requires urgent both theoretical and empirical investigation.

Since its implementation, the LCCP has played a critical role in fostering synergistic gains in environmental protection and economic development. Since the proposal of the LCCP in China in 2010, three batches of LCCP have been implemented across 81 cities in 2010, 2012, and 2017. In the 2010, the “notice on launching low-carbon pilot provinces and cities”, it was stated that “the adjustment of industrial structure, optimization of energy structure, energy conservation and efficiency enhancement, and the expansion of carbon sinks should be integrated” [24]. The “notice on launching low-carbon pilot provinces and cities” states that “the adjustment of industrial structure, optimization of energy structure, energy conservation and efficiency enhancement, and the expansion of carbon sinks should be integrated.” This indicates that the original intent of the LCCP also encompassed driving enterprise transformation and upgrading. While environmental regulations may initially increase production costs and reduce enterprise competitiveness, they can trigger significant technological innovations, laying the foundation for long-term growth and sustainable development [25]. When carefully designed and effectively implemented environmental regulations can stimulate corporate innovation, offsetting the additional costs of compliance and creating a win-win outcome for environmental protection and business development [26]. The LCCP constitutes a suite of regulatory instruments under which municipalities voluntarily undertake low carbon initiatives [27]. In practice, it allows cities to adapt measures according to local conditions and promotes coordinated pollution control among municipalities [28]. Consequently, it helps cities to set environmental policy standards rationally and contributes to ensuring that the Porter effect of the LCCP outweighs its cost effect [29]. This, in turn, ultimately fostering simultaneous improvements in firms’ environmental and economic performance.

Within this context, the extant literature largely concurs that the LCCP exerts a positive influence on both firms’ economic and environmental performance. In terms of economic performance, the LCCP has been shown to spur technological innovation and reduce R&D manipulation [30]. Although the substantive costs associated with these innovations increase firms’ financial pressures, such pressures in turn compel strategic adjustments that enhance production efficiency and resource utilization [31]. Moreover, the LCCP induced technological innovation, improved production efficiency, optimized resource allocation, and upgraded product quality collectively contribute to gains in total factor productivity [32]. The LCCP also stimulates entrepreneurial activity [33], and facilitates green mergers and acquisitions [34]. In terms of environmental performance, the LCCP significantly promotes green innovation [35], and low-carbon innovation [36,37], thereby enhancing firms’ environmental outcomes [38]. It further drives reductions in carbon emissions [39,40], energy savings [41], and curtails environmental noncompliance [42]. Concurrently, the policy heightens executives’ environmental awareness [43], attracts green investors [44], improves ESG performance [45], and advances clean production and green transformation [28,46].

Based on the above research, it is evident that LCCP can effectively stimulate firms to engage in innovative activities, enhance production efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and adopt environmentally friendly practices. These key factors constitute the essential foundation and prerequisite for driving corporate transformation and upgrading. Moreover, one goal of LCCP is to promote industrial upgrading [47]. At the micro level, industrial upgrading is ultimately realized through firms’ technological innovation, improvements in energy efficiency, and adjustments to their products and organizational structures. LCCP raise emission costs and providing green credit and tax incentives. This policy exerts both “pressure” and “incentive” effects on firms, thereby accelerating their transformation. Therefore, there exists an inherent linkage between LCCP and corporate transformation. However, few studies have directly explored this intrinsic relationship.

Therefore, this paper focuses on the impact of urban environmental policies by analyzing whether LCCP affect corporate transformation and upgrading. It also explores the intrinsic mechanisms underlying their relationship. To draw lessons from diverse urban environments, the pilot cities span multiple regions, development stages, and resource endowments. Such variation ensures that, prior to policy rollout, pilot and non-pilot cities were statistically comparable. This provides a strong counterfactual for estimating policy effects and constituting a quasi-natural experimental framework for our analysis.

The present work makes three key contributions. First, unlike prior research that evaluates industrial upgrading only at the city level, we adopt a multi period difference-in-differences design at the firm level. This approach allows us to pinpoint heterogeneous firm responses, thereby enriching the literature on how LCCP drives corporate transformation. Second, we are the first to operationalize firms’ green development along three dimensions: GTFP, green innovation, and green management. Additionally, we integrate these metrics into the mechanism analysis of LCCP’s effects on firm upgrading. Finally, we introduce a heterogeneous, multi-period DID estimator to assess how firms’ transformation outcomes vary with the timing of city participation in the LCCP. We trace for the first time the dynamic evolution of LCCP’s impact on corporate transformation over time.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review; Section 3 outlines the research hypotheses regarding the effect of LCCP on enterprise transformation and upgrading; Section 4 details the data construction process and empirical model setup; Section 5 offers empirical tests and mechanism analysis; and Section 6 presents the conclusion of this paper.
