[TITLE]41+ Amazon early Black Friday sales worth shopping ASAP, per my price tracking:

As someone who’s covered Amazon’s biggest shopping events for years (and lost more sleep than I’d like to admit waiting for deals to drop at midnight), I can confidently say: the early Amazon Black Friday 2025 event is already shaping up to be one for the record books.

This year, the official Black Friday lands on Friday, Nov. 28, but Amazon, being Amazon, isn’t making us wait that long to save on time and shipping.

The e-tailer’s early Black Friday sale has officially kicked off, and, having tracked this retail juggernaut’s playbook for years, I know one thing for sure — those early-bird deals are where some of the best surprises hide.

[TITLE]France Targets Shein Over Illegal Sales - Nepal Updates:
[TEXT]
France Urges EU Investigation into Shein Over Illegal Product Sales

France is pushing the European Union to launch a formal investigation into Shein, the Chinese online fast-fashion retailer, following accusations of selling illegal products. The allegations include the sale of items such as child-like sex toys and prohibited weapons on the platform. This move highlights concerns surrounding online marketplaces and the potential for the distribution of unsafe products.

According to reports, France is initiating a process that could lead to a ban on Shein for offering these illegal items. In response, Shein has stated that it has shut down its marketplace in France to review third-party vendors and has globally ceased the sale of sex toys.

French Economy Minister Roland Lescure and Digital Minister Marina Ferrari have addressed the issue in a letter to EU tech chief, highlighting the “serious violations” within France and expressing concerns about similar risks related to the platform in other European countries. They urge the European Commission to launch an immediate investigation to determine how such illegal products ended up for sale on the platform. The letter emphasizes the need for greater consumer safety and scrutiny of e-commerce platforms.

The European Commission has acknowledged receipt of the letter and has stated that it will assess the situation before deciding on the next steps. This action comes as Shein falls under the European Union’s Digital Services Act as a “very large online platform,” granting the Commission the authority to investigate potential violations of the law. This situation underscores the ongoing debate about online safety, product compliance, and the responsibilities of large online retailers in ensuring the legality and safety of the goods they offer. The investigation could have significant implications for Shein’s operations in Europe and may influence future regulations concerning online sales and product safety.

[TITLE]E-commerce apps turn to content to amp up sales and influencers are loving it:
[TEXT]
Online retail platforms such as Amazon, Myntra, Meesho, and Nykaa, are increasingly becoming the go-to destination for influencers, nudging at the dominance of social media giants like Instagram and YouTube.

The e-commerce platforms no longer only collaborate with publishers on affiliate programs as they have done for long, they now enable influencers and everyday users to create, publish, and livestream directly on their apps.

This shift has grown such affiliate marketing activity on e-commerce platforms multifold in the last one year, according to online retail company executives. (Affiliate marketing refers to influencers or publishers including product links or recommendations in their videos or content and earning a commission on it.)

Fashion platform Myntra’s chief marketing officer Sunder Balasubramanian said that the videos on the platform have grown 240% in

There’s no sign of a year-end slowdown in the Indian passenger vehicle market . At least 15 new models — including 13 SUVs — will debut between November and March as carmakers race to capitalise on the festive-season boom and record October sales.Mass and luxury carmakers alike are doubling down on high margin models and keeping production lines running at full tilt to sustain the momentum, industry executives said. “We are prioritising high-margin SUV production,” said an executive at a leading automaker who requested not to be identified.Sport-utility vehicles today account for more than half of all passenger vehicle sales in India. Small cars are making a comeback after the recent goods and services tax (GST) cuts, but the next five months will still see just one sedan — the Mercedes CLA — and one crossover — the Fronx hybrid — entering the market.Among the most anticipated launches this season is Tata Motors ’ revived Sierra, a mid-size SUV, making a comeback after 22 years. Teasers of the model have already sparked nostalgia and excitement ahead of its debut later this month. Mahindra is gearing up to unveil its first ‘born electric’ seven-seater SUV, while Maruti Suzuki — fresh off flagging off the e-Vitara exports to Europe — is preparing for its India launch next month. Foreign players are equally charged.Renault’s new-generation Duster and Nissan’s Tekton are set to add muscle to an already crowded SUV calendar. In the luxury end of the market, BMW and Volvo are set to drive in new premium electric SUVs. Traditionally, after the Diwali season, automakers focus on clearing year-end stock and avoid major launches before the model-year reset.But this time, companies are sticking to aggressive timelines as a combination of GST relief, easier financing, and pent-up festive demand have kept dealerships running at full throttle, industry insiders said.“To cash in on the boom, many are sticking to schedules not seen earlier,” a senior official at a major car company said on condition of anonymity. That’s not surprising considering popular models such as the Maruti Brezza, Tata Nexon, and Mahindra XUV700 have waiting periods of 20-24 weeks, meaning a buyer may have to wait for up to six months for the delivery of her new vehicle.It reflects the strength of consumer appetite as well as the limits of production capacity, according to Ravi Bhatia, president of Jato Dynamics, a data and analytics firm focused on the auto industry. In October, passenger vehicle sales in India grew 11.4% yearon-year to around 557,000 units, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (Fada).Looking ahead, 2026 will test the industry’s ability to balance growth with new challenges, industry experts said. Automakers will need to navigate the E20 ethanol rollout, CAFE 2027 efficiency norms, and a rapidly accelerating shift toward electrification. “Production agility , not just policy windfalls, will decide who sustains growth,” Bhatia said.

[TITLE]Earnings live: CoreWeave revenue boosted by AI boom, Paramount stock jumps, Occidental Petroleum falls:
[TEXT]
The greater part of third quarter earnings results are in the rearview mirror, though investors this week are looking to reports from CoreWeave (CRWV), The Walt Disney Company (DIS), and Alibaba (BABA).

So far, the Q3 earnings season is off to a positive start. As of Nov. 7, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts are expecting a 13.1% jump in earnings per share during the third quarter. If that figure holds, it would mark the fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth and an acceleration from the 12% earnings growth rate reported in Q2 of this year.

Expectations were much lower coming into the quarter, as analysts expected S&P 500 companies to report a 7.9% jump in earnings per share in Q3, as of Sept. 30.

Source: FactSet

Last week, investors heard from tech and AI players such as Palantir (PLTR), AMD (AMD), Supermicro (SMCI), and Constellation Energy (CEG), as well as from Uber (UBER), Spotify (SPOT), Snap (SNAP), and Airbnb (ABNB).

This week, quarterly results arrive from The Walt Disney Company, Applied Materials (AMAT), CoreWeave, Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Rocket Lab (RKLB), Oklo (OKLO), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Alibaba (BABA), among others.

[TITLE]UK/EU food deal to ease Windsor problems could come at too high a price, says former British minister:

A European Union/UK agreement on food exports designed to resolve problems in existing trade between Britain and Northern Ireland could come at too high a price, a former British minister for trade has warned.

Former Conservative minister Greg Hands told The Irish Times said he was “opposed” to an agreement where London would agree to align with EU regulations on sanitary and phytosanitary rules.

“I don’t think that is the right strategy for the UK. It’s not really in the UK’s interests. A lot of the Brussels food and drink regulations are quite stifling on innovation,” he said.

Negotiations on an SPS agreement are underway, with supporters arguing that it would remove most of the difficulties affecting GB/NI trade, which have irritated many Unionists.

However, Mr Hands said: “Why would the UK voluntarily and dynamically align with rules over which we have no say? It would kill off a lot of nascent things in the UK, like some of work done on GM.”

Former British Minister for Trade, Greg Hands seen here speaking at a conference in Dublin today

Hands, who twice served as Minister for Trade between 2016 and 2018 and later from 2020 to 2024, was in Dublin to speak at a conference on international trade held by law firm Byrne Wallace Shields.

He had doubts that an SPS agreement would remove all of the GB/NI hurdles that are being claimed for it: “It’s an arguable thing. Would it increase the demand in NI for Tesco sausages? I’m not sure it would.

“An agreement would make it easier and reduce paperwork and checks, but I doubt if it would get a whole new volume of trade between GB and NI. It would ease bureaucracy on existing trade, that’s my guess.”

The SPS negotiations could take up to two years, though European Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce he thought they could finish in one.

Saying he did not understand why such negotiations should take even that long, Mr Hands said the European Commission was “treating this as a massive concession on their part”.

In reality, London is ceding ground: “The UK, the second largest economy in Europe, is aligning to your food rules. That is a bonus for the Commission, but it is treating this as a concession,” he added.

Following Brexit, South African citrus exporters have been able to ship oranges and lemons to the UK, including Northern Ireland, without a plant health certificate, or the need for an inspection.

Since 2022, however, EU rules demand that South African exporters cool fruits to limit the spread of pests and disease, such as false codling moth and citrus black spot, and supply a phytosanitary certificate.

Now, the Commission is arguing that it may “withhold” the SPS agreement unless it is satisfied, said Mr Hands, who said the Irish Government could play a useful role “to urge pragmatism”.

He was not “downplaying” the risk posed by citrus fungal disease, but doubted if imports to Britain and Northern Ireland “where neither are citrus producers” could “imperil” the Iberian citrus industry.

The Irish Government has frequently “smoothed things over” when difficulties have emerged between London and Brussels, said Mr Hands, who now works with a Czech-based industrial group.

[TITLE]CLAR Q3 Deep Dive: Outdoor Apparel Growth and Margin Actions Amid Tariff Pressure:
[TEXT]
Outdoor lifestyle and equipment company Clarus (NASDAQ:CLAR) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2025, with sales up 3.3% year on year to $69.35 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.05 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

Is now the time to buy CLAR? Find out in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).

Clarus (CLAR) Q3 CY2025 Highlights:

Revenue: $69.35 million vs analyst estimates of $66.51 million (3.3% year-on-year growth, 4.3% beat)

Adjusted EPS: $0.05 vs analyst estimates of $0.06 (in line)

Adjusted EBITDA: $2.80 million vs analyst estimates of $2.70 million (4% margin, relatively in line)

Operating Margin: -4.4%, up from -8% in the same quarter last year

Market Capitalization: $124.8 million

StockStory’s Take

Clarus’ third quarter results drew a positive market response, as the company’s revenue growth exceeded Wall Street expectations while profitability metrics held steady. Management credited the performance to strong demand for outdoor products in North American wholesale, notable success with the revamped Black Diamond apparel line, and the onboarding of new adventure customers in Australia. Executive Chairman Warren Kanders highlighted that the company’s shift toward a more focused product mix, as well as reductions in discontinued merchandise and operational expenses, were central to the quarter’s incremental improvements.

Looking forward, Clarus’ leadership remains cautious due to persistent macroeconomic headwinds, ongoing tariff and currency impacts, and uncertainty in consumer sentiment. President of Diamond Equipment Neil Fiske pointed to further tariff mitigation plans, ongoing supply chain rebalancing, and a renewed emphasis on product innovation as key to future margin improvement. Fiske stated, “Our outlook is more cautious. Consumer sentiment remains low. Promotional activity seems to be on the rise as the broader market struggles to balance cash and working capital requirements.”

Key Insights from Management’s Remarks

Management attributed the quarter’s performance to a healthier revenue mix, focused cost control, and improvements in product and channel strategy, even as tariffs and FX losses weighed on margins.

[TITLE]American Eagle's Denim Dominance Returns: Will Global Growth Follow?:
[TEXT]
American Eagle Outfitters Inc. AEO is firmly reclaiming its denim leadership. The company delivered an upbeat second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, driven by a powerful resurgence in its denim business. The company’s renewed marketing push and celebrity collaborations have reignited consumer enthusiasm. Its fall “Great Jean” campaign starring Sydney Sweeney broke company records for customer acquisition and brand engagement. This campaign generated more than 40 billion impressions, boosting traffic across stores and online channels. The company’s follow-up collaboration with Tru Kolors by Travis Kelce further sustained this denim momentum, reinforcing American Eagle’s position as a leading lifestyle denim brand.

American Eagle’s strength lies in its inclusive denim lineup, offering fits and styles that appeal across ages and body types. In the past six weeks, the company has seen positive consumer sentiment and a marked increase in purchase intent, suggesting that new shoppers can evolve into long-term loyal customers. The company’s balanced pricing strategy, featuring good, better and best tiers, has also struck the right chord, with selective price increases offset by strong perceived value.

Overall, American Eagle is focusing on denim as a key driver for growth, backed by solid demand and successful marketing strategies. While the company’s core focus is on strengthening its U.S. business, management is optimistic
