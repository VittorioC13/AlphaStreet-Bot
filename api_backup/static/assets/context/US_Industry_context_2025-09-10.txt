[TITLE]CoinShares proposes to change listing venue to a public stock market or other exchange in the US through a joint merger plan with Vine Hill Capital, Odysseus Holdings and others, and to carry out a pr:
[TEXT]
CoinShares International Limited (“CoinShares”), Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp., a special purpose acquisition company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Vine Hill”), and Odysseus Holdings Limited, a newly formed Jersey entity, (“Odysseus Holdings”)1 today jointly announce that CoinShares, Vine Hill and Odysseus Holdings have agreed on a joint merger plan including a court-sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement (as defined below) under Jersey Law between CoinShares and its shareholders (such joint merger plan and the Scheme of Arrangement, together, the “Transaction”), in order to facilitate a change of listing venue for CoinShares ordinary shares from Nasdaq Stockholm to the Nasdaq Stock Market in the United States, or any other public stock market or exchange in the United States as may be agreed between CoinShares and Vine Hill. The total consideration for CoinShares’ shareholders represents a valuation of CoinShares at approximately SEK 11.3 billion or USD 1.2 billion, corresponding to approximately SEK 173.2 per ordinary share in CoinShares calculated based on the shares and options outstanding as of 8 September 2025 in accordance with terms of the BCA (as defined below)2, and representing a premium of approximately 30.6 percent compared to the closing share price of SEK 132.6 in CoinShares on Nasdaq Stockholm on 5 September 2025, which was the last ended trading day prior to the announcement of the Transaction3. The consideration of the Transaction consists of ordinary shares in Odysseus Holdings, which will ultimately replace Vine Hill as the listed entity on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the United States and own all the outstanding shares in CoinShares. The completion of the Transaction is subject to conditions that need to be satisfied or, on whole or in part, waived by Odysseus Holdings (see “Conditions for the Transaction” below). The completion of the Transaction is expected to commence on 17 December 2025. In connection with and subject to completion of the Transaction, CoinShares intends to carry out a private placement of 5,000,000 ordinary shares at a price per share of USD 10.04 to the Private Placement Investor (as defined below), raising approximately USD 50.05 million in gross proceeds (the “Private Placement”). In consideration of its commitment to the Private Placement, the Private Placement Investor will be allocated an additional 1,666,667 ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 6,666,667 ordinary shares being issued in the Private Placement.

Today, 8 September 2025, each of CoinShares, Vine Hill, Odysseus Holdings and Odysseus (Cayman) Limited, a newly formed Cayman Islands exempted company, wholly owned by Odysseus Holdings (“Odysseus Cayman”), have entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “BCA”), which outlines the structure of the Transaction and a joint merger plan that includes a scheme of arrangement under Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law (the “Scheme of Arrangement”). Furthermore, CoinShares and Odysseus Holdings have entered into a Subscription Agreement (as defined below) with the Private Placement Investor, an institutional investor, providing for the subscription of ordinary shares in the Private Placement (see “Private Placement” below).

Consideration and valuation

Each issued and outstanding ordinary share of CoinShares will be exchanged for a number of ordinary shares of Odysseus Holdings (each, an “Odysseus Holdings Ordinary Share”) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Equity Value Per Share (as defined below) by (ii) USD 10.06 (such quotient, the “Equity Exchange Ratio”). The “Equity Value Per Share” is calculated as USD 1.2 billion7 divided by the fully diluted number of outstanding and issued ordinary shares in CoinShares as of immediately prior to the completion of the Transaction, excluding the ordinary shares in to be issued in the Private Placement.8 Based on the number ordinary shares in CoinShares as of 8 September 2025, the Equity Exchange Ratio would be equal to approximately 1.8116 Odysseus Holdings Ordinary Shares.9 The minimum Equity Exchange Ratio is approximately 1.7782 Odysseus Holdings Ordinary Shares.10 The maximum Equity Exchange Ratio is approximately 1.8319 Odysseus Ordinary Shares.11

As per the date of this announcement, CoinShares has a total of 1,927,883 outstanding options under its employee inventive plan. Each option to purchase ordinary shares in CoinShares (each, an “CoinShares Option”) that is issued and outstanding and has vested pursuant to its terms will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment (less applicable withholdings) equal to (i) the excess of the Equity Value Per Share over the exercise price of such vested CoinShares Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of CoinShares Ordinary Shares underlying such option.

Each CoinShares Option that is unvested will be converted into an option to purchase ordinary shares in Odysseus Holdings (“Holdings Option”). The number of ordinary shares in Odysseus Holdings subject to such option will equal (i) the number of CoinShares Ordinary Shares underlying the unvested option multiplied by (ii) the Equity Exchange Ratio. The exercise price per Odysseus Holdings Ordinary Share issuable on exercise of the Holdings Option will equal the exercise price per CoinShares ordinary share of such CoinShares Option immediately prior to completion of the Transaction divided by the Equity Exchange Ratio, and all other terms and conditions (including vesting and duration) will remain unchanged except for the administration of the Holdings Options.

Upon the completion of the Transaction, CoinShares’ shareholders will receive between approximately 78,4 percent of the shares and votes in Odysseus Holdings assuming no redemptions of Vine Hill’s public shares and approximately 91.6 percent of the shares and votes in Odysseus Holdings assuming 100 percent redemptions of Vine Hill’s public shares, in each case, excluding the potential dilution of the Public Warrants (as defined below). The completion of the Transaction is subject to, inter alia, approval by the shareholders of each of CoinShares at the Court Meeting (as defined below) and Vine Hill at a special meeting (the “Special Meeting”), which is expected to be held on or

[TITLE]Trump Slaps His Name on Infrastructure Projects Funded by Biden:
[TEXT]
As Trump was seeking to derail the legislation, he called it a “loser” for the country.

“Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill is a disgrace,” he said in August 2021 before a Senate vote on the bill, warning that Republican lawmakers who supported it would be committing political suicide. After it passed Congress, he referred to it as a “terrible Democrat Socialist Infrastructure Plan.”

Now Trump appears happy to claim Biden’s achievement as his own. The only indication on the signs pointing to the truth is smaller text noting the project was “funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.”

[TITLE]Philadelphia transit agency will use project reserves to avoid cuts. Pittsburgh's might do the same:
[TEXT]
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration on Monday approved the use of hundreds of millions of dollars in capital project funding for Philadelphia’s public transit agency to help it restore bus, trolley and rail services that it had eliminated to shore up its deficit-riddled finances.

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authorit y — one of the nation’s largest mass transit agencies with 800,000 daily riders — had made the request to comply with a judge's order to undo the two-week-old cuts. A similar request is likely to come from the state's next largest public transit agency, Pittsburgh Regional Transit.

SEPTA made the service reductions after Shapiro and Democratic lawmakers had been unable for the past two years to persuade enough Republican lawmakers to approve hundreds of millions more dollars in new transit aid to help fill deficits at transit agencies around the state.

“I am taking this action … to support SEPTA, to make sure that these 800,000 Pennsylvanians and the millions who will visit our commonwealth have a trolley or a bus or a subway or a train to get around,” Shapiro told a news conference Monday.

As a result of SEPTA's cutbacks, schools in Philadelphia reported a big increase in late student arrivals and absenteeism in the just-begun school year, Shapiro said. Meanwhile, Philadelphia is helping host major tourist attractions next year, including FIFA World Cup matches and events surrounding the celebration of the nation’s 250th birthday.

The struggles in the nation’s sixth-most populous city reflect similar dilemmas at major transit agencies around the U.S. as they navigate rising costs and lagging ridership after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted commutes.

SEPTA had described the cuts as more drastic than any undertaken by a major transit agency in the U.S. but necessary to deal with a deficit of more than $200 million.

However, testimony in the court challenge described the cuts as being unnecessary and discriminatory toward poor and minority communities.

SEPTA said that shifting $394 million in state-provided capital funds could restore services and avoid other planned cuts for the next two years.

[TITLE]GE Aerospace Bets On Hybrid Electric Future With $300 Million BETA Deal:
[TEXT]
GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) announced Thursday that it is joining forces with BETA Technologies to advance hybrid electric aviation.

The partnership includes a $300 million equity stake in the Vermont-based aerospace innovator, a move that underscores GE Aerospace’s growing commitment to sustainable flight solutions.

The agreement, which is still subject to regulatory approval, will see the two companies co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator tailored for defense and civil aviation markets.

The system is intended to boost the U.S. Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) sector by offering aircraft longer ranges, faster speeds, lower operating costs and heavier payloads compared with current alternatives.

The collaboration will leverage BETA’s expertise in permanent magnet electric generator technology alongside GE Aerospace’s extensive track record in turbine design, certification, and high-volume production.

The project is expected to build on GE Aerospace’s existing CT7 and T700 engine platforms to integrate hybrid-electric solutions that align with evolving aviation needs.

As part of the deal, GE Aerospace will secure the right to appoint a director to BETA’s board. GE Aerospace Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. said the tie-up will accelerate the development of hybrid-electric propulsion systems, giving customers new options in terms of performance and efficiency.

BETA founder and CEO Kyle Clark added that the partnership represents a significant step toward unlocking hybrid-electric flight at scale while upholding aviation safety and reliability standards.

The agreement builds on GE Aerospace’s past milestones, including a 2016 electric motor-driven propeller ground test and a 2022 megawatt-class hybrid propulsion test conducted at altitudes up to 45,000 feet.

BETA, meanwhile, has logged notable flight hours and range records with its ALIA aircraft across the U.S. and Europe, positioning itself as a front-runner in AAM development.

This investment signals a broader industry push toward sustainable aviation technologies as both companies aim to scale hybrid-electric solutions for military, commercial, and future AAM platforms.

Price Action: GE shares are trading lower by 0.18% to $275.42 premarket at last check Thursday.
