[TITLE]Oil Markets Lackluster Amid Russia Peace Deal, China’s Stockpiling:
[TEXT]
Sentiment in oil markets remains overwhelmingly negative, driven by perceived market oversupply and negative global demand indicators. Brent crude for January delivery was trading at $63.10 per barrel in Thursday’s intraday session, little changed from $62.97 a week ago while the corresponding WTI contract ticked up slightly to $58.70/bbl from $58.46. Meanwhile, the recent rally in oil product prices has cooled off, with ICE Gasoil-Brent crack dropping from a 35.84/bbl peak on 18 November to ~$26/bbl. This is partly due to the easing of panic over the delivery specification into the ICE gasoil futures contract.

Market focus remains firmly on the supply-side, with a view that any progress towards a ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine could lead to easing of heavy U.S. sanctions on Russian producers. The Trump administration has drafted a new 19-point peace plan that’s far more favorable to Ukraine compared to the original 28-point plan. Some of the critical amendments in the new plan include no handover of the Donbas region to Russia for free, no automatic veto on Ukraine joining NATO in the future, and provision of Article 5-style protection for Ukraine, meaning the U.S. would be bound to intervene if Russia invades in the future. A proposal for full amnesty for war crimes that was part of the first plan has also been removed.

China remains the leading buyer of Russian crude, with imports increasing by 275.6 kb/d over the past two months to ~2.15 mb/d. Overall, China’s crude imports have increased by 866 kb/d Y/Y to 11.44 mb/d as the country continues to stockpile crude. Rystad Energy estimates that China has stockpiled more than 1 million barrels of crude per day in some months, socking away nearly 160 million barrels in the first nine months of 2025. The buying spree has been triggered by strategic concerns like energy security and potential conflicts, as well as taking advantage of low oil prices. China is expected to continue stockpiling crude oil at least through 2026, supported by new laws and infrastructure development that allow for greater storage capacity, though some analysts suggest the pace might slow as storage limits are reached.

Potential U.S. intervention in Venezuela has also added to the bearish sentiment after the Trump administration designated Cartel de los Soles, which it alleges is led by President Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. The US’ Operation Southern Spear has been targeting boats suspected of trafficking drugs in the region, with the hawks linking the moves to Venezuela’s 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the largest of any country.

Venezuelan oil production has been on a sharp decline since 2017, with a slew of sanctions prohibiting its access to financial markets. However, production has been slowly rising, from 360 kb/d in 2020 to around 1 mb/d currently, supported by black-market sales. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that it will take years before the South American country can hit peak production of around 2.5 mb/d that it achieved in the 2011-2015 period thanks to years of underinvestment in maturing oil fields as well as a lack of exploration drilling. Shortages of equipment, supplies and labour have also taken a toll on Venezuela’s energy sector. Further, the country is likely to have a hard time attracting fresh capital after the ConocoPhilips (NYSE:COP) debacle. The Venezuelan government under the late Hugo Chávez, and continued under Nicolás Maduro, expropriated ConocoPhillips' oil assets in 2007 during a wave of nationalizations of foreign oil investments. This led to ConocoPhillips receiving two major international arbitration awards totaling over $8 billion. Venezuela's attempts to annul the awards have failed, and ConocoPhillips is now pursuing legal avenues to enforce the rulings and collect the compensation from Venezuela's remaining overseas assets, such as those related to the Citgo refinery.

On the gas front, European natural gas prices have softened, with the front-month Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) contract for December delivery settling below EUR 30 per megawatt hour

(MWh) at EUR 29.5/MWh, its lowest settlement in 18 months. European natural gas inventories drew by 3.76 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 91.97bcm on 23 November, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe. This marks the largest weekly fall in inventories since late February 2025. Recent cold weather has not supported prices, and there are now mild forecasts for the rest of December.

In contrast, U.S. gas prices have continued rallying, with gas futures hitting $4.6/MMBtu on falling inventories coupled with expectations of higher demand. Weather forecasts suggest temperatures will remain mostly below normal over the next two weeks, boosting demand. Further, U.S. LNG exports are rising, with flows averaging a record 18 bcfd in November, up from October’s 16.6 bcfd.

[TITLE]America’s Fragile Grid Faces a Perfect Storm Ahead of Winter:
[TEXT]
The energy infrastructure in the United States has failed repeatedly in instances of severe weather, due to years of underinvestment and the failure of utilities to work together to strengthen larger networks. During winter storms and wildfires, a wide range of energy infrastructure has been known to fail due to the lack of preparedness by utilities and state governments. Going into the winter months, there are fears over more potential network failures across various parts of the U.S.

Texas, California, and several other states face annual power outages due to severe weather events, from winter storms to heatwaves. In February 2021, Storm Uri brought plunging temperatures to the state of Texas and left millions of people without electricity, heat, or running water, as much of the infrastructure froze. These outages turned off electricity in various parts of Texas, including parts of the natural gas network that are electrically operated, such as pumps and antifreeze injection systems. This led to the shutdown of several power plants.

During the storm, as demand increased for heating, Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 GW of rolling blackouts to prevent a total system collapse, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It was the “largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history,” with 4.5 million people losing power for several days, stated a FERC report.

The U.S. energy network is highly fragmented, with different state governments each managing parts of the grid, and a multitude of utilities responsible for different infrastructure. The fractured nature of the system makes it extremely hard to fix. For example, investment made in the transmission lines of one state may not be replicated by the neighbouring state, meaning that the network in part of a region may be more resilient than another.

In 2021, the Biden administration introduced the $2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at upgrading U.S. infrastructure. The plan earmarked $100 billion in financing to update and modernise the electric grid to make it more reliable and resilient. However, due to a multitude of challenges standing in the way of a complete overhaul, U.S. energy infrastructure remains highly unprepared for severe weather events.

Now, another threat is adding to fears of winter blackouts – data centres. There has been a rapid rollout of data centres across the U.S. in recent years, as tech companies invest heavily in the infrastructure needed to power advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence. This has driven up energy demand in several states, particularly in Texas. The concern now is that this will increase the risk of energy shortages, which could result in power cuts during freezing temperatures.

Requests for new data centres are on the rise in Texas, thanks to its growing renewable energy capacity and natural gas resources. In recent years, Houston has become known by many as the Silicon Valley of energy, for its strong reputation for energy production, growing cleantech sector, and welcoming business environment. This has helped attract significant investment to the state from tech companies looking to expand operations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in November that the 24/7 energy demand of data centres will make it increasingly difficult to maintain sufficient electricity supply during times of high demand, such as if the temperature drops to an extreme low.

During a severe winter storm, Texas’ power demand could rise to as much as 85.3 GW. While the state’s 92.6 GW electricity capacity would normally be enough to power this demand, the available power could decrease to roughly 69.7 GW during a severe weather event, meaning a deficit of over 15 GW.

In a recent analysis, NERC stated, “Strong load growth from new data centres and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” It went on to say that while Texas will experience elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the grid will remain stable during normal peak demand.

Over 120 GW of projects have requested to be connected to the Texas grid, marking a 170 percent increase since January requests. Approximately 73 percent of these projects are data centres, according to ERCOT. If all these data centres are built, it would equate to the average annual power consumption of almost 154 million homes. However, experts believe that it is unlikely for the massive project pipeline to be developed in its entirety, as there is simply not enough power to serve it.

Years of underinvestment in the U.S. grid, a lack of preparedness from utilities, and the rise in demand for data centres could lead to a power deficit if Texas, or another state, is hit by severe weather this winter. This demonstrates just how dramatically the tech sector is changing the landscape of power demand through data centre development. It also implies the need for stronger regulations to ensure that the electricity supply is sufficient and stable enough to meet demand before approving new projects.
