[TITLE]GlobalFoundries Plans Billion-Euro Investment to Expand Chip Manufacturing in Germany:
[TEXT]
GlobalFoundries (GF) today announced plans to invest €1.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities at its Dresden, Germany site. The investment will enable a production capacity increase to more than one million wafers per year by the end of 2028, making it the largest site of its kind in Europe.The expansion, known as project SPRINT, is expected to be supported by the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the framework of the European Chips Act, with EU approval for the full program expected later this year. This investment underscores Saxony's role as a critical hub for semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and reinforces Europe's strategic goal of supply chain resilience.As a part of the project, the facility will be upgraded to offer end-to-end European processes and data flows for critical semiconductor security requirements.Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as part of his visit to GF Dresden on 28 October, welcomed the planned investments in Germany: "The SPRINT project is a commitment to Germany as an industrial and innovation location - and above all to the sovereignty of our country and Europe. The investment in chip manufacturing in Dresden sends a signal that Germany wants to play an active role in shaping the development of the global semiconductor market. Germany already plays a leading role in microelectronics in Europe. With its national microelectronics strategy, the federal government is setting the course for further expanding this strength."Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer adds: "The further expansion of semiconductor manufacturing here at GlobalFoundries is a clear commitment to a unique location. The billion-euro investment is more good news for Silicon Saxony, Europe's most important microelectronics location, and demonstrates the attractiveness and dynamism of the cluster that has grown here. This will not only strengthen the Saxon economy—Germany and Europe will also benefit. After all, more chips manufactured here also means more German and European sovereignty and technological independence in this key industry. Germany's economic vulnerability due to excessive dependencies is currently being demonstrated by the example of chip manufacturer Nexperia."The new manufacturing capacity will focus on GF's highly differentiated technologies - with critical performance features including low power, embedded secure memory, and wireless connectivity - all essential for meeting Europe's chip demand for automotive, internet of things (IoT), defense and critical infrastructure applications. These sectors are being rapidly transformed by the rise of physical AI technologies for which GF's semiconductors are essential. The investment will also support continued innovation in next-generation compute architectures and quantum technologies as they scale into the next decade."Recent disruptions in the automotive sector underscore just how vulnerable global chip supply chains truly are. Our planned expansion in Dresden is yet another step in GF's strategy to address these challenges head-on and deliver on our commitment to support Europe's need for secure supply chains and differentiated technologies," said Tim Breen, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "By scaling our manufacturing footprint in Europe, in the U.S. and around the world, GF is reinforcing its role as a resilient and trusted partner to customers in critical industries and building a foundation for the next wave of innovation as physical AI becomes reality."Dr. Manfred Horstmann, senior vice president and general manager European fabs at GlobalFoundries, adds: "With this planned investment, we are deepening our commitment to Germany and Europe. Expanding cleanroom capacity is not just

Revenue

Our revenue decreased by $6,717,914, or 13.4%, from $50,273,589 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $43,555,675 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily because of the decrease in our sales volume of approximately 81,702 metric tons for the six months ended June 30, 2024 to approximately 79,055 metric tons for the six months ended June 30, 2025.

Our revenue increased by $6,019,582, or 13.6%, from $44,254,007 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to $50,273,589 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily because of the increase in our sales volume of approximately 73,633 metric tons for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to approximately 81,702 metric tons for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Cost of revenue

Our cost of revenue mainly represented the marine fuel cost and other costs mainly including the agency fee, barging fee, cancellation charges and survey fee. Our cost of revenue decreased by $6,124,910, or 12.5%, from $50,273,589 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $43,008,979 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which was mainly due to the decrease in our marine fuel costs and in line with the decrease in our revenue.

Our cost of revenue increased by $6,136,770, or 14.3%, from $42,997,119 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to $49,133,889 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which was mainly attributable to the increase in our marine fuel costs and in line with the increase in our revenue.

Gross profit

Our gross profit decreased by $593,004, or 52.0%, from $1,139,700 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $546,696 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which was due to the decrease in our revenue as stated above. Our gross profit margin decreased from 2.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 to 1.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which was mainly attributable to slightly upward adjustments in the purchase cost of our marine fuels we purchased during the six months ended June 30, 2025.

Our gross profit remained relatively stable at $1,139,700 and $1,256,888 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross profit margin remained relatively stable at 2.3% and 2.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses mainly represented the staff costs, agency commission, legal and professional fee, bank charges, utilities expenses, travelling and transportation costs and office supplies.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $455,492, or 63.4%, from $718,758 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $1,174,250 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which was mainly due to the increase in staff cost and professional fees such as audit, legal and consulting service expenses we incurred after the listing in the United States during the six months ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $498,462, or 226.3%, from $220,296 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to $718,758 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which was mainly due to the increase in staff cost and professional fees such as audit, legal and consulting service expenses we incurred for the application of the listing of becoming a publicly traded company in the United States during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses, including, but not limited to, staff costs, to increase in the foreseeable future, as our business further grows. We expect our legal and professional fees for legal, audit, and advisory services will increase as we will incur the audit fee, legal fee and advisory fee for this Offering and subsequently become a public after the IPO.

Reversal of provision for expected credit loss

We recorded a reversal of provision for expected credit loss of $2,401,151, nil and nil, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. Such reversal of provision for expected credit loss of $2,401,151 for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly attributable to the settlement of our long-aged accounts receivable, which was fully provided for expected credit loss as at December 31, 2024, by our customer during the six months ended June 30, 2025, resulting in the reversal of provision for expected credit loss of $5,740,368 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, which was partially offset by the increase in provision for expected credit loss of $3,339,217 for another customer’s accounts receivable for the six months ended June 30, 2025, as the management believed that the recoverability of such accounts receivable was remote due to the client is in the process of liquidation and have written-off the accounts receivable of $3,339,217 for the six months ended June 30, 2025.

Our growing portfolio of high-quality assets continued to deliver exceptional results this quarter, generating a year-over-year increase of approximately 105% in revenue(d) and 157% in free cash flow(c), demonstrating Diversified’s ability to generate substantial value in volatile markets. This performance reflects the strength of our business model, the disciplined approach to acquire assets, the commitment to our optimization strategy, the consistency of our operational execution, and our ability quickly and efficiently integrate acquisitions to capture synergies and enhance margins.

Importantly, we also delivered on our leverage target goal ahead of schedule, ending the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 2.4x. Significant strategic work over the last few years has built us into a company with higher growth prospects, a robust cash flow profile, and solid footing to deliver on our capital allocation framework. This progress has enabled us to strengthen our commitment to shareholders with a record year-to-date return of capital through dividends and share repurchases of approximately seven percent of our current shares outstanding.

The strength of our underlying business, our strategy, and our capabilities, coupled with our strategic partnership with the Carlyle Group, has allowed us to execute our disciplined inorganic growth through an accretive acquisition strategy with the recently announced agreement to purchase Canvas Energy. We believe the strong fit with our existing Oklahoma assets, our differentiated scale, and vertical integration will drive attractive financial returns. Our established acquisition integration playbook, the execution of which allowed us to complete both field-level and corporate-level integration of Maverick ahead of schedule, creates high confidence in our ability to execute the integration of Canvas. We remain well-positioned with strong liquidity and further balance sheet optionality for a robust funnel of potential high-quality opportunities.

Looking ahead, given our momentum on synergy capture, numerous portfolio optimization opportunities, and strong third-quarter performance, we are raising our financial guidance ranges for fiscal year 2025 for both adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. In addition, we continued to believe that our proposed redomestication to the United States and the change in our primary listing to the New York Stock Exchange, which includes full SEC reporting for domestic issuers beginning with year-end 2025 results, will offer several potential benefits that are in the best interest of all shareholders.

With outstanding performance across our platform, Diversified is well-positioned to thrive as a proven portfolio manager of cash generating energy assets in today’s evolving corporate landscape. We are proud to be the Right Company at the Right Time, delivering essential energy while creating long-term value for all stakeholders.”

[TITLE]COMSTOCK RESOURCES, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS:
[TEXT]
FRISCO, TX, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comstock Resources, Inc. ("Comstock" or the "Company") (NYSE; NYSE Texas: CRK) today reported financial and operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Highlights of 2025's Third Quarter

Higher natural gas prices in the third quarter drove improved financial results in the quarter. Natural gas and oil sales, including realized hedging gains, were $335 million for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $190 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAX for the quarter was $249 million. Adjusted net income was $28 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the quarter.

Three Western Haynesville wells turned to sales in the third quarter. These wells had an average lateral length of 8,566 feet and an average per well initial production rate of 32 MMcf per day.

Comstock has turned 28 wells to sales to date in 2025 in its Legacy Haynesville area with an average lateral length of 11,919 feet and a per well initial production rate of 25 MMcf per day.

Divested non-strategic Cotton Valley wells in East Texas and North Louisiana for net proceeds of $15 million.

Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025

During the third quarter of 2025, Comstock realized $2.99 per Mcf after hedging for its natural gas production of 112 Bcf. As a result, Comstock's natural gas and oil sales in the third quarter of 2025 increased to $335.0 million (including realized hedging gains of $26.4 million). Operating cash flow (excluding changes in working capital) generated in the third quarter of 2025 was $190.4 million, and net income for the third quarter was $118.1 million or $0.40 per diluted share. The net income in the quarter included a pre-tax $116.4 million unrealized gain on hedging contracts held for price risk management resulting from the change in future natural gas prices since the second quarter of 2025. Excluding this item, exploration expense and loss from sale of assets, adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2025 was $27.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.

Comstock's production cost per Mcfe in the third quarter averaged $0.77 per Mcfe, which was comprised of $0.36 for gathering and transportation costs, $0.26 for lease operating costs, $0.10 for production and other taxes and $0.05 for cash general and administrative expenses. Comstock's unhedged operating margin was 72% in the third quarter of 2025 and 74% after hedging.

Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Comstock realized $3.19 per Mcf after hedging for its natural gas production of 339 Bcf. Natural gas and oil sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 totaled $1.08 billion (including realized hedging losses of $22.7 million). Operating cash flow (excluding changes in working capital) generated during the first nine months of 2025 was $639.0 million, and net income was $133.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Net income during the first nine months of 2025 included a pre-tax $25.6 million unrealized gain on hedging contracts held for risk management. Excluding this item, exploration expense and loss from sale of assets, adjusted net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $121.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share.

Comstock's production cost per Mcfe during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 averaged $0.80 per Mcfe, which was comprised of $0.37 for gathering and transportation costs, $0.28 for lease operating costs, $0.09 for production and other taxes and $0.06 for cash general and administrative expenses. Comstock's unhedged operating margin was 74% during the first nine months of 2025 and 75% after hedging.

Drilling Results

Comstock drilled seventeen (14.2 net) operated horizontal Haynesville/Bossier shale wells in the third quarter of 2025, which had an average lateral length of 11,692 feet. Comstock turned twelve (10.6 net) operated wells to sales in the third quarter of 2025.

Since its last operational update in July 2025, Comstock has turned ten (8.6 net) operated Haynesville/Bossier shale wells to sales. These wells had initial production rates that averaged 28 MMcf per day. The completed lateral length of these wells averaged 11,156 feet.

Divestitures

On September 2, 2025, Comstock divested of its interest in its legacy Cotton Valley wells in East Texas and North Louisiana for net proceeds, after selling expenses, of $15.2 million. The properties sold include interests in 883 (770.9 net to Comstock) wells and 46 (27.3 net to Comstock) inactive wells. The properties were producing 7.9 MMcfe of natural gas equivalent in August 2025.

On October 10, 2025, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Shelby Trough properties in Nacogdoches, San Augustine and Shelby counties in Texas for $430.0 million to an unaffiliated third party. The transaction has an effective date of October 1, 2025, and is subject to customary closing conditions. The properties being sold include interests in 155 (74.5 net to Comstock) producing wells and approximately 36,000 net acres that are primarily undeveloped. Production net to Comstock's interest in these properties was 9.3 MMcf of natural gas per day in September 2025. Comstock expects to close the divestiture in December 2025 and intends to use the proceeds to reduce long-term debt.

[TITLE]Azad Engineering: Rolls-Royce and Boeing’s go-to Indian supplier — But is it overvalued?:
[TEXT]
Azad Engineering began operations in 2008 with a single Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine, machining turbine components for a Europe-based energy company.

Seventeen years later, it now boasts hundreds of CNC machines and has a market capitalisation of Rs 10,000 crore.

The company’s stock trades at a P/E ratio exceeding 100x, reflecting the market’s confidence in its capabilities.

So what does Azad Engineering do differently, and are the valuations justified?

Azad Engineering: A dual-engine growth model

The company’s business model is strategically built around two high-entry-barrier segments: Energy and Oil & Gas (launched in 2008) and Aerospace and Defence (launched in 2017).

Both require mission-critical precision where there is no margin for error, creating a deep “zero-defect” manufacturing culture.

Energy and Oil & Gas: The stable backbone

This segment remains the company’s primary revenue anchor, contributing Rs 358.6 crore or 79.1% of the total revenue in FY25, growing 26% YoY.

[TITLE]Increasing extreme winds challenge offshore wind energy resilience:
[TEXT]
Extreme wind speed and trends over the ocean

U 50 values in oceanic regions range from below 10 m s-1 to over 50 m s-1, with higher values predominantly occurring along tropical cyclone-prone tracks25 and in high-latitude regions, especially the Northeastern Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Westerlies (Fig. 1a). Our analysis shows that 36.7% of global oceanic grid cells have U 50 values exceeding the U ref of a Class III wind turbine (37.5 m s-1), while approximately 20.2% of grid cells exceed 42.5 m s-1, the U ref for Class II wind turbines (Fig. 1a). Only 0.8% of grid cells surpass 50 m s-1, the U ref associated with Class I wind turbines. For consistency, all U 50 values reported in this study are based on the complete 84-year time series, except for the analysis of U 50 trends derived from the moving time window.

The land regions are covered with blue masks since we mainly focused on the oceanic areas. The 11 sub-basins used for regional analysis are outlined in white boxes, including the Tropical Northwest Pacific (TNWP), Tropical Northeast Pacific (TNEP), Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), Tropical South Indian Ocean (TSI), Tropical South Pacific (TSP), Tropical South Atlantic (TSA), Extratropical Northwest Pacific (ENWP), Extratropical Northeast Pacific (ENEP), Extratropical North Atlantic (ENA), and South Westerlies (SW). b The distribution of U 50 across all pixels and each sub-region. c The trend of U 50 , with values estimated over a continuous 30-year period. The grey dots represent the significant linear trends. d The U 50 trends in all pixels and each sub-region. The colors of the bars represent the trend values, and each bar width represents the area of the sub-region. Full size image

To analyze the spatial distribution of U 50 , we classify ocean basins into tropical (5–30° N/S) and extratropical (30–60° N/S) regions, corresponding to the dominant meteorological regimes of TCs and ETCs, respectively. The southern extratropical Atlantic, Pacific and India Ocean are grouped into a unified Southern Westerlies region because they are well-connected and unobstructed by land, resulting in a total of 11 sub-basins (Fig. 1a). The U 50 values in extratropical regions are substantially higher than those in tropical regions. A pronounced right-skewed distribution is observed in the Extratropical North Atlantic (ENA) and Southern Westerlies (SW) regions, indicating a higher frequency of extreme wind events (Fig. 1b). In tropical regions, U 50 values are higher in the Pacific Ocean, with a broader distribution in the Tropical Northwest Pacific (TNWP) and a concentrated right-skewed distribution in the Tropical Northeast Pacific (TNEP). This spatial pattern aligns with the expansive cyclone-prone zone in the TNWP and the frequent occurrence of intense cyclones in the TNEP (Supplementary Fig. 3). These patterns are consistent with those observed in altimeter data26 and reanalysis dataset from NCEP’s Climate Forecast System Reanalysis27.

A general upward trend in U 50 is observed across most ocean regions. Globally, the average oceanic U 50 has increased significantly at a rate of 0.016 m s-1 yr-1 over the 30-year window adopted in this research (p < 0.01, Fig. 1c). Trend analysis using continuous 20-year and 50-year windows yields similar rates of change (0.014 m s-1 yr-1 and 0.013 m s-1 yr-1, respectively), suggesting that the choice of time window does not substantially affect the trend estimate (Supplementary Fig. 4). Spatially, 68.0% of oceanic grid cells exhibit a significant increasing trend, while only 14.01% show a decreasing trend (Fig. 1d). Regionally, the tropical regions, including the Northeast Pacific (TNEP), North Atlantic (TNA), North Indian Ocean (TNI), and South Pacific (TSP), exhibit a relatively high proportion of grid cells with substantial increases in U 50 . In these regions, 42.77%, 33.03%, 26.35%, and 45.34% of grid cells exhibit an upward trend exceeding 0.05 m s-1 yr-1 (Fig. 1d).

Although this study primarily examines extreme wind speeds, we also assess trends in mean wind speed to identify regions that exhibit both enhanced wind energy potential and heightened extreme wind risks. The ERA5 dataset reveals a modest but widespread increase in mean wind speeds across most oceanic regions from 1940 to 2023, except for equatorial zones and the northern Indian Ocean (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Importantly, increases in mean wind speeds frequently coincide with intensifying extreme winds, particularly in the eastern tropical Pacific, southeastern Pacific, and Southern Westerlies. In addition, ERA5 provides hourly 3-second gust wind speed, which enables us to determine the origins of extreme wind—whether from sudden high-wind events or sustained strong winds. A significant widening of the difference is observed between gust winds and hourly mean winds (here we use the 90th percentile of the difference as an example), suggesting more frequent sudden high-wind events (Supplementary Fig. 5b). However, spatial discrepancies are observed in the north-central Pacific and northwest Atlantic when comparing ERA5-derived mean wind speed trends with those from altimeter observations28 and the NCEI blended seawinds product29. These differences may stem from temporal variations in data coverage, particularly in satellite-based products introduced after 1985.

Extreme wind speed and trend over the coastline

Given that offshore wind farms are primarily sited in coastal regions and that the farthest distance of commissioned wind farms is approximately 100 km from land30, we specifically extract grid cells within 100 km of the coastline for analysis. In these coastal regions, around 16.49%, 11.25%, and 0.62% of grid cells exceed the reference wind speed thresholds for Class III, Class II, and Class I wind turbines, respectively. The coasts of Canada, England, Japan, and southern Argentina have the highest proportion of U 50 values exceeding the reference wind speed thresholds of wind turbine (Fig. 2a). Significant increases in extreme wind speeds, defined as trends larger than 0.05 m s-1 yr-1, are concentrated in tropical and subtropical coastal zones, including the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, the southern and eastern United States, India, Southeast Asia, and northern Australia (Fig. 2b). Coastal regions experiencing increasing mean wind speed and concurrently strengthening extreme winds exhibit greater potential for offshore wind energy development, but also face heightened risks, such as the coasts of California, northern and eastern Europe, the Taiwan Strait, Africa, South America, and Australia (Fig. 2b, c). Conversely, concurrent declines in both mean and extreme wind speeds are detected in the Mediterranean Sea, East China, and coastal India, likely associated with the weakening and poleward shift of boreal mid-latitude storm tracks8.

The pastel pink, soft pink, and deep pink represent U 50 exceeding 37.5 m s-1, 42.5 m s−1, and 50 m s-1, respectively. b The trend of U 50 in coastal regions. c The trend of mean wind speed (MWS) in coastal regions. Since the farthest offshore distance of commissioned wind turbines is 100 km, the coastal regions analyzed here are defined as areas within 100 km offshore. Full size image

The risk assessment for fully commissioned offshore wind farms

Changes in extreme oceanic winds pose increasing risks to offshore wind farms. To assess these risks, we categorize wind farms into three risk categories based on the U 50 values of the grid cells in which they are located. These categories correspond to IEC reference wind speed thresholds: Type 1 (U 50 exceeding 37.5 m s⁻¹), Type 2 (U 50 exceeding 42.5 m s⁻¹), and Type 3 (U 50 exceeding 50 m s⁻¹), as winds exceeding these thresholds endanger turbines in each respective category. Fully commissioned offshore wind farms are predominantly located in Europe and Asia, with 136 and 157 wind farms, respectively, and with total installed capacities of 28.86 GW and 25.24 GW31. Our analysis focuses on U 50 values and their trends at these wind farm locations. Notably, given the large spatial coverage of 0.25° × 0.25° grid cells, multiple wind farms may be situated within the same or neighboring grid cells.

In Europe, U 50 values across commissioned wind farms are closely clustered around the mean of 40 m s-1. The majority of these wind farms (74.26%) are located in regions exhibiting increasing U 50 trends, particularly in key areas such as southeastern UK and the coastal waters of Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden (Fig. 3a). Specifically, 48 wind farms (total capacity of 9.68 GW) are exposed to Type 1 risk, while 61 wind farms (total capacity of 18.14 GW) face Type 2 risk. Among these high-risk farms, 75.23% are located in regions where U 50 is trending upward. A temporal analysis shows a sharp increase in U 50 around 1975, followed by a temporary decline during 2005–2015, and a renewed upward trend in the past decade (Supplementary Fig. 6a).

Fig. 3: The fifty-year return period wind speed (U 50 ) and its trend in fully commissioned wind farms. a U 50 and trend for Europe. b U 50 and its trend for Asia. The solid-colored dots represent the locations of wind farms in Asia and Europe. The colors of the dots represent the magnitude of the trend, and the size of the dots represents the magnitude of U 50 at each wind farm. Additionally, smaller yellow, orange, and red dots mark wind farms that meet Type 1, Type 2, or Type 3 risk criteria, respectively. Full size image

In contrast, commissioned wind farms in Asia exhibit greater spatial variability in U 50 , with values ranging from below 15 m s-1 to above 40 m s-1 (Fig. 3b). Over half of these sites show decreasing U 50 trends, with spatial variance nearly ten times greater than that observed in Europe. Fewer wind farms are currently at risk in Asia, with eight sites falling under Type 1 risk and two wind farms near the Taiwan Strait exposed to both Type 2 and Type 3 risks (total capacity of 1.45 GW). Among these risk-exposed Asian wind farms, U 50 generally shows an upward trend, though it was briefly interrupted around 1985. However, two wind farms located in South China deviate from this pattern, with trends remaining persistently flat or negative (Supplementary Fig. 6b).

The risk assessment for offshore wind farm development zones

The U 50 values and their trends exhibit broadly similar patterns across offshore wind farm development zones. In Europe, U 50 trends are predominantly characterized by significant increases (68.03% of grid cells), mainly concentrated in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and along the west coast of England. Conversely, declining U 50 values are primarily observed along the coastlines of Spain and Italy (Fig. 4a). Among the planned wind farms, 208 are exposed to Type 1 risk, while 292 face Type 2 risk, corresponding to a combined maximum planned capacity of 403.00 GW. Of these, 76.80% are located in areas with rising U 50 trends. The temporal evolution of U 50 across these wind farms mirrors the pattern observed in commissioned wind farms, characterized by a general upward trend interrupted by a temporary decline during 2005–2015 (Supplementary Fig. 7a).

Fig. 4: The fifty-year return period wind speed (U 50 ) and its trend in offshore development zones. a U 50 and trend for Europe. b U 50 and trend for Asia. The solid-colored dots represent the locations of wind farms in Asia and Europe. The colors of the dots represent the magnitude of the trend, and the size of the dots represents the magnitude of U 50 at each wind farm. Additionally, smaller yellow, orange, and red dots mark wind farms that meet Type 1, Type 2, or Type 3 risk criteria, respectively. Full size image

In Asia, 61.23% of planned wind farms are located in regions with increasing U 50 trends, particularly concentrated in South Korea, Vietnam, the eastern and southeastern coasts of China (Fig. 4b). Although the mean U 50 value in planned wind farms across Asia is approximately 4 m s⁻¹ lower than that in Europe, several projects in Asia are exposed to higher risk categories. Specifically, 72 wind farms (total maximum planned capacity of 56.89 GW) face Type 1 risk, 46 wind farms (total maximum planned capacity of 42.11 GW) face Type 2 risk, and 69 wind farms (total maximum planned capacity of 40.52 GW) face Type 3 risk (Fig. 4b). Over 67% of these projects are located in regions where U 50 is increasing. The temporal trends follow a similar pattern to those in Europe, showing a sustained decline prior to the 1990s followed by a rebound after the 1990s (Supplementary Fig. 7b).

There are a total of 172 planned wind farms in North America, South America, and Australia. They are primarily located along the eastern and western coasts of the United States, the northeastern and southeastern coasts of Brazil, and the southwestern and southeastern coasts of Australia (see Supplementary Fig. 8)31. The increasing trends of U 50 are most pronounced in the northeastern United States and in southeastern and southwestern Australia, while most other sites show decreasing trends. Compared to Europe and Asia, these regions display smaller magnitudes of U 50 trends. In the United States, more than half of the planned wind farms, with a total maximum planned capacity of 50.31 GW, are exposed to Type 1 and Type 2 risks. A substantial increase in U 50 began to emerge around 2005 and has continued to date. The remaining sites fall within a relatively low-risk range for extreme wind (Supplementary Fig. 9).

The U 50 details in developing countries

Given the critical role of developing countries in the global energy transition and in meeting the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 7 to ensure access to clean and affordable energy for all, we analyze extreme wind conditions in nine emerging offshore wind markets, including Brazil, Colombia, India, the Philippines, Romania, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Vietnam24. These countries have set ambitious targets for offshore wind development, which will require substantial financial commitments. For example, Colombia is planning 12 projects with a total capacity of 5 GW, scheduled for commissioning between 2032 and 2034 (refs. 32,33). India has issued tenders for offshore wind zones targeting 37 GW by 2030, with the transmission system for 10 GW estimated to cost around 0.28 lakh crore (approximately US$ 3.36 billion)31. Vietnam aims for 6 GW by 2030, with foundation construction alone requiring investments of US$ 40–100 million24. Brazil has advanced regulatory decrees to facilitate the legal use of offshore areas for wind projects32. These developments underscore the need for accurate assessments of extreme wind risks to support efficient capital deployment in these countries.

Six of these nine countries, excluding Brazil, Turkey, and Romania, have over half of their coastal grid cells showing increasing U 50 trends. In Turkey, U 50 trends exhibit clear regional variations, with a significant downward trend observed near the Mediterranean Sea and upward trends near the Black Sea (Fig. 2b). In Sri Lanka, over 30% of grid cells show a trend greater than 0.05 m s-1 yr-1 (Fig. 5a). Colombia experiences different oceanic environments due to its exposure to both the Caribbean Sea and the southeastern Pacific Ocean, with extreme winds primarily concentrated along the Caribbean coast (Fig. 2b).

When compared to the reference wind speeds in IEC standards, five countries––South Africa, Vietnam, Turkey, Colombia and the Philippines––will face extreme risks (Fig. 5b). Notably, approximately 3% of coastal grid cells in both Turkey and the Philippines exceed U 50 values of 50 m s⁻¹ (Type 3 risk), with extreme wind conditions in Turkey mainly occurring in the Black Sea. Such high-wind environments pose additional challenges for floating offshore wind energy development, including increased maintenance difficulties and higher anchor costs34.

Attribution of U 50 trends

To explore potential drivers of the observed changes in U 50 , we use the relationship between SST and annual maximum wind speed (AMW), which serves as a proxy for U 50 at annual timescales. While SST is not a direct indicator of wind dynamics, it reflects low-frequency variability in the climate system and may influence storm intensity through thermodynamic and dynamic processes35. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation (r = 0.80, p < 0.05) between spatially averaged SST and AMW at the global scale from 1940 to 2023 (Fig. 6a). Over this period, AMW increased by 1.05 m s-1 per degree of SST change, indicating a potential response of extreme winds to global warming (Fig. 6b).

The observed correlation between SST and AMW can be explained by the intensification of storm systems under a warming climate. This is because TCs and ETCs account for over 80% of extreme wind events11,36. Our seasonal analysis indicates that most extreme wind events occur in winter months, suggesting a dominant contribution from ETCs (Supplementary Fig. 10)37. Regions where extreme winds peak in summer or autumn align with known TC tracks, such as the North Indian Ocean, the tropical Pacific, and the tropical North Atlantic.

Observed changes in cyclone characteristics provide evidence of intensifying wind extremes. The spatial-temporal patterns of cyclone activities derived from best-track data (details refer to Supplementary Methods) are consistent with U 50 changes. Although TC frequency peaked in the 1990s and 2000s, the 2010–2023 period recorded the highest lifetime-maximum wind speeds in most basins (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). Similarly, accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), defined as \({ACE}=\mathop{\sum }_{0}^{N}\mathop{\sum }_{0}^{\tau }{V}_{\max }^{2}\) (where is the maximum wind speed of cyclone, τ is cyclone lifetime, and N is the total number of cyclones)38, also peaked during this period (Supplementary Fig. 11c). The spatial extent of regions experiencing Category 4 and 5 cyclones (V max larger than 58 m s-1) has expanded by 4.3% compared to the 1980–2001 baseline, particularly in the North Atlantic, consistent with the sharp increase in U 50 observed in the Gulf Stream region (Supplementary Fig. 3). ETCs in both hemispheres are shifting poleward, with notable intensification over the northeastern Atlantic in the Northern Hemisphere and near 60°S in the Southern Hemisphere11. Storm activities have weakened in midlatitude regions, consistent with the decreasing U 50 trends around the Mediterranean Sea and China’s Bohai Sea.

[TITLE]As tariff tensions rise, Bessent sees US aircraft engines, chemicals as leverage in trade talks with China. Is your portfolio armed or exposed?:
[TEXT]
Scott Bessent

The U.S.-China relationship has entered another high-stakes chapter as the Trump administration seeks to secure a more advantageous trade policy with the country.

In a Sept. 24 Fox Business interview, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. can leverage its strength in aircraft engines and parts and certain chemicals in trade discussions with China. (1)

“We’re not without levers on our side,” he told business reporter Maria Bartiromo. “We have plenty of products that they depend on us for.”

For investors, the implications are clear: Companies tied to critical sectors such as aerospace and chemical manufacturing may see both heightened risks and new opportunities.

The shifting policy environment could reshape balance sheets, valuations and long-term growth paths.

Potential gains in aerospace and semiconductor sectors

The U.S. is at a clear advantage in aerospace. Aircraft engines and parts are not easily substituted, and China depends on U.S. and European manufacturers for aviation technology.

This dynamic could translate into increased support for American aerospace companies through government contracts or preferential trade treatment. Government backing in strategic industries often boosts investor confidence. (2)

Meanwhile, Bessent noted that many of the world’s high-performance semiconductors — used to make microchips — are currently produced in Taiwan, a potential “single greatest point of failure” for the global economy. (3)

For some time, the U.S. has been trying to increase its own domestic production of semiconductors and encourage production in countries perceived as allies. Under the Biden administration, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act allocated over $52 billion to strengthen U.S. semiconductor capabilities.

For investors, companies involved in domestic chip production, materials and equipment may stand to benefit from new capital inflows.

Firms with ties to China may present risk

But there’s a flipside. Businesses deeply dependent on China — whether as a market for exports or as a source of critical inputs — are vulnerable to disruptions.

For example, U.S. firms imported nearly $439 billion worth of goods from China in 2024, making China the second-largest supplier of U.S. imports.

Tariffs, restrictions or retaliatory policies could significantly increase costs and squeeze margins for companies reliant on Chinese supply chains.

Investors should closely monitor firms with high exposure to China. Tech hardware companies, consumer goods manufacturers and even automakers face risks if supply chains tighten or demand in China weakens as the country focuses on its own made-in-China products.

How investors can respond

The key is to strike a balance between caution and fear. If investors panic-sell in response to headlines, they could lock in losses and miss potential gains as new winners emerge.

A more measured approach involves rebalancing your portfolio to reduce risk and identify businesses who stand to benefit from U.S. government subsidies and domestic production.

Financial advisors recommend staying informed, diversifying across sectors and geographies and avoiding emotional investment decisions.

Though markets are unpredictable, investors can control costs, practice asset allocation and diversification and maintain long-term discipline. (4)
