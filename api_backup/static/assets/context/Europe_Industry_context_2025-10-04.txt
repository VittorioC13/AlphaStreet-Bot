[TITLE]Notion Capital raises $130 million for European growth fund:
[TEXT]
Notion Capital, a London-based venture capital firm, has announced the close of a new $130 million growth fund. The fund will focus on supporting growth-stage startups across Europe in sectors like AI, defense, and supply chain logistics. Stephen Chandler, managing partner at Notion Capital, emphasized the importance of the new fund in addressing the shortage of growth-stage capital in Europe.

“This opens up a chance for firms like ourselves to become real European champions,” Chandler said. The fund, called Growth Opps III, will target areas of rising demand such as sovereignty, resilience, and artificial intelligence. Chandler described AI as a “super cycle” that is reshaping the industry.

Notion Capital will concentrate on applications of AI to multiply its market reach. Notion Capital has already begun deploying funds into ventures like Upvest, a stock trading API, Kraken, a builder of unmanned surface vessels, and Nelly, a developer of financial products for the medical sector. A dedicated team of fund partners will handle these growth deals and source new opportunities outside the existing portfolio.

Notion Capital secures new funding

The firm has also introduced new leadership with Growth Opps III. Partner Stephanie Opdam will drive the growth strategy alongside Jessica “Jess” Bartos, who joined from Salesforce Ventures as Notion’s first external partner hire.

Europe has historically struggled with a shortage of institutional capital, particularly from pension schemes. However, reforms like France’s Tibi initiative and the UK’s Mansion House Accord are starting to create incentives for long-term capital mobilisation. Reflecting its pan-European ambitions, the fund is denominated in euros and domiciled in Luxembourg, making it less dependent on UK regulation.

Around 85% of its capital came from institutional investors across Europe, the UK, MENA, and the United States. Since its founding, Notion Capital has invested in over 150 companies, including notable names like Currencycloud, GoCardless, Mews, Paddle, and Quantum Systems. Their established relationships with founders serve as a competitive advantage, particularly at the growth stage.

With Growth Opps III, Notion Capital is positioning itself as a key player in Europe’s evolving venture landscape. The firm plans to make about a dozen investments from the new fund, continuing to support ambitious European founders as they scale to global prominence.

[TITLE]MetroLink will have adverse effects across Dublin, planning commission acknowledges:
[TEXT]
The construction would require removal of railings, bollards and traditional lamp-posts and trees at St Stephen's Green

An Coimisiún Pleanála resoundingly endorsed MetroLink in the railway order issued on Thursday.

It did acknowledge, however, there would be adverse effects ranging from “significant” to “profound” at several locations.

“Significant, permanent adverse impacts” would be felt “in respect of the compulsory acquisition of occupied housing at a number of locations”, it said.

These include the College Gate apartment complex, and eight Dublin City Council houses on Townsend Street, all of which are due to be levelled for the Tara station.

There would be a “very significant adverse impact” on the setting and character of St Stephen’s Green, a protected structure and national monument, which is a particular concern of the Office of Public Works.

The construction would require removal of railings, bollards and traditional lamp-posts and trees. Following the completion of construction, the restoration landscaping strategy will have a “limited effect in addressing the overall impact of construction” for a number of years. Once the trains are running, the impact would “remain at the level of very significant”, the commission said.

There would also be “very significant adverse impact on architectural heritage at O’Connell Street Upper”, arising from proposed demolition works between Nos 43-58 O’Connell Street Upper that includes demolition within the curtilage of a protected structure.

The demolition of Hedigan’s pub, also known as the Brian Boru at Cross Guns Bridge in Phibsborough, is described as a “significant adverse impact”.

There would be “profound adverse impacts” on Four Masters Park, in front of the Mater hospital, arising from “the scale of clearance and excavation works proposed and the required presence of construction elements within the park for prolonged periods”.

[ Dublin’s MetroLink: How much will it really cost?Opens in new window ]

Following the completion of construction, the park will be restored, but with a slightly different alignment and a reduced area.

A “profound adverse impact” will also be imposed on the setting and character of the gate lodges of Santry Lodge, a protected structure.

There will be “short-term significant negative impacts” on the western and southwestern commuter rail lines, due to the need for a temporary line closure to facilitate track lowering at Glasnevin station.

A “very significant adverse impact” is identified on the setting and character of Carroll’s Building, a 1960s protected structure in Dublin 6.

Our Lady of Victories Church in Ballymun will be significantly impacted during construction, as will Lissenhall Bridge in Swords, a protected structure, during the operation of the line.

Groundborne noise is also likely to temporarily impact the areas around Glasnevin, Mater, Tara and Charlemont stations during construction. This is noise which originates from vibrations in the ground, for example from boring machines.

The commission said it was “satisfied that these impacts cannot be avoided or mitigated due to the nature of groundborne noise, the extent and depth of the required excavations and the proximity to receptors, all of which are necessary to deliver a metro system within an urban environment”.

[TITLE]H2 2025 Global Hotel Outlook:
[TEXT]
Executive Summary

In the U.S., CBRE has reduced its 2025 RevPAR growth forecast to 0.1% from 1.8% previously. Hotel fundamentals are expected to undergo more dramatic changes over the next three quarters due to a less active hurricane season and fewer election-related events than last year, as well as tariff increases and continued competition from lodging alternatives.

Despite trade tensions with the U.S., Canada is still expected to see a 2.4% increase in RevPAR. Inbound travel from the U.S., as well as domestic travel, remains relatively strong.

Northern Latin America tourism is undergoing a dynamic upswing this year, with Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia and the Dominican Republic all showing strong performance. Visitor numbers are expected to further increase over the rest of 2025.

Europe’s international tourist arrivals continue to rise. Certain markets are seeing stronger occupancy rates amid more measured rate setting. We expect decelerated RevPAR growth of between 2% and 5% across Europe this year.

Middle East hotels and tourism performed well in H1 2025, with the UAE leading the way. Abu Dhabi and Dubai have recorded significant growth in RevPAR, driven by a strong exhibition season and the appeal of new leisure attractions. Most Saudi Arabian markets also recorded RevPAR growth.

Asia-Pacific saw a 9% increase in international arrivals (excluding mainland China) in the first half of 2025, driven by visitors to Japan, Vietnam and Korea. Growth of average daily rates (ADRs) slowed in most markets. Japan, Korea, Vietnam and India are expected to have the strongest RevPAR growth in 2025.

United States

Despite stronger-than-expected economic growth through the first half of 2025, year-to-date RevPAR growth through July stands at a meager 0.4% as the occupancy rate fell for four consecutive months.

Historically, ADRs tend to contract following four to six months of occupancy declines, which does not bode well for the balance of the year. CBRE now forecasts RevPAR growth of -0.6% for H2 2025, bringing our full-year 2025 RevPAR forecast to just 0.1% year-over-year, down from our earlier forecast of 1.8%.

CBRE lowered its 2025 U.S. GDP growth forecast to 1.5% from 1.9% earlier in the year, reflecting the impact of persistent trade tensions, elevated interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. CBRE also lowered its 2026 GDP growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.5%, well below the long-term average. Inflation is expected to remain elevated, with CPI growth forecast at 2.9% for the year—10 basis points higher than previous estimates. Along with weaker growth in real disposable income and cautious consumer sentiment, these are expected to weigh on hotel fundamentals for the rest of this year and in 2026.

Following better-than-expected RevPAR gains in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, growth fell sharply in Q2. This can be attributed to several factors: a modest 0.5% increase in inbound foreign travelers, a drop in meeting and convention attendance, less business travel, government layoffs and a 5.3% increase in the supply of short-term rentals over the past 12 months.

0.1% - Forecast growth in U.S. hotel RevPAR this year.

12% - CAGR in hotel loyalty program membership since 2019.

Hotel market fundamentals are expected to remain challenged for at least the next three quarters. Year-over-year changes will be more dramatic due to strong demand last year from an active hurricane season and presidential election-related events, as well as flat per diems for travel by government workers, increased tariffs and continued competition from lodging alternatives. These headwinds are compounded by persistent labor challenges and rising operating costs, which are pressuring margins. As alternative lodging options proliferate, hotel margins are expected to decline for the third consecutive year in 2025.

Chain-affiliated hotels have outperformed independents in 2025, supported by a 12% CAGR in loyalty program membership since 2019. Loyalty programs continue to provide a buffer for occupancy during challenging periods, though their impact is partially offset by the 40% cumulative proliferation of brands among the world’s largest hotel families since 2019. Luxury remains the strongest-performing chain scale, while urban hotels lead in year-over-year growth. However, urban hotels still trail their pre-COVID performance levels.

Lower-priced hotels are expected to underperform through the remainder of 2025 and into early 2026, having benefited disproportionately from hurricane-related demand in late 2024 and early 2025.

Additionally, tariffs, inflation risks and the potential for rising unemployment could suppress demand by price-sensitive travelers.

Figure 1: Americas Hotel Performance & Key Macroeconomic Indicators as a % of 2019

CBRE expects San Francisco, Orlando and San Jose to see the strongest RevPAR growth and Memphis, Austin and New Orleans to see the weakest over the balance of 2025 and in 2026. San Francisco and San Jose will benefit from a strong convention calendar and large special events like the Super Bowl and World Cup in 2026. Orlando will benefit from the opening of a new theme park in 2025.

CBRE expects further improvement in hotel fundamentals next year, supported by special events such as the World Cup and the country’s 250th birthday. Even so, top-line growth is expected to remain below inflation for the foreseeable future. With construction and operating costs at all-time highs on a per-available-room basis, CBRE forecasts annual supply growth of just 0.7% between 2024 and 2028, less than half the rate over the four years preceding COVID. Persistent growth in shadow supply will likely delay the hotel market’s next upcycle beyond the near term.

Now in its fifth year, the hotel sector’s recovery has entered its later stages. Operators and asset managers must remain diligent on cost control, while continuing to deliver clean, safe and comfortable guest experiences. Maintaining amenities and service levels is critical to retaining market share, especially as competition from shadow supply and limited-service brand offerings intensifies.

Hotel owners and operators should optimize channel mix, invest in guest-facing services and amenities, retrofit obsolete spaces into revenue-generating outlets where possible and work hard to keep review scores high.

Canada

Heading into 2025, the Canadian hotel market was expected to return to a typical RevPAR growth pattern, characterized by supply and demand balance and moderate ADR growth.

Following several years of strong demand growth and minimal new supply, the national occupancy rate was expected to remain at peak levels (~65%).

New hotel supply was expected to rebound to levels in line with historical norms (~1.5%) after several years of increased construction and borrowing costs, along with closures and conversions of existing properties.

The Canadian hotel market saw significant ADR growth in recent years, including a 4.5% increase in 2024 to more than $200. Strong demand was driven by both leisure and business travel, as well as improved technology that helped operators drive rate yield.

2.4% - Forecast growth in Canadian hotel RevPAR this year.

While the initial optimism for steady RevPAR growth faced challenges in early 2025 due to rising trade tensions with the U.S. and economic uncertainty, we still expect a 2.4% increase in RevPAR to $138. This moderate RevPAR growth is based on balanced supply and demand and a moderate improvement in ADR.

[TITLE]There Is No Green Transition Without Consequences:
[TEXT]
U.S. politics currently allow for vanishingly few areas of bipartisan consensus. But one thing government officials of all kinds tend to agree on is the importance of mining. In particular, they seek “transition minerals,” which are vital to the shift away from fossil fuels. These include lithium, cobalt, copper, and nickel (often called critical minerals, essential for rechargeable batteries), as well as rare-earth minerals such as yttrium, scandium, and lanthanides (integral components of green infrastructure). Freedom from dirty energy, it would appear, requires doubling down on the decidedly nonrenewable practice of mineral extraction.

The Biden administration devoted billions of dollars to building a domestic supply chain for critical minerals and called for half of all new cars to be electric or hybrid by 2030. Despite its well-documented hostility toward electric vehicles, the Trump administration recently took the unusual step of investing hundreds of millions of dollars in a private company to grow domestic mineral production. Donald Trump, like Joe Biden before him, craves Ukraine’s mineral wealth; the desire for mining access also partly motivated Trump’s threats to annex Greenland and Canada.

The mass deployment of technologies that these minerals make possible—fleets of electric cars; flocks of wind turbines; a cleaner energy grid—may be imperative if our society is to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and thereby avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change. Yet the green transition comes at a significant cost. The mining of minerals such as lithium “often leaves parts of the Earth itself uninhabitable,” the political scientist Thea Riofrancos writes in her astute new book, Extraction. As Riofrancos notes, approximately 69 percent of transition minerals—and a whopping 85 percent of lithium reserves—are in or near Indigenous or poor communities across the globe, rendering these groups disproportionately vulnerable to water contamination, displacement, and economic insecurity.

According to a number of recent books, the harmful consequences don’t stop there. The mining of cobalt often entails child labor, brutally described in Siddharth Kara’s 2023 best seller, Cobalt Red. Clashes between powerful political actors pursuing profit and local communities opposed to mines, in places as widespread as Peru and Pakistan, have led to “political upheaval, mayhem, and murder,” as the journalist Vince Beiser writes in his 2024 book, Power Metal.

Beiser describes the green transition as “a paradox” for human civilization: “We must do everything we can to stave off the catastrophes of climate change, but, in doing so, we may create a whole other set of catastrophes.” The reporter Ernest Scheyder poses a similar question in The War Below, also from 2024: What do we value more, the environment “or the lithium beneath it?”

In Extraction, Riofrancos moves well beyond this binary framing, and for this reason hers is by far the most clear-eyed of mining’s many recent chronicles. She takes seriously the costs of the green transition but argues that the paradox is, in fact, the result of false choices and a limited vision. She looks past mining sites to the policy choices of the world’s wealthiest corporate and political actors, located “all the way at the other end of far-flung supply chains.” In doing so, she suggests that a different, fairer, and greener world—one that demands less energy altogether—is possible.

The word extraction, as Riofrancos uses it, has a deliberately negative connotation. In adopting the term, she is pointedly conflating mining (the extraction of metals from the ground) with exploitation (the extraction of profits, often from faraway places and poor people’s labor). Just as Ta-Nehisi Coates used plunder to make clear that racism harms people not just interpersonally but materially, Riofrancos uses extraction to argue that mining is far more than shafts and tunnels and the removal of silver or copper; it is part and parcel of the unequal distribution of wealth, work, and waste.

In Riofrancos’s account, modern mineral mining was extractive from the start. No sooner had Christopher Columbus landed in the New World in 1492 than his men conscripted Indigenous Taíno people to dig up as much gold as they could find. Centuries of pillage followed, as colonial governors—in the Americas, in Africa, in Asia—compelled millions of enslaved or indentured laborers to mine precious metals that enriched European crowns and corporations, setting patterns that persisted, in some form, well past the end of formal colonialism.

Resistance to these practices also has deep roots. Starting in the 1920s and ’30s, a number of Latin American countries began nationalizing their oil and mining sectors. This trend went into hyperdrive in 1960, when Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela founded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), seeking to wrest control of the oil industry from the handful of U.S. and European companies that enjoyed a near-global monopoly. In the two decades that followed, nationalization was embraced by former colonies across Asia and Latin America, spurring the United States and wealthy European nations to start prioritizing domestic resource extraction.

Read: Why the energy transition will be so complicated

The “oil shock” kicked off by OPEC also led Exxon to spend millions on finding a fossil-fuel alternative. Out of this research emerged the lithium-ion battery, first deployed at scale in early-2000s China. Over the next generation, Chinese companies began buying control of lithium mines around the world. Partly because of this access, China is now the world’s top exporter of batteries and solar panels (and nearly the top exporter of electric vehicles), and it is reportedly building three-quarters of solar and wind projects globally.

Riofrancos notes the predominance of China in the green transition, but the country is more of a specter than a fully realized subject of her study. Instead, she devotes far more attention to Latin America—and especially to Chile, where more than a third of global lithium reserves are located. After Chile nationalized its copper mines in 1971, U.S. officials backed a violent coup through which General Augusto Pinochet took power. Pinochet promptly reimbursed foreign mining companies, invited in foreign investors, and crushed domestic miners’ unions, moves with long-term ramifications. Today, in northern Chile, mining companies govern in all but name: They build local infrastructure and even provide social services. In exchange, Riofrancos writes, they expect local residents to quietly abide their presence.

Chilean lithium extraction occurs almost entirely in the country’s salt flats, striking desert landscapes that are home to thousands of flamingos and a great many Indigenous communities. The region’s plants, animals, and people bear the greatest environmental costs of the green transition. Mining companies have so exacerbated water scarcity that many Indigenous Chileans have had to give up herding. In China, as Riofrancos reports, the pollution flowing from mineral extraction has led to places where disproportionate rates of disease, including cancer, are the norm. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, women in cobalt-mining regions have reported reproductive-health concerns such as miscarriages and birth defects; cobalt mining has also polluted croplands. And in the United States, as Beiser writes in Power Metal, the mining industry is the leading emitter of toxic chemicals and “has sullied the watersheds of almost half of all the rivers in the American West.”

In the face of such extensive despoliation, grassroots opposition has emerged. Widespread demonstrations against lithium mining began in northern Chile in 2007 and spread around the world in the following years. In 2023, Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, who was elected in 2021 following protests against inequality and privatization, announced the creation of a state-owned lithium company and obliged future mining contracts to be “public-private partnerships.” This was part of a global trend: A third of the world’s countries have increased government control of their mining and energy industries since 2019. Even as Trump and China’s Xi Jinping seek to lock down global access to minerals, the inhabitants of mining regions continue to contest foreign dominance.

In 2024, Boric took steps to significantly expand lithium mining in the salt flats. Such a move is an example of what Riofrancos called “resource nationalism”—efforts by countries with abundant resources to increase control over them—in her previous book, Resource Radicals. The policy still countenances harmful mining, but with the intent of benefiting locals, not faraway CEOs or shareholders. African nations are hastening to restrict the export of key metals, hoping to generate domestic jobs and revenue. China, home to the majority of rare-earth-metal mining, recently did the same (possibly in response to the Trump administration’s tariff policies), a move that temporarily closed American auto plants. The United States and European Union are racing to “onshore” mineral production.

Read: The clean-energy equation no one can solve yet

An approach that simply transfers the control or profits of mineral mining to a different party is no path out of the climate crisis—especially when that approach might lead to a “resource war.” Yet how to solve the paradox presented by transition minerals? The solutions widely on offer are plainly inadequate. For instance, in Power Metal, Beiser advocates for greater recycling and reuse of electronics, pushing readers to take up biking and “turn down the heating or cooling systems in your home a few degrees”—fine ideas as far as they go, which is not far at all.

Riofrancos writes that she, too, once felt overwhelmed by this conundrum. Upon returning from her first visit to the Chilean salt flats in 2019, she found herself asking: “If climate action requires more extraction, do the ends justify the means?” Yet since then, she has come to reject the premise of the question.

As Riofrancos writes, she was surprised to learn that existing studies of future mineral needs “assumed that the only way to eliminate emissions from transportation”—the second-largest source of carbon emissions—“is to replace individual gas-powered vehicles with individual electric vehicles.” So Riofrancos began working with the Climate & Community Institute to study the subject herself. Together, they posited different worlds—denser cities, less sprawl, a reimagined transportation sector in which many more commuters used mass transit or rode bikes—and learned that such scenarios require significantly less lithium, as much as 92 percent less by 2050. Such findings defy the zero-sum formulations; indeed, Riofrancos argues, a path to zero emissions that depends on electrifying personal vehicles is the slowest path to that goal (albeit one that might not demand larger societal shifts).

She calls for a just transition that not only phases out oil and gas but also can “transform the unequal social system” of the fossil-fuel era. Riofrancos does not detail how to reach this future (charting such a course would be beyond the scope of her project). And she acknowledges that some amount of mining will remain necessary, even as she advocates for a society that demands less extraction overall. But one can envision what some of those changes—challenging as they might be to implement—might look like: denser, public construction to reduce energy demand; direct government funding of electrification; a transition to community control over utilities and industries.

Riofrancos is clear that the solution, in her eyes, cannot just be “governing mining better.” In making such a demand, she echoes the philosopher Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, who calls for reparations—but not as a onetime money transfer. Instead, he seeks an approach to the climate crisis that can “reshape” the global order, not simply “manage its consequences.” Critical minerals are important if the future is to be a livable one, but their costs are very real. In Extraction, Riofrancos not only illustrates those costs; she suggests they are, at least to some extent, avoidable.

[TITLE]Beyond Aero Achieves Full-Scale Hydrogen-Electric Power:
[TEXT]
BYA-1 Hydrogen-Electric Biz-Jet is On-Track to Hit the Market in the Early 2030s

Beyond Aero is getting closer to rolling out its green-powered business jets, reaching Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6) for its hydrogen-electric propulsion system. The full-scale power testing keeps the company on track to roll out its BYA-1 aircraft in the early 2030s.

The company’s new test facility in Toulouse, France, was used to demonstrate the system in a realistic environment. The lab allows engineers to test power levels, fuel storage, and safety systems under operating conditions similar to what the aircraft will face in service. With the successful campaign, Beyond Aero can begin the transition from lab experiments to industrial-scale readiness.

The milestone comes after “18 months of relentless teamwork, powered by an environment where ambition is matched by rigor and where every achievement is the result of collective determination,” according to CEO Eloa Guillotin. “Leading such a talented, diverse, and purpose-driven team is both an honor and a responsibility.”

Beyond Aero’s progress has been strengthened by the acquisition of assets and data from hydrogen flight pioneer Universal Hydrogen. The deal included patents, test results, and experienced staff, which the company admits helped accelerate its program and reduce risks as it nears certification.

Several well-known aerospace suppliers have partnered with Beyond Aero along the way, ranging from fuel cell developers to power electronics firms to testing specialists. These collaborators have put in their two cents to ensure the propulsion system meets strict safety and performance standards.

On the regulatory front, Beyond Aero has already engaged with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency through the early application process. Developing a relationship with EASA at this stage allows the company to align its testing with certification requirements and to address potential safety questions before the aircraft enters formal review.

The BYA-1 is a small business jet that targets a six-passenger capacity for trips up to 800 nautical miles. While shorter than the traditional biz-jets we’re used to, that range is roughly five times greater than today’s battery-electric aircraft, making it a practical alternative for regional travel.
