[TITLE]Vaxxas secures ~A$90 million in funding to:
[TEXT]
Total equity and debt raising of ~$90 million provides runway to 2H 2027

Strong support from existing and new investors including SPRIM Global Investments

Funds will be used to scale-up production of needle-free vaccination delivery technology

Founding CEO David Hoey will transition to Strategic Advisor

Company well-advanced in search for new CEO to accelerate commercialisation.

BRISBANE, Australia, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxxas Pty Ltd, the biotechnology company pioneering the high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) for needle-free vaccine delivery, today announced that it has secured ~$90 million in its latest financing round.

The financing is one of the largest financings for a private biotech company in Australia this year and includes $49.22 million in new Series D equity and $40 million in debt facilities, with additional commitments under discussion as the Company continues to attract investor interest.

The equity financing was led by SPRIM Global Investments, the venture arm of global life sciences firm SPRIM, with strong participation from new investor LGT Crestone as well as existing investors OneVentures and Brandon Capital-Hostplus.

The funding will enable Vaxxas to accelerate the development and scale-up of its HD-MAP technology towards market readiness, including installation of semi-automated manufacturing lines and later-stage clinical trial programs.

Vaxxas’ HD-MAP technology represents a major advance in vaccine delivery, enabling needle-free administration that reduces temperature control requirements for vaccine storage and creates opportunities for self-administration in the home. This could dramatically improve vaccine access and uptake worldwide.

Chair of Vaxxas, Sarah Meibusch, said the capital raising represented an excellent achievement in a very difficult market for biotech. “This result underscores the confidence that leading investors have in Vaxxas’ disruptive technology and the progress the team has made toward scaling-up and commercialisation. Coupled with our sharp focus on commercialisation, this funding provides Vaxxas with a runway into the second half of 2027 as we focus on bringing our technology to market.”

Michael Shleifer, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of SPRIM Global Investments, said: “SPRIM is proud to lead this financing and support Vaxxas at this exciting juncture. We believe the HD-MAP platform has the potential to fundamentally transform vaccine delivery globally – expanding access, reducing costs, and improving uptake. The commercial opportunity is enormous, and we look forward to partnering with the team as they advance toward market.”

In addition to the Series D equity, Vaxxas has entered into a US$25.2 million (A$40 million) debt facility with SPRIM Global Investments, which the company can draw down based on eligible R&D activity under the Australian Government’s R&D tax rebate scheme and in line with the Company’s R&D needs.

Leadership and Board transition

After 14 years as CEO, David Hoey will transition to a new role as Strategic Advisor. Having led Vaxxas since 2012, Mr Hoey and the Board believe that this transition provides a strategic opportunity to put leadership in place for the coming years, as the Company accelerates its commercialisation efforts to bring the HD-MAP to market.

Mr Hoey said: “I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved to bring the company and its technology to this point in its growth. We have successfully validated the revolutionary potential of this vaccination delivery platform for a spectrum of diseases in global markets and have strong traction in product and market development. I look forward to continuing to be a part of the Vaxxas journey, supporting the executive team and Board as they drive forward.”

Under Mr Hoey’s leadership, Vaxxas has established a world-class team, strategic relationships with global leaders in vaccination, and raised more than $300 million to support the programs, of which almost $160 million has been injected into the Australian economy, including more than $140 million in Queensland.

Sarah Meibusch said: “We are deeply grateful to David for his tireless work to get Vaxxas to this stage. David and the Vaxxas team have grown the company from a spinout from The University of Queensland into a company with strong technical and operational capabilities and established a world-class development and manufacturing facility. This transition reflects the Company’s evolution from a high-potential startup to a commercially focused biotech scaling for global impact. David’s continued involvement as advisor and committed shareholder will help ensure a smooth transition and continuity.”

A global search for a new CEO is well advanced.

Vaxxas Chair Paul Kelly, who has been on the Board since Vaxxas was founded in 2011, has retired from the Board. Fellow OneVentures representative Sarah Meibusch has been appointed Chair. Ms Meibusch, OneVentures Healthcare Partner, has been closely involved with Vaxxas for a number of years and has been an alternate director since 2020.

[TITLE]Thoma Bravo to buy Verint in $2 billion deal as software acquisitions ramp up:
[TEXT]
Thoma Bravo will acquire Verint Systems in a $2 billion deal, including debt, the customer engagement platform said on Monday, marking the latest software buyout as private equity firms increasingly bet on AI to navigate an uncertain economy.

Software companies have emerged as prime acquisition targets as adoption of artificial intelligence and recurring revenue prove to be resilient markers in an economy pressured by tariffs and volatile customer spending.

Under the agreement, Verint shareholders will receive $20.50 per share in cash. The offer represents a premium of 4.2 per cent to the stock's closing price on June 30, before the talks were first reported, and implies an equity deal value of $1.23 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Shares of Verint — which provides an AI-powered platform to help enterprises organize, manage and improve customer interactions across various channels and digital operations — were down 1.2 per cent at $20.23.

The stock has lost 25 per cent of its value so far this year, pressured by strong competition and declining revenue in the past two quarters.

Still, some analysts expect Verint's focus on AI bots to result in higher demand as enterprise customers invest in automation and efficiency.

"We believe this was a strategic move for both entities as these organizations are closely aligned in terms of customer experience automation that leverages data and AI, with Thoma Bravo already heavily invested in this market," Wedbush analysts said in a note.

Thoma Bravo, which had about $184 billion in assets under management as of March 31, is among the largest software-focused investors globally. The private equity firm has acquired or invested in more than 530 software and technology companies.

Earlier this month, it had signed a $12 billion deal to acquire human resources software provider Dayforce.

The latest deal is expected to close before the end of Verint's current fiscal year.

[TITLE]Chip firms gear up for pilot rollout; first Made-in-India chip to come from CG Power:
[TEXT]
Sanand: India’s semiconductor ambitions are moving from paper to reality, with CG Semi—a Murugappa Group subsidiary—set to roll out the first Made-in-India chip by the end of the year. CG Semi, along with Micron, Tata Electronics, and Kaynes, is gearing up to launch chip prototypes out of pilot production lines this year, with commercial rollout starting next year.

“All the first four units that got approved are going to complete their pilot line within this year. Fab will take time,” IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in a media interaction on Thursday.

The announcement came during the launch of CG Semi’s pilot Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility in Sanand, Gujarat.

While full-scale fabrication facilities are still in development, pilot lines or small-scale production setups used to test chip batches are nearing completion.

The first chip coming out of CG Semi’s plant assumes significance as the company's project was approved for 50% capital support from the government in February 2024.

Micron, which received approval for a $2.75 billion project in June 2023, was expected to lead the rollout. Addressing delays, Vaishnaw said, “The Micron plant is very big. They have a large pilot line within their unit, which will get commissioned very soon.”

Under the ₹76,000 crore India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), 10 semiconductor projects have been approved with a total investment of ₹1.6 trillion so far, according to government data. Four projects—Micron, CG Semi, Tata Electronics chip assembly plant in Assam, and Kaynes OSAT plant—are being set up with an investment of ₹66,000 crore.

Micron, Kaynes and Tata Electronics could not be immediately reached for comments.

Pilot line push "Our OSAT facility in Sanand is almost there with proto (prototype) products for AOS (Alpha and Omega Semiconductors Ltd) and is on track to be fully operational for commercial production by December 2025," said Ramesh Kannan, MD Kaynes Technology India, during the Q1FY26 earnings call in July.

Kaynes is expected to start shipping chips commercially in the fourth quarter of the current financial year. The company's management said during the call that it has onboarded three clients for the chip assembly business so far.

Further, Tata Electronics is also setting up a chip fabrication plant in Gujarat's Dholera at an investment of ₹91,000 crore.

CG Semi is a subsidiary of CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd and part of the Murugappa Group. In collaboration with Renesas and Stars Microelectronics, CG Semi is investing over ₹7,600 crore over five years to develop two state-of-the-art chip facilities in Sanand, Gujarat. Under the Semiconductor Mission, the government provides 50% capital support to the companies, with additional fiscal support from the state government.

During the earnings call with analysts to discuss the April-June quarter, CG Power and Industrial Solutions’ management said its contribution to the total investment would be around ₹1,700 crore. So far, it has invested ₹400 crore and employed about 170 people.

“Industries must support each other and embrace domestically made chips. As India's demand grows, whether in consumer electronics, automobiles, or appliances, we must start moving towards making chips and using chips that are made here in India,” said Vellayan Subbiah, CG Power chairman.

India first According to Subbiah, China also followed the same concept of using locally made chips, wherein their industries supported their ecosystem. The company's mini-plant, which was launched on Thursday, will have a capacity of 0.5 million chip units per day. It will start commercial production by next year. Another facility of CG Power, which is under construction, is expected to be completed by the end of 2026, the company said.

Once operational, the facility will scale up to a capacity of about 14.5 million units per day. Together, the two facilities are projected to generate over 5,000 direct and indirect jobs in the coming years, CG Semi said.

[TITLE]India’s 1st pilot line for semiconductors becomes operational in Gujarat; CG Semi’s plant to roll out initial Make-in-India chip:
[TEXT]
India’s first pilot line that will handle end-to-end chip assembly, packaging, testing and post-test services, became operational at a newly built Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Testing (OSAT) facility of CG Semi Private Ltd at Sanand in Gujarat, Thursday. The micro-controllers produced here will be used in cars, fridges and drones.

The first Made-in-India semiconductor chip will now roll out from this facility said Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, while inaugurating the pilot line along with Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel. CG Semi Private Ltd is a joint venture between CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, Renesas Electronics America Inc, and Stars Microelectronics (Thailand) Public Co Ltd; all entities have proposed to invest ₹7,500 crore in the facility.

The company is setting up two manufacturing sites - G1 and G2 - at Sanand. The G1 facility inaugurated on Thursday with a 75,000 sq ft of built up area is equipped to handle end-to-end chip assembly, packaging, testing and post-test services for a peak capacity of 0.5 million units a day. The first facility is expected to begin commercial production in calender year 2026.

The second facility located 3 km away, will be spread on 10 lakh sq ft area and will have 14.5 million units per day capacity. The second facility is scheduled to become operational by end of calender year 2026. Together these two facilities will generate over 5,000 direct and indirect jobs. ”Today, a pilot line of CG Power is getting operational and very soon the first chip from this pilot line will be dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said Vaishnaw.

“The pilot line is very important, because, whatever production we do will be used for qualifying the products for customer approval. Once the chips are qualified, then, it will be easy for the start the commercial production of those qualified products. This is a major milestone in country’s semiconductor journey,” the minister added.

Vaishnaw said he also visited the under-construction semiconductor facilities of Micron Technologies and Kaynes Semicon in Sanand on Thursday. “Overall out of the 10 projects approved in the Semiconductor Mission, this is a dream getting fulfilled. For last three decades, we wanted this to happen in our country,” the Minister said while speaking

[TITLE]First Made in India semiconductor chip to roll out soon from Sanand's CG plant: Ashwini Vaishnaw:
[TEXT]
Union Minister for Information and Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw on Thursday inaugurated the advanced Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility of CG Semi Private Limited in Sanand, Gujarat.Vaishnaw also announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will "soon" dedicate the country's first chip produced at this facility."CG Power's pilot line was inaugurated here today, and very soon, the chip produced from this pilot line will be dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister," Vaishnaw said. CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd set up its semiconductor OSAT unit in Sanand in partnership with Renesas Electronics America Inc and Stars Microelectronics (Thailand) Public Co Ltd, with a total investment of approximately Rs 7,600 crore.Speaking at the inauguration event, Union Minister Vaishnaw said, "This is a major milestone in our country's semiconductor journey."About the progress in other chip plants, he said, "I also visited the nearby Micron's plant, and the construction is going on at a very good pace. The Kaynes plant and construction are going on at a very good pace. And few months ago I visited Dholera, there also the construction is going on with very good pace.""Overall, out of the 10 projects that we have approved in the semiconductor mission. Very happy to report to all that this is a dream getting fulfilled," the Union Minister said.Vaishnaw highlighted a key achievement of India's Semiconductor Mission, emphasising its focus on developing talent to meet a looming global workforce shortage in the semiconductor sector.Speaking about the initiative, Vaishnaw noted that while the mission's goals may seem ambitious, they are rooted in a clear global need as experts estimate a shortfall of nearly one million semiconductor professionals by 2032.To bridge this gap, India has partnered with approximately 270 universities, providing them with access to some of the world's most advanced chip design tools used by leading companies. These tools cover nearly every critical aspect of chip design, he added.Vaishnaw said that the impact is already visible, as in 2025 alone, students clocked approximately 1.2 million design hours using these tools. As a result, 17 institutions have successfully designed chips, which are now in the final stages of production.The CG Power's Project will benefit from 50% fiscal support on a pari-passu basis for the eligible CAPEX from India Semiconductor Mission , reflecting the commitment of the Government of India to strengthen India's position as a key player in the global semiconductor value chain.In January, a Fiscal Support Agreement (FSA) was signed by India Semiconductor Mission, CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd. and CG Semi Pvt Ltd, which highlights the government's commitment.The Programme for Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India was notified in December 2021 with a total outlay of Rs 76,000 crore under the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM).In June 2023, the government approved the first proposal for setting up the semiconductor unit in Sanand. In February 2024, three more semiconductor units were approved. Tata Electronics is setting up a semiconductor fab in Dholera, Gujarat and one semiconductor unit in Morigaon, Assam.Construction of all four semiconductor units is progressing at a rapid pace, and a robust semiconductor ecosystem is emerging near the units. These four units will bring an investment of almost Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The cumulative capacity of these units will be about seven crore chips per day.Earlier this month, the government approved four more semiconductor projects under the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), two in Odisha and one each in Andhra Pradesh and Punjab.These four approved proposals will set up semiconductor manufacturing facilities with a cumulative investment of around Rs 4,600 crore and are expected to generate a cumulative employment of 2034 skilled professionals, which would catalyse the electronic manufacturing ecosystem, resulting in the creation of many indirect jobs.With these four plants, the total approved projects under the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) reach 10, with cumulative investments of around Rs 1.60 lakh crore in 6 states.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document presents verifiable facts exposing the suppression of two life-saving, cost-reducing inventions—3D-Flow for high-energy physics, and 3D-CBS for early cancer detection. Although recognized as a scientific breakthrough at Fermilab in 1993 and in several international, public scientific reviews (see Sections 3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6.3, and 10), these inventions have never been funded, despite being unrefuted, but instead have been suppressed for more than three decades.

Meanwhile, billions in taxpayer funding continue to be allocated to less effective technologies that waste public resources on flawed systems (see Ref. [9]). In particular, CERN continues to waste billions of taxpayer euros despite well-documented inefficiencies and flaws (see Sections 9.1.1, 9.1.2).

Only transparency, accountability, and cooperation through open dialogue can save CERN from the misuse of trust, funds, and scientific authority (Sec. 11), resulting in the waste of billions, and the blocking of innovations in particle detection—thereby also blocking advances in cancer detection that could have already saved millions of lives. (Sec. 13.1).

The 3D-Flow invention filters valuable signals from radiation for two distinct applications. In particle physics, it detects new particles like the Higgs boson. In medical imaging, specifically with the 3D-CBS device, it detects signals from radiation associated with tumor markers. This allows for the cost-effective, early detection of diseases like cancer, ultimately saving lives. (Secs. 1.2, 2).

The central issue is the continued, decades-long funding of CERN’s FPGA-based approach, which has proven to be incapable of efficiently filtering 1.2 billion events per second from the LHC’s radiation. The 3D-Flow breakthrough invention has been officially recognized as solving this problem, and yet its inventor continues to be excluded from a public dialogue with CERN’s FPGA-based Level-1 Trigger designers (Secs. 6.4.4, 9, 14.1.2).

The escalation of CERN’s multiple flawed FPGA systems—which have already wasted over €4 billion in decades (Sec. 8)—has culminated in CERN’s reliance on a massive 20-trillion-transistor, ~650 kW FPGA Trigger system planned for the next ten years, 2026–2036, to filter valuable data from radiation arriving at 8-billion events per second from the HL-LHC. It was approved by the CERN Council on 20 June 2025 [9], alongside other ATLAS and CMS upgrades. This Level-1 Trigger system is limited to executing approximately 66 operations on each dataset arriving every 25 nanoseconds making it also destined to fail. The result will be a projected waste of over €12 billion in the next decade (Sec. 9.1.3).

By contrast, Crosetto’s 3D-Flow system operates at ~6 kW and performs over 8,000 operations per dataset offering a vastly more efficient and powerful alternative (Secs. 6.3, 7, 10, 14.1.7, 17.2).

Twenty-five years after the invention of the 3D-CBS, the necessary resources should be provided to the inventor to experimentally test his inventions, which can save billions in physics experiments, enable the discovery of new particles, with the potential to halve premature cancer deaths—saving millions of lives and billions of euros by significantly reducing the global financial burden of cancer care (Secs. 10, 11.1, 12, 17.2).

The path forward requires more than just funding; it demands a recommitment to core principles of scientific integrity: honesty, the humility to accept experimental failure, and an openness for dialogue and cooperation to understand and respect nature’s laws (Secs. 6.4, 13.3, 17.2).

Humility includes learning from errors (Sec. 6.8), comparing the FPGA approach with the 3D-Flow solution that has existed for 32 years, and cooperating to implement the higher performing and most cost-effective solution. It also requires accepting the undisputed failures highlighted by Crosetto during his two-hour, 102-slide presentation [13] granted by the Chairs of the 2024 IEEE-NSS-MIC-RTSD conference attended by 1,300 scientists, with video and slides made available on the IEEE website without being challenged. (Sec. 14.1.6)

However, the transparency implemented by IEEE in 2024 should not have been reversed on 14 April 2025, when IEEE denied Crosetto the right to share his 82-page article [25] from preprint, followed by the suppression of his two 2-page articles [2], [3] submitted to the 2025 IEEE-NSS-MIC-RTSD Conference detailing mistakes made and the remedies. (Secs. 9.1.2, 14.1.7).

IEEE continued to approve articles on FPGA-Based Level-1 Triggers, while CERN Council ignored their flaws. On 20 June 2025 [9], the Council approved the CMS and ATLAS upgrades—relying on an FPGA-Based Level-1 Trigger system almost completely built for 2026–2036—a decision that will waste over $12 billion in the next decade.

There needs to be an open, public dialogue between the 3D-Flow and 3D-CBS inventor and all relevant institutions—CERN and IEEE taking a leading role—to ensure a transparent, reliable, and ethical approach to uncovering the scientific truth for the benefit of humanity. Such a collaborative, truth-seeking process will not only benefit patients and taxpayers but will also restore public trust in the institutions and individuals dedicated to advancing science for the good of humanity. (Secs. 13.3, 14.1.7, 17.2, 17.3).

By unlocking these medical applications, we can save countless lives, significantly reduce the global financial burden of cancer care, and ensure fewer families lose loved ones too soon (Secs. 2, 3, 6.6.2, 12, 13.3, 14.1.3, 14.1.5).

Key Facts

Scientific Breakthrough Suppressed: In 1993, a major public scientific review at Fermilab declared Crosetto’s 3D-Flow invention a breakthrough [10], yet anonymous reviewers and influential scientists have consistently suppressed it (Secs. 6.4, 6.5).

In 1993, a major public scientific review at Fermilab declared Crosetto’s 3D-Flow invention a breakthrough [10], yet anonymous reviewers and influential scientists have consistently suppressed it (Secs. 6.4, 6.5). Performance Advantage: The 3D-Flow, capable of over 8,000 operations per dataset while using ~6 kW, can efficiently detect new particles and cancer, unlike CERN’s ~650 kW FPGA systems limited to ~66 operations, which cannot detect particles efficiently (Sec. 7.3.6).

Solution

Hold a public scientific comparison between CERN’s current system and Crosetto’s 3D-Flow system. This will introduce transparency and accountability, and enable an objective evaluation based on merit, power consumption, and operational capacity. Implementing this solution would not only save billions in misallocated taxpayer funds but also unlock the potential of 3D-Flow for broader applications, including 3D-CBS—accelerating the development of life-saving innovations for cancer patients.

Call to Action

Freeze current and future funding for CERN’s FPGA-based Level-1 Triggers for CMS and ATLAS upgrades, approved by the CERN Council on 20 June 2025 [9], until a public scientific comparison is held (Secs. 11, 13.1). Fund Italian-American scientist Dario Crosetto, the inventor of the 3D-CBS, to build 2 prototypes with less than 0.00000067 of the $30 trillion already spent on global R&D since his inventions (Secs. 16, 17.2.b, 17.3.b). Share this appeal with media, institutions, and elected representatives (Sec. 17.c). Contact officials responsible for cancer research, transparency, and stewardship of taxpayer funds (Sec. 17.3.a). Donate to support transparency, scientific integrity, and the implementation of open, public scientific procedures to let the scientific truth emerge for the benefit of humanity: https://crosettofoundation.org/donate-now/ (Sec. 17.b).

[TITLE]Another artificial intelligence deal collapses — as Colorado lawmakers’ budget fixes near finish line:
[TEXT]
Colorado’s first-in-the-nation regulations on artificial intelligence may have to wait longer if the legislature approves a proposal advanced by the state Senate on Monday.

In a dramatic shift from Sunday night, when a deal on revamped regulations appeared within reach, Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez gutted the bill. The measure, proposed during a mostly budget-focused special session, had been aimed at regulating AI and increasing transparency around its use to make decisions affecting Coloradans.

Instead, the bill as amended would simply delay, by several months, the implementation of a law passed 2024 that is supposed to go into effect next February.

Under Rodriguez’s proposal, which still needs to pass the state House, those regulations would take effect at the end of June — giving the tech industry, lawmakers, and public-interest and consumer-protection groups another chance during the next regular session to nail down how to regulate the growing, affluent industry. The regular session convenes in mid-January.

“Overnight, the tech industry decided that they were so unhappy with the compromise that had been achieved by consumer-protection organizations, educators, labor and business that they would rather return to the (existing rules),” said Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and driving figure on AI regulations in the state.

The legislature met for its latest special session chiefly to address a $783 million budget deficit brought on by tax cuts and spending changes made by the federal government in July. But the AI regulations, which drew the ire of an industry that argues they are unworkable, was also specifically designated for new consideration in Gov. Jared Polis’ recall of the legislature this month.

Most budget-related bills finished

By the end of the fifth day of the session on Monday, the Democratic majority had sent to Polis the bulk of the bills they hoped would bite into the deficit. The single biggest revenue-raising measure, however, still needed at least two more votes.

The bills that have passed the legislature are:

House Bill 1001, which makes permanent a limit on certain business income deductions for people making more than $500,000 per year.

House Bill 1002, which cracks down on the use of foreign tax havens and adds several countries to that label.

House Bill 1003, which ends a tax incentive for insurance companies that keep offices in the state.

House Bill 1005, which ends a state subsidy to businesses for collecting sales taxes.

In total, those measures are expected to raise about $150 million. The fifth measure, House Bill 1004, would allow certain entities to sell tax credits that can be reclaimed at a discount in future tax years. Lawmakers expect that to bring in another $100 million, for a total of just over $250 million.

"Right now, we need to ensure that the families and the small businesses that truly need our help are getting it," said Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Jefferson County Democrat.

The revenue-raisers amount to nearly a third of the total $783 million budget gap. Polis' staff is preparing to address as much as a third of the gap through spending cuts. His office is expected to reveal its planned reductions later this week, after the revenue part has been adopted.

The rest of the hole will be filled from the legislature's piggy bank. That'll happen last: Whatever's not raised or cut will be pulled from the state's reserves. The governor's office has suggested roughly $320 million, which would reduce the current reserve level -- about 15% of the general fund budget -- by 2 percentage points.

That would mean his office was planning to propose about $200 million in spending reductions.

Liability at issue on AI

On the AI front, Rodriguez’s bill was sent Monday over to the House, where members have already debated a competing AI measure -- one that had also been watered down to simply delaying the 2024 regulations, in that case until October 2026. The House planned to take up Rodriguez's bill in committee and potentially for an initial floor vote Monday night, which would make a final vote possible Tuesday.

How to assign liability for bias apparent in the use of AI to make decisions -- between entities that use AI for things like screening job and rental applications and the entities that developed the AI tools -- was a key part of Rodriguez's measure before its gutting.

But that has been a key sticking point between the dueling bills.

“A delay is the prudent thing to do,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat and sponsor of the House bill, said. “We need to figure out a way where school districts, hospitals and other deployers aren’t left holding the bag for these regulations. We need to ensure that all stakeholders involved in this legislation are held equally accountable when bad things happen.”
