[TITLE]EU moves to choke off Russia’s energy cash flow with sanctions on ‘shadow fleet’ and LNG sanctions:
[TEXT]
The European Union has agreed on a new raft of sanctions against Russia targeting its shadow fleet of oil tankers and banning its imports of liquefied natural gas, the Danish EU presidency announced Thursday.

“Today is a good day for Europe and Ukraine,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a statement, as EU leaders were gathering for a summit in Brussels.

He said that the new sanctions “will introduce new and comprehensive measures on oil and gas, the shadow fleet and Russia’s financial sector.” A new system for limiting the movement of Russian diplomats within the 27-nation EU will also be introduced.

The move comes a day after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration announced new sanctions against Russia’s oil industry that are aimed at moving Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and ending Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

Energy revenue is the linchpin of Russia’s economy, allowing Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.

The new EU measures took almost a month to decide. The 27-nation bloc has already slapped 18 packages of sanctions against Russia over the war, but getting final agreement on who and what to target can take weeks.

The sanctions agreement was sealed at a Thursday morning meeting of EU ambassadors, just a few hours before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joins his European counterparts for the one-day summit, as they press for a ceasefire to halt almost four years of fighting.

The summit comes after Trump said that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.” It was yet another twist in Trump’s stop-and-go effort to end the war.

The leaders are also eager for any progress on Trump’s Gaza peace plan, and will debate ways to keep the 27-nation bloc involved in proceedings.

The EU is the world’s biggest provider of aid to Palestinians but has little leverage over Israel – in part because European nations are divided over how to handle the conflict – and it has struggled to play a role of consequence.

It’s role in the war in Ukraine is clearer, and the summit takes place as Russian armed forces strike at the conflict-torn country’s power grid just as the weather starts to turn colder.

Earlier this week, Ukraine’s strongest European backers who form part of the “coalition of the willing” said they opposed any push to make Ukraine surrender land captured by Russian forces in return for peace, as Trump most recently has suggested.

The U.K. will host a meeting of the members of that coalition of more than 30 countries on Friday.

On the EU side, leaders intend to push forward with plans to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine’s war efforts, despite some misgivings about the consequences of such a step.

The biggest tranche of frozen assets – some $225 billion worth – are held in Belgium, and the Belgian government has been reluctant to take any risks on using the money without firm guarantees from its European partners.

Ukraine’s budget and military needs for 2026 and 2027 are estimated to total around $153 billion.

The EU leaders are also likely to sign off on a new “road map” to prepare Europe to defend itself against a Russian attack by the end of the decade. Top officials believe that Russian could be ready to take aim at another European country within 3-5 years.

[TITLE]Full ban on Russian gas imports on the table at EU Energy Ministers’ meeting:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 20 08:26

The European Union’s initiative to fully ban the import of gas and oil from Russia, as part of its sanctions over the war in Ukraine, is expected to move to the next stage today, as the bloc’s 27 Energy Ministers are set to adopt the measure.

Meeting in Luxembourg, the ministers aim to forge a common position on the total ban before the decision is finalized in negotiations with the European Parliament.

Members of the European Parliament already voted in favor of the proposal last week, paving the way for talks with the member state capitals.

According to the plan, imports of oil, pipeline natural gas, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be entirely and permanently prohibited by 2028 at the latest.

The ban, once agreed upon in talks with the European Parliament, will be adopted by simple majority vote — meaning countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, which still import Russian gas through pipelines, will not be able to veto it.

It is not ruled out that the measure could be implemented sooner, as efforts are underway to impose a ban on Russian gas imports under the upcoming package of sanctions against Moscow.

As of 2024, Russia still accounted for roughly one-fifth of all gas imports into the EU, with an even higher share in natural gas specifically. In the first half of 2025, EU member states imported Russian gas worth nearly €4.5 billion.

The sanctions can be formally adopted once all 27 member states agree — without the involvement of the European Parliament — allowing the process to move faster.

The punitive measures are described as temporary and can be lifted once the war in Ukraine ends and Brussels no longer sees any justification for maintaining them.

At the same time, the EU’s Foreign Ministers, also meeting today in Luxembourg, will discuss developments in the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is expected to join part of their session.

The Council will also discuss a proposal to use frozen Russian assets to finance a loan aimed at providing war reparations to Ukraine, as well as the EU’s 19th package of sanctions against Russia.

The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip will also be on the agenda. Although the EU has so far been sidelined in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, European officials emphasize that the Union intends to play an active role in efforts to restore stability in the Middle East.

[TITLE]Soaring Cocaine Shipments Weigh On U.S.-Colombia Alliance:
[TEXT]
The surge in cocaine output is attributed to the end of aerial glyphosate spraying and a reduction in manual eradication efforts, leading to a dramatic increase in coca bush cultivation.

Record-breaking cocaine production in Colombia is causing significant tension with the United States, with former President Trump accusing President Petro of colluding with drug traffickers and threatening to end US aid.

In an inflammatory social media post, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Colombia’s first-ever leftwing President Gustavo Petro of colluding with drug traffickers, calling him “an illegal drug leader”. Trump, in an increasingly hardline stance, called for the cessation of U.S. aid and imposition of further steep tariffs on Colombia. He even went as far as threatening military strikes if narcotics trafficking does not end. This is testing the historically close alliance between the United States and Colombia, which is Latin America’s largest recipient of U.S. financial aid.

The latest spat comes after Trump decertified Colombia as a counternarcotics partner in September 2025, stating the country had “failed demonstrably” in its obligations to fight drug trafficking. Colombia’s rapidly growing cocaine output, which set a new annual record for the past ten years, is straining what was once a close-knit relationship between the White House and the Casa Nariño, Colombia’s presidential residence. By the mid-1990s, Colombia had overtaken Peru and Bolivia to become the world’s leading cocaine producer. As a result, the strife-torn country now supplies close to 70% of all cocaine consumed globally.

United Nations data shows Colombia’s 2023 cocaine output surged by a massive 53% year over year to an all-time high of 2,664 metric tons. This is a whopping nine times greater than the 290 metric tons manufactured a decade earlier and almost 30 times more cocaine than Colombia produced in 1993, the year notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was shot down on a Medellin rooftop. Cultivation of the coca bush, whose leaves contain the alkaloid needed to produce cocaine, climbed to a record 253,000 hectares (625,176 acres) during 2023. This figure is 10% higher than a year earlier and five times the 48,000 hectares (118,610 acres) recorded for 2013.

The sharp surge in the amount of land used to grow the alkaloid-rich coca bush began when then-President Juan Manuel Santos ended the aerial spraying of glyphosate for illicit crop eradication in May 2015. He made the controversial decision because a 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) report indicated that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic. Studies also link the herbicide to birth defects, Alzheimer-type diseases, and immunological disorders.

Herbicidal drift was another long-standing issue with glyphosate aerial spraying, particularly because the herbicide persisted in the environment for up to 72 hours after application. When spraying coca fields, herbicide droplets would drift well beyond the target zone, destroying legitimate crops, damaging the jungle canopy, and contaminating water bodies. This was particularly problematic with the U.S. contractors charged with spraying glyphosate, showing little regard for the herbicide’s impact on local communities and the environment.

Another contributing factor to the rising volume of coca being grown in Colombia was Petro’s decision to reduce efforts to manually eradicate illicit crops significantly. Forced eradication, even after aerial coca fumigation ended, long formed the backbone of Bogota’s counternarcotics strategy aimed at suppressing cocaine production. During 2023, only 20,325 hectares (50,224 acres) of coca had been manually eradicated, a third of the 68,974 hectares (172,910 acres) destroyed a year earlier and a fifth of the 103,257 hectares (255,154 acres) removed during 2021.

Instead, Colombia’s president shifted strategy to pursue illegal armed groups, their leaders and finances rather than the poor peasants who maintain a subsistence living from growing coca. That plan resulted in a significant increase in narcotics seizures. For 2023, Colombian authorities seized 739,557 kilograms of cocaine, the highest volume ever. This represented a 12% year-over-year increase and was 5 times the 147,464 kilograms seized a decade earlier.

While that is an impressive quantity of cocaine that was removed from global supply, it doesn’t tell the full story. You see, since 2012, when authorities interdicted 61% of all cocaine produced in Colombia, the quantity seized relative to total production has fallen substantially, as the chart below shows.

Source: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime

The 739 metric tons seized by Colombian authorities during 2023 represent a mere 28% of all cocaine produced that year. This is the lowest amount relative to the volume of cocaine produced since 2007, when authorities intercepted 161 metric tons or 27% of that year's total output. This data suggests the total volume of cocaine exported from Colombia to principal consumer markets, the U.S. and Western Europe, is increasing. In that context, the White House's elevated level of frustration is easier to understand.

Soaring cocaine output sparked considerable speculation over whether the narcotic is a major contributor to Colombia’s economy. An academic paper valued 2023 cocaine production at $15.3 billion, making the illicit trade responsible for 4.2% of Colombia’s gross domestic product (GDP), which is significantly more than the 2.7% generated by petroleum, the Andean country’s largest export. This estimated $15.3 billion is nearly as much as the $15.8 billion earned by crude oil exports, making the narcotic Colombia’s second most valuable export during 2023, underscoring cocaine’s considerable economic clout.

The latest events couldn’t come at a worse time for a cash-strapped Petro administration. Trump’s decision to halt all financial aid to Colombia, totaling $232 billion for 2025, has removed a vital financial lifeline at a time when fiscal revenue is plummeting. The notable decline in fiscal revenue is exacerbated by significantly weaker production of Colombia’s main legal export, petroleum. Not only is Colombia’s crude oil production locked in a seemingly never-ending death spiral, negatively affecting a key source of fiscal income, but this problem is compounded by weaker oil prices and foreign energy companies slashing investment.

For these reasons, the Petro administration is facing a potentially debilitating financial crisis. Plummeting tax revenue and expenditures soaring to unsustainable levels, driven by the need to bolster security spending to counter growing lawlessness, are responsible for the fiscal deficit ballooning. For the first eight months of 2025, Colombia’s budgetary shortfall amounted to 5.1% of GDP, with economists, before accounting for the loss of U.S. aid, anticipating it will balloon to 8% by the end of 2025.

The loss of U.S. aid is a tremendous blow for Bogota. For decades, Colombia has benefited from Washington’s largesse, receiving $6.8 billion over the last decade. This not only makes Colombia the largest recipient of U.S. aid in Latin America, but also makes it an important financial lifeline for the strife-torn country. This places greater pressure on already severely stretched finances, with the government unable to fund any sustained budget shortfall. This will only worsen if Trump hikes tariffs on imports from Colombia. The U.S. is the country’s largest trade partner, receiving over $14 billion, or 29%, of Colombia’s exports during 2024.

[TITLE]The Race to Recycle Renewable Energy:
[TEXT]
With the renewable energy sector growing rapidly on a global scale, as many governments pursue a green transition, the need to recycle more components has become evident. Finding innovative ways to recycle renewable energy equipment could help significantly cut costs and reduce waste, further supporting the sector’s green ambitions. There is great potential for a range of components to be reused and recycled, from solar panels to wind turbines and electric vehicle (EV) batteries. However, greater research and investment must be contributed to the sector to improve practices and make recycling options more accessible. As interest and investment in renewable energy increase, we are seeing more technological advancements across the sector. Wind turbines have become bigger and more powerful, while solar panels have been getting cheaper and more efficient. This means that old technologies are becoming outdated more quickly, leading to their replacement. Once a renewable energy component reaches the end of its lifecycle, it is normally removed and replaced by something bigger, stronger, and better. What is done with these old components varies massively from country to country.

Often, old turbine blades or photovoltaic (PV) panels are stockpiled for long periods of time as companies decide what to do with them. Waste from the renewable energy sector is significant, with Europe expected to dismantle around 14,000 wind turbines by the end of the decade. This would result in between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of blade waste, according to WindEurope. Meanwhile, in the United States, wind turbine blade waste could reach anywhere between 200,000 to 370,000 tonnes a year by 2050.

Greater innovation in recycling could help reduce waste and cut costs by putting old components to good use. However, recycling old renewable energy parts is not always so simple. Steel and other materials that can be easily recycled account for around 85 to 90 percent of the makeup of a wind turbine, but the glass fibre or carbon fibre blades are much more complicated to recycle. The difficulties in recycling have not put operators off, with more innovative solutions being seen year on year. In a bid to become more sustainable, after years of discarding old blades and other components, several wind firms have pledged to invest in recycling operations to prevent old components from going to landfill.

In Scotland, old blades from the Hagshaw Hill windfarm are being recycled to provide a hybrid polymer to be used to produce precast concrete alternatives or replace virgin plastics. Meanwhile, Spanish energy firm Iberdrola aims to transform 10,000 tonnes of blade waste annually at its blade recycling facility on the Iberian Peninsula. It will use glass fibres and resins from the turbines to produce new blades to be used across a range of sectors, from aerospace to construction.

Related: Spain’s Clean Energy Dilemma

In the solar energy sector, various innovations are being seen. For example, in Brisbane, Australia, solar panels are being transformed into silver and copper. Operators are removing aluminium and wires from PVs that can no longer produce energy to grind them up into plastic, glass, silicon, silver, and copper. Pan Pacific Recycling is now processing around 30,000 panels a year and hopes to eventually increase its annual capacity to 240,000 panels.

Global solar panel waste is currently far higher than the recycling capacity for this waste, meaning that greater investment is needed in the sector to expand capacity and improve sustainability by preventing old solar panels from going to landfill. In addition, experts suggest that many of the solar panels being replaced with more efficient models are still capable of producing energy and could be reused in a different context rather than discarded. Several startups, such as Australian Second Life Solar, are working to encourage the reuse of old solar panels in alternative settings to provide clean energy and prevent unnecessary waste.

Some of the greatest advancements have been seen in EV battery recycling, as companies worldwide strive to improve their critical mineral supply chains. The lithium supply used for EV battery production is finite, meaning that once supplies are depleted, we will no longer be able to produce this type of battery. However, extracting the lithium from old EV batteries could allow EV makers to reuse the critical mineral, rather than relying wholly on mining projects for their lithium supply. Other minerals that can be extracted from these batteries include nickel, cobalt, and graphite.

Various companies from different regions of the world are now investing in expanding and improving recycling practices, although the industry’s recycling capacity still falls far behind the production of new wind turbine blades and solar panels, suggesting that greater funding is needed to accelerate the global component recycling capacity. In addition, governments could encourage companies to invest in recycling activities by introducing stricter rules and regulations on renewable energy waste, thereby helping the industry to become more sustainable.

[TITLE]This is India’s strategy in the face of Trump’s Russia sanctions:
[TEXT]
New Delhi signals quiet defiance of US attempts to dictate its oil and trade policies.

It is just as well that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to skip going to the two-day East Asian leaders’ summit in Kuala Lumpur from October 26 to 28. Modi settling for virtual attendance at the ASEAN summit is being seen as his way of averting a face-to-face bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump.

As speculated, had an in-person meeting between the two happened, Trump’s two-faced pressure on India to halt import of Russian oil would have become three-faced.

In his current tactics of harm-and-charm, on the one hand, Trump publicly warns India against importing oil from Russia and threatens even higher tariffs; on the other hand, he tweets flattering messages to Modi saying he’s a good friend and great leader and telephones to greet him on occasions such as his birthday and the Diwali festival.

Modi plays along when it comes to Trump’s messages and calls to charm him. Modi’s verbal response may be effusive, but his actions show that he does not expect these pleasantries to make the US retreat from inflicting harm on India by way of tariffs. The only way the latter can happen is if Modi refuses to buckle under Trump’s pressure as he appears to be doing, by not meeting Trump in-person.

The official reason advanced for Modi staying away from this important forum is Deepavali (or Diwali) festivities. However, there are few takers for this explanation. Observers point out that Modi had also kept away from the summit on Gaza in Egypt, evidently to avoid being cornered by Trump. He has deputed External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to represent India at the East Asia Summit whereas he sent a junior minister to Egypt.

Modi is said to be miffed with Trump for claiming more than 50 times in recent months that he had mediated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a short but fierce military standoff between the two Asian neighbors in May this year. This has been repeatedly denied by New Delhi. Worse, Trump has claimed at least five times that Modi assured him of stopping oil purchases from Russia.

Trump’s assertions of Modi’s promise on this move, under threat of raising tariffs further, has been followed by sanctions on Russian oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil. This year, at least 34% of India’s crude requirement has been imported from Moscow and these two Russian oil giants account for 60% of the supplies. In addition to the reciprocal tariff of 25% already in place since July 30, the US slapped another 25% secondary tariff on India for buying Russian oil.

The sanctions will force Reliance Industries, India’s biggest buyer of Russian oil, to reduce imports; and public sector oil companies such as Indian Oil may be ‘advised’ to follow suit though they have no direct arrangements with Rosneft and Lukoil. For now, they may continue buying from intermediaries. Another company to suffer a body blow from the US sanctions is Nayara Energy, one of India’s largest refineries, in which Rosneft holds a 49.13% ownership share.

The sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil mean that any entity, US or foreign, dealing with these companies runs the risk of massive penalties. Reports are that Reliance Industries, which is estimated to have purchased $35 million worth of oil since the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine in 2022, will have to start reducing imports gradually and possibly stop all imports from Russia by November 21. In its statement on Friday, the company said it is reviewing the impact of Western sanctions on its Russian suppliers and will adjust operations accordingly while maintaining domestic energy security.

Reliance will be hit very hard although a large proportion of the crude, imported at discounted prices and refined by it (into petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel) was exported to the US and Europe at good profit. The company, which has a 25-year agreement with Rosneft to buy 25 million tons of crude per year, is reported to have imported nearly 50% of the 1.8 million barrels supplied daily to India. The absence of discounted crude from Russia could mean a loss of $5 to $6 billion per year, according to a former foreign secretary. Trump had described the move as a “gradual process” and said India would bring Russian oil imports “down to almost nothing” by year-end.

Reports are that in the wake of US-imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, China’s big state-owned oil companies are suspending purchases of “seaborne Russian oil”.

Trump’s attempts to squeeze India and China in a big way to gradually reduce and end oil imports from Russia is to beat Moscow into submission and make it comply with his diktat for a deal with Ukraine. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to yield any ground under mounting pressure from the US, and Europe. Putin made it clear this week that “no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decide anything under pressure.”

Such a position should hold good for India as well. However, New Delhi does not have the economic and military heft of China and Russia to withstand US pressures beyond a certain point. Putin slammed sanctions on the big two Russian oil companies as an “unfriendly act” and admitted that it “will have some consequences.” But, he said, “they won’t greatly affect our economic stability.” The same cannot be said about the impact of sanctions on the Indian economy.

New Delhi has pointed out more than once that energy security is critical and India’s imports from Russia are dictated by its national interest in ensuring stable prices and secure energy supplies. The government called Trump’s tariffs as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.” The friction caused by tariffs has stalled progress on a trade agreement between India and the US although talks continue at various levels.

Some of these conversations seem to be pulling India deeper into a situation where New Delhi may find it hard to push back against the tremendous pressure being exerted by the US. This is evident, first and foremost, in India agreeing to cut Russian oil imports, although there is no official word of this being done to comply with Trump’s demand; and asking public sector oil companies to source more crude from the US. Second, India has reportedly agreed to open its agriculture sector to US produce, which the government had been unwilling to do as higher farm imports could hurt India’s farmers.

These developments relating to the two critical sectors of energy and agriculture are being attributed to the recent visit of Trump’s new special envoy Sergio Gor to India. Gor’s visit appears to have melted New Delhi’s resistance to stay the course with Russian oil imports and not open the agriculture sector to US produce. Gor was in India for five days from October 10 to 15. On October 11, he met with Modi, Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri. Rare is the diplomat who has scored such high-level intensive discussions with four top figures in government in a single day. In fact, ambassadors have to wait weeks, if not months at times, to present their credentials after being posted to Delhi.

Whereas Gor, as of now, is ambassador-designate to India and scheduled to assume office only in the New Year. He has a larger role as Trump’s Special Envoy for South and Central Asia and that mandates him to engage with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian states.

Gor is not a career diplomat. He served as Trump’s campaign strategist. His appointment, the royal reception he received in New Delhi and the upbeat mood with gung-ho remarks by both sides show that Trump means business when he wants India to abide by his terms whether on energy or agriculture. It might be a case of diplomacy leveraging transactional deals for an India-US geopolitical alignment with implications for regional security. Gor’s meeting with India’s commerce secretary suggests that, after scoring on energy and agriculture, his next target may be to wrap up a bilateral trade deal in November.

Washington is gradually and inexorably lowering the boom on Russia, India, and China. This could have unforeseen effects on India’s foreign policy, its relationship with Washington, Moscow, and Beijing, and its role in multilateral forums such as SCO and BRICS besides a troubled neighborhood where the US is a major player. That is, if Trump continues to call the shots.

[TITLE]Climate Change Weekly # 560—Study: Net Zero Wind and Solar Buildout Needs Huge Amount of Land:
[TEXT]
From THE HEARTLAND INSTITUTE

By Heartland Admin

IN THIS ISSUE:

Study: Net Zero Wind and Solar Buildout Needs Huge Amount of Land

Uncovered Ski Lifts Show Rapid Climate Change in Recent Past

Climate Lawfare Sidelined in Montana

Study: Net Zero Wind and Solar Buildout Needs Huge Amount of Land

New research published in the journal Nature confirms what The Heartland Institute and our allies in the free-market environmental community have long argued: wind and solar power have low power density and thus impose huge environmental footprints. The new study acknowledges the environmental footprint of wind and solar is even larger than industry promoters have admitted. As a result, to reach net zero with wind and solar as the primary sources of electric power will require the transformation of a large swath of agricultural land and wildlands into industrial power sites.

The report from researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state found a high-renewable scenario will require a lot more land, much of it on or near undeveloped or wild areas, than a plan for less wind and solar incorporation into the grid. They write,

Expanding United States electricity infrastructure to meet growing demand could require extensive power plant development footprints and land use conversion, depending on the mix of generation types chosen. Understanding where future power plant sitings are likely to take place and identifying potential conflicts and land-use tradeoffs will be key to identifying feasible and affordable investments and evaluating regional planning coordination needs. Here we use an integrated modeling framework that combines capacity expansion planning, hourly grid operations, and geospatial techno-economic analysis to develop projections (2025-2050) of power plant sitings in the Western United States (US) . . . for a business-as-usual scenario and a high renewables penetration scenario. We find that 30% more land will be needed in the high renewables scenario as compared to business-as-usual, and that 75% of that development is projected to be located within 10 km of natural areas.

It is important to note that even the “business as usual” capacity expansion scenario assumes wind and solar power will be the dominant new sources generating electric power in the United States.

“Results from the capacity expansion analysis show that approximately 85% of new power capacity deployed in the Western US by 2050, under either a high renewables or business-as-usual scenario, will consist of solar photovoltaics (PV) and onshore wind,” says the study.

This analysis seemingly ignores the fact that the Trump administration is rapidly cancelling wind and solar projects and funding for associated infrastructure and technologies while pushing new nuclear and natural gas and keeping existing coal operational. The researchers’ entire analysis seems to assume the trend that began under Obama and expanded under Biden will continue in the future, regardless of current policies and the preferences of Trump’s successors as president. Presidential administrations after Trump might continue or expand on his efforts rather than going back to the energy policies under the net zero goals of previous democratic administrations.

Those questionable assumptions aside, and after accounting for assumed existing and modeled environmental and development exclusions, the study found under the business-as-usual scenario (which I would consider an exceedingly high, unjustified expansion of wind and solar power) new wind and solar will require more than 23,333 square kilometers (km2) of land, more than 9,010 square miles. And that’s the low-penetration, business-as-usual case. The high wind and solar scenario will require an additional 7,000 km2, or 2,703 square miles of land. And to be clear, this does not include the indirect land footprints of mining for rare earth elements and critical minerals needed for wind and solar, spacing between panels, or the land needed for the expanded transmission grid. In addition, this analysis just covers expansion in the western United States, where sunlight and wind in some areas are more favorable for wind and solar development than elsewhere in the country, where electricity demand is also growing.

The footprint of the anticipated growth in wind and solar facilities alone is greater than the size of New Jersey and close to the size of Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island combined.

Other analyses suggest the land footprint of wind and solar to meet net zero goals is even larger. A June 2025 report from the Center of the American Experiment found the low energy density (the amount of energy produced by volume or mass, in this case land space required to produce a megawatt of power) means that,

wind turbines and solar panels need at least 10 times as much land per unit of power produced as coal- or natural gas-fired power plants. To generate the same amount of electricity as a 1 GW nuclear plant, which occupies approximately 1.3 square miles, one would need between 45 and 75 square miles of solar panels or between 260 and 3,360 square miles of wind turbines. The latter is larger than the combined areas of Delaware and Rhode Island. If the U.S. relied entirely on wind turbines for electricity, it would need

[TITLE]Carney’s Nuclear Detour: Darlington’s SMRs Will Raise Prices, Emissions, & Political Risks:
[TEXT]
In October 2025, the federal government officially designated the four-unit SMR build at Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington site as a “Major Project” and invested $2 billion through the Canada Growth Fund, alongside $1 billion from the provincial Building Ontario Fund, signalling that the federal government views the SMR programme both as a national-industrial priority and a pillar of Canada’s clean-power strategy. This upfront funding and symbolic anointment embed the SMR scheme at the core of Prime Minister Carney’s climate-industrial agenda—tying his legacy to its success and subjecting his broader ambitions to the reactor’s performance.

Ontario once led the world in nuclear engineering. The province built its grid around CANDU reactors designed, manufactured, and operated by Canadians. Those heavy-water machines provided decades of reliable electricity and created thousands of high-skill jobs. They also anchored a domestic supply chain that made Canada one of the few countries with full nuclear sovereignty. Now, as the world turns toward flexible, low-cost renewables, Ontario is making a different bet. With Mark Carney’s backing and the provincial government’s enthusiasm, it is building the first GE Hitachi small modular reactor at Darlington. It is a decision that will look visionary to some today, but in a decade it will look like a strategic error.

Carney’s ambition to build a clean, secure industrial future for Canada is genuine. His economic credibility and climate focus give him the moral authority to act. But in aligning himself with an American-owned, first-of-a-kind reactor technology, he has made a choice that will come back to haunt him. The project promises jobs, energy security, and innovation, but it delivers higher costs, greater complexity, and new dependencies. The evidence is already clear. Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington site is the province’s largest single employer, and the refurbishment program for the existing reactors is providing steady, high-paying work. The new SMRs are not needed to sustain that prosperity. What they will bring is financial exposure and an energy mix less aligned with what Ontario actually needs.

Darlington alone employs roughly 15,000 people directly and indirectly in a region with only 70,000 workers. Those jobs are secure for decades through ongoing refurbishment and operations, with the current CANDU reactors expected to be extended to 2065, an unprecedented 80+ years. Average wages are among the highest in the province. It is by far the largest and best paying employer around. Adding four small modular reactors does not create a new employment base. It diverts billions of dollars toward a first-of-a-kind nuclear experiment that will be built by foreign technology vendors and managed under unfamiliar regulatory frameworks. For the region, this is not an economic development project. It is an engineering gamble wrapped in the rhetoric of innovation.

The GE Hitachi BWRX-300 is a light-water boiling reactor that bears little resemblance to the CANDU systems Ontario’s nuclear workforce knows intimately. It requires enriched uranium, not natural fuel. It has a fixed refuelling cycle, not continuous on-power refuelling. It depends on U.S. supply chains for core components and fuel assemblies. Ontario’s nuclear professionals, from control-room operators to maintenance crews, have spent their careers mastering CANDU systems. They will have to relearn an entirely different technology under a regulatory regime still being defined. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has no operating precedent for this design, and its licensing process must be harmonized with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The result is a project that combines first-of-a-kind technical risk with first-of-its-kind regulatory uncertainty.

Bent Flyvbjerg’s megaproject database—now in the tens of thousands of cases across sectors—shows nuclear among the worst performers for cost and schedule reliability, with a dedicated nuclear new-build reference class of roughly 194 projects used in recent risk analyses. From that record, reference class forecasting (RCF) gives decision-grade uplifts: at P50, add

Fringe Theories for a Faulty Financial System

We’re obviously living in tumultuous times. If investors sense they’re on a financial roller coaster, they’re right.

Recently, I scanned my market tickers and saw that everything was up. Stocks, bonds, gold, silver, the dollar, cryptos and commodities were all advancing. Of course, that didn’t last. The next day cryptos crashed and stocks were down sharply. Even gold suffered its worst day in a decade on Tuesday, a day after notching new record highs. In these markets, volatility is the one constant.

These types of markets demand discipline, but they also give rise to what I can only describe as fringe theories. Even highly seasoned market analysts with great reputations will write to me with theories they’ve heard asking what I think

[TITLE]The Race to Recycle Renewable Energy:
[TEXT]
With the renewable energy sector growing rapidly on a global scale, as many governments pursue a green transition, the need to recycle more components has become evident. Finding innovative ways to recycle renewable energy equipment could help significantly cut costs and reduce waste, further supporting the sector’s green ambitions. There is great potential for a range of components to be reused and recycled, from solar panels to wind turbines and electric vehicle (EV) batteries. However, greater research and investment must be contributed to the sector to improve practices and make recycling options more accessible. As interest and investment in renewable energy increase, we are seeing more technological advancements across the sector. Wind turbines have become bigger and more powerful, while solar panels have been getting cheaper and more efficient. This means that old technologies are becoming outdated more quickly, leading to their replacement. Once a renewable energy component reaches the end of its lifecycle, it is normally removed and replaced by something bigger, stronger, and better. What is done with these old components varies massively from country to country.

Often, old turbine blades or photovoltaic (PV) panels are stockpiled for long periods of time as companies decide what to do with them. Waste from the renewable energy sector is significant, with Europe expected to dismantle around 14,000 wind turbines by the end of the decade. This would result in between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of blade waste, according to WindEurope. Meanwhile, in the United States, wind turbine blade waste could reach anywhere between 200,000 to 370,000 tonnes a year by 2050.

Greater innovation in recycling could help reduce waste and cut costs by putting old components to good use. However, recycling old renewable energy parts is not always so simple. Steel and other materials that can be easily recycled account for around 85 to 90 percent of the makeup of a wind turbine, but the glass fibre or carbon fibre blades are much more complicated to recycle. The difficulties in recycling have not put operators off, with more innovative solutions being seen year on year. In a bid to become more sustainable, after years of discarding old blades and other components, several wind firms have pledged to invest in recycling operations to prevent old components from going to landfill.

In Scotland, old blades from the Hagshaw Hill windfarm are being recycled to provide a hybrid polymer to be used to produce precast concrete alternatives or replace virgin plastics. Meanwhile, Spanish energy firm Iberdrola aims to transform 10,000 tonnes of blade waste annually at its blade recycling facility on the Iberian Peninsula. It will use glass fibres and resins from the turbines to produce new blades to be used across a range of sectors, from aerospace to construction.

Related: Spain’s Clean Energy Dilemma

In the solar energy sector, various innovations are being seen. For example, in Brisbane, Australia, solar panels are being transformed into silver and copper. Operators are removing aluminium and wires from PVs that can no longer produce energy to grind them up into plastic, glass, silicon, silver, and copper. Pan Pacific Recycling is now processing around 30,000 panels a year and hopes to eventually increase its annual capacity to 240,000 panels.

Global solar panel waste is currently far higher than the recycling capacity for this waste, meaning that greater investment is needed in the sector to expand capacity and improve sustainability by preventing old solar panels from going to landfill. In addition, experts suggest that many of the solar panels being replaced with more efficient models are still capable of producing energy and could be reused in a different context rather than discarded. Several startups, such as Australian Second Life Solar, are working to encourage the reuse of old solar panels in alternative settings to provide clean energy and prevent unnecessary waste.

Some of the greatest advancements have been seen in EV battery recycling, as companies worldwide strive to improve their critical mineral supply chains. The lithium supply used for EV battery production is finite, meaning that once supplies are depleted, we will no longer be able to produce this type of battery. However, extracting the lithium from old EV batteries could allow EV makers to reuse the critical mineral, rather than relying wholly on mining projects for their lithium supply. Other minerals that can be extracted from these batteries include nickel, cobalt, and graphite.

Various companies from different regions of the world are now investing in expanding and improving recycling practices, although the industry’s recycling capacity still falls far behind the production of new wind turbine blades and solar panels, suggesting that greater funding is needed to accelerate the global component recycling capacity. In addition, governments could encourage companies to invest in recycling activities by introducing stricter rules and regulations on renewable energy waste, thereby helping the industry to become more sustainable.

[TITLE]New Trump Administration Energy Rule Would Enable Data Centers with ‘Large Loads’:
[TEXT]
Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you’re apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time.

The Trump administration has made it known that it’s a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid.

In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.”

Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he’s now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright’s proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don’t get bogged down in a lengthy review process. In a letter

[TITLE]Energy Secretary Chris Wright Proposes Changes to Power American Manufacturing, Lead AI Innovation:
[TEXT]
Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate a rulemaking to accelerate American manufacturing and ensure that the United States continues to lead in artificial intelligence.

Wright wrote to commissioners of the FERC:

To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.

The Energy secretary wrote that, while FERC has historically not exerted jurisdiction over load interconnections to the interstate transmission system, he believes that interconnection of large loads falls “squarely within” FERC’s jurisdiction.

He explained why this move is so important for American manufacturing and AI development:

This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing and driving American AI innovation, both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously. Thus, pursuant to my authority under section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, I attach for the Commission’s consideration the enclosed advance notice of proposed rulemaking.

Yahoo News wrote:

This type of rule change has been eagerly anticipated by tech and power executives in the aftermath of the FERC’s rejection of a request by Talen Energy Corp. to directly supply an Amazon.com Inc. data center from a Pennsylvania nuclear plant. But it also risks pushback from states grappling with soaring power demand from data centers, new factories, and electric vehicles — and the resulting higher utility bills.

Wright’s proposed rule would give data centers an expedited review if they include additional power plants or agree to limit power usage if the regional grid system faces increased strain, such as during a heatwave.

Data center companies cheered the news.

“Then there’d be a lot more certainty when you start a project that you’d know when it would be energized,” Raul Martynek, CEO of DataBank, which operates about 75 data centers across the country, said.

He added, “On behalf of the American people, and given the urgency of this issue, I look forward to your consideration and final action (no later than April 30, 2026).”
