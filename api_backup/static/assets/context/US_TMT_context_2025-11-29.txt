[TITLE]J.P. Morgan Sounds the Bullhorn for These 2 Tech Stocks:
[TEXT]
Marvell also produces network and connectivity solutions at enterprise scale, the very tech needed to keep businesses connected to the digital world. The company’s enterprise connectivity solutions are designed to enable mobility and cloud computing, promoting the idea of a ‘borderless campus,’ a connected business that is not confined by the limits of a brick-and-mortar presence.

In Marvell’s core business, the company is known for producing high-quality, custom XPUs, CPUs, and DPUs – all essential components of high-end AI- and cloud-computing data center tech. These are complemented by a range of Ethernet and data center switches, and electrical and optical connectivity devices capable of connecting racks, rows, and servers at all scales.

We’ll start in the world of semiconductor chips, data centers, and networking tech, with Marvell Technology. This company is considered a mid-tier player in the digital infrastructure industry, operating on a far smaller scale than the multi-trillion-dollar giants like Nvidia and Broadcom, but even so, Marvell still boasts a market cap of $72 billion and generated $5.77 billion in revenue in its fiscal year 2025.

And discipline is exactly the stance JPM’s analysts are taking. Building on that view, they’re calling out two tech stocks they see as well-positioned from here. We’ve used the TipRanks data to see what’s driving that conviction. Let’s dive in.

A broad market analysis from J.P. Morgan Wealth Management captures the moment clearly: “Despite persistent skepticism, the fundamentals behind AI infrastructure and innovation remain strong.

[TITLE]Catamaran Ventures to follow patient capital route in bets on India's manufacturing push:
[TEXT]
Billionaire N R Narayan Murthy's family office Catamaran Ventures plans to make more growth stage equity bets in manufacturing, a top executive at the firm said on Wednesday.

“Our thesis is based on the view that over the next 5-10 years in India, from a wealth and job creation perspective, the country needs to develop its supply chain for precision manufacturing," Deepak Padaki, president at Catamaran Ventures told Mint.

Murthy, a co-founder of information technology services bellwether Infosys Ltd, is chairman emeritus of Catamaran.

Over the last year, several funds have been deepening their focus on manufacturing as a sector, with some launching new funds to narrow down on the industry's potential. Much of this is backed by private equity and venture capital's belief that manufacturing and supply chain companies are going to be what pushes India to become an export-led economy.

“Themes like import substitution (for EMS), rising domestic consumption (for packaging, building materials) and India’s emergence as an export hub (for chemicals, auto, engineered solutions, aerospace and defense) are providing structural long-term impetus to companies," said Koushik Bhattacharyya, managing director and head of industrials investment banking at Mumbai investment bank Avendus Capital. (EMS is short for electronic manufacturing services.)

So far, Catamaran has two precision manufacturing investments: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker. Both companies are headed for IPOs.

Catamaran has so far made two investments in the manufacturing space, both of which are headed for the public markets: precision aerospace component manufacturer Aequs and SEDEMAC, a mechatronics maker looking to raise up to Rs1,000 crore through an offer for sale. Catamaran has also invested in point-of-care medical diagnostics company Achira Labs.

The family office's sees supply chain manufacturing companies as not a good fit with typical venture capital bets given the long gestation period for such businesses. Most generalist VC funds look for exits in a five to six year horizon.

Manufacturing, which is considered a sub-sector of deeptech given the changing nature of the activity and patents around it, take as long as 10-15 years to come of some scale. For private equity to back such startups, on the other hand, they need them to be more mature businesses.

“We're more mid-market private equity when it comes to manufacturing. We thought about how we as a family office can put money into companies that is patient capital," said Padaki.

Sectors of opportunity

Catamaran is focused on a few areas within manufacturing: aerospace, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the electric vehicle space, medical devices and semiconductor companies.

The family office sees defence as “interesting" while on the lookout for companies that have achieved some scale and can be taken global — of which it has seen very few. Even on the aerospace side, apart from Aequs, despite Catamaran's desire to do more in the coming year, the pipeline is looking thin.

There's more action in electric vehicle OEMs, however. “There's a lot of small component manufacturers in places like NCR (Delhi region) and Coimbatore that are promoter-owned who are switching to EVs because we already have a strong base in auto component manufacturing," said Padaki. “We're more interested in EV supply chain components like motors, electronic systems, that kind of thing."

Catamaran is also looking to back battery recycling companies that are looking to claw back the rare earth materials used to make EV batteries.

In the electronics and semiconductor space, there are two burgeoning ends like a dumbbell. On the one end, there are plenty of startups but they're still very early in their journey, and on the other, there's fabrication companies which require very large investments to build out factories. Catamaran is scouting for those in the middle. “We're looking for companies that are in the semiconductor or data center space that are looking for growth capital support," said the Catamaran president.

Cheques from Catamaran would range from ₹50 crore to ₹250 crore and in some exceptional cases, the family office is willing to go up to ₹400-500 crore, especially when companies from outside India are looking to build joint-ventures for strategic partnerships in the country.

Previously, Catamaran had a joint venture with e-commerce behemoth Amazon back in 2014 called Cloudtail. In 2021, Amazon acquired the family office's stake due to stricter rules for e-commerce marketplaces with foreign investments.

The firm has traditionally been selective in how it makes investments and that's not changing going into 2026. "Our run rate is typically two to three investments, for which we have to look at 10-12 companies" said Padaki. “These are long gestation in terms of companies because we have to understand the promoters for some time to build relationships. Even next year, we're looking to do maybe two or three."

Manufacturing maturity in 2026

India saw some large deals by risk capital players in manufacturing this year. VIP Industries raised $206 million in a round led by Multiples. Euler Motors secured $75 million from GIC and British International Investments, while Scimplify raised $40 million in a deal led by Accel and Omnivore Partners. Rangsons Aerospace also raised capital in a round led by ValueQuest.

Many of the manufacturing startups that cropped up between 2018-2020 are also now on the lookout for their growth rounds. “Valuations need to see a shift," said Padaki. “The reason many of these companies don't get high valuations is because people don't understand that these are ROCE businesses and not growth-at-all-costs businesses."

Also Read | GameChange Solar bets big on India, plans second factory and export push

ROCE stands for return on capital employed and is a ratio used to assess a company's profitability and capital efficiency, essentially giving insight into how well it is doing based on the money it is spending.

Aequs and SEDEMAC are both heading for the public markets and Catamaran hopes their debut will set the precedent for IPOs by other manufacturers. “Today, you don't have that many precedents of small promoter-owned companies that have suddenly gone public," Padaki said.

Given how the various themes are playing out across manufacturing and precision manufacturing, both venture capital and private equity players have their ears perked for companies that are growing sustainably. “While some near-term factors like tariff might lead to temporary uncertainty, we see large amounts of private capital entering this sector in the next 3-5 years," said Avendus' Bhattacharyya.

[TITLE]FDI insurge: Robust inflows into future-focused fields could help India stare down global economic uncertainty:
[TEXT]
Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a long history of transforming industries—from steel to semiconductors. This has been true in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and India.

But there’s an FDI shake-up underway, according to a new study from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).

As investment decisions increasingly follow geopolitical lines, India stands as the world’s top emerging-market destination for announced ‘greenfield’ FDI—that is, cross-border investment projects that create net new production capacity.

From 2022 through the first five months of 2025, India’s greenfield FDI inflow announcements have averaged $83 billion a year—24% higher than in the 2015 to 2019 period.

Of those billions pledged to India since 2022, nearly 80% were destined for advanced manufacturing, communications and software, and resource-related sectors—industries poised to shape tomorrow’s global economy.

These are neither the conventional textile nor basic product investments that played large roles in years past. While India’s large and growing domestic market continues to pull in foreign investors, it is far from the only factor in play in the post-pandemic years.

[TITLE]Exclusive-Huawei, ZTE seal 5G deals in Vietnam after US tariffs, as ties with China warm​:
[TEXT]
By Francesco Guarascio

HANOI (Reuters) -China's leading telecommunication firms Huawei and ZTE have won a string of contracts this year to supply 5G equipment in Vietnam, in another sign of Hanoi's strengthening bonds with Beijing, stirring concern among Western officials, seven people with direct ​knowledge of the situation told Reuters.

For years, Vietnam was seen as reluctant to use Chinese technology in sensitive infrastructure, but in recent months it ‌has embraced Chinese tech companies as sometimes frosty relations with its northern neighbour have warmed while ties with Washington have soured over tariffs on Vietnamese goods.

While Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia secured contracts for Vietnam'‌s 5G core infrastructure, with U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm providing network equipment, Chinese companies have begun winning smaller tenders with state-owned operators, so far unreported public procurement data shows.

A consortium including Huawei was awarded a $23 million contract for 5G equipment in April, weeks after the White House announced tariffs on Vietnamese goods. ZTE has won at least two contracts, one last week, totalling more than $20 million for 5G antennas. The first publicly disclosed deal came in September, a month after U.S. tariffs took effect.

Reuters ⁠could not establish whether the timing of these wins was linked ‌to U.S. tariffs, but the deals raised concerns among Western officials.

The exclusion of Chinese contractors from Vietnam's digital infrastructure, including undersea fibre-optic cables, has long been identified by Washington as a key condition for support in advanced technologies.

Huawei and ZTE ‍are banned from U.S. telecom networks as an "unacceptable risk" to national security. Sweden and other European countries have similar restrictions.

Ericsson declined to comment on Chinese companies, but said it was "fully committed to support its customers in Vietnam."

Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Qualcomm, the U.S. embassy in Vietnam, China's embassy, Sweden's ​foreign ministry or Vietnam's tech ministry responded to requests for comment.

VIETNAM-CHINA TIES WARM

The unaligned Southeast Asian nation is a crucial battleground in the competition for global influence.‌ Its proximity to China has made it a major industrial hub for multinationals such as Apple, Samsung and Nike, which rely on Chinese components and Western consumers.

Under Western pressure, Vietnam long took "a wait-and-see approach" to Chinese technology, said Nguyen Hung, a specialist in supply chains at RMIT University Vietnam. But "Vietnam has its own priorities," he added, noting the new deals could spur deeper economic integration with China.

[TITLE]Telecom operators slam Trai’s draft rules, call 1% turnover penalty excessive:
[TEXT]
India’s telecom service providers have opposed the regulator’s proposal to impose turnover-linked penalties of up to 1% for filing incorrect or incomplete financial reports.

The government relies on these filings to verify operator revenues, compute statutory levies such as licence fees and spectrum usage charges, and intervene to ensure fair competition and protect consumer interest.

In submissions reviewed by Mint, the operators said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) proposed framework, which seeks to link monetary penalties to turnover, is disproportionate and would unfairly penalise inadvertent or minor errors.

“The proposed financial disincentive of up to 1% of turnover appears very stringent and should be reviewed by the Authority (Trai) to ensure that it remains fair, proportionate, and consistent with the existing regulations," Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said in its submissions to Trai earlier this month. COAI represents Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea.

Also Read | Telecom operators dial govt for power reforms as costs surge

Queries emailed to Trai and COAI remained unanswered till press time.

In FY25, telecom operators collectively reported a gross revenue of over ₹3.72 trillion, an increase of 10.7%, according to Trai data. A proposal for linking financial disincentives to turnover has come at a time when Vodafone Idea is eyeing relief on its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues up to FY17 from the department of telecommunications (DoT), after a recent Supreme Court verdict. Bharti Airtel, too, wants the government to reassess its case for pending AGR dues.

According to the Trai proposal, if a service provider submits a false report, or knowingly leaves out any important information, it will be required to pay a financial disincentive of up to 1% of its turnover, as determined by Trai, according to the draft regulations.

According to the operators, Trai’s draft rules to increase financial penalties for delays in reporting tariff plans and administrative compliances go against the government’s wider goals of promoting ease of doing business, simplifying compliance, and decriminalising minor procedural errors, as per the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023 and the proposed Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0.

“Trai is currently evaluating the inputs received from telecom operators. Any decision on the implementation of the regulations will be taken accordingly," a government official said on the condition of anonymity.

Last month, the telecom regulator proposed steeper fines under amendments to two regulations - the Draft Telecom Tariff Order (72nd Amendment) and the Reporting System on Accounting Separation (Amendment) Regulations, 2025. The tariff order amendment mandates reporting any new tariff plans, or changes to existing ones, to Trai within seven working days of its implementation. The regulator needs the same to review and intervene if a change is anti-competitive, predatory, or harmful to consumer interest.

Similarly, the Accounting Separation Regulations (ASR) are intended to provide transparency and accountability in telecom finances, allowing Trai to monitor the costs and revenues of different services and ensure fair pricing and regulatory decisions.

“The purpose of the regulation is to ensure that telecom service providers report to Trai on a consistent and accurate basis. The present regulation aims to amend the relevant regulatory provisions to enhance the effectiveness of financial disincentives in ensuring regulatory compliance," Trai said in the draft regulations on ASR.

According to telecom operators, ASR-based filings are administrative compliance requirements that do not directly impact the customers, the market behaviour or service quality and there is no loss to the government as well. In fact, the regulator should discontinue the requirement for submission of ASR, and rely on audited financial statements and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) certificates for analytical and statistical assessments.

“Even in the case of compliances related to license fees/spectrum usage charges, non-compliance does not lead to any penalty (post 2021 Cabinet reforms), let alone turnover-based penalty," Bharti Airtel said in its submission to Trai dated 7 November. The operator argued that Trai should first issue advisories and warnings before considering any financial disincentive, and said penalties should not be linked to turnover.

Under ASR, telecom operators must annually submit segment‑wise accounting statements to Trai — breaking down costs, revenues, capital employed, and other relevant financial data by service type (such as wireless access, internet, long‑distance, etc.), and by geographical area/licensed service area — so that the regulator can monitor the financial performance of each service separately and make informed decisions on regulations, and policies.

The regulator said the proposal is also to implement financial disincentive in a graded manner in the case of ASR defaults, which would align with gravity of violation, prescribing a maximum ceiling, and imposing interest on default in payment of financial disincentive.

Under the existing regulations, the penalty is up to ₹10,00,000, without any graded penalty structure.

Reliance Jio called Trai’s proposal for a financial disincentive up to 1% of annual turnover as ultra vires the Trai Act and “unsustainable" in law. “The proposed 1% of turnover disincentive would therefore be punitive, unjustified, and open to challenge as a manifestly arbitrary exercise of power under Article 14 of the Constitution," Jio told Trai in its submission on 7 November. The operator said the draft amendment lacks transparency, as it does not explain why the changes are necessary or how increasing financial disincentives will improve compliance. No data has been provided on the number of past violations or actions taken by Trai, nor any rationale showing how the proposed increase in penalties would lead to better adherence to the rules, it said.

“Linking the financial disincentives with turnover is not the right way for such errors. Further, this is very subjective as to who will decide that there are errors in reporting," said Satya N. Gupta, former principal adviser at Trai.

As part of the amendment to the ASR regulations, if a telecom operator fails to submit reports or provides false reports, the penalty proposed is ₹25,000 for each day of delay for the first seven days. If the default continues beyond seven days, the operators would be liable to pay an additional amount of ₹40,000 for each subsequent day of delay subject to a maximum of ₹1,000,000. For continued violation in the consecutive years, the daily penalty proposed is ₹50,000-75,000, capped at ₹25,00,000. The maximum amount of penalty is linked to turnover.

Similarly, if the service providers don’t report their new plans or prices on time, the regulator has proposed steeper penalties — starting at ₹10,000 a day for the first week of delay, and doubling to ₹20,000 a day after that, up to a maximum of ₹500,000.

Operators argued the regulator should retain or rationalise the current ceiling and rates of financial disincentive to ensure proportionality. The regulator needs to treat first-time or inadvertent delays for first seven days as minor procedural lapses leading to warning letters without financial disincentive, the COAI said.

[TITLE]Can Chinese Authoritarianism Stay Smart?:
[TEXT]
Xi was formally taking office for the third time, after altering the Chinese Constitution to make it possible. The move was a striking rejection of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) norms that had been designed to protect China from the personalism associated with Mao Zedong’s rule. The political and economic reforms of the post-Mao era supported China’s stunning economic rise from poverty to the world’s second-largest economy and succeeded in fostering innovation.

The man at the podium wore a dark suit and a red tie. Behind him sat rows of dignitaries in front of a vast wall, draped in gold, from which protruded a yellow hammer and sickle, framed on either side by 100-foot scarlet flags. In front of him, in the cavernous, red-carpeted hall, sat more than 2,000 delegates to the 20th People’s Party Congress in 2022. They listened attentively and took notes like their lives depended on it, which they may well have. The man, Xi Jinping, spoke for over two hours, during which his rapt audience occasionally erupted in ecstatic applause. The moment was both bland in its authoritarian predictability and a sea change in Chinese politics.

Xi was formally taking office for the third time, after altering the Chinese Constitution to make it possible. The move was a striking rejection of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) norms that had been designed to protect China from the personalism associated with Mao Zedong’s rule. The political and economic reforms of the post-Mao era supported China’s stunning economic rise from poverty to the world’s second-largest economy and succeeded in fostering innovation.

Many observers argue that autocracies are unable to cultivate innovation, which is essential for sustaining growth. But by pursuing what I call “smart authoritarianism,” China’s leaders, influenced by the experience of Singapore, adapted their tools of authoritarian control for a globalized information age. Recognizing the tension between political control and the conditions needed to encourage innovation, the CCP governed with more inclusive economic policies and low-intensity repression.

China’s smart authoritarianism, alongside a massive innovation push, led to its rapid rise from technology copycat to leading innovator. The 2025 Global Innovation Index put China within the world’s top 10 most innovative countries, past France, Germany, and Japan. Chinese innovation is translating to meaningful commercial success, even dominance, in a number of high-tech sectors. And it is also shaping the military balance vis-à-vis the United States—particularly in artificial intelligence, telecommunications, supercomputing, and quantum communications.

But when Xi stood before that giant gold hammer and sickle, many experts argued that by flouting term limits, centralizing power, and doubling down on statist economic policies, he was moving away from smart authoritarianism toward policies that would stifle innovation. Some economists, such as Nicholas Lardy and C. Fred Bergsten, were cautiously optimistic, believing that China could still experience growth. But many other observers expressed deep skepticism
