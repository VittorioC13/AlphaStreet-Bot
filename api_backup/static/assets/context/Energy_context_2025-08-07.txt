[TITLE]Presidio Petroleum to go Public via Business Combination with EQV Ventures Acquisition Corp., Creating a Differentiated Dividend Yield-Driven C Corp Focused on the Optimization, Acquisition and Produc:
[TEXT]
Presidio expects to initiate a $1.35/share annual common dividend (13.5% expected dividend yield at $10.00/share) after closing i

Expected net production of 26 Mboe/d in 2025, with an 8% base decline rate, across a diverse set of more than 2,000 operated oil and gas wells in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas

Experienced management team will continue to lead Presidio, alongside a majority independent board

78% of estimated production hedged through 2027, expected to provide stable cash flow for dividends and systematic debt reduction

Projected 16% unlevered free cash flow yield in 2026, with no development risk

Approximately $970 million of transaction capital, inclusive of:

Approximately $65 million of rollover equity from existing Presidio equity holders including approximately $40 million from Presidio management and $25 million from investment funds managed by Morgan Stanley Energy Partners; More than $85 million of PIPE investment from new investors, including a major oil and gas company; $125 million of Series A Preferred Equity anchored by funds advised by JPMorgan Investment Management; $50 million reserve-based loan commitment from Citizens Bank, N.A.; $279 million ii of investment grade debt remaining in place; and Approximately $360 iii million of cash in trust

Fort Worth, TX, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Presidio Investment Holdings, LLC (“PIH”), a differentiated oil and gas operator focused on the optimization of mature, producing oil and natural gas assets in the United States, and EQV Ventures Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: EQV) ("EQV"), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by EQV Group, an experienced acquirer and producer of oil and gas, announced today that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “proposed business combination”). The proposed business combination will result in Presidio becoming a publicly listed company with an expected listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “FTW,” reflecting Presidio's roots in Fort Worth, Texas, where it is headquartered. The combined company is expected to have an estimated post-transaction enterprise value of approximately $660iv million, including assets acquired pursuant to the transaction.

The combined company, a US-domiciled C Corp to be named Presidio Production Company ("Presidio" or the “Company”), will be led by Presidio's existing management team, including Will Ulrich and Chris Hammack as Co-CEOs. As part of the transaction, Presidio will also acquire a complementary Texas Panhandle asset from an affiliate of EQV, EQV Resources LLC (“EQV Resources”). EQV’s sponsor will maintain a significant ownership stake in Presidio post-closing.

The transaction will create a new public company with a stable dividend,v underpinned by cash flow from the commodity price hedged production of stable, mature oil and gas wells. Presidio has a strong track record of substantial acquisitions and intends to acquire and optimize additional producing oil and gas wells. Presidio will optimize these acquisitions through the application of technology, which includes automation, real-time data analytics and the introduction of AI processes.

Presidio's entry into the public markets comes at a pivotal moment in the energy sector, as the capital-intensive shale era gives way to a more disciplined focus on returns. Presidio’s differentiated model stands out with zero reliance on future drilling, minimal capital investment, and substantial free cash flow.

Presidio's strategy of acquiring under-managed oil and gas wells offers a contrarian and validated approach to hydrocarbon asset management with a focus on acquiring new assets, and optimizing existing production assets, across the United States.

Presidio Management Commentary

"Presidio was purpose-built to be the last, best steward of America's oil and gas wells," said Will Ulrich, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Presidio. "This transaction provides a permanent platform to scale our yield-focused model, pursue highly accretive acquisitions, and generate value for shareholders."

"Presidio represents the next evolution of the public oil and gas company — efficient, predictable, and yield-driven within a simple and transparent business model," said Chris Hammack, Co-Founder and Co-CEO. "We believe our track-record of acquisitions and meaningful cost optimization make us the strongest near-term consolidator of mature assets."

“America’s oilfield needs capital-disciplined operators focused on deploying new technology to create long-term value,” continued Will Ulrich. “We have the expertise, track record and capital discipline to squeeze efficiency from every molecule and barrel, delivering superior returns.”

EQV Management Commentary

Jerry Silvey, Founder and CEO of EQV, commented, "This transaction with Presidio aligns with our vision to bring a world-class dividend yield focused producing energy company to the public markets. The structure of the transaction and meaningful commitments from investors will be critical to support the tested and experienced management team at Presidio. With our complementary expertise and shared vision, we are confident that Presidio will be a sustainable yield leader, well-positioned to be a preferred consolidator of producing oil and gas assets."

Transaction Details

Upon the closing of the business combination, EQV will be renamed Presidio Production Company and is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "FTW". The transaction values Presidio at a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $660 million,vii representing a discount to combined proved developed PV-10 value.

To finance the transaction, EQV has entered into agreements for approximately $85 million in common stock PIPE investments. The common stock PIPE is anchored by strategic and institutional investors, including a major oil and gas company. In addition, management and funds managed by Morgan Stanley Energy Partners will provide approximately $65 million of rollover equity. In connection with the transaction, EQV has also entered into agreements with Presidio and investors to issue, on a private placement basis, approximately $125 million of Perpetual Preferred Stock anchored by funds advised by JPMorgan Investment Management. Presidio has entered into a $50 million reserve-based lending commitment provided by Citizens Bank, N.A. to be funded upon closing. The combined financing, together with approximately $360 million of cash from the EQV trust account,viii will provide substantial liquidity for Presidio to pursue dividend accretive acquisitions.

Presidio's management team and EQV’s sponsor and its affiliates have committed to customary lock-ups. EQV’s sponsor has committed to customary earn-out provisions, which includes subjecting 75% of the founder shares held by EQV’s sponsor after closing into a dividend reinvestment plan and earn-out structure. Presidio’s management team have signed rollover agreements totaling over $32 million, with additional rollover agreements from other interest holders being sought up to an aggregate total of $40 million.

The expected transaction proceeds will be used for a $135 million equity buyout of existing Presidio equity holders, repayment of debt, hedge restriking, transaction expenses, and general corporate purposes. The transaction was unanimously approved by the EQV and Presidio boards of directors and the sole member of EQV Resources, and remains subject to the approval of EQV shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. The balance of cash held in the EQV trust account, the equity private placement financing proceeds and debt financing will allow Presidio to continue to employ its acquisition growth strategy.ix

[TITLE]Exxon Signs Oil Deal in Libya:
[TEXT]
Exxon has inked a preliminary deal for exploration at four offshore blocks in Libya after a decade of absence from the country.

The news was reported by Libya’s National Oil Corporation, which said the U.S. supermajor will conduct a detailed technical study of the blocks that are located off the country’s northwest coast and the Sirte Basin with the purpose of identifying the size of oil and gas resources in the blocks.

The deal follows similar preliminary agreements between the National Oil Corporation and BP and Shell, which also returned to Libya after a prolonged hiatus amid Libya’s civil war that began in 2011 after the U.S. deposed of Muammar Ghaddafi.

The memorandum of understanding with BP will see the UK-based supermajor conduct studies to assess the potential for hydrocarbon exploration and production in the Messla and Sarir fields, as well as in some surrounding exploration areas.

Separately, the Libyan oil corporation sealed an agreement with Shell for the oil and gas major to evaluate hydrocarbon prospects and conduct a comprehensive technical and economic feasibility study to develop the al-Atshan field and other fields fully owned by the NOC, excluding any areas where third parties, other than the NOC and Shell, have rights.

Libya, earlier this yea,r launched its first oil and gas exploration tender since 2007, which is also the first since the civil war started. Exxon, Chevron, TotalEnergies, and Eni were among the 37 international companies that expressed interest in Libyan acreage for oil and gas exploration. The participants in the tender were competing for 22 blocks, both offshore and onshore.

The country with the richest oil and gas resources in Africa holds an estimated 91 billion in untapped resources, per National Oil Corporation data. Production averages around 1.4 million barrels daily but is subject to frequent disruption from various political and paramilitary groups.

[TITLE]Deal or Delay? Oil Diplomacy Tests Market Patience - US-China Trade Talks Progress, But Energy Dispute Remains:

Experts believe China feels it holds leverage in negotiations. With Trump eager for a deal and China unwilling to cut vital oil imports, Beijing sees energy as non-negotiable—even if it causes friction and delays in the talks.

[TITLE]Pakistan Buys First U.S. Oil Cargo After Trade Deal:
[TEXT]
Pakistani refiner Cnergyico will import Pakistan’s first U.S. crude oil cargo in October following the trade and energy cooperation deal the two countries signed earlier this week.

Cnergyico will import on October 1 million barrels of American crude via top commodity trader Vitol, Usama Qureshi, vice chairman of the biggest refiner in oil-import-dependent Pakistan, told Reuters on Friday.

The cargo of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is set to load from Houston in August and arrive in Pakistan in late October, the executive said.

“This is a test spot cargo under our umbrella term agreement with Vitol. If it is commercially viable and available, we could import at least one cargo per month,” Qureshi added.

The cargo will not be for resale and will help diversify Pakistan’s predominantly Middle Eastern supply of crude oil.

This first U.S. crude purchase by Pakistan follows the trade deal announced earlier this week.

Following months of negotiations, the United States and Pakistan this week signed a trade deal that will involve the joint development of Pakistan’s oil resources.

“We have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive Oil Reserves,” U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media.

“We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!” Trump also said on Truth Social.

Pakistan is an importer of energy, but it may hold substantial reserves of oil and gas in shale formations.

This year, Pakistan also updated its oil and gas reserves estimate, revising the oil reserves part upwards by 23% from a year earlier, to 238 million barrels. The revision came on the back of seven fields where discoveries were made in the period.

Santos has entered a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Engie, signalling a potential supply of natural gas from the Narrabri Gas Project to the Australian east coast domestic gas market.

This agreement could see up to 20 petajoules (PJ) per year being supplied for at least ten years following the project’s commencement.

The proposed deal is contingent upon Santos’ final investment decision (FID) on the Narrabri Gas Project, the negotiation and execution of a definitive gas supply agreement, and approvals from both parties.

Santos managing director and CEO Kevin Gallagher said: “Santos voluntarily committed 100% of Narrabri gas to the domestic market back in 2020. Santos already produces Narrabri gas from appraisal wells for the Wilga Park power station that generates electricity for the north-west NSW [New South Wales] grid.

“This experience, combined with our project development and production experience in Queensland’s Surat Basin, gives us confidence that Narrabri gas will be a very competitive source of domestic gas supply for the east coast market that is further advantaged by proximity to customers in NSW.”

Santos has been dedicated to developing the Narrabri asset since its acquisition in 2011, with more than A$1.5bn ($969.6m) invested thus far.

In addition to the supply agreement, Santos and Engie are exploring decarbonisation initiatives, particularly through Santos’ carbon management business and the proposed Moomba phase two carbon capture and storage project.

“Narrabri will be subject to some of the strictest environment and groundwater protections in the world, and we will comply with them,” Gallagher added.

In related news, Santos has reached a significant milestone in its Pikka phase one project in Alaska, US, with the safe arrival of critical processing modules at Oliktok Point.

This development is a key step towards enhancing the company’s growth and presence in the region.

78% of estimated production hedged through 2027, expected to provide stable cash flow for dividends and systematic debt reduction

Projected 16% unlevered free cash flow yield in 2026, with no development risk

Approximately $970 million of transaction capital, inclusive of:

Approximately $65 million of rollover equity from existing Presidio equity holders including approximately $40 million from Presidio management and $25 million from investment funds managed by Morgan Stanley Energy Partners; More than $85 million of PIPE investment from new investors, including a major oil and gas company; $125 million of Series A Preferred Equity anchored by funds advised by JPMorgan Investment Management; $50 million reserve-based loan commitment from Citizens Bank, N.A.; $279 million ii of investment grade debt remaining in place; and Approximately $360 iii million of cash in trust

Fort Worth, TX, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Presidio Investment Holdings, LLC (“PIH”), a differentiated oil and gas operator focused on the optimization of mature, producing oil and natural gas assets in the United States, and EQV Ventures Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: EQV) ("EQV"), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by EQV Group, an experienced acquirer and producer of oil and gas, announced today that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “proposed business combination”). The proposed business combination will result in Presidio becoming a publicly listed company with an expected listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “FTW,” reflecting Presidio's roots in Fort Worth, Texas, where it is headquartered. The combined company is expected to have an estimated post-transaction enterprise value of approximately $660iv million, including assets acquired pursuant to the transaction.

The combined company, a US-domiciled C Corp to be named Presidio Production Company ("Presidio" or the “Company”), will be led by Presidio's existing management team, including Will Ulrich and Chris Hammack as Co-CEOs. As part of the transaction, Presidio will also acquire a complementary Texas Panhandle asset from an affiliate of EQV, EQV Resources LLC (“EQV Resources”). EQV’s sponsor will maintain a significant ownership stake in Presidio post-closing.

The transaction will create a new public company with a stable dividend,v underpinned by cash flow from the commodity price hedged production of stable, mature oil and gas wells. Presidio has a strong track record of substantial acquisitions and intends to acquire and optimize additional producing oil and gas wells. Presidio will optimize these acquisitions through the application of technology, which includes automation, real-time data analytics and the introduction of AI processes.

Presidio's entry into the public markets comes at a pivotal moment in the energy sector, as the capital-intensive shale era gives way to a more disciplined focus on returns. Presidio’s differentiated model stands out with zero reliance on future drilling, minimal capital investment, and substantial free cash flow.

Presidio's strategy of acquiring under-managed oil and gas wells offers a contrarian and validated approach to hydrocarbon asset management with a focus on acquiring new assets, and optimizing existing production assets, across the United States.

Presidio Management Commentary

"Presidio was purpose-built to be the last, best steward of America's oil and gas wells," said Will Ulrich, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Presidio. "This transaction provides a permanent platform to scale our yield-focused model, pursue highly accretive acquisitions, and generate value for shareholders."

"Presidio represents the next evolution of the public oil and gas company — efficient, predictable, and yield-driven within a simple and transparent business model," said Chris Hammack, Co-Founder and Co-CEO. "We believe our track-record of acquisitions and meaningful cost optimization make us the strongest near-term consolidator of mature assets."

“America’s oilfield needs capital-disciplined operators focused on deploying new technology to create long-term value,” continued Will Ulrich. “We have the expertise, track record and capital discipline to squeeze efficiency from every molecule and barrel, delivering superior returns.”

The structure of the transaction and meaningful commitments from investors will be critical to support the tested and experienced management team at Presidio. With our complementary expertise and shared vision, we are confident that Presidio will be a sustainable yield leader, well-positioned to be a preferred consolidator of producing oil and gas assets."

The transaction values Presidio at a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $660 million,vii representing a discount to combined proved developed PV-10 value.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the EQV and Presidio boards of directors and the sole member of EQV Resources, and remains subject to the approval of EQV shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. The balance of cash held in the EQV trust account, the equity private placement financing proceeds and debt financing will allow Presidio to continue to employ its acquisition growth strategy.ix

[TITLE]Sixth Street takes 38% of Italian renewable energy firm Sorgenia in $4.6 billion deal:
[TEXT]
MILAN (Reuters) -U.S. investment firm Sixth Street said on Monday it had agreed to buy 38% of Sorgenia, in a deal that values the Italian renewable energy company at 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion).

The transaction allows Spanish infrastructure fund Asterion Industrial Partners to exit Sorgenia's capital, while F2i, Italy's main infrastructure fund, retains its position as the leading shareholder in Sorgenia, with a 62% stake.

Under the agreement, F2i will transfer to Sorgenia its wind and solar power generation assets in Italy and Spain: EF Solare, Renovalia and Renovalia Tramontana.

Asterion, which held 27.6% of Sorgenia, first invested in the company in 2020 supporting its efforts to build a position as a significant player in Europe's green energy transition.

"This agreement establishes Sorgenia as one of the leading energy infrastructure platforms in Europe," Sixth Street partner Richard Sberlati said.

Sorgenia's renewable portfolio spans solar, wind, biomass, and hydroelectric plants.

The company currently operates approximately 1,700 megawatt (MW) of installed renewable capacity and is pursuing development projects totalling an additional 5,000 MW.

Rothschild & Co advised Sixth Street, together with law firm Cleary Gottlieb.

Lazard, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mediobanca acted as financial advisers to F2i and Pedersoli Gattai as legal adviser. BofA Securities, Nomura and Societe Generale each advised one of the F2i funds involved in the transaction. ($1 = 0.8636 euros)

[TITLE]Electronics and renewable energy investments set to dominate state’s investment announcements in Thoothukudi:
[TEXT]
As the Tamil Nadu government kicks off its regional investment summits ‘TN Rising’ from Thoothukudi on Monday, electronics manufacturing and renewable energy sectors are set to take centrestage.

Sources told businessline that South Tamil Nadu’s existing strengths in precision manufacturing and green energy, electronics and renewable energy investments are set to be the highlight of the TN Rising conclave at Thoothukudi. The Tuticorin port is also a huge draw for these manufacturing entities to set up export-oriented units, sources said.

Businessline has learnt that high precision electronics manufacturing firm Yeemak, along with its group company Jeanuvs proposes to invest around ₹3,500 crores in Thootukudi for manufacturing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and consumer electronics. This is set to be a large manufacturing set up with potential to employ over 7,000 people, sources in the know said.

Interestingly, the facility, once operational, will cater to both domestic and export market and is also set to dabble in defence manufacturing. “The company is also exploring ways to leverage the facility as an advanced integrated artillery ammunition and missile manufacturing factory,” an electronics industry insider said.

With the likes of Tata Power and Vikram Solar present in South Tamil Nadu, the region is also attracting renewable energy projects. This has also attracted Delhi-based Mobius Energy to set up a new ₹1,000 crore solar cell and module manufacturing facility in the district of Theni, with an MoU likely to be signed for it on Monday.

Beyond Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli, South Tamil Nadu is also seeing the mushrooming of more investment clusters. Dindigul and Theni’s agriculture strengths offer potential for companies in the value-added food exports space, and the temple town of Madurai too is fast emerging as an IT hardware and software hub.

Following Thoothukudi, the state also plans to conduct editions of the Regional Investment Conclaves in western, central, and northern Tamil Nadu.
