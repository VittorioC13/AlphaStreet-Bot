[TITLE]Tokenization will disrupt finance faster than digital disrupted media: Crypto exec:
[TEXT]
Tokenization will transform the financial industry faster than digital technology disrupted legacy media, such as print newspapers, physical copies of music and other analog formats, according to Keith Grossman, president of crypto payments company MoonPay.

“While many feared digitization would destroy media, what it actually did was force its evolution,” Grossman said, adding that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, the process of representing traditional assets onchain, will force traditional institutions to adapt. He added:

“This is no longer hypothetical. BlackRock is offering tokenized funds. Franklin Templeton is running tokenized money market funds on public blockchains. Major global banks are piloting onchain settlement, tokenized deposits and real-time asset movement.”

The market capitalization of the RWA sector, excluding stablecoins, is nearly $19 billion at the time of this writing. Source: RWA.XYZ

Financial incumbents like Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and others will continue to exist in a different form, Grossman said, much like media companies continued to exist after the shift to digital distribution in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which disrupted business models that worked for decades.

Ultimately, the survivors and winners of the ongoing shift toward tokenized finance will be those companies that get ahead of the change and not those that attempt to stop the inevitable shift to a global financial system powered through blockchain rails, he said.

Why tokenized assets can change the game

Tokenizing real-world assets carries several benefits, including enabling 24/7 access to markets, making asset classes global in scale, cheaper transaction costs through disintermediation, and lowering settlement times to minutes, instead of days.

In September, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement on creating a regulatory framework to enable 24/7 capital markets.

The financial system shifting to 24/7 trading represents a major departure from how traditional markets, which close on nights, weekends and holidays, currently operate.

In December, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a settlement and clearing company that processed about $3.7 quadrillion in settlement volume in 2024, received approval from the SEC to start offering tokenized financial instruments.

The DTCC plans to roll out tokenized assets in the second half of 2026, starting with US Treasuries and stock indexes.

[TITLE]Wall Street Firms Cut AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (AIRO) Price Target But Affirm Long-Term Prospects:
[TEXT]
AIRO Group Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AIRO) is one of the best aerospace and defense stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts. Colin Canfield of Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed his Buy rating on AIRO Group Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AIRO) on December 11, keeping his $20 price target unchanged.

Wall Street Firms Cut AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (AIRO) Price Target But Affirm Long-Term Prospects

On November 24, BTIG analyst Andre Madrid lowered the price target on the stock to $19 from $26 while reiterating a Buy rating. The cut is in response to disappointing third-quarter results, in which sales dropped to $6.3 million from $23.7 million in the same quarter a year ago.

Meanwhile, on November 21, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its overweight rating on AIRO Group but cut the price target to $20 from $30. While the research firm cut the price target over concerns that third-quarter results disappointed, it maintains the company represents significant value as a key drone supplier in the US and the European Union.

A point of concern is that the company’s increased focus and concentration on drone revenue, which represents 80% of 2025 sales, creates inherent quarterly volatility. Nevertheless, the research firm has echoed the company’s solid gross profit margins that stand at 63.78%. Cantor Fitzgerald expects the company to address radio-related supply chain challenges by sourcing from multiple suppliers while receiving priority as a national security provider.

AIRO Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AIRO) is a next-generation aerospace and advanced air mobility company focused on defense and commercial markets, operating through four segments: Drones (developing and selling unmanned systems), Avionics (creating flight technology for various aircraft), Training (providing military pilot and commercial flight training), and Electric Air Mobility (developing eVTOLs for cargo and passengers).

While we acknowledge the potential of AIRO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Leonardo’s Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor Demonstrator Makes First Flight in Italy:
[TEXT]
The NGCTR demonstrator is designed to mature key novel technologies that could support the development of a larger civil tiltrotor with lower emissions.

Leonardo has announced the first flight of the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor – Technology Demonstrator (NGCTR-TD), which took place on Dec. 19, 2025, at the company’s Cascina Costa facility in northern Italy. The flight marks a major milestone for one of Europe’s most advanced civil rotorcraft research programs, developed under the EU-funded Clean Sky 2 initiative.

The event formally opens the flight test phase for the demonstrator, which is intended to mature key technologies to be used for a future generation of high-speed, long-range civil tiltrotors. The NGCTR program aims to combine the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) flexibility typically shown by helicopters with the cruise performance similar to that of fixed-wing turboprop aircraft, while significantly reducing environmental impact.

#Leonardo and the EU @clean_aviation JU (Joint Undertaking) are pleased to announce the first flight of the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor – Technology Demonstrator (NGCTR-TD), which took place on 19 December at Leonardo’s Cascina Costa di Samarate facility (Varese, Italy).… pic.twitter.com/rGzNBnp4tU — Leonardo Helicopters (@LDO_Helicopters) December 19, 2025

First Flight

According to a video released by Leonardo, the first flight consisted only of a brief hovering sortie, meant to verify aircraft stability and overall system functionality before moving to longer tests. The flight was performed by Leonardo test pilot Gianfranco Cito at the Cascina Costa site, the same site where the aircraft was assembled and underwent ground testing.

Leonardo said that the first flight marks the start of a progressive flight-test campaign, during which the demonstrator’s flight envelope will be gradually expanded. Subsequent sorties will then focus on validating individual subsystems and, later on, more complex flight profiles, including transitions between helicopter and airplane modes, which are notoriously among the most critical flight phases for tiltrotors.

The NGCTR program reached another key milestone in July 2024, when the demonstrator successfully completed its first ground run tests. Those activities paved the way for flight clearance and ultimately led to the aircraft’s first flight in December 2025.

“Building on our well-established experience in the tiltrotor sector, bringing this technology demonstrator into the air for the first time represents an important milestone in our journey to make a key contribution toward an even more advanced, effective, and sustainable use of helicopter technologies in Europe. Vertical lift continues to deliver invaluable benefits to operators and communities across a wide range of missions worldwide; for this reason, we are committed to developing and delivering solutions that uniquely combine the best of both worlds – rotary-wing and fixed-wing architectures – unlocking entirely new capabilities.” — Gian Piero Cutillo, Managing Director of Leonardo Helicopters

Clean Sky 2 Framework

The NGCTR-TD was developed within Clean Sky 2, the European Union’s large-scale aeronautical research program under the Horizon 2020 framework. Clean Sky 2 was designed to reduce aviation emissions, noise, and operating costs while strengthening Europe’s aerospace industrial base. Its successor, Clean Aviation, continues to build on the technologies matured under the program.

Launched in 2015, the NGCTR initiative brought together industry, research centers, and academic institutions across Europe. According to Clean Aviation, the program involved more than 85 organizations from 15 countries, supported by over €100 million in EU funding distributed across multiple grant agreements.

Clean Sky 2 also placed particular focus on cross-border industrial collaboration and supply-chain development, using demonstrators such as NGCTR to create common design, manufacturing, and testing practices across Europe, explains Clean Aviation’s website. This approach was intended to ensure that the benefits of technology maturation extended beyond a single airframer, strengthening Europe’s long-term competitiveness in advanced rotorcraft and VTOL systems.

“The NGCTR demonstrates how Europe can turn ambition and vision into impact. The programme brought together more than 85 organisations from 15 countries around a shared objective: developing faster and more sustainable rotorcraft based on the tiltrotor architecture. With €116 million in EU funding distributed across more than 30 grant agreements, the outcomes extend well beyond the project itself. More than 20 patents have emerged from the NGCTR, and the programme has helped foster skills, industrial capabilities, and new European supply chains. This makes the NGCTR – launched under Clean Aviation’s predecessor programme, Clean Sky 2 – a key element in strengthening Europe’s strategic leadership in sustainable air transport.” — Axel Krein, Executive Director of the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking

Demonstrator Built on the AW609 Platform

The NGCTR builds directly on Leonardo’s decades of tiltrotor experience embodied by the AW609 program. The AW609 is currently considered one of the most significant technological innovations in the global aviation industry and might pave the way for a large-scale diffusion of the tiltrotor platforms, becoming the first commercial tiltrotor.

Because of this, rather than relying on an entirely new airframe, the NGCTR-TD uses a Leonardo AW609 fuselage as its baseline, allowing the program instead to focus resources on the validation of new technologies while reducing cost and technical risk. The aircraft is powered by GE Aerospace CT7 turboshaft engines.

Building on the AW609, the demonstrator intends to advance five core technology areas: an advanced wing architecture, an innovative tail layout, a non-tilting engine installation with a high-efficiency nacelle architecture and split-gearbox transmission, as well as an advanced, modular, distributed, and scalable Flight Control System (FCS). The innovative solutions developed and integrated into the NGCTR-TD contribute to reducing aerodynamic drag, optimizing engine installation, and mitigating the effects of emissions.

In fact, beyond designing and building the aircraft itself, the NGCTR was structured to raise key technologies to Technology Readiness Level 5–6 at whole-aircraft level. These outcomes are intended to feed directly into future civil tiltrotor designs and to support evolving European certification frameworks for high-speed VTOL aircraft.

Performance objectives

The NGCTR concept targets a cruise speed of around 280 kt (520 km/h) and a range of approximately 1,000 nautical miles (1,850 km). These figures place it well beyond conventional helicopters and closer to regional turboprop aircraft, while retaining VTOL capability.

Such performance is seen as particularly relevant for passenger transport, cargo operations, and search and rescue missions. In those situations, the ability to combine speed, range, and vertical access could significantly expand operational flexibility. Leonardo and Clean Aviation also emphasize the potential to operate without the need for extensive ground infrastructure.

The program also focuses on the environmental aspects, aiming to demonstrate reductions in CO₂ emissions, NOx emissions, and noise footprint compared to helicopters of similar size and payload. This aligns with the European Union’s climate and sustainable mobility objectives.

Long Development

While the first flight represents a major achievement, it follows a lengthy and complex development path. The NGCTR demonstrator’s maiden flight had originally been planned for 2020, before being delayed due to technical challenges and program restructuring.

Aircraft assembly was completed in June 2024, following a multi-year design and validation phase that included a critical design review at aircraft level in 2021. Ground testing culminated with the successful power-on milestone achieved in July 2024, enabling flight clearance for the December 2025 first flight.

The ongoing flight-test campaign is expected to accumulate up to 200 flight hours, progressively validating the demonstrator’s technologies.

[TITLE]Asian Stocks Set To Climb On Year-End Rally Hopes: Markets Wrap:
[TEXT]
Focus in Asia will be on China’s one and five-year loan prime rates later today. Commercial banks are likely to keep lending rates unchanged for a seventh month as expectations grow that the People’s Bank of China may ease policy next year.

“A weaker economy heading into the fourth quarter has raised the urgency for more support to prevent a sharper slowdown, with year-end policy meetings hinting slightly more monetary easing in 2026,” said Eric Zhu from Bloomberg Economics. “We see the next rate cut early next year, guiding lending rates lower.”

Crude prices will also be watched, with the US still in pursuit of a third oil tanker near Venezuela as President Donald Trump intensifies an oil blockade on Nicolás Maduro’s government.

Elsewhere, UK and US growth readings are due this week, as well as minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s December policy meeting which may give clues to whether it could hike in February. In Japan, Tokyo inflation as well as national jobs data are due, helping traders assess the outlook for Bank of Japan policy after its cautious hike last week.

Treasury yields edged higher on Friday as New York Fed President John Williams signaled no urgency to cut interest rates again citing recent employment and inflation data. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack echoed that sentiment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, reinforcing expectations for a pause after a string of recent reductions.

While the slew of economic data last week did little to provide clarity on the outlook for US interest rates, traders continue to bet on two rate cuts in 2026.

“We think inflation worries voiced by some hawks on the board are overdone and overall risks in the labor market are clearly to the downside,” Citigroup Inc. strategists including Adam Pickett wrote in a note to clients. But with only one clean set of data to be published prior to next month’s meeting, “this makes current market pricing of a 30% probability of cut in January look fair,” they wrote.

[TITLE]Wall Street banked on a flurry of deals under Trump in 2025. It wasn't that simple:
[TEXT]

Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. "This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale," said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan 's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects.

Uncertain times

Early in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. "Macroeconomic uncertainty" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. "We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down," KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. "With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general." In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. "That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride," said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. "We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. "The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration," Foley said. "All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets." Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing.

Policy playbook

Ahead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification. But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector. There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025. Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull. "If volumes aren't growing, you can't sit still, you've got to think

As leadership teams wrap up annual planning and look ahead to 2026, this provides a rare moment in the corporate calendar for those occupying the heady heights of the C-Suite to step back and reassess which trends will actually matter as the next year unfolds.

Dimitri Masin, Co-Founder and CEO of Gradient Labs — an AI-native fintech working with leading financial institutions across Europe and recently launched in the U.S. — believes the next phase of customer experience will look fundamentally different. Based on what his team is seeing in live, regulated deployments, Masin has told Digital Journal

[TITLE]FOMO vs. Bubble Angst Signals More Stock Volatility in 2026:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) — The US stock market is poised to be kept on edge next year as investors are caught between fear of missing out on the artificial-intelligence rally and concern that it’s a bubble just waiting to burst.

Big selloffs and quick reversals have been a feature of stock markets for the past 18 months. That trend is likely to continue heading into 2026, with some strategists anticipating that AI will follow the boom-and-bust cycle of past technological revolutions.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The tech companies at the center of the AI investment boom carry an outsized influence. While the divergence between the group and the rest of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has helped dampen realized volatility across the market in 2025 as gains in tech cancel out declines elsewhere, investors are alert for stumbles in chip names to spread. That would cause volatility gauges such as the Cboe Volatility Index to surge.

“2025 has generally been a year of rotation and narrow leadership, rather than one of broad risk-on versus risk-off,” said Kieran Diamond, derivatives strategist at UBS Group AG. “This has helped to drag implied correlation levels down to record lows, which in turn leaves the VIX at risk of ongoing outsized spikes whenever we see macro drivers taking over again.”

The scale of the stock-price runup has made angst about a bubble the top concern among fund managers, a recent Bank of America Corp. (BAC) survey found. But another is the classic risk of missing out if it still has more room to run — potentially punishing anyone who pulls back too early.

The strategists expect equity volatility to be supported in 2026 primarily because asset bubbles tend to get more unstable as they inflate. As a result, they say investors should expect occasional declines surpassing 10%, but with record-fast snapbacks as traders realize the bubble isn’t popping yet.

To UBS strategists, the question of whether the AI boom continues or busts makes owning contracts that profit from higher volatility on tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index (^NDX) key to playing both sides of the trade. Maxwell Grinacoff, head of US equity-derivatives research at the Swiss bank, says volatility wagers on the gauge perform better in both scenarios, adding that the trade can be structured to be directionally neutral using straddles or over-the-counter swaps.

[TITLE]33-year-olds shuttered their $2M-a-year startup, risked running out of money—now their AI business is valued at $100M:
[TEXT]
This story is part of CNBC Make It's The Moment series, where highly successful people reveal the critical moment that changed the trajectory of their lives and careers, discussing what drove them to make the leap into the unknown.

Dhruv Amin and Marcus Lowe left Google and built a startup that was "profitable from Day 1," operating at a $2.2 million run rate by September 2023, Amin says. They predicted continued success, forecasting monthly revenue to multiply at least five-fold by late-2024.

Then, they shuttered the whole thing to start over from scratch — all due to ChatGPT, says Amin.

Today, Amin and Lowe, both 33, are the co-founders and co-CEOs of Anything, a vibe-coding startup valued at $100 million following an $11 million funding round in September, according to the company. The business was originally known as Create, a marketplace connecting startups to freelance engineers and artificial intelligence-powered coding tools to build websites and apps.

Why blow it up? Amin cites "the ChatGPT moment" in November 2022, when OpenAI debuted the generative AI chatbot. Its leap in capabilities from previous AI models "was a surprise to everybody," Amin says.

By spring 2023, Amin and Lowe predicted that AI could eventually approach human developers' ability to write sophisticated code. If that happened, human engineers might not be needed at all, rendering their business obsolete.

But if they rebuilt their company around AI and the technology didn't advance rapidly enough, their new model would be a flop. Clients would bolt and the company would run out of money.

After months of anxious deliberation, in October 2023, Amin and Lowe undertook the difficult process of laying off half of their seven-person staff and cutting ties with freelance developers, says Amin: "Within two weeks, we were back to an empty office."

They first launched an AI-powered tool to build app components like login forms and calendar tools. In April 2025, they released a new product for building entire online businesses, including backend authentication and payments systems, no coding experience necessary — and renamed the company Anything.

"That was actually the moment where it felt like it really took off," says Amin. Within two weeks of the company's relaunch announcement, Anything reached a $2 million annualized revenue run rate, he says.

The AI coding industry is "extremely early" in its development, says Amin, as evidenced by overall mixed reviews for vibe-coding services. Still, non-technical users have built functional commercial apps with Anything, including a hair salon owner's AI stylist mobile app and a dental hygienist's app for tracking gum health, Amin wrote in a Sept. 29 blog post.

Here, Amin discusses his realization that AI could upend their entire business model, the anxiety of determining whether to start over, and getting the timing right when launching a startup in an emerging industry.

CNBC Make It: You decided to shut down and rebuild in October 2023. How painful of a decision was that, and what was the reaction from your company's investors?

Amin: We went back to zero, so that was hard. We had to let go of half of the team. We had to shut down the developer marketplace and tell our customers we weren't going to do this with devs anymore.

At the time, people were still kind of scoffing: "Is this AI thing going to be real? Are you actually going to be able to build real apps [with just AI]?"

We had raised [$3 million] of venture capital. We had promised [investors] that we were going to hit [specific] timelines. Then, we went back to everyone and told them, "Actually, no, we're going to go back to zero." Everyone was like, "Are you sure?"

As you and your co-founder tracked AI's advancements, what were your conversations like?

We talked all the time. We would revisit the position, like, once a month. It took me and Marcus a very, very long time to both come to the conclusion [to start the business over], and it felt like one of those decisions that both of us, as co-founders, needed to agree with.

There'd be times where I was more bullish on the prospects of the [original] marketplace and what we could do with it. There were times where Marcus would be more bullish. And there were times where both of us were like, "This technology is advancing so fast and we're using it in more and more places, does it just make sense to build a new product?" That was hard.

I think what ended up breaking that logjam for us was: We launched a few prototype builders, just to test and see if there was demand for [code-generation products] where you don't have to talk to any of us, you just can use it. That gave us some early signal. When we talked to our customers, it felt like the code-gen system had product-market fit.

How confident were you that the underlying generative AI technology would keep advancing exponentially?

Confident, but unconfident on the timescales. That was the scariest part. Through 2024, large language models kind of hit a plateau, to some extent, in capability. It was very unclear through that time how good [that technology] would end up getting. There were definitely [times] where it was like, "Oh, boy. Did we make a mistake in trying to pivot?"

Could we even build something valuable and useful enough that people would want it and pay us for it? We had many opportunities to pivot to a quicker win, which would be: "Let's make a prototyping tool. Let's make a design tool, because all [LLMs] can do is components. We'll sell it to agencies."

What stopped you?

Marcus and I always had this [mindset] that we'd already gone through one really big pivot trying to align closer to the mission of the company. That pivot would've been for naught if we didn't actually accomplish the mission of the company, which is that people should be able to build real production products, even if they don't know how to code.

It's a useful founding story now: This company will stick through it, even if the technology shifts, even if the business model shifts. At the time, it was hard. Now, I can say with some pride: You don't have to just take my word that we're serious about what we're trying to do here. We've painted it in blood, sweat and tears.

I expected it would take about a year to get this technology good enough to build real production systems. In reality, it has taken about two and I still think we're at the start. The sophistication of apps you can build with Anything — what it will look like in a year, or even two years, is just going to be dramatically different.

I hope our hardcore pivots are behind us, at this point. Now, I think we're just more in the [mindset]: Let's execute, let's take advantage of opportunity, and let's really grow it.

Where would your business be today if you hadn't shut down the marketplace to focus on AI?

It's so hard to tell. I wonder if the company would still exist? Would the business we were building then still be attractive to [investors]? I think marketplace models like that, while popular in 2021, have really fallen out of fashion unless you're more pure AI [focused].

This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

[TITLE]Georgia regulators OK 50% power capacity boost, betting AI data center demand will materialize:
[TEXT]
Georgia’s only private electric utility plans to increase power capacity by 50% after state regulators on Friday agreed 5-0 that the plan is needed to meet projected demand from data centers.

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The construction cost would be $16.3 billion, but staff members say customers will pay $50 billion to $60 billion over coming decades, including interest costs and guaranteed profit for the monopoly utility.

Georgia Power Co. and the Public Service Commission pledge large users will more than pay for their costs, and that spreading fixed costs over more customers, could help significantly cut residents’ power bills beginning in 2029.

“Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians,” Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said in a statement after the vote.

But opponents say the five elected Republicans on the commission are greenlighting a risky bet by the utility to chase data center customers with existing ratepayers left holding the bag if demand doesn’t materialize.

“The need for 10,000 megawatts of new capacity resources on the system in the next six years isn’t here,” said Bob Sherrier, a lawyer representing some opponents. “It just isn’t, and it may never be.”

The approval came less than two months after voters rebuked GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the commission in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson — the Democrats who will take office Jan. 1 — opposed Friday’s vote. But current commissioners refused to delay.

Electric bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize power demands of technology behemoths.

Georgia Power is the largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. It says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — with 80% of that flowing to data centers. The company has 2.7 million customers today, including homes, businesses and industries.

Whether the company’s projections of a huge increase in demand will pan out has been the central argument. Georgia Power and commission staff agreed Dec. 9 to allow the company to build or acquire all the desired capacity, despite staff earlier saying the company’s forecast included too much speculative construction.

In return, the company agreed that after the current rate freeze ends in 2028, it would use revenue from new customers to place “downward pressure” on rates through 2031. That would amount to at least $8.50 a month, or $102 a year, for a typical residential customer. That customer currently pays more than $175 a month, including taxes.

“So we’re taking advantage of the upsides from this additional revenue, but allow it to shift the downside and the risk over to the company. And I’m real proud of that,” Commission Chairman Jason Shaw said after the vote.

But “downward pressure” doesn’t guarantee a rate decrease.

“It doesn’t mean your bills are going down,” said Liz Coyle, executive director of consumer group Georgia Watch. “It means that maybe they’re not going up as fast.”

Existing customers would pay for part of the construction program that doesn’t serve data centers. More importantly, opponents fear Georgia Power’s pledge of rate relief can’t be enforced, or won’t hold up over the 40-plus years needed to pay off new natural-gas fired power plants.

In a Monday news conference, Hubbard likened it to a mortgage “to build a massive addition to your home for a new roommate, big tech.”

“If in 10 years, the AI bubble bursts or the data centers move to a cheaper state, then the roommate moves out, but the mortgage doesn’t go away,” he said.

Staff members say the commission must watch demand closely and that if data centers don’t use as much power as projected, Georgia Power must drop agreements to purchase wholesale power, close its least efficient generating plants and seek additional customers.

Many opponents oppose any new generation fueled by natural gas, warning carbon emissions will worsen climate change. Some opponents were escorted out of the commission meeting by police after they began chanting “Nay! Nay! Nay! The people say nay!”

“Increased natural gas output for the sake of these silicon billionaire kings seems like a lose-lose,” opponent Zak Norton told commissioners Friday.
