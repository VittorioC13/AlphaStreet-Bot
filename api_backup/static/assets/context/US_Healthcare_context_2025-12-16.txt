Charter Medical Group is planning to invest €85m in a new capital plan that will include a €50m investment in its Mullingar private hospital facility and a new ambulatory surgery centre to be located in central Dublin.

The private healthcare group expects the new plan will see current group revenues – at €50m in 2025, up from €41m in 2024 – double on foot of the investment. Overall group jobs numbers are expected to grow from 370 to 700 with the expansion, it said.

The healthcare provider said it is planning a €50m investment over two years in Charter Medical Private Hospital at Ballinderry in Mullingar and this would be “a transformative step in expanding healthcare capacity in the Midlands”.

“The hospital in Mullingar plays a significant role in supporting the public hospitals in the Midlands region where it serves to reduce pressure on the health system and deliver ease of access to services that are in critical demand,” said the group in a statement.

The two-year plan for the Westmeath hospital will create 100 new jobs in 2026 followed by another 100 roles in 2027, adding to the hospital’s current workforce of over 300, it said.

Commencing in January 2026, the capital plan for the hospital comprises new theatres, new endoscopy suites, additional surgical and medical beds and an investment in what the group said would be “leading-edge technology to enhance patient care”.

The plan will also include investment in its existing facilities in Dublin, as well as the new central Dublin surgery centre, details of which would be announced in early 2026.

Charter Medical Group’s facilities currently treat 80,000 patients a year and it is the second-largest provider to the National Treatment Fund (NTPF) nationally.

'The hospital in Mullingar plays a significant role in supporting the public hospitals in the Midlands region' the group said

“Charter Medical Group is entering an exciting phase of growth,” said Charter Medical Group chairman Tom Byrne.

“Our €85m capital programme for 2026 and 2027 will see the addition of a third facility in central Dublin, complementing our existing sites in Dublin and Westmeath.

This expansion underscores our commitment to delivering world-class care to more patients and supporting the national healthcare system at scale.”

The group said in a statement that the new roles it plans to create would include nursing staff and clinical nursing specialists, health and social care specialists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, specialist medical and surgical registrars, respiratory physiologists and a clinical innovation team to develop new services and integrate new technologies.

It also plans to create new senior managerial and administration roles, it said.

[TITLE]Healthcare Costs Set to Spike After Senate Rejects ACA Funding:

Millions of Americans could see a massive spike to their health insurance premiums with federal subsidies for people who use the Affordable Care Act marketplace set to expire at the end of the 2025 as lawmakers on Capitol Hill remain deadlocked on a deal. The Democrats' plan would have allowed the vast majority to keep their benefits for three more years while the Republicans wanted to scrap them in favor of boosting health savings accounts, but both bills failed.

[TITLE]No Healthcare Deal In Sight As Parties Nuke Each Other’s Plans:
[TEXT]
Senate Democrats and Republicans each shot down the other’s healthcare proposal on Thursday, underscoring how divided the parties remain as the boosted Obamacare subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year.

The Senate voted on a Democrat plan to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies for three years, as well as a Republican alternative centered on expanded Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Both measures failed after party leaders declared the opposing proposals “dead on arrival,” leaving little room for a healthcare deal to materialize before the year’s end.

The Democratic proposal was part of the agreement that secured their votes to end the monthlong government shutdown. Their plan would offer a three-year clean extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies — enacted in 2021 by Democrats without a single GOP vote — and is estimated to add $350 billion to the national debt over a decade. (RELATED: Fake People And Phony SSNs Had 100% Success In Getting Obamacare Subsidy, Fraud Investigation Finds)

The GOP bill — the Health Care Freedom for Patients Act — is sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo. Under the plan, roughly $1,000 to $1,500 would be deposited into HSAs paired with Bronze or Catastrophic plans on the ACA exchanges, and would not include an extension of the enhanced subsidies.

Senate Republican leadership coalesced around the Cassidy-Crapo proposal, arguing that federal dollars should flow directly to consumers rather than to insurance companies through subsidies. Republicans point to rising insurer profits since the enhanced subsidies were enacted, and note that Obamacare premiums have increased twice as fast as employer-based premiums.

“Democrats want to force families to pay $6,000 out-of-pocket before their insurance kicks in. Republicans want to make health care affordable and put thousands in patients’ pockets to help pay for their out-of-pocket expenses,” Cassidy said ahead of the vote. “Democrats need to stop playing politics with people’s health care and come to the table to find real solutions.”

The Government Accountability Office recently revealed that enrollees with fictitious identities, invalid Social Security numbers, and even deceased individuals are frequently approved for taxpayer-funded subsidies in the ACA marketplace.

“The Democrat bill sends $83 billion directly from the Federal Treasury to insurance companies. And it fails to include a single reform to stop the waste, the fraud, the abuse, or the corruption – because Democrats simply don’t care,” Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said during a floor speech Wednesday.

Even so, many Republicans acknowledged that neither party’s standalone bill was likely to advance this week.

“In my opinion, trying to take the longer view — and also being as objective as I can — I think the only way that there will be a bill put together reforming the Obamacare exchanges is through the reconciliation bill,” Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters on Tuesday. He added that the world would not “spin off its axis” if Republicans failed to vote on their own proposal.

Others, meanwhile, stress the urgency of acting before the subsidies expire on Dec. 31.

“The point is that, right now, people in my state and around the country will not be able to afford health insurance,” Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Tuesday. “We need to think

[TITLE]Cycle Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Applied Therapeutics:
[TEXT]
NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLT; “Applied”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to creating transformative treatments for rare diseases, today announced a definitive agreement for Cycle Group Holdings Limited (“Cycle”) to acquire Applied Therapeutics.

Applied Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the development of novel drug candidates against validated molecular targets in rare diseases. Applied’s lead drug candidate, govorestat, is a novel central nervous system (CNS) penetrant Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) for the treatment of CNS rare metabolic diseases, including Classic Galactosemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency (CMT-SORD) and phosphomannomutase 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG).

“We are confident that Cycle has the resources and capabilities to move govorestat forward towards the ultimate goal of bringing a life-changing treatment to the patients suffering from Classic Galactosemia, CMT-SORD and PMM2-CDG, who have always been at the center of everything we do at Applied,” said Les Funtleyder, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Applied. “I want to thank the entire Applied team for their perseverance and commitment. We are also grateful to the investigators and patients who have contributed to the development of govorestat.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cycle will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock for a per share price of $0.088 per share in cash payable at closing plus one non-transferrable contingent value right (CVR) that entitles the holder to receive potential additional payments.

The CVR provides payments based on the following:

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for any galactosemia indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.10 per CVR in cash payable upon FDA approval of a new drug application for the CMT-SORD indication prior to the eighth anniversary of closing.

Up to $0.20 per CVR in cash payable upon the first achievement of worldwide net sales of any product covered by the CVR by Cycle, its affiliates or licensees equal to or exceeding $200 million dollars in any four-quarter fiscal period prior to the tenth anniversary of closing.

Each CVR holder will also be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any cash of Applied in excess of $500,000 at closing (capped at $1.5 million) (“Closing Cash Payment”).

Each such CVR and Closing Cash Payment will be paid only once, if at all.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions contained in the merger agreement that will be filed with the SEC, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Applied common stock. The merger agreement does not include a financing condition. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions. If the tender offer closes, then Cycle would acquire untendered shares of Applied through a second-step merger for the same consideration.

Applied also issued a Promissory Note (the “Promissory Note”) to Cycle. The Promissory Note is unsecured and enables Applied to receive loans aggregating up to $8.5 million from Cycle, to fund Applied’s working capital needs under an approved budget. Cycle’s funding obligations cease, and amounts borrowed immediately becomes repayable, if the transaction is terminated for certain reasons. Absent funds provided by Cycle under the Promissory Note or from another source, Applied would be unable to continue to fund its activities for more than a limited number of days and Applied would anticipate proceeding to wind down operations.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Applied Board of Directors following an extensive evaluation of strategic alternatives. This evaluation process included numerous discussions with potential counterparties. The Applied Board of Directors determined that entering into the merger agreement with Cycle represented the path that best advanced the interests of Applied and its stockholders.

For Cycle, Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as legal counsel. For Applied, Aquilo Partners, L.P. provided a fairness opinion, and Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel.

The price target hike follows the company’s agreement to acquire Bluejay Therapeutics for $620 million in cash. With the acquisition, the company gains worldwide rights to brelovitug, a monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis D, a rare and aggressive liver condition.

“This acquisition fits squarely with what we do best—advancing high-impact medicines for patients with rare diseases through disciplined development, regulatory innovation, and commercial excellence,” Mirum CEO Chris Peetz said in the release.

The acquisition of Brelovitug comes on the heels of 100% HDV RNA response in Phase 2 clinical trials, with Phase 3 results expected in the second half of next year.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley have also reiterated an Overweight rating on Mirum Pharmaceuticals with an $81 price target. The investment bank views the deal as a smart strategic move for Mirum, saying it bolsters the company’s position in rare liver diseases while offering clear synergies with its current commercial setup. The firm also projects that the enlarged pipeline could generate more than $4 billion in peak sales.

Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIRM) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering treatments for rare and debilitating liver diseases, especially those affecting children, by transforming scientific discoveries into therapies such as their key drug LIVMARLI (maralixibat) for cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC).

While we acknowledge the potential of MIRM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Our mission is driven by the urgent need for better treatment options, and we remain focused on advancing our lead programs and expanding our pipeline of indication-specific and pan-tumor therapies that have the potential to truly make a difference,” commented Mark Manfredi, Ph.D., CEO of DISCO. “I would like to thank Roman for the leadership that brought DISCO to this stage and positioned the company for long-term success.”

“DISCO’s platform can open entirely new therapeutic areas by revealing previously unknown targets on the cancer cell surface and their biology,” said Lenny Van Steenhuyse, Investment Manager at Ackermans & van Haaren. “With the addition of Mark Manfredi as CEO, DISCO is poised to become a leader in surfaceome-guided oncology drug development, and we look forward to supporting the company on its path towards the clinic.”

Mark Manfredi, Ph.D., brings over 20 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and a proven track record in cancer drug development. Mark most recently served as CEO of Ikena Oncology, before which he was an Entrepreneur in Residence at Atlas Venture, a leading early-stage venture capital firm supporting groundbreaking biotech innovation. He served as Chief Scientific Officer of Raze Therapeutics and as Vice President, Oncology Biology at Takeda Pharmaceuticals. During his tenure at Takeda and as part of the senior R&D management team, he contributed to the global oncology R&D strategy, helping translate several novel mechanisms into clinical development, including programs that progressed into Phase 3 trials and gained regulatory approval. Mark received his B.S. from the University of Rhode Island and earned his Ph.D. in biology from Boston College.

“DISCO was founded to discover novel medicines by mapping the entire surface of cells and significantly expanding the addressable target space for any indication,” said Roman Thomas, M.D., founder and founding CEO of DISCO Pharmaceuticals. “Having led DISCO from its inception to the development of several promising programs emerging from our novel target discoveries, I look forward to the company’s next phase of growth under Mark’s leadership.”

Charter Medical Group is planning to invest €85m in a new capital plan that will include a €50m investment in its Mullingar private hospital facility and a new ambulatory surgery centre to be located in central Dublin.

The private healthcare group expects the new plan will see current group revenues – at €50m in 2025, up from €41m in 2024 – double on foot of the investment. Overall group jobs numbers are expected to grow from 370 to 700 with the expansion, it said.

The healthcare provider said it is planning a €50m investment over two years in Charter Medical Private Hospital at Ballinderry in Mullingar and this would be “a transformative step in expanding healthcare capacity in the Midlands”.

“The hospital in Mullingar plays a significant role in supporting the public hospitals in the Midlands region where it serves to reduce pressure on the health system and deliver ease of access to services that are in critical demand,” said the group in a statement.

The two-year plan for the Westmeath hospital will create 100 new jobs in 2026 followed by another 100 roles in 2027, adding to the hospital’s current workforce of over 300, it said.

Commencing in January 2026, the capital plan for the hospital comprises new theatres, new endoscopy suites, additional surgical and medical beds and an investment in what the group said would be “leading-edge technology to enhance patient care”.

The plan will also include investment in its existing facilities in Dublin, as well as the new central Dublin surgery centre, details of which would be announced in early 2026.

Charter Medical Group’s facilities currently treat 80,000 patients a year and it is the second-largest provider to the National Treatment Fund (NTPF) nationally.

'The hospital in Mullingar plays a significant role in supporting the public hospitals in the Midlands region' the group said

“Charter Medical Group is entering an exciting phase of growth,” said Charter Medical Group chairman Tom Byrne.

“Our €85m capital programme for 2026 and 2027 will see the addition of a third facility in central Dublin, complementing our existing sites in Dublin and Westmeath.

This expansion underscores our commitment to delivering world-class care to more patients and supporting the national healthcare system at scale.”

The group said in a statement that the new roles it plans to create would include nursing staff and clinical nursing specialists, health and social care specialists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, specialist medical and surgical registrars, respiratory physiologists and a clinical innovation team to develop new services and integrate new technologies.

It also plans to create new senior managerial and administration roles, it said.
