[TITLE]EU still ready to conclude free trade pact with India despite no ‘breakthrough’ last month:
[TEXT]
The EU is still ready to conclude on a mutually beneficial free trade agreement (FTA) with India, with negotiating teams working hard to meet the year-end deadline, despite the previous month’s negotiating round not resulting in a “breakthrough”, EU Ambassador to India Hervé Delphin has said.

In an indirect reference to the US which has imposed tariffs on most of its trade partners, including the EU and India, Delphin said the FTA should be used by the two sides to diversify trade and strengthen supply chains.

“The FTA can open new opportunities for the EU and Indian businesses and create conditions to significantly increase our bilateral trade and investment. While some countries are raising tariffs or otherwise closing their markets, we should use the FTA to diversify trade, hedge against uncertainties and strengthen our supply chains,” Delphin said in his speech at the annual general meeting of the Federation of European Business in India (FEBI) on Saturday.

The 14th round of the India-EU FTA negotiations begins on October 6 and is crucial as progress made in this round could determine whether the year-end deadline set by EU President Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister Narendra Modi could be met.

It is fair to say the negotiations are challenging and important issues remain to be solved, Delphin conceded. “The 13th round earlier in September with the direct involvement of Commissioners Sefcovic and Hansen on the EU side did not result in the sort of breakthrough which was expected. The EU was and still is ready to conclude on a meaningful package. We look forward to the next round and further negotiations towards a mutually beneficial deal,” he said.

Areas that still need ironing out include duty cuts offered by India on certain items such as automobiles, liquor, agriculture items and dairy, quality controls imposed by India, the EU’s carbon tax (CBAM), treatment of intellectual property and the EU’s quality standards that impede Indian exports.

Citing a recent survey by FEBI on the role of EU businesses in India, the Ambassador pointed out that there are around 6,000 EU companies in India, creating over three million jobs, across various sectors including manufacturing, professional services or information and communication technology.

“But with an FTA, it could be much bigger. Eighty per cent of EU firms would scale up investment and jobs in India,” Delphin said.

The EU is India’s top trading partner, with bilateral trade in goods of €120 billion, ahead of the US and China. Adding services, our bilateral trade has reached €180 billion, the Ambassador noted. “This is an impressive figure, but there is a huge potential for growth considering that EU and India are the second and the fourth largest economies in the world. To unlock this untapped potential EU and India are negotiating the FTA,” he said.

[TITLE]The War Over Defense Tech | Susannah Glickman:
[TEXT]
1.

Last October, on a Martin Luther–inspired website called www.18theses.com, a software executive named Shyam Sankar published a four-thousand-word polemic with the title “The Defense Reformation.” “As a nation, we are in an undeclared state of emergency,” it begins. There follows a litany of provocations: Chinese escalation in the South China Sea, Iranian attacks on US military bases, the October 7 attacks in Israel, “an estimated 1 million casualties in brutal combat in Ukraine.” All this, Sankar writes, amounts to “a hot Cold War II.”

It is a war, he argues, for which the US is catastrophically underprepared: “In the current environment, American industries can’t produce a minimum line of ships, subs, munitions, aircraft, and more.” The problem lies with American capitalism in its present form, which—as Sankar lamented last year on a military podcast called The Merge—has left legacy defense firms like Lockheed Martin dominated by “fifth-generation MBA cadre[s]” who care more “

[TITLE]Inside the uranium plant at the center of U.S. plans to expand nuclear power:
[TEXT]
watch now

EUNICE, NEW MEXICO — Paul Lorskulsint was a shift manager at a brand new uranium enrichment facility deep in the American Southwest when catastrophe struck Japan in 2011. A massive tsunami and earthquake had caused a severe accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Thousands of miles away in Eunice, New Mexico, Lorskulsint turned on the television to make sure his team could witness what was happening across the Pacific Ocean. Lorskulsint knew the disaster in Japan was a watershed moment for the nuclear industry. The plant where he was leading an operations shift had just opened in 2010, after the European uranium enricher Urenco had spent years building the facility in anticipation of growing demand. Over the ensuing decade, public support for nuclear power diminshed and a dozen reactors closed in the U.S. as the industry struggled to compete against a flood of cheap natural gas and renewable energy. Demand for the low enriched uranium that fuels nuclear plants dwindled. "The price of what we sold basically went through the floor," Lorskulsint, who is now the chief nuclear officer at Urenco USA, told CNBC. Urenco's long-term contracts with utilities insulated the facility during the downturn, he said, but the price drop put further expansion plans on hold.

[TITLE]Notion Capital raises $130 million for European growth fund:
[TEXT]
Notion Capital, a London-based venture capital firm, has announced the close of a new $130 million growth fund. The fund will focus on supporting growth-stage startups across Europe in sectors like AI, defense, and supply chain logistics. Stephen Chandler, managing partner at Notion Capital, emphasized the importance of the new fund in addressing the shortage of growth-stage capital in Europe.

“This opens up a chance for firms like ourselves to become real European champions,” Chandler said. The fund, called Growth Opps III, will target areas of rising demand such as sovereignty, resilience, and artificial intelligence. Chandler described AI as a “super cycle” that is reshaping the industry.

Notion Capital will concentrate on applications of AI to multiply its market reach. Notion Capital has already begun deploying funds into ventures like Upvest, a stock trading API, Kraken, a builder of unmanned surface vessels, and Nelly, a developer of financial products for the medical sector. A dedicated team of fund partners will handle these growth deals and source new opportunities outside the existing portfolio.

Notion Capital secures new funding

The firm has also introduced new leadership with Growth Opps III. Partner Stephanie Opdam will drive the growth strategy alongside Jessica “Jess” Bartos, who joined from Salesforce Ventures as Notion’s first external partner hire.

Europe has historically struggled with a shortage of institutional capital, particularly from pension schemes. However, reforms like France’s Tibi initiative and the UK’s Mansion House Accord are starting to create incentives for long-term capital mobilisation. Reflecting its pan-European ambitions, the fund is denominated in euros and domiciled in Luxembourg, making it less dependent on UK regulation.

Around 85% of its capital came from institutional investors across Europe, the UK, MENA, and the United States. Since its founding, Notion Capital has invested in over 150 companies, including notable names like Currencycloud, GoCardless, Mews, Paddle, and Quantum Systems. Their established relationships with founders serve as a competitive advantage, particularly at the growth stage.

With Growth Opps III, Notion Capital is positioning itself as a key player in Europe’s evolving venture landscape. The firm plans to make about a dozen investments from the new fund, continuing to support ambitious European founders as they scale to global prominence.

[TITLE]Evantic Capital debuts with $400 million to fund B2B AI startups across Europe and beyond:
[TEXT]
Evantic Capital, a new London-based venture capital firm, has launched with over €341 million in capital to support B2B AI innovators across Europe, the United States, and Israel.

Why it matters: The substantial funding underscores the importance of investing in AI technologies that hold the promise of revolutionizing how businesses operate and deliver value, contributing to the competitiveness and dynamism of the European tech landscape.

The details:

Evantic Capital aims to identify and nurture groundbreaking AI startups that demonstrate strong potential in transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics.

The investment fund will provide financial support, strategic guidance, and industry connections to help these startups scale and achieve their transformative goals.

The firm’s launch is seen as a significant boost for the European AI startup ecosystem, which continues to garner global attention for its innovation and growth.

The firm is backed by an exclusive network of 140 seasoned founders, operators, and investors collectively known as “The Legends,” designed to create direct alignment between startup success and stakeholder involvement by allocating up to 50% of investment carry to those Legends who actively support the portfolio companies.

What they’re saying:

“Our Legends are senior leaders—experienced founders, operators, and executives—who bring a deeper level of involvement to our portfolio companies,” explains Matt Miller, Founder and Managing Partner of Evantic Capital.

“This creates a true partnership model: our Legends are not only motivated by goodwill or networking, but by a real alignment of interests. It ensures that when a founder engages with a Legend, they’re interacting with someone who is deeply invested in helping them succeed, both emotionally and economically.”

The other side: The rise of AI technologies presents a myriad of opportunities and challenges.

What’s next: Evantic Capital has already invested in five AI-focused startups and has two more commitments underway, with its current portfolio including Fireworks, Listen Labs, and Nexos.

[TITLE]Europe teams with Japan on asteroid mission, beefs up space cooperation with South Korea:
[TEXT]
An illustration showing the Ramses spacecraft near the asteroid Apophis.

SYDNEY — Europe is deepening cooperation with South Korea and Japan as it looks to expand its international cooperation activities on Earth and in space.

The European Space Agency (ESA) and the Korea AeroSpace Administration ( KASA ) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for enhanced cooperation here at the 76th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) here in Sydney on Wednesday (Oct. 1).

The agreement will allow the agencies to use each others' ground stations for telemetry, tracking and command functions. The MoU also covers future areas of cooperation including space science, exploration, human spaceflight, in-space infrastructure and beyond. There is also an intention to work together on space weather .

"This is an important moment for Europe and Korea, opening up great opportunities for our space interests, and strengthening existing systems through cooperation," ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said in a statement . "In ESA, we are excited to learn from our colleagues in KASA, and to share our experience to reach complementary goals."

"KASA's objectives include enhancing global space cooperation;" said Youngbin Yoon, KASA's administrator. "Today, we have taken an important step, and we look forward to our shared journey in cooperation in space activities for peaceful purposes."

Support from ESA's Estrack global ground station network could help facilitate South Korea's lunar ambitions, with ESA having played a similar role during the development of China's Chang'e lunar program .

South Korea's moon program already includes the Danuri spacecraft, which is in lunar orbit, capturing stunning images of the moon. But the country is now building toward a robotic lunar lander to be launched by a homegrown rocket, with a grander vision of establishing a moon base by 2045 as part of a long-term exploration road map released by KASA in August. Earlier this year, the agency began converting an abandoned mine to a testing ground for lunar exploration.

The developments come as ESA earlier this year began considering diversifying and deepening global partnerships in the wake of uncertainty over the NASA budget and the future of cooperative programs. ESA also held discussions with India on deepening their cooperation at IAC in Sydney.

India is a strategic partner with enormous capacity and is precisely the type of nation that @esa and its Member States want as a partner. Today, with @isro, we discussed ways of deepening collaboration in three main areas: Exploration, Earth Observation, and Operations. pic.twitter.com/A5cVzsm88ROctober 1, 2025

Asteroid rideshare with Japan

A day earlier, ESA's Aschbacher celebrated recent milestones in cooperation with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) with agency head Hiroshi Yamakawa. Both men addressed IAC at a Heads of Agencies event on Sept. 29.

Aschbacher celebrated a recent rideshare agreement that will see ESA's Ramses spacecraft and Japan's Destiny+ mission launch together on a Japanese H3 rocket to study the former doomsday asteroid Apophis ahead of its 2029 close encounter with Earth .

"Ramses is not only a scientifically exciting mission and a symbol of two partnerships between Japan and ESA, but it also is a good example of quick project development and implementation," Aschbacher said.

The main objective for Destiny+ is to study the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower . Launch delays have, however, provided the opportunity for the spacecraft to first visit Apophis, and for a serendipitous rideshare for Ramses.

[TITLE]Telecom Italia targets B2B growth from sovereign services:
[TEXT]
TIM Enterprise, the domestic business-to-business (B2B) division of Telecom Italia, has outlined a three-year €1bn investment plan for 2025-27 that will help it “consolidate its role as the technological engine and point of reference for the TIM Group, serving over 30,000 business and public administration customers” and help it fulfil the €4bn in contracts it has already secured with enterprise and government customers.

And at the heart of its efforts is, like many of its digital service provider peers, a focus on the development and delivery of sovereign services for Italy’s public and private sectors.

In 2024, TIM Enterprise, which has 6,600 staff, generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of €700m from revenues of €3.3bn (24% of group revenues), with half coming from public/government bodies and half from its private business customers, which include more than 8,000 large enterprises.

Of that total, €1.1bn was from connectivity services (40% market share), another €1.1bn from cloud (15% market share), €200m from cybersecurity and €100m from internet of things (IoT), and the remaining €600m from other tech services. (All of these numbers exclude the Sparkle international unit that is being divested.)

According to TIM, the total B2B tech and communications services sector in Italy was worth €26.8bn in 2024 and that is set to grow to be worth
