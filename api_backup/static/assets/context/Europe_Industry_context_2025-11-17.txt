[TITLE]Carbios Eyes China, Gets Closer to PET Plant Plans:
[TEXT]
Carbios is one step closer to closing the first license for its enzymatic depolymerization technology, as the French biotechnology firm has confirmed the viability of its business model with Zhink Group subsidiary, Wankai New Materials.

Translation? With eyes on China, capital for a (conceivable) Carbios-outfitted recycling production plant in the country is on the (theoretical) table.

In the works since June 2024, the prospective partners reached a binding agreement on the main principles of their strategic collaboration: Deploying a minimum annual processing capacity of 50,000 metric tons of prepared polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste per year.

“This agreement represents a key step in the international roll-out of our technology and an important milestone in the implementation of our licensing model,” said Vincent Kamel, CEO of Carbios.

While still subject to the signing of final agreements— in particular, the shareholders’ agreement and the license agreement—the effort will start by building a China-based biorecycling plant, outfitted with the next-gen company’s proprietary technology that allows for the “infinite recycling” of PET.

Carbios will “grant to this entity a licence to produce purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) monomers,” which means that Carbios is legally giving this said entity—in this case, Wankai—the legal right to use its proprietary, patented enzymatic technology to break down PET plastic waste into its core chemical building blocks: PTA and MEG.

China is arguably the world’s largest PET producer; in 2021, 58 percent of the global recycled PET consumption was in Asia; China comprised 38 percent, per the June 2024 statement. Representing 61 percent of global production, the region produces 67 million tons of the popular plastic produced annually, representing 61 percent of international outputs. And, given growing demand for rPET across both the regional and global markets, China has the potential to take the lead in rPET production, Carbios said last June during the initial discussions.

As such, China is a key market for Carbios, the French biotech firm said. The agreement represents a strategic step forward for both partners, equally focused on accelerating the adoption of a circular PET industry in Asia. Furthermore, China is the primary country for turning PET into fiber, representing 78 percent of “all PET fiber transformation in the world,” the partners said.

“This cooperation with Wankai—China’s third-largest PET producer—will enable us to produce enzymatically recycled PET and thus make a concrete contribution to the transition to a more circular and low-carbon PET industry,” said Kamel.

Specializing specifically in PET and textiles, the Zhink Group produces 3 million tons of PET each year across domestic and global markets, with Wankai New Materials manufacturing and selling various versions of PET polyester. While the subsidiary’s main offerings span both bottle-grade and non-bottle-grade PET chips, the company is also involved in producing biobased and recycled PETs and has a large production capacity for PET resin, per the June statement. Carbios, meanwhile, develops and industrializes biological solutions to reinvent the lifecycle of plastics and textiles, designing enzyme-based biological processes to break down plastic and foster the circular economy.

Additionally, Wankai would make a 5 million euro ($5.8 million) investment into Carbios.

“As a result of this investment, Wankai could appoint a representative to Carbios’ board of directors,” said the companies, as shared in a superscript disclosure within the binding agreement’s public statement.

“The terms and conditions of the capital investment, particularly the financial terms, are still to be finalized in the definitive agreements. This investment will, if necessary, be subject to administrative and regulatory approvals in France and China,” per the release.

With Wankai serving as the future joint venture’s main shareholder, financing the plant’s construction will be guaranteed by the latter and is expected to break ground in the first quarter of 2026. Final agreements should be signed by the end of 2025.

[TITLE]Japanese investors turn to Europe as deep tech boom lures capital abroad:
[TEXT]
Huge swathes of cash are flowing from Japan to European tech startups as risk-averse investors favor a more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping to scale the continent's booming deep tech cluster. While the European startup and venture capital ecosystem has long operated in the shadow of Silicon Valley, it has become fertile ground for Japanese corporates, whose domestic market is younger. Japanese investors or venture capital funds who themselves have Japanese investors, known as limited partners, participated in European financing rounds worth more than 33 billion euros ($38 billion) since 2019 when a trade deal between the European Union and Japan came into force, according to research from venture capital fund NordicNinja and data platform Dealroom. For the five years leading up to the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, investment totaled 5.3 billion euros. In Europe at that time, "there was no Japanese capital other than Softbank," Tomosaku Sohara, co-founder and managing partner of Japan-Europe VC NordicNinja, told CNBC. NordicNinja, which has 250 million euros of assets under management, is a collaboration between the firm's managing partners and Japan's JBIC IG Partners.

"Softbank was pretty active already at that moment, because they had acquired Finnish gaming company Supercell," Sohara said, noting that the acquisition injected life into Finland's startup ecosystem. Now, Mitsubishi , Sanden , Yamato Holdings , and Marunouchi Innovation Partners are among those directly backing European tech, per the report, while Japan-linked venture capital firms such as NordicNinja, Byfounders, and Toyota 's Woven Capital cut checks to startups on the continent. There are over two times more VC-backed startups in Europe than in Japan, per capita, and 4.3 times more unicorns, per the report.

The shadow of Silicon Valley

Japan's appetite for investing was always there, Sohara said. Its multinationals — like many — headed stateside to set up corporate venture capital arms in early 2000, in search of a slice of the action at the time when some of today's largest companies were just being thought up in dorm rooms. "Nobody wanted to look at Europe at that moment, but I think that after a couple of years they realized, 'Hey, maybe the U.S. culture is totally different from the Japanese culture,' and they began thinking, 'Hey, maybe we need to look at another region like Europe,'" Sohara said, adding that the profile of entrepreneurs in Europe, many of whom came from large corporates at the time, was more aligned with Japan. That's in contrast to the young founders coming from Stanford or university research and development departments, he said.

watch now

"They have experience at the corporates and also they have a mindset of entrepreneurship. Japan, unfortunately, is lacking the entrepreneurship mindset," Sohara added, referring to Europe's founders, many of whom came from Nokia and Skype.

The pull for founders

Japanese-linked investors have a penchant for one sector in particular: deep tech, which refers to companies building on top of scientific or engineering innovation. Deep tech and artificial intelligence accounted for 70% of deals made by such investors in Europe in 2024, echoing trends in the broader startup ecosystem as the AI, energy, and defense industries boom. The top-funded companies with Japanese participation include the U.K.'s autonomous vehicle startup Wayve, which raised $1.05 billion in an investment round in May 2024, British quantum computing firm Quantinuum, which secured 273 million euros in January 2024, and Spanish quantum firm Multiverse Computing, which saw investors cut it a check of 189 million euros in June 2025. The rounds were backed by Softbank, Mitsui and Toshiba, respectively. Such companies, however, typically need a lot of growth capital and industrial experience to scale successfully — two elements that Europe famously lacks.

"Investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe," Sarah Fleischer co-founder and CEO, Tozero

"Japanese firms — and they're old, most of them that we're talking about, right — they're just sitting on a pile of money. They've been saving money throughout the last century, and now they're starting to spend it, to try to grow as a large corporate and increase their footprint outside of Japan," said Sarah Fleischer, co-founder and CEO of Germany-based battery materials recycling startup Tozero. "You see that investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe," she added. Tozero has raised 14.5 million euros to date and counts NordicNinja, Honda and JGC among its investors. It's not just about the check. Japanese corporates and industrials have robust manufacturing and automotive know-how, Fleischer and Sohara noted respectively, meaning they are well positioned to plug Europe's knowledge gaps when it comes to scaling large manufacturing projects. Fleischer added that Japanese firms have long shored up their critical minerals supply chain and long-established trading firms, meaning they know how to secure essential components needed for the energy transition. For Tozero, this is an added plus, Fleischer said, given it's in the business of recovering such materials from spent batteries. In the age of political uncertainty amid choppy U.S.-China relations, Japan also acts as a good bridge to the Asian markets, Fleischer said.

A slower pace and lower risk appetite

Back in Japan, the number of entrepreneurs is "still very limited," Sohara said, as the older generation and "great talents" wanted to work for "a Toyota and Honda or Sony," he added, but the younger generation's mindset is beginning to change. Europe has also become the home to ambitious would-be founders searching for a tech ecosystem to build their companies in, Sohara said. However, as collaboration between Europe and Japan scales, language remains a barrier as fluency in English is not widespread in Japan, he added. For Fleischer, this also poses challenges. "There's so much miscommunication and local translation that could ruin a partnership instantly. And there's also some sort of cultural aspect as well, one needs to probably be aware of," she said, adding that she recently spent weeks in Japan getting to know her investors face-to-face, "because that's still the sentiment" there. Decision-making can therefore be slower, the founder said, due to thorough research and preparation. "They just do their homework," Fleischer said, noting that Japanese partners were hands-on in helping the company understand "how to build our next future commercial plant, potentially starting from Japan and then going worldwide."

Indeed, "without the support from NN [NordicNinja] it would have been much more difficult to build the right relationships," said Aaike van Vugt, co-founder and CEO of Dutch nanotechnology engineering firm VSParticle. That's in contrast to perhaps the most well-known Japanese player: Softbank. Softbank is "totally different" from traditional Japanese investor cultures, given it is driven by founder Masayoshi Son's decisions rather than operating on a consensus basis, like most Japanese business, Sohara added. The venture firm, known for its lofty bets on WeWork and, more recently, chip company Arm, poured huge sums of cash into tech startups amid the 2021 venture capital tech boom, which saw at least one Japanese-linked investor involved in deals worth 11.2 billion euros, per the report. Softbank stood out during this period; it was involved in 22% of deals with Japanese-linked participation in 2021.

[TITLE]Wells Fargo Reaffirms Underweight on Tesla (TSLA) Amid Sharp Delivery Declines:
[TEXT]
Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is among the most fantastic stocks every investor should pay attention to. With its innovations in electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology, the company remains a leader in this industry. However, demand headwinds and rising competition seem to be weighing on its outlook, as evidenced by the subdued price targets and cautious ratings from many analysts in recent weeks.

Among the analysts who foresee a sharp downside in Tesla shares is Wells Fargo’s Colin Langan, who reaffirmed his Underweight rating and $120 price target on November 10, as reported by TheFly. Langan’s analysis suggests that deliveries are seeing a “widespread weakness” across the U.S., EU, South Korea, and China, the four markets he tracks. The trends are relatively better in the U.S. than in other markets. He emphasized that October deliveries are down roughly 23% year-over-year and 54% month-over-month, with year-to-date volumes lower by

[TITLE]Beam Global Announces Third Quarter 2025 Operating Results:
[TEXT]
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beam Global, (Nasdaq: BEEM), (the “Company”), a leading provider of innovative and sustainable infrastructure solutions for the electrification of transportation, energy security and smart city infrastructure, today announced its third quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2025.

Recent Operational Highlights

● Opened Beam Middle East offices and entered the MEA market through a joint venture with the Platinum Group in Abu Dhabi ● Deployed EV ARC™ and BeamBike™ systems in Abu Dhabi ● Deployed BeamWell™ product in Jordan for Royal Jordanian Armed Forces ● Deployed BeamBike™ product for tribal communities in the United States ● Signed reselling agreements with multiple qualified representatives in U.S. and Europe ● Granted renewal of General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract through October 31, 2030, enabling federal, state and local governments to purchase the Company’s products through the GSA MAS program ● Awarded purchasing contract by Sourcewell enabling federal, state and local government agencies, and higher education institutions across North America to easily purchase Beam Global products without the requirement for competitive bidding or RFP processes ● Granted several new valuable patents which increase barrier to entry for competition and further reinforce Beam Global’s moat ● Received TUV SUD 1090-2 EXC4 Level certification at Beam Europe ● Shipped Beam Global products to Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Nevada, Texas, Washington, Quebec, Illinois, Ontario, Alabama and internationally to Serbia, Romania, Greece, North Macedonia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro

Financial Highlights

● 67% of Revenues from Non-Government Commercial Entities Q3 YTD '25 ● 39% of Revenues from International operations Q3 YTD '25 ● Q3 YTD '25 Gross Margin 10%. Adjusted non-GAAP Gross Margin, net of non-cash costs, 22%, a 4-percentage point increase over non-cash Q3 YTD '24 ● Q3 YTD '25 Operating expenses adjusted for non-GAAP, net of non-cash costs, reduced by $1.9 million, a 14-percentage point improvement over Q3 YTD '24 ● Contracted backlog of $8 million ● Debt free and $100 million line of credit available and unused

“Although we had some unfortunate order timing in the 3rd quarter we simultaneously took some of the most important steps in our history for growth,” said Desmond Wheatley, CEO of Beam Global. “Our expansion into the Middle East, a market, which has announced it will invest $1 trillion in the next decade in sustainable infrastructure, has created new opportunities, not just for global growth, but also for a fantastic evolution of the uses of our products for drones and autonomous vehicles. Beam Global has always been a little ahead of its time, but now we’re finding that our superior battery technology, our ability to rapidly and autonomously deploy sustainable charging infrastructure which can charge autonomous vehicles, wirelessly, without any human intervention, and some of our other products like our BeamFlight™ (formerly UAV ARC) rapidly deployed and autonomous drone recharging product, are coming-of-age, particularly in markets like the Middle East where there is significant investment and a less burdensome regulatory environment. Electric bicycles are the fastest growing segment in mobility today globally and our approach to that market with BeamBike™ is the most rapidly deployed and scalable approach I’m aware of. Our ability to deploy electric bikes and charging infrastructure without construction or electrical work and without a utility bill put us in a position to compete for recurring revenue in a market where others are burdened by the costs, resources and risks associated with those activities. The successful deployment of BeamBike™ both in the United States and Abu Dhabi, is proof that there’s a great market for these products as well. We had some orders move right in the third quarter, but we will execute on them in the near future and in the meantime, we will continue to focus heavily on all the new opportunities that we have as a result of the expansion of our product portfolio and geographic footprint. We did all of this while remaining debt free, reducing our operating costs, maintaining sufficient cash and operating capital, and improving almost every other aspect of our operations.”

Revenues

For the quarter ended September 30, 2025, the Company’s revenues were $5.8 million, a decrease of 50%, driven largely by unfavorable order timing, compared to $11.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Revenues derived from non-government, commercial entities represented 82% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 48% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company’s revenues decreased 53% to $19.2 million compared to $40.9 million for the same period in 2024 driven largely by a reversal of the U.S. federal government’s commitment to electrify its fleets. Revenues to non-government, commercial entities grew to 67% of total revenues for the first nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 31% for the same period in 2024. International customers grew to 39% of the revenues for the first nine months of 2025 compared to 20% for the same period in 2024.

Gross Profit

Gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, was -1% as the Company reported a gross loss of $28 thousand driven by the impacts of fixed overhead allocations on reduced reported sales, compared to a 11% gross margin or gross profit of $1.2 million in 2024. The gross profit for 2025 and 2024 includes a non-cash negative impact of $0.6 million for depreciation and $0.2 million for amortization of intangible assets resulting from the All-Cell acquisition. Without these non-cash expenses, gross profit for 2025 would be $0.7 million with a 13% gross margin and gross profit for 2024 would be $2.0 million with an 18% gross margin.

Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was 10% compared to a gross margin of 12% for the same period ended 2024. The nine months ended September 30, 2025 excluding non-cash items of depreciation and intangible amortization, was 22% compared to 18%, a 4-percentage point increase.

The Company has continued to recognize synergies and report positive gross margins from the Company's acquisitions. We expect the Company’s revenue to grow in the future and the Company’s fixed overhead absorption to improve.

Operating Expenses

[TITLE]US slashes tariffs to 15% for Switzerland after reaching trade deal, boost bilateral investment:
[TEXT]
Live Events

Reduction of US tariffs on Swiss and Liechtenstein goods to a maximum of 15%, aligning them with rates applied to the European Union, down from 39%, which had severely impacted Swiss exports.

Switzerland's commitment to removing tariffs on American industrial goods, while also opening up new duty-free quota systems for specific U.S. agricultural products such as beef, poultry, and bison.

Measures to simplify customs and labeling processes, making it easier for American goods like poultry, dairy, and medical devices to enter Swiss markets.

Robust agreements on intellectual property rights, digital trade principles including the avoidance of harmful digital services taxes, and enhanced cooperation on export controls, sanctions, and investment screening.

Swiss plans to invest $200 billion in the U.S. by 2028, with substantial new investments focused on pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and other key sectors.

The United States and Switzerland announced a framework agreement which significantly reduces US tariffs on Swiss goods from a steep 39% to a balanced 15%, marking a major step in improving trade relations and addressing longstanding barriers.The deal also includes a commitment by Swiss and Liechtenstein companies to invest $200 billion in the US, with $67 billion slated for 2026 alone, aiming to create thousands of American jobs and reduce the US trade deficit with Switzerland.The agreement, announced by US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer and Swiss officials, reflects the successful culmination of constructive negotiations to promote “Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade."ALSO READ: Trump plots major tariff cuts to slash soaring grocery bills for millions of Americans Ambassador Greer highlighted the deal as a continuation of the "America First Trade Policy" that removes tariff and non-tariff barriers, expands market access for U.S. exports, and welcomes sizable Swiss investment into the US economy.Key features of the agreement include:Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said the agreement “puts Switzerland on an equal footing with the European Union.” The framework contains sectoral safeguards (the United States will cap tariffs at 15% for Swiss goods, and some sectors, notably pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, have special treatment or caps under the arrangement), but detailed implementation and any sectoral exemptions will be specified as negotiations proceed.The US trade deficit with Switzerland and Liechtenstein stood at $38.3 billion in 2024, and this agreement is expected to pave the way for levelling that deficit by 2028 by fostering more balanced, reciprocal trade ties.This trade deal ends months of tariff tensions that began when the Trump administration imposed the 39% tariffs in 2025 as part of a broader strategy to address trade imbalances and alleged unfair trade practices by key partners.The agreement is seen as a mutually beneficial framework that strengthens economic ties, secures supply chain resilience, and supports job growth on both sides of the Atlantic through expanded market access and substantial new investments.

Geneva: Switzerland announced plans on Friday to invest $200 billion in the United States through 2028 as the country finalised a hard-wrought deal to slash US tariffs on Swiss goods.Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said the Trump administration has agreed to cut US tariffs on most Swiss goods to 15%-the same level imposed on the neighboring European Union-from 39%, the highest rate on any Western country.Speaking to reporters in Bern, the capital, Parmelin hailed the deal as a result of "new momentum generated by the commitment of the American president" and said it would take "several weeks" to take effect.The White House confirmed the deal Friday, adding that companies from Switzerland and tiny Liechtenstein would invest $67 billion of the $200 billion in the United States next year."These investments will create thousands of well-paying American jobs across all 50 states in a number of sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical devices, aerospace, construction, advanced manufacturing, gold manufacturing, and energy infrastructure," said a White House fact sheet.The US consistently runs a deficit-more than $38 billion last year-in the trade of goods with Switzerland. The White House said "this deal with Switzerland will put us on a path to eliminate that deficit by 2028.''

[TITLE]Exclusive-A new rare earth crisis is brewing as yttrium shortages spread:
[TEXT]
By Lewis Jackson, Allison Lampert, Fanny Potkin and Ernest Scheyder

BEIJING/MONTREAL/SINGAPORE/HOUSTON (Reuters) -Global supplies of the rare earth element yttrium are running low due to Chinese export restrictions, sparking fears of shortages and surging costs that could hit aerospace, energy and semiconductor production.

China, the main source of the element used in speciality alloys found in ​engines as well as coatings to shield against high temperatures, restricted exports along with six other rare earths in April in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.

While a high-stakes meeting last month between U.‌S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had raised industry hopes for a more reliable flow of critical materials, the dispute has not been fully resolved.

So while China has since paused some of its rare earth restrictions, its April controls remain in place,‌ raising questions
