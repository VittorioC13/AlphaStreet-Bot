[TITLE]Who's behind the deep-pocketed private equity firm that's bought into Therme? - Spacing Toronto:
[TEXT]
Back in the summer, Therme went public with a somewhat perplexing development in its corporate life — a €1 billion merger of its two, somewhat related, operating divisions: Therme Erding, which owns the legacy spa in Munich built by founder Josef Wund and Therme’s Bucharest location, constructed just under a decade ago and helmed by CEO Robert Hanea.

The new entity, dubbed Therme Horizon, would also “co-invest” in the company’s long-delayed Manchester spa, which remains a fallow industrial site in a large mall area in a suburb known as Trafford City. The operator will be a U.K. asset management firm called Peel Waters, and the current target opening date is either 2027 or 2028.

The previously undisclosed fact that these were distinct entities was first reported last April by the New York Times, which noted that the company “misrepresented” itself to the Ontario government in regards to the details of its corporate structure. The Times investigation “revealed [that] Therme falsely presented itself as an industry player that operated as many as half a dozen spas in Europe. In fact, it had built and operated just one, outside Bucharest.”

These corporate moves also introduced a new player into Ontario’s Therme drama — a sprawling Luxembourg-based private equity firm known as CVC Capital Partners, which currently has €201 billion invested in dozens of corporate assets around the world. The company dates back to the early 1980s, when Citicorp spun off its venture investment arm.

CVC’s portfolio includes the luxury watch brand Breitling and the Lipton teas group, as well as firms in sectors such as insurance, infrastructure, business services, chemicals, health care, sports teams and consumer goods. It owns two Canadian companies — a Quebec City ad agency, Plus Company, and TechInsights, a technology market analysis consultancy based in Nepean, Ont. Therme Horizon is listed among CVC’s consumer/retail holdings, which is a grab bag of brands, online educational offerings and at least two digital gaming platforms.

Typically, the way private equity companies raise capital is through offerings to limited partnership (LP) funds, which become the vehicles for investing is specific companies. The Therme Horizon investment came from CVC Capital Partners IX, which finished amassing a €26 billion war-chest in July, 2023, targeting deals in Europe and the Americas.

While CVC’s new stake in Therme’s European and U.K. spas could indicate further capital investments in, or loans to, the company’s other spa projects, including the one at Ontario Place, there’s no guarantee, as private equity firms tend to be highly opportunistic with their acquisitions. What we do know, however, is that a buyout fund with very deep pockets has placed a bet on the company’s destination wellness vision.

Here’s what else Spacing has found out

[TITLE]This one Costco item has skyrocketed 108% in price over just 2 years. Now the retail giant is restricting purchases:

For bargain hunters, Costco has long been a go-to destination. The warehouse giant famously still sells its hot dog and soda combo for $1.50 — the same price it launched with back in the mid-1980s. But not every Costco item has held its price as stubbornly as the hot dog combo.

Case in point: gold bars.

In late 2023, Costco began selling 1-ounce gold bars. At the time, shoppers could choose between two types: the PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan bar and the Rand Refinery bar, priced at $1,979.99 and $1,949.99, respectively, according to Business Insider. Despite the hefty price tag, both quickly became hot sellers (1).

Must Read

Fast forward to today, and not much has changed — except the price.

As of December 2025, the Pamp Suisse bar sells for $4,119.99, an increase of 108% (2).

The jump in price is in line with the broader gold market, which has surged roughly 65% over the course of 2025. What’s more surprising is the continued demand.

Customers are now restricted to “one transaction per membership, with a maximum of 4 units per 24 hours”, according to the Costco website (3).

Why investors are flocking to gold

Gold has long been viewed as a way to preserve purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it can’t be printed at will by central banks.

It’s also considered a classic safe haven. Gold isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to it — driving prices higher.

That’s exactly what appears to be happening now. Markets are getting whipsawed by tariff uncertainty, rising deficits and global tensions — and gold has emerged as a rare bright spot.

Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, also highlighted gold’s importance as part of a resilient portfolio.

“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier (4).”

Gold hit a peak price of $4,371.78 per ounce in October, and many experts expect it to continue to rise as stock market outlooks get shaky (5).

[TITLE]Stocks See Support from Economic Confidence After Strong US GDP Report:
[TEXT]
The Wall Street sign is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange by hapabapa via iStock

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Tuesday rose +0.46%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) rose +0.16%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) rose +0.50%. March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) rose +0.42%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) rose +0.49%.

Stock indexes closed higher on Tuesday on reinforced confidence in US economic fundamentals after the stronger-than-expected US Q3 GDP report of +4.3%, although most of the other economic reports were weaker-than-expected. In any case, stocks were undercut as the odds for a Fed rate cut at the next meeting on Jan 27-28 dropped to 13% from 20%. Also, the 10-year T-note yield rose slightly.

US Q3 real GDP rose +4.3% (q/q annualized), stronger than expectations of +3.3% and the Q2 rate of +2.5%. The Q3 GDP Price Index rose +3.8% (q/q annualized), much stronger than expectations of +2.7% and up from Q2’s +2.1%. The Q3 core PCE Price Index rose +2.9% (q/q annualized), in line with expectations but up from Q2’s +2.6%.

The Conference Board’s Dec US consumer confidence index fell by -3.8 points to 89.1 from Nov’s revised level of 92.9 (preliminary 88.7), weaker than expectations for a report of 91.0.

The Dec Philadelphia Fed non-manufacturing index fell by -0.5 points to -16.8 from -16.3 in Nov, which was weaker than expectations for a rise to -15.0.

Oct durable goods orders fell -2.2% m/m, which was weaker than expectations of -1.5%. Oct durable goods orders ex-transportation rose +0.2% m/m, slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.3%. Oct core capital goods orders (ex transportation and defense), a proxy for capital spending, rose +0.5% m/m, which was slightly stronger than market expectations of +0.3%.

Nov US industrial production fell -0.1% m/m, slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.1%. Nov manufacturing production fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than market expectations of +0.1%.

The Dec Richmond Fed manufacturing index rose by +8 points to -7 from Nov’s -15, and was stronger than market expectations of -10.

Seasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.

The markets are discounting a 13% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on January 27-28.

Overseas stock markets rose slightly on Tuesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.10%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.07% for the fifth consecutive daily gain. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.02%.

Interest Rates

March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) on Tuesday fell by -1.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose by +0.2 bp to 4.165%. T-note prices fell on the stronger-than-expected US Q3 GDP report of +4.3%, although most of the other economic reports released Tuesday were mildly weaker than expected on balance.

T-note prices were also undercut by supply overhang. The Treasury on Tuesday sold $70 billion of 5-year T-notes and $28 billion of 2-year floating rate notes. The Treasury will sell $44 billion of 7-year T-notes on Wednesday.

European government bond yields ended lower. The 10-year German bund yield on Tuesday fell back from Monday’s 9-month high and ended the day down -3.6 bp at 2.862%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell by -2.7 bp to 4.509%.

Swaps are discounting a 0% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.

US Stock Movers

The Magnificent Seven stocks all closed higher on Tuesday except for Tesla. Nvidia (NVDA) rallied by more then +3%. Alphabet (GOOGL)and Amazon.com (AMZN) closed up by more than +1%.

Chip stocks closed mixed. Marvel Technology (MRVL) and Nvidia (NVDA) rallied by more than +3%, while Globalfoundries (GFS) was the weakest chip stock with a loss of -1.7%.

Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks traded lower, with Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) falling about -0.8%.

Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell by more than -5%, and Strategy (MSTR) fell by nearly -4%. Coinbase Global (COIN) and Mara Holdings (MARA) fell by more than -2%.

Miners saw support as gold, silver, and copper all posted new record highs on Tuesday. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) closed up +2.5%, and Newmont Mining (NEM) closed up +0.35%.

Sable Offshore Corp (SOC) soared by +36% after news that the US Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration approved the company’s Las Flores pipeline restart plan.

Zim Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM) rallied more than +5% after news of buyout interest from multiple potential bidders.

[TITLE]Global stocks rise amid strong US economic data:
[TEXT]
US stocks were up after stronger than expected US economic data.

Major stock indexes were up marginally and US bond yields rose on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected US economic data, while the yen shot up after warnings from Tokyo on its readiness to support the battered currency.

Dublin

Euronext Dublin finished the day down 0.3 per cent on what was a subdued day for the market as investors wound down for Christmas.

Ryanair finished down 0.2 per cent as the market shrugged off the imposition of a €255.8 million fine by Italy’s competition watchdog for abusing a dominant position in its dealings with travel agents.

“The markets just ignored that as they get with them regularly and they are often overturned,” said a trader. “They are appealing it. If the fine stands, it will be quite serious.”

Most stocks finished up in the red, but Uniphar was big loser on the day as it sank 3.7 per cent. “There was a seller around on that stock,” the trader noted.

Among the financial names, AIB and Bank of Ireland 0.2 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.

Elsewhere, food giant Kerry Group and insulation specialist Kingspan – two of the heavyweights on the index – closed down 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.

London

UK stocks little changed as gains in healthcare were offset by losses in consumer staples, with trading subdued during a shortened three-day week leading up to Christmas.

The FTSE 100 was up 0.06 per cent. The index continued its upward momentum in the previous session, having reached a five-week high on Friday, a ​day after the Bank of England’s 25-basis-point interest rate cut.

The domestically focused midcap FTSE 250 index added 0.07 per cent amid thin volumes.

Among sectors, healthcare stocks were up 0.5 per cent, mirroring gains in European peers. Oxford Nanopore Technologies gained 1.3 per cent, while Oxford Biomedica and AstraZeneca added 0.8 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.

Consumer staples lagged, with the index of personal goods down 0.8 per cent and beverage slipping 0.4 per cent.

Europe

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index finished up 0.4 per cent after it briefly hit a record high on gains in the healthcare sector.

Novo Nordisk shares rallied after the Food and Drug Administration approved its weight-loss pill, giving the Danish drugmaker a competitive edge in the fast-evolving obesity treatment market.

The approval positions Novo Nordisk ahead in the race for a potent oral weight-loss medication as it works to recover market share lost to Eli Lilly.

New York

Wall Street’s main indexes were little changed in choppy trading, pausing after three sessions of gains as Treasury yields climbed following stronger-than-expected economic data.

The US economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending. Early estimates showed gross domestic product increased at a 4.3 per cent annualised rate last quarter, much above economists’ forecast for a rise at 3.3 per cent pace.

Six of the 11 S&P sectors gained, led by energy and communication services. Consumer staples and real estate were the laggards.

A rebound in technology stocks and a cooler-than-expected November inflation report have fuelled US stocks in the past three sessions, bringing the benchmark S&P 500 within the 0.5 per cent of its December 11 record close.

All three main were set for their third straight yearly gain. The S&P 500 and the Dow were also on track to rise for the eighth consecutive month.

US-listed shares of precious metal miners extended their recent gains after gold and silver prices surged to all-time highs against a weakening dollar and as geopolitical tensions buoyed safe-haven demand.

US military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls rose 1.4 per cent after US president Donald Trump announced plans for a new “Trump class” of battleships, which he said would be larger, faster and “100 times more powerful” than any previously built. – Additional reporting: Agencies

[TITLE]California’s minimum wage is increasing in 2026 as LA debates $30 an hour:
[TEXT]
Californians will see the minimum wage increase to $16.90 per hour starting Jan. 1. The adjustment — a boost of 40 cents per hour — was calculated in August by the Department of Finance as part of its minimum wage annual review required by state law.

California has been raising its minimum wage over the past decade. Former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 signed a watershed law to increase minimum wage from $10.50 per hour to $15 per hour, plus annual adjustments for inflation.

The current rate of $16.50 per hour suggests that a minimum wage worker needs to work 98 hours per week to afford a one-bedroom rental at fair market rent in California, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

California is one of 19 states to raise minimum wages in 2026, according to payroll company ADP. Cities and counties can also set their own minimum wages. This year, over two dozen local jurisdictions have increased local minimum wages. West Hollywood will have a $20.25 minimum wage starting in January — the highest of any California city, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center.

Voters last November narrowly rejected a ballot measure that would have increased the minimum wage to $18 per hour. But some low-wage workers this year have successfully lobbied for bumps in pay in specific industries.

Under laws Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023, fast food workers earn a minimum wage wage of $20 an hour and health care workers are on track to make $25 an hour.

That momentum extended to Los Angeles hotel and airport employees. Labor organizers in May secured a city minimum wage increase to $30 per hour for those workers by the 2028 Olympics. Large businesses fought back, arguing that wage hikes will only increase challenges for the tourism industry, which is still struggling to find its footing after the pandemic.

After failing to gather enough signatures for a ballot measure to repeal the new minimum wage, business groups later filed a different measure that could gut millions of dollars of revenue from the city’s general fund.

Following the move, Los Angeles City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson this month introduced a motion to delay the full wage increase from taking effect until 2030, according the Los Angeles Times.

Labor leaders rebuked the motion, calling it “repulsive.”

“You can’t threaten to blow a hole in our budget and then the only way to stop it is on the backs of workers,” said Kurt Petersen, co-president of the union that represents many hotel workers, UNITE HERE Local 11. “That kind of raw extortion and shakedown has no place in our city.”

According to Peterson, a coalition of community organizations and unions are beginning to collect signatures for a ballot measure that would raise the minimum wage to $30 per hour for all workers in Los Angeles.

Disaster relief budget for flood-hit Sumatra sufficient, minister says

Related news: BNPB to finish temporary homes in Agam before schools reopen

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa stated that the budget for disaster recovery in Sumatra is sufficient, ensuring there is no need to reallocate funds from the Free Nutritious Meals (MBG) program.He told the press here on Wednesday that the Indonesian government had set aside Rp60 trillion (around US$3.58 billion) for disaster recovery in Sumatra.According to him, the proposed funding needed to recover the three flood- and landslide-hit provinces in Sumatra, namely Aceh, North Sumatra, and West Sumatra, has only reached approximately Rp51 trillion.With these funds available, Purbaya emphasized that the government remains committed to implementing the MBG program as planned.Several members of the House of Representatives (DPR) had proposed diverting a portion of the MBG budget to accelerate disaster response measures across Sumatra.Deputy Chair of Commission IX of the DPR, Charles Honoris, argued that distributing free meals during the school holiday period risks being ineffective, adding that the funds are more urgently needed to address evacuees' nutritional needs and to repair healthcare facilities in disaster-stricken areas.In response, the National Nutrition Agency (BGN), which is tasked with implementing the MBG program, asserted that any decision to change budget allocations falls entirely under the authority of the president and the Ministry of Finance.Amid the school holiday period, the agency is continuing to distribute free meals to students to ensure optimal budget absorption.Devastating floods and landslides struck Aceh, North Sumatra, and West Sumatra in late November 2025 following high-intensity rainfall.The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) data showed that as of December 24, the death toll from the disasters had reached 1,129, while 174 people remain missing.The disasters damaged a total of 157,838 houses, including 47,165 that were severely damaged.

[TITLE]India’s booming fashion industry is a climate nightmare that demands clean-up action right away:
[TEXT]
India’s fashion story need not become a climate disaster because the country still has an advantage that Europe and North America lost decades ago. Our apparel market and industrial base are still being built and consumer habits are not yet fully entrenched. Industrial clusters are not locked into high-carbon infrastructure. We could embed climate discipline into this phase of growth rather than trying to retrofit it later at vastly higher cost and against fiercer resistance.

[TITLE]How brands shifted marketing and media strategies through year of tariffs:
[TEXT]
The tariff policies imposed by U.S. President Trump at the beginning of his second term in office turned 2025 on its head for marketers.

Joshua Scherz was among them. Scherz is the founder of Bela, a family-owned seafood brand based in Maine that imports canned sardines from Portugal. Hoping to take advantage of rising demand for premium canned seafood among U.S. consumers, Bela rebranded and launched a direct-to-consumer (DTC) business at the end of January — right into the teeth of President Trump’s trade war.

What should have been a celebratory year for the 28-year-old business proved to be one of its hardest. “We took a margin hit,” said Scherz. And Bela wasn’t the only one.

For Sam Piliero, CEO and founder of media agency The Moonlighters, it’s been a “whirlwind” of a year. The agency works with almost 100 brands, 80% of which are e-commerce businesses – many spending between $1 million-$10 million annually. During the choppiest period of Trump’s tariff maneuvers, Piliero estimated some clients cut back on media spending by 50% as they navigated higher costs on imported goods and the end of the de minimis shipping exemption.

“Some of the smaller businesses that weren’t prepared for this had to cut a lot of operational costs,” he said.

‘High degree of uncertainty’

Though the political drama around tariffs quieted down in the second half of the year, their economic impact will be felt for months to come. The IMF, for example, predicted nominal GDP growth will fall from 9.1% in 2024 to 6.8% in 2026. Though many businesses absorbed the additional cost, many more chose to increase consumer prices, leading to loss of real income for the average American household of $1,257, according to Yale University’s Budget Lab.

And although the ad market remained stronger than most expected — WPP recently upgraded its 2025 ad revenue growth projections from 7.7% in 2024, to 8.8% — businesses large and small were forced to devote time and money to navigate the shifting regulatory maze.

“There were shipments that we lost money on because we didn’t want to upset our retailers,” recalled Bogg Bag founder and CEO Kim Vaccarella. The company’s brightly colored bags, which are popular on social media platforms including TikTok, were all manufactured in China at the beginning of the year, putting the company on the hook for tariffs initially as high as 145%.

Though that figure has reduced, the firm no longer depends solely on Chinese suppliers. “By the end of December, we’ll have 50% [of our suppliers] in Vietnam,” said Vaccarella. “Unfortunately … there still isn’t a lot of certainty. But you still have to run the business.”

Target, already weathering one of the rockiest years in its history, has had to manage similar disruption on a much larger scale. In May, a 5.7% fall in sales was attributed to the introduction of tariffs. “The difficulty level has been incredibly high, given the magnitude of the rates we’re facing and a high degree of uncertainty,” CEO Brian Cornell told analysts that month.

‘We scaled back significantly’

In some cases, brands had to choose between media budgets or their price margins. Vaccarella said that Bogg Bag reduced its ad spending by 10%, as part of a wider cost-cutting push that enabled it to hold prices. “We scaled back on that [advertising] significantly in that period,” she said.

Within his agency’s roster, Piliero saw several clients move production out of China to countries with smaller tariffs, such as Brazil and Mexico, while two apparel clients stopped advertising altogether. More typically, those clients that had reduced their spending in the first half of the year ended up increasing investment just months later. Piliero told Digiday revenues and client accounts had both doubled in 2025. He didn’t provide financial specifics.

Not every brand choosing to absorb rising costs altered its advertising plans. Some cut back on free online returns, while others rethought their promotional calendar — and some international brands stepped back from the U.S. altogether (and some U.S. brands leant farther into overseas markets).

At Bela, which faced a 15% blanket tariff on goods from the European Union, Scherz decided not to raise prices and not to cut paid media investment. The brand originally planned on spending 15% of its sales on advertising, the bulk on Instagram and Facebook (Scherz didn’t provide a dollar amount).

But as well as additional costs, delays moving goods through ports during the spring led to stock shortages. “After 28 years, I pride myself on being in stock — even throughout the entire pandemic. This was a much more challenging year than the pandemic,” he said.

The shortages led Bela to focus promotional efforts on the products it had over the ones it couldn’t ship (in this case, piri-piri sardines over lemon sardines). As a result, Scherz’s team tilted the campaign supporting Bela’s DTC business farther into brand storytelling, and away from emphasizing specific products.

In Target’s case, the retailer chose to refocus its campaign messaging on own-brand product lines and its decision not to raise prices. “We continue to see strong consumer response to campaigns that clearly communicate savings, newly lowered prices and stylish, on-trend items at affordable price,” chief guest experience officer Cara Sylvester said in an email.

Noble West, a full-service agency that works with food and beverage firms Sun Valley Rice and nut company Minturn, found clients willing to take a similar direction. Founder and CEO Ali Cox told Digiday the tariffs had granted some of its clients a window to reinforce regional credentials.

“In times of international uncertainty it’s actually an opportunity to double-down on the safety and ‘local’ story,” she said. The agency’s clients had refocused on content marketing and social campaign activity; she declined to provide specific examples.

‘A good problem to have’

Marketers deciding whether to change course – and if so, how – have had to juggle opportunity cost alongside rising real costs. In many cases, the impact of tariffs wasn’t felt by businesses until months after they were imposed – just as they went into the make-or-break Q4 sales period. Some marketers cut back on creator spending in response.

According to John Shea, head of commerce at PMG, while some clients reduced their spending in that period, high e-commerce demand among shoppers meant most kept their investments in place. As a result, PMG’s revenue during the fourth quarter was “slightly better than expectation”, he noted, without providing specifics.

Elsewhere, Piliero said clients were less willing to take a chance on channels with unproven performance, preferring to keep budget focused on Facebook or Google’s search inventory.

While 2026 should bring fewer surprises, businesses that chose to absorb higher costs will have to choose whether or not they continue to do so — and if so, whether to cut marketing spend to maintain profit margins. At full-service agency Moroch, CEO Matt Powell said he expects one or two “very conservative” clients to cut media spend by 5-10%, while others are set to take a wait-and-see approach.

Shea hopes 2026 will bring relative calm after the “super turbulent” 2025, while major sporting events like the World Cup and Winter Olympics offer the chance of boosting brand spending. “I think you’re going to expect an extra 2% bump in overall media spending just [from those] cultural moments,” he suggested.

Despite the turbulence, Bela’s DTC business caught an updraft. Speaking to Digiday a week after visiting Portugal to visit olive oil suppliers, Scherz said the company recorded “exponential growth” in sales. In 2026, he said the brand will promote its full range of items and forge ahead on its DTC business.

“We were confronted with logistical challenges and inventory challenges, but the demand for canned fish is insane” he said. “That’s a good problem to have.”

[TITLE]India’s creator economy 2026: From commerce to contracts, a year of maturity:
[TEXT]
Dear reader, as 2025, a year of global tumult and volatility, rolls by, Mint's reporters and columnists look around the corner on what is coming in 2026—to help you know what to expect and prepare for it. Tell us what you think at feedback@livemint.com.

In 2025, India’s creator economy went from strength to strength, expanding nearly 25% to touch ₹4,500 crore, up from ₹3,600 crore last year, according to India Influencer Marketing Report 2025 by The Goat Agency and Kantar.

The boom was powered by India’s insatiable appetite for snackable digital content, smarter data-driven tools, and a growing audience base clustering around niche and vernacular creators.

The momentum shows no signs of slowing as 2025 rolls into a new year. As brand playbooks evolve, policy support emerges, and e-commerce partnerships deepen, the independent content industry is poised to enter a phase of strategic maturity and scale.

Here are 10 trends shaping India’s creator economy in 2026, based on the early signals already coming into view.

1. From content to commerce

India’s creator economy, which already influences $350-400 billion in consumer spending, is on track to power over $1 trillion in creator-driven commerce by 2030, as per data from consultancy BCG. While brand collaborations remain a key pillar, the real acceleration is coming from e-commerce and content platforms backing creators heavily to drive sales.

Platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, and Nykaa are expanding their commission-based influencer programmes, while content giants are ramping up efforts around affiliate marketing models. YouTube, for instance, has already partnered with Flipkart, Myntra, Nykaa, and Purplle for its affiliate initiative and may soon bring Amazon on board. Meta, meanwhile, is working with Wishlink to strengthen its creator-affiliate ecosystem.

As a result, affiliate marketing and social commerce are expected to see strong growth through the next year, with a growing share of creator earnings tied directly to product sales and commissions.

2. Global format shows come to India

The year 2025 cemented India’s appetite for format-based shows. Despite the India’s Got Latent controversy, several homegrown shows like Judge Me If You Can, Brocode Roast, The Nation Wants to Guess, and Madhur Model dominated YouTube charts and some of them landed sponsors such as Cashify and Brocode.

In 2026, the trend is going global. We’re already seeing early signs of cross-border collaborations. Popular British YouTuber KSI is filming his show Try Not to Laugh in Mumbai, featuring creators such as Tanmay Bhat, CarryMinati (Ajey Nagar), Fukraa Insaan (Abhishek Malhan), and Samay Raina in January 2026. British creator Max Klymenko’s hit career-guessing series Career Ladder is also expected to be shot in India.

3. Microdramas go mainstream—now with brands in the script

In 2025, a new storytelling format emerged on social media: microdramas, which last between 60 and 180 seconds. These bite-sized, serialized stories—each ending in suspense—captivated millions and kept audiences coming back for more. Their viral rise pushed not just influencers and content houses, but even local OTT platforms and content startups, to experiment with the format.

In 2026, microdramas will evolve again—this time as a tool for brand storytelling, say experts. Companies are using their own social media pages to roll out episodic narratives centred on products, employees, and behind-the-scenes moments. Meanwhile, more creators are using microdramas to repackage long-form content into shorts, in turn boosting engagement and retention.

4. ‘ Thank you’ and ‘Welcome’ DMs: Turning followers into loyalists

Brands have realized that niche creators with smaller but engaged audiences often deliver better ROI than mass influencers. In response, creators are doubling down on community-building—a strategy that not only attracts brand collaborations but also drives paid memberships and subscriptions on Instagram and YouTube, a trend that gained traction in 2025.

To fuel this engagement loop, the Meta-Wishlink tie-up has birthed a new tool to deepen relationships between creators and followers. Built on the success of 2025’s Direct Message (DM) automation tools (originally used to send product links), this update helps creators send automatic ‘thank you’ messages when followers share their content and personalized ‘welcome’ notes to a new follower.

The idea is simple but powerful—make every follower belong to the community, encouraging them to engage more.

5. AI becomes both a boon and a battleground for creators

Artificial intelligence is now an inseparable part of content creation in India. AI has helped both cost and speed in drafting scripts, editing videos, and generating copyright-free visuals. However, as the line between human and machine-generated content blurs, the industry has a challenge: authenticity and attribution.

While emerging AI guidelines require creators to disclose the use of AI tools, compliance remains a major hurdle. If enforcing brand partnership disclosures has proven tough, AI-use declarations may be even harder.

In 2026, we can expect a twin trend: a surge in AI-powered content creation and the parallel rise of the AI-detection and verification software industry, as platforms and brands race to preserve credibility in an increasingly automated ecosystem.

6. More creators seek legal protection for their personality rights

In a landmark move, Raj Shamani recently became the first Indian influencer to formally acquire personality rights—a legal safeguard that prevents others from commercially exploiting a person’s image, content, or identifiable traits.

Traditionally associated with Bollywood celebrities such as Amitabh Bachchan, Jacky Shroff, and Anil Kapoor, this protection is now making its way into the creator economy. Legal experts told Mint that several more mega influencers—those with over a million followers—are expected to pursue similar protections in 2026.

The likelihood of approval, they added, will depend on how significantly the misuse of a creator’s name or likeness impacts the public, especially in sensitive categories such as finance or health.

Beyond safeguarding identity, these rights could also help tackle a growing industry problem: misrepresentation by fake talent managers who claim to represent top creators.

7. XR creators and India’s AVGC boom

Following the first edition of the World Audio Visual & Entertainment Summit (WAVES) in 2025, India’s AVGC sector—animation, visual effects, gaming, and comics—gained significant policy and media momentum.

The domestic gaming industry’s rapid expansion is fuelling parallel growth among XR (extended reality) creators, who build lenses, filters, and immersive effects for social media content and earn substantial revenue from them. Once reliant on Snapchat for monetization, XR creators are diversifying as YouTube onboards them and Meta prepares to revive partnerships in 2026.

Meanwhile, the surge in anime and manga fandom is accelerating the broader animation and comics ecosystem, with more studios producing Indian comics, manga-style stories that blend desi mythology, and indigenous animated IPs to meet the rising demand.

8. Multi-platform storytelling: Creators go omnichannel

Until 2025, most creators primarily stuck to one or two platforms—primarily Instagram and YouTube. However, with Snapchat doubling down on India, creators are mastering multi-format storytelling by adapting the same content for each platform’s strengths: behind-the-scenes and authentic stories on Snapchat, long-form videos and Shorts on YouTube, and polished Reels on Instagram.

India’s massive user base—making it one of top three markets for these platforms—has intensified the competition, pushing creators to maximize reach and monetization across ecosystems.

Emerging players are also joining the fray: WhatsApp channels are leveraging celebrity communities, LinkedIn is testing video formats for professional creators, and homegrown apps like Moj and ShareChat are targeting Tier II and III audiences with vernacular content.

9. Brands weigh their option on a data scale

Brands are increasingly scrutinizing influencer ROI amid uncertainty, making data the decisive factor in campaign decisions. While the influencer marketing software-as-a-service (SaaS) sector has matured, platforms like Instagram are now offering built-in analytics tools directly, empowering brands to evaluate metrics such as engagement rates, audience demographics, and conversion potential before committing budgets.

Gone are the days of gut-feel allocations; 2026 will see more campaigns built on data insights, ensuring creators are selected based on performance rather than follower counts or estimates.

10. Bulletproof contracts: Legal protection matures

The creator economy has learned hard lessons from legal battles of 2024 and 2025, prompting agencies to turn to ironclad contracts that vet campaign scripts and terms upfront—dodging summons and disputes. Even independent creators are now consulting attorneys directly, moving beyond verbal ‘yeses’ to signed paperwork.

This professionalization is tackling one of the industry’s biggest pain points: payment ambiguity and delays. No more waiting three months for earnings—clearer terms mean faster, reliable payouts.

In 2026, expect this trend to boost creator confidence, reduce disputes, and attract more brands to a more secure ecosystem.

[TITLE]Socure Acquires BNPL Consumer Credit Database Qlarifi:
[TEXT]
Identity verification, compliance, and risk decisioning platform Socure has acquired Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) consumer credit database, Qlarifi. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The acquisition will create a unified, identity, anti-fraud BNPL credit infrastructure to help consumers build credit responsibly.

New York-based Socure has been a Finovate alum since 2013. Johnny Ayers is Founder and CEO.

Global identity, compliance, and risk decisioning platform Socure has acquired real-time Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) consumer credit database, Qlarifi. The combination will create a unified identity, anti-fraud BNPL credit infrastructure helping consumers build credit responsibly, enabling lenders to confidently offer financing to more qualified customers, while providing transparency and increased consumer protection that regulators increasingly demand.

“BNPL has outgrown the legacy systems that were never designed to support their innovative lending products,” Socure Founder and CEO Johnny Ayers said. “At the same time, consumers deserve a safe path to build credit, lenders need real-time visibility to reduce fraud and risk, and regulators require transparency and reporting. Qlarifi built the first real-time BNPL consumer credit database, and by combining it with SocureID and our Identity Graph, we can deliver the unified infrastructure that all market participants have been asking for.”

Buy Now Pay Later is a growing component of the e-commerce ecosystem, with nearly 6% of all online transactions in the US relying on BNPL. With growth of more than 20% in the US, spending on BNPL is poised to top $700 billion globally by 2028. The rise of BNPL presents a challenge to both conventional credit reporting systems and infrastructure, however. These systems were not built for the kind of high frequency, small dollar amount lending decisions made in milliseconds that characterizes BNPL. Moreover, lenders have little visibility into the creditworthiness of borrowers, especially when it comes to cross provider visibility. This can expose merchants to significant losses and even increased fraud rates. Furthermore, unlike other credit schemes, BNPL also tends to leave consumers without a path to build credit.

In response, Qlarifi’s platform enables BNPL providers to safely extend financing to qualified customers, while identifying high-risk behavior such as loan stacking and financial crime such as first-party fraud. Already piloted effectively with its partners in Europe, Qlarifi is designed specifically to help lenders protect their customers from overextension and reduce the risk for BNPL providers. Integrated with Socure’s Identity Graph intelligence and RiskOS decisioning engine, lenders will be able to validate identity across BNPL providers, enable thin file customers (those with limited credit history) to access credit responsibly, and reduce fraud-related payment costs for merchants.

“We built Qlarifi to solve a very real pain point: the lack of infrastructure to protect consumers from overextending themselves across multiple BNPL providers,” Qlarifi CEO and Co-founder Alex Naughton said. “By joining forces with Socure, we now have their tremendous commercial scale, balance sheet, and world-class analytics behind us to build the infrastructure that will enable responsible lending at scale and demonstrate to regulators that the industry can protect consumers while expanding access to credit.”

Headquartered in London and founded in 2023, Qlarifi offers a BNPL consumer credit database, providing lenders with BNPL transaction history data to enable them to make more informed underwriting decisions. The solution helps consumers access the right credit products for their needs, provides enhanced fraud protection, and reduces scoring costs while enabling lenders to mitigate operational risks through an emphasis on data privacy and data minimization.

New York-based Socure has been a Finovate alum since 2013. The company leverages AI and machine learning, along with trusted online and offline data intelligence, to verify identities in real time. A leading digital identity verification and trust platform, Socure has more than 2,000 customers in financial services, e-commerce, healthcare, and other industries, and includes four of the top five banks, seven of the top 10 card issuers, and more than 250 of the largest fintechs among its clients.
