[TITLE]Responsible AI design in healthcare and life sciences:
[TEXT]
Generative AI has emerged as a transformative technology in healthcare, driving digital transformation in essential areas such as patient engagement and care management. It has shown potential to revolutionize how clinicians provide improved care through automated systems with diagnostic support tools that provide timely, personalized suggestions, ultimately leading to better health outcomes. For example, a study reported in BMC Medical Education that medical students who received large language model (LLM)-generated feedback during simulated patient interactions significantly improved their clinical decision-making compared to those who did not.

At the center of most generative AI systems are LLMs capable of generating remarkably natural conversations, enabling healthcare customers to build products across billing, diagnosis, treatment, and research that can perform tasks and operate independently with human oversight. However, the utility of generative AI requires an understanding of the potential risks and impacts on healthcare service delivery, which necessitates the need for careful planning, definition, and execution of a system-level approach to building safe and responsible generative AI-infused applications.

In this post, we focus on the design phase of building healthcare generative AI applications, including defining system-level policies that determine the inputs and outputs. These policies can be thought of as guidelines that, when followed, help build a responsible AI system.

Designing responsibly

LLMs can transform healthcare by reducing the cost and time required for considerations such as quality and reliability. As shown in the following diagram, responsible AI considerations can be successfully integrated into an LLM-powered healthcare application by considering quality, reliability, trust, and fairness for everyone. The goal is to promote and encourage certain responsible AI functionalities of AI systems. Examples include the following:

Each component’s input and output is aligned with clinical priorities to maintain alignment and promote controllability

Safeguards, such as guardrails, are implemented to enhance the safety and reliability of your AI system

Comprehensive AI red-teaming and evaluations are applied to the entire end-to-end system to assess safety and privacy-impacting inputs and outputs

Conceptual architecture

The following diagram shows a conceptual architecture of a generative AI application with an LLM. The inputs (directly from an end-user) are mediated through input guardrails. After the input has been accepted, the LLM can process the user’s request using internal data sources. The output of the LLM is again mediated through guardrails and can be shared with end-users.

Establish governance mechanisms

When building generative AI applications in healthcare, it’s essential to consider the various risks at the individual model or system level, as well as at the application or implementation level. The risks associated with generative AI can differ from or even amplify existing AI risks. Two of the most important risks are confabulation and bias:

Confabulation — The model generates confident but erroneous outputs, sometimes referred to as hallucinations. This could mislead patients or clinicians.

— The model generates confident but erroneous outputs, sometimes referred to as hallucinations. This could mislead patients or clinicians. Bias — This refers to the risk of exacerbating historical societal biases among different subgroups, which can result from non-representative training data.

To mitigate these risks, consider establishing content policies that clearly define the types of content your applications should avoid generating. These policies should also guide how to fine-tune models and which appropriate guardrails to implement. It is crucial that the policies and guidelines are tailored and specific to the intended use case. For instance, a generative AI application designed for clinical documentation should have a policy that prohibits it from diagnosing diseases or offering personalized treatment plans.

Additionally, defining clear and detailed policies that are specific to your use case is fundamental to building responsibly. This approach fosters trust and helps developers and healthcare organizations carefully consider the risks, benefits, limitations, and societal implications associated with each LLM in a particular application.

The following are some example policies you might consider using for your healthcare-specific applications. The first table summarizes the roles and responsibilities for human-AI configurations.

Action ID Suggested Action Generative AI Risks GV-3.2-001 Policies are in place to bolster oversight of generative AI systems with independent evaluations or assessments of generative AI models or systems where the type and robustness of evaluations are proportional to the identified risks. CBRN Information or Capabilities; Harmful Bias and Homogenization GV-3.2-002 Consider adjustment of organizational roles and components across lifecycle stages of large or complex generative AI systems, including: test and evaluation, validation, and red-teaming of generative AI systems; generative AI content moderation; generative AI system development and engineering; increased accessibility of generative AI tools, interfaces, and systems; and incident response and containment. Human-AI Configuration; Information Security; Harmful Bias and Homogenization GV-3.2-003 Define acceptable use policies for generative AI interfaces, modalities, and human-AI configurations (for example, for AI assistants and decision-making tasks), including criteria for the kinds of queries generative AI applications should refuse to respond to. Human-AI Configuration GV-3.2-004 Establish policies for user feedback mechanisms for generative AI systems that include thorough instructions and any mechanisms for recourse. Human-AI Configuration GV-3.2-005 Engage in threat modeling to anticipate potential risks from generative AI systems. CBRN Information or Capabilities; Information Security

The following table summarizes policies for risk management in AI system design.

Action ID Suggested Action Generative AI Risks GV-4.1-001 Establish policies and procedures that address continual improvement processes for generative AI risk measurement. Address general risks associated with a lack of explainability and transparency in generative AI systems by using ample documentation and techniques such as application of gradient-based attributions, occlusion or term reduction, counterfactual prompts and prompt engineering, and analysis of embeddings. Assess and update risk measurement approaches at regular cadences. Confabulation GV-4.1-002 Establish policies, procedures, and processes detailing risk measurement in context of use with standardized measurement protocols and structured public feedback exercises such as AI red-teaming or independent external evaluations. CBRN Information and Capability; Value Chain and Component Integration

Transparency artifacts

Promoting transparency and accountability throughout the AI lifecycle can foster trust, facilitate debugging and monitoring, and enable audits. This involves documenting data sources, design decisions, and limitations through tools like model cards and offering clear communication

Human-AI Configuration GV-3.2-005 Engage in threat modeling to anticipate potential risks from generative AI systems. CBRN Information or Capabilities; Information Security

The following table summarizes policies for risk management in AI system design.

Action ID Suggested Action Generative AI Risks GV-4.1-001 Establish policies and procedures that address continual improvement processes for generative AI risk measurement. Address general risks associated with a lack of explainability and transparency in generative AI systems by using ample documentation and techniques such as application of gradient-based attributions, occlusion or term reduction, counterfactual prompts and prompt engineering, and analysis of embeddings. Assess and update risk measurement approaches at regular cadences. Confabulation GV-4.1-002 Establish policies, procedures, and processes detailing risk measurement in context of use with standardized measurement protocols and structured public feedback exercises such as AI red-teaming or independent external evaluations. CBRN Information and Capability; Value Chain and Component Integration

Transparency artifacts

Promoting transparency and accountability throughout the AI lifecycle can foster trust, facilitate debugging and monitoring, and enable audits. This involves documenting data sources, design decisions, and limitations through tools like model cards and offering clear communication
