Whisky industry faces bleak midwinter as tariffs bite and exports stall

Scotch whisky is facing a sharp downturn in production as it adapts to tough market conditions around the world. Tariffs for export to the USA, introduced under the Trump administration and adding 10% to importers' costs, have hit sales in the industry's biggest export market. American tariffs on single malts, which were suspended four years ago, are on course to return next spring with a further 25% charge, unless a deal can be done with the Trump administration. Single malts, which sell at premium prices, are a particularly important part of exports to the US. However, the downturn is not only in the American market. There is also weakening demand in other markets due to squeezed growth and consumer spending, increased tax and costs, including packaging regulation, and because of trade disruption. Shipments to China last year fell by 31%, moving it from THE fifth biggest market to the tenth biggest. The first half of this year shows a 1% increase in the value of Scotch exports, to £2.5bn, while volumes were down nearly 4%. And the negative effects of US tariffs may not become clear for some months, as distillers moved swiftly to build up stocks in the country ahead of the frontier tax being introduced.

Getty Images The full impact of Donald Trump's tariffs is not yet clear as stocks were built up in the US before they took effect.

One of the brightest prospects for distillers is the sharp tariff reductions in India, the world's biggest whisky market which last year replaced France as the biggest importer of Scotch by volume. Currently at 150% of the value of each bottle, the trade deal between the London and Delhi governments includes a staged reduction to 40% tariffs. But with ratification in both countries expected to take time, that is seen as too far off to avoid the slump being felt in the shorter term.

Companies that supply the industry are also feeling the pressure. Distillers' demand for malted barley has slumped. Expectations for next year are of a cut from the range of 900,000 to 1 million tonnes to the lower range of 600 to 700,000 tonnes. Grain farmers are finding it hard to secure contracts for their barley harvests next year. Many are planting other crops such as wheat and rapeseed, or plan to do so. According to Jack Stevenson, chair of the crop committee of the National Farmers Union in Scotland, who runs Brangan farm between Portsoy and Banff: "A lot of the merchants are struggling to find contracts. The end users are cutting them back hugely. "It's the same story the length and breadth of Scotland. We're trying to keep the dialogue open with the Scotch whisky industry, and it'll come back. It's a huge market for Scotland." But for now he says: "There's doom and gloom in the cereals sector. And costs have been getting out of control on the machinery side of things."

Getty Images The downturn affects not just distillers but their suppliers including farmers who grow barley

He says the break-even point for barley is more than £200 per tonne, and around half of it is sold in contracts for future delivery. But the spot price, without a future contract, fell during September to £160 per tonne. According to data compiled by market intelligence agency AHDB, use of barley for distilling and brewing during July to October was down 14% on last year. One farmers' co-operative in Aberdeenshire is facing a halving of its 70,000 tonne barley contract this year with Chivas Brothers, one of the largest whisky distillers, owned by French drinks giant Pernod Ricard. A maltings plant, supplying distilleries with processed barley, is being permanently closed at Pencaitland in East Lothian, with the loss of around 20 jobs. Julian South, executive director of the Maltsters' Association of Great Britain (MAGB), says that is partly because the sector has grown its processing capacity elsewhere in recent years, with plans for more expansion. "Whisky has its ups and downs, while brewing is more consistent," he says. "Some people are quite surprised how quickly demand dropped off. Maltsters are having to look at their own production and contracts for barley in the coming season." A key signal to farmers is the industry's forecast of its demand for all malted barley, including around 40% of it used for brewing beer. The MAGB estimated demand next year is down from 1.8m tonnes to 1.4m.

Some firms are forecasting reduced demand and are adjusting production

Diageo, the biggest producer of Scotch whisky, has halted work at one of its main maltings, at Roseisle in Moray, until at least next June. A Diageo spokesperson said: "We have temporarily paused production at Roseisle Maltings as we look to balance capacity against current demand. We continue to assess production volumes and will communicate future plans as part of the normal planning cycle." The firm has reduced production in some distilleries and has paused distilling at Teaninich, near Alness in Easter Ross. Glenmorangie, at Tain in Easter Ross, is among distilleries where production has been halted for several months. Along with Ardbeg, it is a subsidiary of French luxury goods firm LVMH. A spokeswoman says this is a "short term adjustment" to production based on forecast demand for Glenmorangie: " There was a temporary pause in distillation early in the summer and another pause over the winter, with production scheduled to resume in spring 2026. This is part of the strategy to grow the value of the brand, she said. That reflects the risk that over-production could force down prices, and not only the profit margins but the premium status built up over years.

Man distilleries combine production with some kind of visitor experience that offers staff alternative roles

In most cases, the small number of people required to run a distillery are being redeployed, and visitor centres remain open, though there are knock-on effects for hauliers and other suppliers. The large US distilling firm that owns the smaller Glenglassaugh and Benriach distilleries in north-east Scotland has been operating only one of them since the start of this year, shutting down Glenglassaugh until autumn. As it started up again, Benriach was closed for two years. Brown-Forman, based in Kentucky and owner of Jack Daniels whiskey, also operates the Glendronach distillery near Huntly, and says it has slowed production there, "based on demand planning". That is despite its output of single malt having to wait at least 12 years before it is bottled and available for sale. The whole industry has to forecast where demand will be at least three years from now - the minimum length of time for Scotch whisky to mature in casks.

Bourbon barrels

A recent update for investors from Brown-Forman warned about global markets: "We continue to anticipate the operating environment to be challenging, with low visibility due to macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility as we face headwinds from consumer uncertainty and lower non-branded sales of used barrels". The main customer for used bourbon barrels is the Scotch industry, which has been importing around £200m-worth each year. The downturn suggests the forecast is for a prolonged downturn in demand, though it may also be due to warehousing, or whisky bonds, being full from high production levels in recent years. There is criticism in the industry at slow planning decisions holding back investment in extra capacity. Brown-Forman's global brand director for malts, Adip Agarwal, emphasised that slowing production, and the two-year closure of Benriach, does not alter availability of its Scotch produce. "This strategic decision aligns our production with the current market, allowing us to manage our resources effectively and optimise operations," he said.

No cheer from the Autumn Budget

[TITLE]Nestle India's Premiumisation Game: CEO Manish Tiwary Eyes Tighter SKUs On Quick Comm Boost:
[TEXT]
Discussing his vision for consumers, Tiwary said many people in the Delhi-NCR region, especially Gurugram are now living like Europeans. "I want every house in Gururgram to have an espresso machine as they can afford it. They are used to it and now with the quick commerce segment, they have a new route to markets," Tiwary told NDTV Profit.

Tiwary explained that earlier if one walked into a store, a company could have a maximum of 5,000-6,000 SKUs because real estate is expensive. "Today one of our best selling SKUs in NCR's quick commerce region is Nescafe Roastery. The product comes in medium roast and black roast."

According to the newly-appointed CEO, earlier it was very difficult to search for these products in a physical store. "Now, with search algorithm, we get to know the moment consumers buy a roastery. So, that quick route to markets is definitely helping us boost our e-commerce journey," he said.

According to Nestle, the company is witnessing premiumisation trend universally across urban and rural, the maker of Maggi, Kit Kat, and Nescafe. In the traditional trade space, Tiwary highlighted the resilience of the service by the local kirana waalas in urban and rural areas. ''I see them as the backbone. Organised market can never match that," he said.

Nestle India is probably the best supplier when it comes to supply chain market. "This is why our market share in quick commerce are better than in general trade. I see that working well for us. The segment will grow as long as innovation lasts," he said. Tiwary said Nestle India has fixed a revenue target of achieving over annual 40% growth in the rural space.

[TITLE]‘Dynamic pricing’ used to raise costs of everything from food and Uber rides to museum visits:
[TEXT]
If you feel like you’re being nickel-and-dimed everywhere you shop – you probably are.

Instacart has been using a shady AI algorithm that charges different prices to different customers on the same grocery items in the same stores without telling them, according to an explosive study released by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative earlier this week.

At a Target store in North Canton, Ohio, for example, the popular grocery app charged one customer $2.99 for Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter – while other Instacart users paid as much as $3.59 for the same jar picked up from the same location, the study found.

But it’s not just Instacart using cutting-edge tech to set higher prices. So-called “dynamic pricing” practices have been used by rideshares Uber and Lyft; Las Vegas convenience stores; children’s museums and zoos; and even your local grocery stores.

4 One customer at Caesars Palace noted that his wife was charged $10 for a Snickers bar and Gatorade and the next day, he was charged $14 for the same items Tam Nguyen / NYPost Design

Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and Kroger have already rolled out electronic price tags that allow workers to raise shelf prices in a matter of minutes. Walmart has said it’s planning to add the tags to thousands of stores by 2026.

Variable pricing is nothing new, but artificial intelligence has made it easier for companies of all sizes to leverage dynamic pricing – and “when something is easier to use, it becomes easy also to take advantage of,” said Pascal Yammine, CEO at Zilliant, an AI-driven pricing optimization firm.

Wendy’s faced heated backlash last year over its plans to invest $20 million in digital menu boards that could change the price of a Dave’s burger in real time – but it quickly walked back the comments, saying it “will not implement surge pricing … We didn’t use that phrase.”

While businesses have always adjusted prices to find the highest amount a customer will fork over, now artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms and massive troves of user data are allowing companies to be more exacting than ever.

“The problem isn’t that companies across multiple industries are using AI for dynamic pricing or even surge pricing,” Yammine said. “The problem is more around transparency and trust.”

Variable pricing, after all, can benefit consumers in some ways – offering discounts when they bulk-buy at Costco, allowing them to compare Amazon prices to other retailers online, and saving them money on plane tickets and vacations when they book during off-seasons, he noted.

The problem arises when data collection and algorithms are used without customers’ knowledge, experts said.

Just last month, the Justice Department settled its case against real estate tech firm RealPage, which allegedly used “completely sensitive information” to jack up rents for tenants.

Around the same time, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul made New York the first state to prohibit the use of algorithmic tools in setting rent prices.

Furious New Yorkers have blasted “slime balls” Uber and Lyft for hiking prices when subway lines are shut down during rainstorms – reportedly charging $80 for a 10-minute ride to work.

People have also reported being charged higher Uber fares when using a personal credit card instead of a corporate one. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog suggested in a report that Uber might charge more on users with low phone batteries — the idea seeming to be that customers are more likely to pay higher prices when they’re desperate — though the company denied this.
