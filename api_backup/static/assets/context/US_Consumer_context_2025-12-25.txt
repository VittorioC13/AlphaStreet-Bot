Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) surged on December 18 after announcing a $6 billion all-stock merger with fusion energy company TAE Technologies. But retail investors aren’t buying the hype. Reddit sentiment collapsed from 78 to just 22 out of 100 immediately following the announcement, with the main discussion thread on r/stocks drawing 972 upvotes and 164 skeptical comments.

24/7 Wall St.

The disconnect is striking. While the stock posted strong single-day performance, retail traders are treating the news with deep cynicism rather than celebration.

Reddit Calls It an “Old School Penny Stock”

The tone on Reddit tells the real story. User cheddarben, whose post received overwhelming support from the community, captured the prevailing sentiment:

In the post, cheddarben wrote: “Old school penny stock with bizarro news. I am sure it will be a wild ride.” The characterization of Trump Media as operating like a penny stock resonated widely with commenters expressing similar skepticism.

Top-voted comments echoed this skepticism. Reddit user Unlucky-Clock5230 commented: “This is the most obvious pump and dump I’ve ever seen. The fundamentals are absolutely terrible.” Reddit user techgeek72 added: “TAE has been ‘five years away’ from fusion for the last 27 years. This merger is a joke.” Reddit user InvestmentGrift questioned: “How is a social media company with declining revenue suddenly worth billions by merging with a fusion company that’s never produced commercial energy?”

Retail investors have legitimate concerns:

Trump Media trades at a staggering 797x price-to-sales ratio with just $3.68 million in trailing revenue

The company posted negative EBITDA of $175.8 million and a net loss of $54.8 million last quarter

Revenue declined 3.8% year-over-year, moving in the wrong direction

Technical indicators support the skepticism, with the stock showing high volatility and overbought conditions following the announcement.

Truth Social Meets Fusion Energy

Despite recent gains, Trump Media remains down significantly year-to-date. The stock hit a 52-week low of $10.18 just days ago and trades well below its $43.46 peak. TAE Technologies, founded in 1998, has raised $1.3 billion pursuing commercial fusion energy but has yet to demonstrate a working power plant. The merged company plans to break ground on a 50-megawatt facility in 2026, with co-CEOs Devin Nunes and Michl Binderbauer leading the venture. For investors watching peers, the broader market offers a stark contrast. The S&P 500 is up 15% year-to-date, highlighting the challenging performance of Trump Media stock.

[TITLE]Blum Holdings, Inc. Announces Closing of Acquisition of High-Volume Bay Area Cannabis Retail Dispensary:
[TEXT]
DOWNEY, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blum Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: BLMH) (the “Company,” “Blüm,” “Blüm Holdings,” “we” or “us”), a California-based publicly traded holding company, today announced the successful closing of its acquisition of a high-volume Bay Area cannabis retail dispensary through the purchase of all outstanding equity of the operating entity.

The acquired dispensary is a well-established, fully licensed retail operator located in a major Northern California market and has generated approximately $12.0 million in annual revenue with a long operating history and strong local customer base. The transaction further expands Blüm’s Northern California footprint.

“This acquisition reflects our continued focus on disciplined, opportunistic growth,” said Sabas Carrillo, Chief Executive Officer of Blüm Holdings. “We are acquiring durable retail assets with real revenue, real customers, and meaningful operating history, positioning the Company to benefit from both improved execution at the asset level and broader structural tailwinds impacting the U.S. cannabis industry.”

The transaction was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement and included a combination of cash and equity consideration. The Company noted that all required closing conditions have been satisfied.

Carrillo added, “As the regulatory backdrop continues to evolve at the federal level, including ongoing discussions around potential reclassification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act, we believe scaled, compliant retail operators are well positioned to benefit from broader market development.”

[TITLE]Holiday retail spending rose 4.2% this season, driven by e-commerce and electronics: Visa report:
[TEXT]
U.S. consumers showed resilience this holiday season, driving retail spending up 4.2% year over year, according to preliminary data released Tuesday by Visa .

The report from Visa Consulting and Analytics indicated that despite lingering economic headwinds, shoppers were still spending, particularly on technology and personal goods.

The findings tracked payments activity over a seven-week period beginning Nov. 1 using a subset of Visa payments network data in the U.S. and cover core retail categories, excluding spending on automotive, gasoline and restaurants. The figures are also not adjusted for inflation.

In-store shopping accounted for the bulk of holiday spending, capturing 73% of total retail payment volume during the period, while online purchases made up the remaining 27%.

However, e-commerce was the primary driver of growth, with online sales rising 7.8% compared with last year, reflecting continued demand for convenience and early-season promotions.

"The underlying surprise here ... is that consumer spending is holding up reasonably well in light of softer consumer confidence than we had this time last year and a number of headwinds and concerns

[TITLE]Warby Parker Case Study: How a DNVB Disrupted Eyewear:
[TEXT]
1. Understanding Digital Native Vertical Brands (DNVBs)

Digital native vertical brands are companies that begin on the Web and interact mainly through online channels. These brands often sell directly to consumers rather than through traditional retail stores. The case explains that DNVBs such as Warby Parker, Dollar Shave Club, and Bonobos disrupted established industries by controlling their own supply chain, communication, and customer experience. Their growth is linked to the expansion of e-commerce and the rising ability of brands to reach consumers without relying on third-party retailers.

2. Key Features of Successful DNVBs

Successful DNVBs share several traits, including strong investment in customer acquisition, direct sourcing of materials, and a strong focus on customer experience. They build relationships through social media, online communities, and personalized service. Direct distribution allows them to gather real-time feedback and improve products quickly. Because they sell directly, they can charge lower prices than traditional brands while keeping more control over brand messaging and customer service.

3. The Business Environment Enabling DNVB Growth

The rapid expansion of e-commerce made DNVBs a natural fit for modern consumer behavior. As online retail grew from

New Delhi: The organised refurbished smartphone market is expected to end this calendar year with a double-digit growth in sales despite the exit of two large ecommerce platforms Amazon and Flipkart from the segment, denting sales in the first half.A robust festive season, however, helped the sector regain momentum, industry executives said. Companies have also started expanding into categories such as laptops, cameras, smartwatches, and gaming consoles to diversify revenues, they added.In the first half of 2025, both Amazon and Flipkart restructured their businesses of selling refurbished smartphones by discontinuing sales of externally-refurbished products due to high return rates, and inconsistent quality. This led to a dip in sales for companies selling refurbished handsets through the platforms.According to Counterpoint Research, India's refurbished smartphone market grew 9% on-year in the calendar first half, sparking a shift in business models with companies such as Cashify and Control Z focusing on expanding their direct-to-consumer channels including both online and offline stores."This exit created a short-term drop in sales for ecosystem partners but opened a significant long-term vacuum in the market for organised players," said Yug Bhatia, co-founder, ControlZ, a Gurugram-based refurbished smartphone seller. "In response to these platforms leaving, we have expanded our inventory beyond the previous exclusivity with iPhones to include Android devices, witnessing clear demand for them."Revenue from direct-to-consumer channels has nearly doubled year-on-year, rebounding from a decline in the first half, while current monthly revenues have surpassed last year's figures, said Bhatia.Amazon and Flipkart's exit, however, also led to a surge in smartphone sales in the unorganised sector, he said. "Currently, the unorganised sector is booming because the organised marketplaces are inactive. But, in the next 3-6 months, the organised market will pick up as players refine their independent strategies," he said.Cashify, considered the largest organised seller of refurbished handsets, said it expects to close 2025 with a 40% surge in revenue. It also saw a 16% increase in trade-ins, helping ease constrained supply of old devices in the market."Approximately 300,000 smartphones were sold directly to consumers via our online channel, which accounts for roughly 20% of our total devices sold," said Nakul Kumar, co-founder, Cashify. He added that the company saw a 3% volume growth in direct-to-consumer channels, with a 30-40% increase in revenues from '1,150 crore in 2024.Overall, Cashify expects to sell 2.4 million devices this year, up from 2 million in 2024. It has also started seeing an uptick in sales of premium smartphones with many buying opting for EMIs. The number of deals processed through financing options has doubled compared to last year, Kumar said."iPhones make up 60% of sales in the online market, and overall, it is 25% of the total portfolio. MacBooks also account for 30% of laptop sales," said Kumar. "We expect to close between '150-200 crore in laptop sales this year, with a target of '350-400 crore next year."

[TITLE]Saks Global ‘Exploring All Potential Paths’ On Anniversary of Neiman Marcus Deal:
[TEXT]
Tuesday marked exactly one year since Saks Global — to the surprise of its many doubters — closed on its $2.7 billion deal to buy Neiman Marcus Group.

While the acquisition did create a luxury department store giant including Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, it did not dispel the doubters.

From the controversial decision to extend payment terms on vendors and to cover its past-due payments in monthly increments in February to a quick refinancing in August, the future path of Saks Global was a question mark for many.

Now, finishing off a make or break holiday season, the company is clearly at a crossroads with a more than $100 million interest payment due Dec. 30.

Bloomberg reported that Saks Global is “considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a last resort.”

In response, a spokesperson for the retailer told WWD: “Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future for Saks Global and advance our transformation while delivering exceptional products, elevated experiences and personalized service to our customers. Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it.”

Even after the refinancing in August, which brought in $600 million in new money, liquidity concerns swirled around the company.

In September, Standard & Poor’s projected that the company would have a $500 million deficit in reported free operating cash flow this year and said “liquidity will be rapidly depleted by the investments required to stabilize the business.”

Saks Global’s finances have kept it in a bind, making it difficult to buy inventory to stock its store, which in turn makes it harder to build cash to reestablish itself with vendors and pay down its debt.

Hilldun Corp., a key supporter that guaranteed vendor shipments to Saks, has a pause on approving new orders after the retailer missed a couple weeks of payments this month.

Meanwhile bondholders have once again grown very cautious on the company.

Senior secured bonds offered in August were recently priced at just 47.3 cents on the dollar, according to S&P Capital IQ. Less secured bonds in Saks Global financing were trading below 9 cents on the dollar.

Just what comes next for the company remains a vital question for the fashion industry.

Larger brands with concession shops at the retailer’s stores would hold on to their inventory if there were a bankruptcy, but they would face more change in the still-sizable department store channel.

Many smaller brands rely on Saks or Neiman’s or both and could struggle to recoup unpaid bills in a bankruptcy. Likewise, landlords would have to contend with the possibility of store closures.

Authentic Brands Group has a joint venture with Saks Global and Amazon has a stake in the company and operates a storefront for Saks within its luxury stores business.
