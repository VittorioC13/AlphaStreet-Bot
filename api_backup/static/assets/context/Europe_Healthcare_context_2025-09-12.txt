Cutting-edge extended reality backed to deliver real-time mental health support for people across the UK, including those with severe depression and anxiety

17 projects supported by share of £3.6 million could treat people in every corner of the UK, helping reduce costs to the NHS and resource pressure with real-time support, turbocharging our Plan for Change

Smart glasses technology being developed by CrossSense in London shows how AI can help those suffering with severe depression to navigate daily challenges

Smart glasses which help people struggling with severe depression to complete everyday tasks and AI filter apps making therapy for debilitating anxiety less daunting are among the cutting-edge tech projects being backed to deliver real-time mental health support across the UK, Science Minister Lord Vallance has announced today (Thursday 11 September).

With a 40% rise in people receiving mental health support from the NHS in England alone since before the pandemic, Innovate UK is supporting 17 businesses across the UK to take low-cost innovations to the next level to improve lives up and down the country, for the most in need, including in remote or underserved areas.

Developments include light-weight smart glasses which use AI to address the impact illnesses like depression, anxiety and psychosis can have on memory loss, by recognising household objects and offering advice on a connected app.

Technology led by CrossSense helps to reframe negative thoughts while offering step-by-step instructions for carrying out daily tasks, such as keeping vulnerable users safe from harm with prompts like advice to stay away from boiling water on the hob. It adapts to the wearer’s needs over time and helps to prevent cognitive decline, including dementia, so complex mental health conditions are not an unnecessary barrier to fulfilled and independent lives.

Tech will be built and trialled over the next year to 18 months - following £3.6 million of support from Innovate UK’s Mindset extended reality ( XR ) for digital mental health programme. This investment is part of the government’s commitment to protecting record funding for research and development, as outlined in the Autumn Budget 2024, which recognises that capitalising on the UK’s excellence in science and innovation is essential to seize the opportunities of AI , drive economic growth, and support our NHS.

Science Minister, Lord Vallance, said:

These projects are shining examples of how innovation can transform people’s quality of life, by helping those with severe mental health conditions to take on everyday tasks that can otherwise feel impossible. From smart glasses helping those with debilitating depression to navigate through the day to games helping children to build their social skills, we are supporting teams across the UK to build cutting-edge tech that unlocks opportunity, supports the NHS and grows our economy.

Minister for Mental Health, Baroness Merron, said:

Technology is transforming healthcare and we are putting patients at the heart of this revolution. New tools such as smart glasses and AI filter apps show how we’re backing innovations to reach people with mental health conditions - especially in communities that often get left behind. By embracing new tech, we’re improving lives and reducing pressure on the NHS to make healthcare fit for the future, as part of our Plan for Change.

These solutions aim to treat more people, particularly those with complex needs including those in remote or underserved areas, through scalable, immersive care. They also offer further advantages in terms of reduced costs and resource pressure with real-time support; and improved outcomes through personalised, engaging therapeutic experiences.

Other work

Play Well for Life, partnering with the University of the West of England, developing an augmented reality board game, co-produced by students, psychologists and teachers to help get children back into a learning environment where they can thrive. As a group-based game that can be played remotely or in-person it helps children build their communication and social skills by visiting 4 different ‘worlds’ to help them make and keep friends, solve problems and handle emotions, reducing anxiety as the game goes on and in time building confidence.

In Northern Ireland, a project led by Life Process Program is developing a customisable virtual coach for individuals struggling with substance abuse in an interactive environment that mimics real-life therapy sessions, and in West Yorkshire EcoGPX is linking extended reality with physical activities to connect people with nature and support adults living with generalised anxiety.

A world-first app is combining AI with augmented reality to help young people create therapeutic visual content. The work by Photography Based Therapeutics, working with the University of Surrey, will enable young people to edit photographs using familiar AR filter tools, removing elements that cause distress and adding calming features or text overlays. These personalised images can then be used as virtual backgrounds during remote therapy sessions or as part of a visual diary to help therapists understand how patients are feeling

[TITLE]Vaxart Reports Additional Phase 1 Data Supporting the Potential Efficacy of its Second-Generation Norovirus Oral Pill Vaccine Candidate:
[TEXT]
- Second-generation constructs induce robust increases in fecal IgA, which was shown to be correlated with protection against infection in the company’s previous Phase 2b challenge study -

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxart, Inc. (OTCQX: VXRT), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a range of oral recombinant pill vaccines based on its proprietary delivery platform, today reported additional positive data from the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating its second-generation oral pill norovirus vaccine constructs head-to-head against its first-generation constructs. Dr. Sean Tucker, Vaxart’s Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, presented the data at the 9th International Calicivirus Conference, which is taking place in Banff, Canada, September 7-11, 2025. Further, Dr. Becca Flitter presented data on Vaxart’s norovirus challenge study at the same conference.

The data show a 25-fold increase in the GII.4 fecal IgA response and a 10-fold increase in the GI.I fecal IgA response over baseline with the high dose of the second-generation vaccine candidates after a single tablet administration for each strain. The data also show an 8-fold increase in the GII.4 fecal IgA response and a 7-fold increase in the GI.I fecal IgA response over baseline with the low dose of the second-generation vaccine candidates after a single tablet administration for each strain.

While the Phase 1 study was not powered to determine superiority by statistical methods, the fecal IgA increases observed with the second-generation constructs compared favorably to the increases observed with the first-generation constructs at the same high dose level and in the same study (13-fold GII.4 and 6-fold GI.1 over baseline). As previously reported , a Phase 2 challenge study of the first-generation constructs identified fecal IgA as a critical correlate to protection from norovirus infection.1

“With these positive fecal IgA results and the previously announced serum responses, the totality of data has given us confidence that our second-generation constructs induce more robust immunologic responses than our first-generation constructs. These immunological endpoints are important because they correlated with protection in our Phase 2b challenge study,” said Dr. Tucker. “As the first-generation constructs demonstrated a statistically significant 30% relative reduction in infection compared with placebo, we believe the numerically greater fecal IgA and functional blocking antibody responses observed in the Phase 1 head-to-head study have the potential to translate into improved efficacy.”

These new data confirm that Vaxart’s vaccine technology, which induces intestinal immunity, likely enables stronger protection against infection from norovirus by providing better immunity at the site of virus entry. With second-generation constructs that produces more intestinal IgA, these data further differentiate Vaxart’s norovirus vaccine approach from others in development, which are more focused on generating a serum antibody response.

In June 2025, Vaxart reported data from the Phase 1 head-to-head study demonstrating that its second-generation norovirus constructs produced statistically significant increases in GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus blocking antibodies (141% and 94%, respectively) compared with first-generation constructs. Norovirus blocking antibodies also correlated with protection against infection in the Phase 2b challenge study.

“Results to date on all our norovirus vaccines studies give us confidence that we may have a potential solution for an easily transmitted disease with a $10+ billion economic impact in the U.S.,” said Steven Lo, Chief Executive Officer of Vaxart. “We believe these new data further support our efforts to secure a partnership or other funding to conduct a Phase 2 trial of these constructs.”

Assuming a partnership or other funding, Vaxart plans to conduct a Phase 2b safety and immunogenicity study that could potentially begin before the end of 2025 followed by an End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A Phase 3 trial could then begin as early as 2026.

There is no approved vaccine against norovirus, a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide that is responsible for outbreaks of infection and illness globally. Each year there are approximately 685 million norovirus infections globally, with 20 million infections occurring annually in the United States. Due to these high rates of infection, norovirus is believed to cause nearly 20% of diarrheal disease globally. Additionally, the economic burden associated with norovirus infection and AGE is estimated at $60 billion worldwide and $10 billion in the United States.

Blow for UK drugs sector as Merck scraps £1bn expansion

US pharmaceutical giant Merck is scrapping a planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations, saying the government is not investing enough in the sector. The multi-national business, known as MSD in Europe, said it would move its life sciences research to the US and cut UK jobs, blaming successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines. One science industry expert told the BBC that, following Merck's decision, many major pharmaceutical companies could stop investing in the UK. A spokesperson for the government defended its investments in science and research, but acknowledged there was "more work to do".

Pharmaceutical companies have been refocusing on investing in the US following pressure from President Donald Trump, including threats of sky-high tariffs on drug imports. Merck had already begun construction on a site in London's King's Cross which was due to be completed by 2027, but said it no longer planned to occupy it. The company will also vacate its laboratories in the London Bioscience Innovation Centre and the Francis Crick Institute by the end of the year, which will lead to 125 job losses. A spokesperson for the drug company said the decision "reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments".

'Global uncertainty'

Speaking in the House of Commons, science minister Ian Murray said Merck's decision was "deeply disappointing" but that it was "a commercial decision for them". The company recently announced 125 job losses and $3bn (£2.2bn) per year cost cuts. Mr Murray said global economic pressures and the US trade policy had compounded its problems. He added that pharmaceutical companies were getting a lower proportion of NHS drugs spending due to the actions of previous Conservative and coalition governments. However, Conservative shadow science secretary Julia Lopez said the message from Merck bosses was "unsparing". "Simply put, the UK is not internationally competitive", she said. "The government must wake up, and do so now."

Drugs spending

Sir John Bell, emeritus regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, told the BBC's Today programme that he'd spoken to several bosses of major companies in the past six months, "and they're all in the same space, and that is, they're not going to do any more investing in the UK". One of the problems, he said, was the amount of money the NHS spends on medicines. "Ten years ago, we used to spend 15% of our healthcare spend on pharmaceuticals. Now it's 9%. The rest of the world, the OECD, are sitting between 14 and 20%," Sir John said. "The large companies do have to work in a system where they can sell their products, and if they can't sell their products here, they'll go and do their business somewhere else." Richard Torbett, head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said the decision was "an incredible blow". "We've really got to see it as a wake up call to try and understand what is driving companies to make these difficult decisions and what can we do to turn that round," he told the BBC's Wake Up To Money programme. "The lack of competitiveness of the UK is the big thing that's driven the decision," he added. "We've got systematic under-investment in the products that come out of the end of innovation."

MSD is the latest pharmaceutical company to abandon or reduce investment plans in the UK. In January, AstraZeneca walked away from plans to invest £450m in expanding a vaccine manufacturing plant in Merseyside earlier this year, blaming reduced government support. The UK boss of another pharmaceutical giant warned last month that NHS patients would lose access to cutting-edged treatments because Britain was "largely uninvestable". Norvartis's Johan Kahlstrom said the company had "already been unable to launch several medicines" in the country due to the "declining competitiveness" of the UK market. In 2023, AstraZeneca chose to build a new factory in the Republic of Ireland instead of the UK. The firm's boss said at the time it wanted to build the site in north-west England, but a "discouraging" tax rate meant it chose Dublin instead.

Industry sources told the BBC the sector had been attracting major funding in the hub around Kings Cross focused on the intersection between life sciences and AI. They pushed back on claims that the decision was linked to ongoing negotiations over drug prices, in which industry has been lobbying hard for the NHS to approve more and pay more for medicines. The current pricing regime was set and agreed to by drug companies in 2023 - less than 18 months ago.

Since then, pharmaceutical firms have come under pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices for American customers and to invest more in the US - affecting their ability to invest elsewhere. In an August interview with CNBC, Trump suggested that tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported to the US could reach up to 250%. The threat followed an executive order signed by the president in May aimed at reducing drug prices for American consumers. Dr David Roblin, chief executive of London-based biotechnology company Relation Therapeutics, told the BBC the fundamentals that drove MSD to invest in the UK in the first place had not changed. "The academic environment in the UK continues to produce innovative ideas and people to run with those ideas, which attracts foreign investment," he said. "The environment to do research is still outstanding: we've got great academics, the NHS does provide a research platform, for example the UK Biobank is proving to be a real attractor for companies like mine," he said. What has changed, Dr Roblin said, was the political landscape in the US which big pharma has to respond to, "because the US remains the largest market for pharmaceuticals on earth," he added.

[TITLE]Royalty Pharma Announces Release of Deloitte’s Report on the Biopharma Royalty Market:
[TEXT]
First of its kind report offers insight from over 110 biopharma executives into the benefits of royalties, current market dynamics and outlook for royalty market expansion

Royalties have become integral to biopharma’s diversified capital landscape driven by attractive cost of capital, flexibility and positive investor perception

NEW YORK, Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Royalty Pharma plc (Nasdaq: RPRX) today announced the release of a biopharma royalty market study conducted by Deloitte. The report, titled "Role of Royalties in Funding Biopharma Innovation," is the first of its kind and offers a comprehensive analysis of the current dynamics, growth drivers and outlook for biopharma royalties. The full report is available for download at Deloitte’s website and Royalty Pharma’s website.

“Our report takes a deep dive into the key factors driving increased executive interest in royalty funding,” said Teresa Leste, principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP. “As capital demands grow and global innovation accelerates, the biopharma industry is evolving towards a more diversified funding model, with royalties gaining prominence as a tailored funding solution capable of supporting biopharma’s significant capital requirements.”

“We’re witnessing the emergence of a new funding paradigm in biopharma,” said Pablo Legorreta, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Pharma. “As highlighted in Deloitte’s publication, royalties are increasingly recognized as a vital component of a diversified capital structure to help fund innovation and advance scientific breakthroughs. For companies seeking flexible, non-dilutive capital at scale, royalties are an attractive solution.”

Key Highlights

As part of this study, Deloitte engaged with more than 110 biopharma leaders, primarily CEOs and CFOs, through a digital survey and one-on-one interviews to assess views on royalty funding. The report delivers several key insights into the state of the biopharmaceutical royalty market, including:

The strategic benefits of royalties are driving their acceptance as part of a diversified funding strategy for biopharma companies: the most important benefits of royalties included their non-dilutive nature, the absence of covenants, the retention of operational control, the ability to finance a single product and the scale of capital available.

Positive investor perception and attractive cost of capital are further driving royalty adoption.

Perspectives on the role of royalties in the current market environment and future outlook: 87% of surveyed biopharma executives would consider royalties as part of their capital raising plans over the next three years.

Case studies detail innovative applications of royalty funding.

The report underscores the vital role royalties play in fueling the biopharma ecosystem — supporting life sciences innovation and commercial success while offering flexible, non-dilutive capital at scale.

Cutting-edge extended reality backed to deliver real-time mental health support for people across the UK, including those with severe depression and anxiety

17 projects supported by share of £3.6 million could treat people in every corner of the UK, helping reduce costs to the NHS and resource pressure with real-time support, turbocharging our Plan for Change

Smart glasses technology being developed by CrossSense in London shows how AI can help those suffering with severe depression to navigate daily challenges

Smart glasses which help people struggling with severe depression to complete everyday tasks and AI filter apps making therapy for debilitating anxiety less daunting are among the cutting-edge tech projects being backed to deliver real-time mental health support across the UK, Science Minister Lord Vallance has announced today (Thursday 11 September).

With a 40% rise in people receiving mental health support from the NHS in England alone since before the pandemic, Innovate UK is supporting 17 businesses across the UK to take low-cost innovations to the next level to improve lives up and down the country, for the most in need, including in remote or underserved areas.

Developments include light-weight smart glasses which use AI to address the impact illnesses like depression, anxiety and psychosis can have on memory loss, by recognising household objects and offering advice on a connected app.

Technology led by CrossSense helps to reframe negative thoughts while offering step-by-step instructions for carrying out daily tasks, such as keeping vulnerable users safe from harm with prompts like advice to stay away from boiling water on the hob. It adapts to the wearer’s needs over time and helps to prevent cognitive decline, including dementia, so complex mental health conditions are not an unnecessary barrier to fulfilled and independent lives.

Tech will be built and trialled over the next year to 18 months - following £3.6 million of support from Innovate UK’s Mindset extended reality ( XR ) for digital mental health programme. This investment is part of the government’s commitment to protecting record funding for research and development, as outlined in the Autumn Budget 2024, which recognises that capitalising on the UK’s excellence in science and innovation is essential to seize the opportunities of AI , drive economic growth, and support our NHS.

Science Minister, Lord Vallance, said:

These projects are shining examples of how innovation can transform people’s quality of life, by helping those with severe mental health conditions to take on everyday tasks that can otherwise feel impossible. From smart glasses helping those with debilitating depression to navigate through the day to games helping children to build their social skills, we are supporting teams across the UK to build cutting-edge tech that unlocks opportunity, supports the NHS and grows our economy.

Minister for Mental Health, Baroness Merron, said:

Technology is transforming healthcare and we are putting patients at the heart of this revolution. New tools such as smart glasses and AI filter apps show how we’re backing innovations to reach people with mental health conditions - especially in communities that often get left behind. By embracing new tech, we’re improving lives and reducing pressure on the NHS to make healthcare fit for the future, as part of our Plan for Change.

These solutions aim to treat more people, particularly those with complex needs including those in remote or underserved areas, through scalable, immersive care. They also offer further advantages in terms of reduced costs and resource pressure with real-time support; and improved outcomes through personalised, engaging therapeutic experiences.

Other work

Play Well for Life, partnering with the University of the West of England, developing an augmented reality board game, co-produced by students, psychologists and teachers to help get children back into a learning environment where they can thrive. As a group-based game that can be played remotely or in-person it helps children build their communication and social skills by visiting 4 different ‘worlds’ to help them make and keep friends, solve problems and handle emotions, reducing anxiety as the game goes on and in time building confidence.

In Northern Ireland, a project led by Life Process Program is developing a customisable virtual coach for individuals struggling with substance abuse in an interactive environment that mimics real-life therapy sessions, and in West Yorkshire EcoGPX is linking extended reality with physical activities to connect people with nature and support adults living with generalised anxiety.

A world-first app is combining AI with augmented reality to help young people create therapeutic visual content. The work by Photography Based Therapeutics, working with the University of Surrey, will enable young people to edit photographs using familiar AR filter tools, removing elements that cause distress and adding calming features or text overlays. These personalised images can then be used as virtual backgrounds during remote therapy sessions or as part of a visual diary to help therapists understand how patients are feeling
