[TITLE]French datacenter biz signs 12-year nuclear pact with EDF:
[TEXT]
The datacenter industry's unquenchable thirst for nuclear energy has seen French bit barn operator Data4 sign a 12 year supply deal with EDF.

The arrangement will see Data4's network of server farms across France tap into a 40MW slice of EDF's atomic-powered grid from next year, making it the first datacenter operator in the country to sign a Nuclear Production Allocation Contract (CAPN).

Data4n operates facilities across a number of campuses in France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Germany, and Greece, and is understood to have at least 1.5 GW of infrastructure in play.

Those in France at least will now be partly powered via a CAPN, in addition to long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) Data4 already has in place for solar and wind energy.

The contract involves a "cost and risk-sharing mechanism" based on the actual volumes of energy produced - a so-called behind-the-meter arrangement where it can secure energy at a reduced cost over the long term.

The move is part of a broader strategy by Data4 to integrate low-carbon and renewable energy across all operations, and thereby operate its datacenters more sustainably.

Such efforts are not altruistic. Many companies in Europe and elsewhere are starting to demand environmental sustainability data from their suppliers amid efforts to comply with regulations such as the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

"Combined with renewable energy purchase agreements, [this contract] guarantees reliable, resilient, and continuous access to low-carbon energy at a controlled long-term cost - a considerable advantage for our clients and the development of our infrastructure," said François Stérin, Data4's chief operating officer.

France is perhaps the ideal country for such an agreement, as

[TITLE]EU and US sanction officials discuss options after Trump threatens to punish Russia for massive attack on Ukraine:
[TEXT]
Europe’s top sanctions envoy met with US officials on Monday to discuss economic options against Moscow after President Trump threatened to punish Russia over the largest-ever air attack on Ukraine.

David O’Sullivan, the EU sanctions envoy, discussed the terms of Europe’s 19th package of sanctions aimed at crippling Moscow’s war machine, the European Commission said, with the items set to deal a blow to Russian oil sales.

EU Council President Antonio Costa said the new sanctions were being closely coordinated with the US after Trump announced Sunday that he was ready to move forward with a second phase of restrictions against Moscow.

Costa said he was hopeful that the US and Europe can create a united front against Putin after Trump had dodged efforts to coordinate earlier this year to pursue his own peace talks with Russia instead.

The US is one of the notable standouts among the G7 nations who did not join to lower the price cap on Russian crude oil before sanctions were levied at $47.60 a barrel.

As Trump calls for a new wave of restrictions against Moscow, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled Sunday that the US and Europe could work together to attack Russian oil sales and “collapse” Moscow’s economy.

“We are prepared to increase pressure on Russia, but we need our European partners to follow us,” Bessent told NBC New’s “Meet the Press.”

“We are in a race now between how long can the Ukrainian military hold up versus how long can the Russian economy hold up,” he added.

“And if the U.S. and the EU can come in, do more sanctions, secondary tariffs on the countries that buy Russian oil, the Russian economy will be in total collapse, and that will bring President Putin to the table.”

The Trump administration has already imposed 50% tariffs on India, one of the highest levied against any nation, over its continued purchase of Russian oil.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky touted the tariffs on buyers of Russian oil as he reiterated that economic blows to Moscow were a key strategy to hurt the invasion effort.

“I’m very thankful to all the partners, but some of them, I mean, they continue [to] buy oil and Russian gas, and this is not fair,” Zelensky told ABC News’ “This Week” on Sunday.

“I think, what I think, I think the idea to put tariffs on the countries who continue [to] make deals with Russia. I think this is [the] right idea,” he added.

The Kremlin said Monday that no sanctions would ever force Russia to change course on its invasion of Ukraine.

The move to apply more economic pressure to Moscow comes after Russia fired 810 drones and decoys and 13 missiles at Ukraine over the weekend, the largest aerial assault of the war to date.

More than 700 of the Russian drones were intercepted by Ukraine’s air forces, as were at least some of the missiles in the bombardment, which struck more than 30 locations around the country, killing four people and wounding more than 40 others.

The devastating assault included a first-ever strike on Ukraine’s central government headquarters in Kyiv, causing a “huge” fire and blasting a massive hole into the top two floors of the building, officials said.

[TITLE]US to Europe: Stop buying gas and oil if you want new sanctions on Moscow:
[TEXT]
Newsroom September 8 06:39

European countries must stop buying Russian oil and gas if they want Washington to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow, according to Donald Trump’s energy chief, who said the trade funds Vladimir Putin‘s “war machine.”

Chris Wright, the US Energy Secretary, told the Financial Times that European countries would have to buy US LNG, gasoline and other fossil fuel products in order to meet the terms of the US-EU trade deal, which calls for EU countries to buy $750 billion worth of US energy by the end of 2028.

“If the Europeans would set a limit and say: “We won’t buy any more Russian gas, we won’t buy Russian oil”. Would that also have a positive effect on the US to adopt a more aggressive stance [on sanctions]? Absolutely,” he said in an interview ahead of talks with his EU counterpart in Brussels this week. “We think it’s good for Europe from an economic point of view. You want to have secure energy suppliers who are your allies, not your enemies. The other reason is that a huge goal of the Trump administration, and I think of the EU, is to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Russia is funding its war machine from oil and gas exports, and if you stop European markets for these products, it reduces its revenues.”

Brussels is pressing Washington to impose tougher economic sanctions on Russia to increase pressure on Putin as part of an effort to reach a peace deal in Ukraine.

[TITLE]Trump reversed policies supporting electric vehicles − it will affect the road to clean electricity, too:
[TEXT]
When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, it was the largest climate bill in U.S. history, with major incentives for electric vehicle production and adoption. In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world – especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars – especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions – it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built – and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A virtuous – or vicious – cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector – eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes – is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition – it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn’t just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors – power generation and transportation – while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

[TITLE]Italy’s renewable energy delays could miss EU carbon emission goals: report:
[TEXT]
Italy could tap into an estimated 13.6GW of hydropower storage capacity across 56 new sites. Credit: Standret / Shutterstock.com.

Italy may struggle to meet its carbon emission reduction commitments due to delays in renewable power generation and energy storage systems, according to Reuters, based on a recent study conducted by Edison and TEHA Group.

The report suggests that Italy could take an additional ten years beyond the expected timeframe to deploy the necessary green infrastructure, potentially causing the country to fall short of the European Union’s 2030 decarbonisation targets.

The study emphasises the need for Italy to streamline permitting processes, provide investment certainty, and manage energy costs effectively.

By integrating hydropower storage, advanced nuclear power, and carbon capture technologies, Italy has the potential to boost its economy by €190bn ($222.2bn) by 2050.

The nation could tap into an estimated 13.6GW of hydropower storage capacity across 56 new sites, which would bolster energy security and climate resilience, according to the report.

Edison CEO Nicola Monti was quoted by the news agency as saying: “We must reduce our energy and technological dependence on foreign countries, enhance domestic supply chains such as hydroelectric pumping, and build European partnerships around emerging technologies, from next-generation nuclear to carbon capture.”

[TITLE]Govt eyes sub-target for renewable energy under priority sector lending:
[TEXT]
New Delhi: Developers of renewable power may get enhanced access to cheaper bank loans in the near future, with the Centre working on a proposal mandating dedicated priority lending for such projects.

The ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) is preparing a recommendation to the finance ministry carve out a sub-target under priority sector lending (PSL) for renewable energy projects, two people aware of the development said.

Priority sector lending rules require banks to allocate a specific portion of their loans to sectors such as agriculture and education that might not otherwise receive timely credit. While renewable energy is among the priority sectors, the proposal aims to ensure guaranteed lending to the sector.

Currently, banks must allocate 40% of their adjusted net banking credit or their credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposure (CEOBSE), whichever is higher, to PSL, and sub-targets have been prescribed only for agriculture (18%), micro enterprises (7.5%), and loans for economically weaker sections (12%).

Now, with the need for increased financing for renewable energy at competitive rates, the energy ministry is weighing a sub-target for renewable energy projects, the people cited above said. The government has set ambitious targets of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil-fuel capacity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070.

Lost in the crowd

Data from SBI Research showed that bank loans to the renewable energy sector under PSL stood at ₹7,558 crore in the first 10 months of FY25 (April 2024 to January 2025). They accounted for just 8% of the total value of bank loans for the renewable energy sector over this period, and just over 1% of the ₹6.64 trillion in loans for the overall power sector in that time.

"Financing from banks needs to gain pace. Although renewable energy is covered under priority sector lending, credit through this window is yet to pick up as there are several sectors under PSL. Either you get almost all of the funds under PSL for renewables, or you don't get anything at all. So, there is a consideration to propose a sub-target or mandate for renewables under PSL," said one of the people mentioned above.

Also Read | Renewable energy may be the future, but its stocks are full of hot air

Another person aware of the development said if the proposal took concrete shape and renewables got a separate mandate, sub-sectors such as solar, wind green hydrogen and hybrid projects could be explored.

Queries sent to the union ministries of new and renewable energy and finance were unanswered till press time.

Since renewable energy was included under PSL in 2015, several amendments have been made to boost liquidity for the sector. In 2015, PSL offered loans up to ₹15 crore for things like solar-based power generators, biomass-based power generators, and micro-hydel plants. In 2020 this was raised to ₹30 crore per borrower, and in March 2025 it was raised to ₹35 crore per borrower with effect from 1 April 2025. The government broadened the criteria for loans to be classified under ‘renewable energy’ in March.

Why bank financing lags

Although equity investments in renewable energy have gained pace over the years, bank financing has not grown in line with requirements, sector experts said. In August 2024, Union minister for new and renewable energy Pralhad Joshi said India's renewable-energy sector had received investments of
