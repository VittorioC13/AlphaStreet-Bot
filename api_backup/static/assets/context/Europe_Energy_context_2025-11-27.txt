[TITLE]Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission blocks 3.2 GW coal power plan, citing clean energy push:
[TEXT]
The power regulator of Rajasthan, India’s largest solar power producer, has refused permission for a proposed 3,200-megawatt coal power project, saying it conflicts with clean energy goals and lacks justification under demand forecasts, a filing showed.

The Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission said in an order published on Thursday it had dismissed a petition by state-run Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services Ltd seeking approval to procure coal power for 25 years through bidding.

The utility argued the new capacity was needed to meet rising round-the-clock demand.

However, the regulator said the proposal was inconsistent with the Central Electricity Authority’s latest Resource Adequacy Plan.

The Resource Adequacy Plan estimates Rajasthan will require only 1,905 MW of additional coal capacity by 2035-36, far less than the 3,200 MW sought.

The decision comes even as other Indian states are accelerating their coal power purchases, citing strong power demand and the need for round-the-clock, base-load power.

The Rajasthan power regulator also noted upcoming nuclear projects, large-scale solar additions and battery storage plans would ease supply gaps for the state.

Long-term coal contracts could lock in costly power and undermine renewable integration, the commission said in its order.

The commission warned that locking in coal for 25 years could burden consumers with high tariffs and worsen air quality, as the proposed plant would burn about 40,000 tonnes of coal daily, releasing hundreds of tonnes of particulate matter.

It also flagged renewable energy curtailment as a persistent issue and advised the state to maximize the use of its solar and wind resources before adding new coal capacity.

[TITLE]Heed electricity, gas safety during floods, Energy Commission cautions:
[TEXT]
PUTRAJAYA: The Energy Commission has reminded the public to remain vigilant and prioritise electricity and gas safety during the current flood season.

In a statement Monday (Nov 24), the commission said floods pose various risks, including fallen electricity poles, broken power lines, and damage to electrical and gas equipment. It also outlined several safety measures to be taken before, during and after a flood.

“If instructed to evacuate, place electrical appliances in a high and safe location to prevent them from being submerged. Switch off the main power supply at the electrical distribution board, as well as any installations connected separately from the main switch, such as solar PV systems, electric fences or electric vehicle chargers. Also, close the valves of gas cylinders or piped gas," it said.

The commission further advised the public to avoid areas with submerged electrical lines or installations, such as substations and switch rooms, and to refrain from touching poles or any structures that carry electricity.

It also reminded the public not to move fallen electricity poles or severed power lines, but instead to report them immediately to the electricity utility provider.

To ensure the safe use of electricity and gas after a flood, the main switch on the electrical distribution board and gas line valves must be turned off before any cleaning work begins.

"Before switching the main supply back on, ensure that all electrical equipment is in good condition and completely dry. Always remain cautious when carrying out post-flood cleaning activities near electrical lines, installation structures or piped gas systems.

"Avoid using any electrical or gas equipment if its safety is uncertain. If you are still in doubt, seek the assistance of an electrical or gas contractor registered with the Energy Commission," the statement said.

The public is also reminded to keep important emergency numbers, including the police, the fire and rescue department, the hospital and utility service providers, easily accessible at all times.

[TITLE]India’s Nayara Energy Defies Sanctions With Record Russian Intake:
[TEXT]
Nayara Energy has spent the past four months navigating one of the most complicated sanction environments in its history, yet instead of retreating, the Rosneft-backed refiner is quietly re-wiring its entire crude-sourcing and fuel-export strategy. After EU sanctions in July forced its 400,000 b/d Vadinar refinery to slash throughput, and October’s US sanctions on Rosneft added further pressure, Nayara’s crude imports briefly collapsed to just 240,000 b/d, sourced from exclusively Russian suppliers. But by October and November, the company had staged a dramatic rebound, pushing intake back up to 390,000 b/d and then 420,000 b/d – exceeding even the refinery’s nominal nameplate capacity. By simultaneously deepening domestic sales and cultivating new buyers from Brazil to Sudan, Nayara appears to have found a way to turn sanctions risk into a trading opportunity, even as the official US sanctions wind-down deadline passed on 21 November and tankers from Russia’s Baltic Sea ports continued to dock at Vadinar undeterred.

After the EU imposed sanctions on Nayara Energy’s Vadinar refinery in July (citing its association with Russian crude supplied via Rosneft, which holds a 49% stake), the company struggled to keep the refinery running at normal rates. The measures triggered logistical disruptions, pushed away most vessel owners, and forced Nayara to scale back utilisation rates sharply. As Iraqi and Saudi suppliers refused to supply contracted volumes to Nayara, crude imports into Vadinar in August sank to 240,000 b/d, the lowest level in months, marking the first time the refinery was entirely reliant on Russian grades.

Related: Oil Prices Sink as Ukraine Agrees to Peace Deal

On the face of it, the pressure on Nayara was supposed to deepen when Washington sanctioned Rosneft in October. However, by late October, it became clear that Vadinar is bouncing back to strength rather than faltering. With its 400,000 b/d nameplate capacity as a benchmark, Nayara ramped up intake of Russian crude to 390,000 b/d that month, and then lifted imports further to 420,000 b/d in November to date – effectively running the plant at 105% capacity.

The official US sanctions wind-down period expired on 21 November, before which all buyers of Rosneft and Lukoil crude or products were required to conclude transactions. Yet Vadinar’s behavior suggested no intention of slowing down. Two Aframax tankers, both loaded at Russia’s Ust-Luga terminal for Rosneft, arrived at Vadinar on 22 and 24 November, indicating that sanctions alone were insufficient to interrupt flows.

In August, the core question facing Nayara was no longer how to buy Russian crude, but where to sell its refined products. The company’s sharp decline in throughput and exports that month was partly the result of blocked outlets, as sanctions sealed off the Europen market altogether. The first, most reliable fallback was India itself: Nayara’s network of 6,500 retail stations (with another 400 outlets planned) offered an available channel to absorb its gasoline and diesel.

Then came an unexpected lifeline. In October, state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) reported operational problems at its Mumbai refinery after processing domestic crude with unusually high salt and organic chloride content, which led to corrosion in downstream units. Nayara stepped into the gap. Shipments of gasoline and gasoil to HPCL surged, helping lift domestic deliveries to around 90,000 b/d in October, according to Kpler.

With domestic channels strengthened, Nayara moved to diversify export outlets beyond India. Roughly a third of its November clean-products cargoes were directed to ship-to-ship hubs such as Fujairah (UAE) and Sohar (Oman) – a strategy commonly used to obscure final destinations in sensitive trades.

But the most striking change came from the emergence of new customers, notably Brazil and Turkey – countries that did not appear in Nayara’s client list over the past three years. In November so far, Nayara exported 21,000 b/d of clean products to Brazil and another 21,000 b/d to Turkey. These flows almost certainly reflect disruptions in Russian diesel exports after intensified Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian refineries, coupled with rising compliance risks for traders buying directly from Russia. Because Vadinar has processed exclusively Russian crude since August, its products offer these markets a politically safer, operationally simpler way to access the same molecules.

Yet the most consequential addition to Nayara’s portfolio may be Sudan. Since October, the Vadinar terminal has dispatched four cargoes totalling 1.3 million barrels of clean products to Sudanese ports. With Sudan engulfed in civil war and its only major refinery – the 100,000 b/d Khartoum (Al-Jaili) facility – destroyed in the summer of 2023, the country is entirely dependent on imports. Potential discounts on products refined from Russian oil make Vadinar an obvious supplier. Sudan, and other fragile markets across East Africa, have little incentive to observe Western sanctions, making them ideal long-term buyers for Nayara’s output.

Still, securing crude supplies might become increasingly challenging under full US sanctions. Nayara may attempt to insulate itself through smaller, opaque trading houses, using them as intermediaries to avoid purchasing directly from Rosneft.

Whether this workaround can be scaled is uncertain. But for now, Nayara Energy is demonstrating that a combination of discounted Russian crude, flexible logistics, opportunistic trading, and an expanding footprint in both domestic and sanctions-agnostic markets can keep one of India’s largest refineries running near full tilt – even as Western sanctions close in from both sides. Paradoxically, the pressure may be accelerating a broader shift: Western restrictions are pushing companies linked to Russian oil producers into new geographies, opening fresh trade routes, and supplying developing economies with cheaper fuel at a moment when they need it most. These developing markets gain more incentive to boost imports of discounted flows and give themselves a commercial edge, while many of the former Western buyers now find themselves managing the opposite outcome: higher prices, fewer sanction-free suppliers, and a tightening pool of accessible energy.

[TITLE]Strikes And Sanctions On Russian Refineries Drive Up Gasoline and Diesel Prices:
[TEXT]
The ongoing strikes on Russian oil refineries are driving up the cost of gasoline and diesel worldwide. The prices are really noticeable in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

Ukraine has targeted oil depots, processing plants, and metering stations with drones and missiles, calling them legitimate facilities that support Russia’s “war machine.” Russia, in turn, has struck elements of Ukraine’s power grid, saying the infrastructure supports the Ukrainian military, accoridng to a report by RT.

Back in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the West should be on the hook for repairing the damage done to its oil infrastructure by Ukraine during the war.

Putin: The West Should Repair The Damage Done By Ukraine To Oil Infrastructure

“Since they [the Western companies] are… interested in restoring the facility’s operational capacity, then let them arrange for the necessary equipment delivery despite all the sanctions,” Putin said. He added that the CPC shareholders would be doing this “for their own benefit” anyway. Moscow will provide the necessary assistance, he noted. –SHTFPlan

Bloomberg reported on Saturday that these attacks, combined with outages at key plants in Asia and Africa, have removed millions of barrels of diesel and gasoline from the global market, the outlet said. United States sanctions on Russian energy giants Lukoil and Rosneft in October, along with restrictions imposed by the EU, have also helped drive prices higher.

Refining margins in the US, Europe, and Asia are now at their highest levels for this time of year since at least 2018, Bloomberg said, citing its own calculations. Additional pressure has come from shutdowns and outages at refineries in Kuwait and Nigeria.

In August, Hungary imposed sanctions on Ukraine’s top drone commander, Robert Brovdi, after repeated strikes disrupted the flow of crude through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline.

Ukraine’s New Attack on A Key Pipeline

Continued attacks on refineries coupled with sanctions will continue to raise the cost of oil globally, and the most affected humans will be those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.

[TITLE]Oil Closes the Day Near Month Low:
[TEXT]
Oil fell as signs of progress in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia buoyed expectations that Moscow's supply will stay online.

West Texas Intermediate futures fell 1.5% to settle near $58 a barrel, the lowest in a month, as talks to end the war in Ukraine show signs of progress. Crude had dropped sharply earlier in the session after ABC News reported Kyiv agreed to the terms of a revised peace deal aimed at ending Russia's nearly four-year war.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said talks on a peace plan are continuing with the US. There are key points still to be resolved between US and Ukraine, including the thorniest issues, according to a person familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson signaled optimism around the efforts while warning some details still need to be sorted as Russia's position on the plan remains unclear. Moscow and Ukraine carried out airstrikes overnight.

"Flat crude prices got hammered on news that Ukraine appeared open to the broad contours of the US-proposed peace plan," said Rory Johnston of Commodity Context. The physical market tells a different story, with "prompt Brent timespreads continuing to strengthen, indicating continued tightness" in near-term supply.

An end to the war would have significant ramifications for the oil market. Russia is one of the world's top producers and its flows are heavily sanctioned by the US, European Union and UK. In October the US announced new sanctions on its two major producers. It's still far from certain, though, that Russia will accept a revised peace plan that cut several points from an initial proposal following input from European officials.

"For energy markets, this means volatility is far from over," said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy A/S. "Prices reacted swiftly to the initial optimism for an agreement, but the underlying uncertainty has not changed. With several core issues unresolved and fighting still ongoing in parts of Ukraine, any new information from Kyiv or Moscow can move markets sharply in either direction."

In post-settlement trading, US President Donald Trump said on X that he looks forward to meeting Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "but only when the deal to end this war is final."

Any uptick in Russian oil volumes would only add to the oversupply in a market that the International Energy Agency says is heading for a record annual surplus next year. Producers inside and outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have been ramping up output in recent months, boosting supplies at a faster pace than demand is growing. Oil prices are down this year and on course for a fourth monthly decline.

[TITLE]The Hidden Energy Agenda Behind Trump’s Ukraine Peace Framework:
[TEXT]
The recently revealed 28-point peace framework promoted by Donald Trump’s team has been presented as a pragmatic blueprint for ending the war and rebuilding Ukraine. Yet beneath the diplomatic wording sits a highly strategic energy and raw-materials design, one that risks locking Ukraine into a future defined by fossil-fuel dependency, American control over vital resources, and a European Union sidelined at precisely the moment when its leadership is most needed. This is not only a peace plan, but it is also an energy settlement disguised as diplomacy, and Europe must recognise it as such.

Fossil-fuel dependency rebranded as reconstruction

According to coverage from Reuters and others, the 28-point plan includes a long-term economic cooperation framework that explicitly covers energy, natural resources, and industrial reconstruction. At first glance, this may seem like necessary investment thinking for a country devastated by war. But in practice, it follows the same pathway set earlier in the year when the U.S.–Ukraine cooperation framework quietly placed oil, natural gas, and other hydrocarbons at the centre of projected revenue streams for reconstruction.

This means Ukraine is being nudged to double down on fossil-fuel extraction rather than leap toward the renewable, hydrogen-based and European-integrated energy model that would give it long-term independence. Ukraine might indeed earn short-term revenue from exporting more gas or opening new oil fields, but doing so binds its future to volatile global energy markets, exposes it to decarbonisation-driven stranded-asset risks, and cements a structural dependency on external investors and technology holders.

In effect, Ukraine trades the energy future it could build for the energy past the world is trying to leave behind.

Privileged U.S. access to Ukraine’s subsoil wealth

The deeper issue lies in how the plan structures access to raw materials. Earlier cooperation language between Washington and Kyiv already gave U.S. entities priority access to new extractive licences and allowed half of Ukraine’s future revenues from newly developed natural-resource projects to flow into a joint fund shaped by U.S. financial logic. The 28-point plan simply expands and entrenches this approach.

This creates an uncomfortable reality. Ukraine, desperate for capital and military support, is being asked to part with significant control over its subsoil wealth, ranging from hydrocarbons to critical minerals such as lithium, graphite, titanium, and rare earth elements. The U.S. secures strategic advantages in supply chains vital for defence, industry, and the green transition. Ukraine secures much-needed support and a pathway to peace, but at the cost of long-term leverage over its own strategic assets.

Even more troubling is the way the plan implicitly separates military support from political autonomy. As reported by the Financial Times, President Zelenskyy has warned that Ukraine may be forced into a “very difficult choice” between maintaining dignity and risking the loss of a major partner. The pressure is real, and it is encoded directly into the energy terms of the 28-point plan.

Europe watches from the margins when it should lead

For Europe, the implications are profound. Ukraine is not just a neighbour, it is central to Europe’s future energy architecture. A Ukraine rebuilt as a modernised fossil-fuel hub for American supply chains does little for European energy autonomy. It contributes nothing to European hydrogen corridors, to renewable-grid integration, to the diversification of raw-materials processing away from China or to the consolidation of Europe’s own industrial base.

If the U.S. dominates Ukraine’s resource future, Europe’s strategic position weakens further. The EU becomes a payer rather than a partner, a supporter of Ukrainian survival but not a shaper of its reconstruction. This dynamic is entirely avoidable, yet the 28-point plan currently pushes Ukraine toward a model in which Europe becomes a secondary, even peripheral actor.

A restructuring that benefits Ukraine and Europe

Europe can still alter this trajectory, but only by proposing an alternative to the current resource-heavy settlement model. A credible restructuring of the peace and reconstruction framework could benefit both Ukraine and the EU if it rests on principles very different from the U.S. design.

Ukraine should be offered an energy pathway anchored in renewable power rather than hydrocarbons, one where the country becomes a major producer of green electricity and green hydrogen linked directly to European markets. This would give Ukraine sustainable revenue, technological advantage, and long-term geopolitical relevance.

Ukraine’s strategic minerals should be developed in partnership with European processors and manufacturers so that the value is created in Ukraine and Europe rather than simply extracted and exported. This means transparent governance, European regulatory standards and industrial integration, rather than resource concessions tied to external military or financial obligations.

Europe should position itself as the leading architect of Ukraine’s reconstruction, not merely as a donor. This requires a European peace proposal, one aligned with EU energy goals and decarbonisation strategies, that minimises dependence on U.S. political winds and military conditionalities.

Military or financial aid must never be exchanged for privileged access to subsoil resources. This principle protects Ukraine’s sovereignty and prevents exploitation during vulnerability.

If Europe can articulate such a plan, Ukraine would gain an alternative to a heavily U.S.-centred model. Europe, meanwhile, would gain a stronger, cleaner and more resilient energy partner on its eastern border.

The strategic upside of a European-led approach

A European restructuring of the peace and reconstruction framework brings significant advantages. Europe enhances its own energy security by integrating Ukraine into its hydrogen corridors, transmission networks and renewable-energy zones. It strengthens its raw-material sovereignty by working with Ukraine to process and refine critical minerals within the European industrial sphere. And it contributes to a peace settlement that is not built on extraction, dependency or foreign leverage but on long-term stability, economic dignity and mutual benefit.

This is a geopolitical strategy rooted in the future rather than the past. It recognises that Ukraine can either become the last major fossil-fuel frontier in Europe or the first major energy-transition partner on Europe’s eastern flank. The choice is still open, but the window is closing.

Conclusion, a final warning for Europe

The 28-point plan emerging from Washington may lead to a temporary cessation of fighting, yet it entrenches an energy and raw-materials architecture that serves American strategic interests far more than Ukrainian sovereignty or European security. If the EU continues to watch rather than act, Ukraine will rebuild on someone else’s terms, and Europe will inherit the consequences of another generation of dependency, vulnerability and lost opportunity.

Ukraine deserves a better energy future than one based on hydrocarbons and foreign leverage. Europe deserves a partner, not a pawn. And the moment to shape that outcome is now

[TITLE]Data Centers, AI, and Energy: Everything You Need to Know:
[TEXT]
The primary bottleneck for AI expansion has shifted from power generation to physical infrastructure, with long lead times for grid upgrades, a global transformer shortage, and geopolitical vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chain (copper, lithium, rare earth elements) creating acute risks.

Despite major tech companies' net-zero pledges, the sheer velocity of the AI buildout forces a reliance on reliable baseload power from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas through 2030, with nuclear power viewed as the long-term, carbon-free solution.

The exponential energy demand of AI-driven data centers, particularly from high-performance accelerated servers (GPUs and ASICs), is rapidly outpacing global energy efficiency trends, leading to a projected doubling of data center electricity consumption by 2030.

For the past decade, the defining narrative of the global energy sector has been the transition of supply. Governments, utilities, and investors have focused almost exclusively on shifting generation assets from fossil fuels to renewables, retiring coal plants in favor of wind farms and solar arrays....

The narrative for the next decade, however, is currently being rewritten by a structural shift in demand that few predicted would happen this quickly: the exponential rise of the data center.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) transitions from theoretical models in research labs to wide-scale commercial deployment, data centers have evolved. They are no longer passive warehouses for email storage and website hosting; they are now active, energy-intensive industrial engines. These facilities have become the "refineries" of the digital age, processing raw data into economic value, and in doing so, they are exerting unprecedented pressure on electricity grids, water resources, and critical mineral supply chains.

The implications for the energy market are profound. We are witnessing a collision between the digital economy's exponential growth curve and the physical economy's linear constraints. This guide provides a comprehensive analysis of how data centers utilize resources, the specific energy mixes powering them across different geopolitical regions, and the systemic risks posed by the integration of hyperscale compute infrastructure with legacy power grids.

Part I: The Anatomy of Consumption

To understand the macro-level impact of the sector on global energy markets, it is necessary to first understand the micro-level physics of the data center itself. These facilities are complex aggregations of IT equipment, environmental controls, and power management systems, each with distinct energy profiles that contribute to the total load.

From CPU to GPU and Custom Silicon

The fundamental driver of increasing energy density is the changing nature of the silicon chip. For decades, the industry relied on Central Processing Units (CPUs) for general-purpose computing. While powerful, CPUs operate within a relatively predictable energy envelope. The rise of Generative AI has necessitated a wholesale shift toward "accelerated servers."

The GPU Explosion

The initial phase of the AI infrastructure buildout has been defined by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). To understand the energy implications, one must understand the architecture. A traditional CPU is designed to do a few complex tasks very quickly in sequence. A GPU, conversely, is designed to do thousands of simple mathematical tasks simultaneously. Since AI training is effectively one giant matrix multiplication problem, the GPU is exponentially more efficient at the task than a CPU.

However, this computational density comes at a severe thermodynamic cost. As the industry packs more transistors onto silicon wafers to process larger models, the power draw per chip has skyrocketed. We have moved from an era of "general purpose" computing to "high-performance" computing, where energy consumption is the primary constraint on performance.

The market for these high-performance chips is currently dominated by a few key players driving the energy intensity of the sector:

Nvidia H100 "Hopper": Currently the industry standard for AI training. A single H100 chip can consume up to 700 watts at peak utilization. When installed in a server rack of 8 to 16 GPUs, the power density exceeds anything legacy data centers were built to handle.

Nvidia B200 "Blackwell": The next-generation architecture. It promises massive performance gains but raises the thermal stakes significantly, with a single chip capable of drawing up to 1,200 watts.

AMD Instinct MI300X: The primary competitor to Nvidia, offering high-density memory configurations that also require significant power and cooling infrastructure.

The deployment of these chips is fundamentally altering the physical requirements of the data center building. A legacy server rack typically draws 5 to 10 kilowatts (kW) of power. A modern rack packed with Blackwell or H100 GPUs can draw between 50 and 100 kW.

This tenfold increase in power density forces a transition from air cooling (fans blowing over metal heatsinks) to liquid cooling. Air is simply not a dense enough medium to carry away the waste heat generated by a 100kW rack. Consequently, the next generation of data centers is being plumbed like industrial chemical plants, with coolant loops running directly to the silicon die to prevent thermal throttling.

The Hyperscaler Rebellion

As energy constraints tighten and power costs rise, the major technology giants—the "Hyperscalers"—are seeking to reduce their dependence on general-purpose GPUs. While GPUs are excellent for AI, they still include legacy graphics logic that AI models do not need. This "silicon bloat" equates to wasted watts.

To solve this, companies are evolving toward Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These are custom chips designed from the ground up to do exactly one thing: run neural networks. By stripping away general-purpose features, these chips achieve significantly higher performance per watt, allowing data center operators to get more compute out of the same grid connection.

The major players have all launched proprietary silicon strategies:

Google (TPU): Google’s Tensor Processing Units are the veterans of this space. The latest 6th-generation "Trillium" TPU is explicitly engineered for energy efficiency, offering a 67% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the previous generation.

AWS (Trainium & Inferentia): Amazon Web Services has bifurcated its silicon. Trainium is built for the heavy lift of training models, while Inferentia is designed for the low-cost, low-energy task of "inference" (running the model for end-users).

Microsoft (Maia): Microsoft has introduced the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator, custom-designed to run large language models on the Azure cloud. It features a unique "sidekick" liquid cooling setup that fits into existing data center footprints.

Meta (MTIA): The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator is designed specifically for Meta's recommendation algorithms, optimizing for the specific math heavily used in social media ranking rather than generative text.

This shift toward ASICs represents the industrialization of AI. Just as the automotive industry moved from general workshops to specialized assembly lines, the data center industry is moving from general-purpose servers to specialized AI pods.

These custom chips allow Hyperscalers to decouple their growth from the broader supply chain constraints of the merchant GPU market. More importantly, they allow for a holistic system design. Because Google designs the TPU, the server rack, the cooling loop, and the data center shell, they can optimize the cooling flow to match the exact thermal profile of the chip, squeezing out efficiency gains that are impossible with off-the-shelf hardware.

Beyond the Silicon Limit

Looking further ahead, the industry recognizes that even custom silicon has a physical limit. As transistors shrink to the size of atoms, electrical resistance creates heat that cannot be easily mitigated. To break this energy curve, R&D labs are exploring exotic architectures that abandon traditional electronics entirely.

Two specific technologies are currently moving from theory to prototype:

Silicon Photonics: Current chips use copper wires to move data. Copper has resistance, which generates heat. Companies like Lightmatter and Ayar Labs are replacing copper with light (photons). Light generates virtually no heat compared to electricity and travels faster, potentially solving the data movement energy bottleneck that currently plagues large clusters.

Neuromorphic Computing: Traditional computers separate memory and processing, wasting energy moving data back and forth (the Von Neumann bottleneck). Neuromorphic chips are designed to mimic the human brain’s architecture, using "spiking neural networks" where processing and memory happen in the same location. These promise orders-of-magnitude reductions in power for specific sensory processing tasks.

This architectural pivot from CPU to accelerated silicon—and eventually to photonics—is not merely a technical detail; it is creating a two-speed energy market. The "old" internet of email and web hosting will continue to run on efficient, low-growth CPU servers. The "new" economy of AI will run on power-hungry accelerated infrastructure.

According to 2024 data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), this split is already visible in the data. Conventional servers are projected to see electricity consumption grow at a modest rate of 9 percent annually. In stark contrast, electricity consumption for accelerated servers (GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs) is projected to grow by 30 percent annually. By 2030, these accelerated servers will account for almost half of the net increase in global data center electricity consumption.

The Breakdown of Power Usage

A data center’s electricity consumption is distributed across five primary categories. Understanding this breakdown is critical for investors and analysts trying to identify where efficiency gains—and energy wastes—are located.

Source: IEA

Servers: Servers account for approximately 60 percent of total demand in a modern facility. This is the electricity actually doing the "work" of computation. As chip density increases, this percentage is rising relative to auxiliary systems, meaning the grid is becoming more directly coupled to the computational workload. When an AI model is training, the load is constant and high; when it is idle, it drops. This variability introduces new challenges for grid operators accustomed to steady industrial loads.

Cooling and Environmental Control: Cooling represents the single largest variable in data center efficiency, accounting for anywhere between 7 percent and 30 percent of total electricity intake. This massive variance highlights a divided market.

"Hyperscale" data centers—those massive campuses owned by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft—utilize advanced techniques to keep cooling demands near that 7 percent floor. They employ hot-aisle containment, free-air cooling, and increasingly, direct-to-chip liquid cooling. The shift to TPUs and high-end GPUs has made water cooling a necessity rather than a luxury, as air alone can no longer dissipate the heat generated by modern silicon.

In contrast, smaller enterprise data centers and legacy facilities are far less efficient. Many of these older facilities burn up to 30 percent of their total electricity intake just fighting the laws of thermodynamics, using energy-intensive air conditioners to keep servers from overheating. This sector is also the primary driver of water usage in data centers.

Storage, Network, and Infrastructure: The remainder of the power wedge is split between storage systems (5 percent), network equipment like switches and routers (5 percent), and general infrastructure like lighting and physical security. While individually small, the sheer volume of data being retained for AI training datasets means that storage energy demands are growing in absolute terms.

This internal distribution of energy—heavily weighted toward the silicon itself—explains why the industry is so focused on chip efficiency. Every watt saved at the server level cascades through the system, reducing the need for cooling, power distribution, and backup infrastructure. However, as the breakdown illustrates, the "low hanging fruit" of cooling efficiency has largely been harvested by the hyperscalers. The next frontier of efficiency gains must come from the compute load itself.

Ultimately, understanding the micro-level physics of the server rack is only the first step. While an individual GPU or TPU is a marvel of engineering, the aggregation of millions of these chips into global fleets creates a macro-economic force. The efficiency gains at the chip level are currently being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of deployment, leading us from the physics of the rack to the physics of the grid.

To grasp the full impact on global energy markets, we must move beyond the walls of the facility and look at the aggregate demand these components are placing on national power systems. The internal struggle between heat and compute is now spilling over into a global struggle for capacity.

Part II: The Scale of Demand

Data centers currently occupy a relatively small niche in global energy usage compared to heavy industry or transportation, but their growth velocity is outpacing almost every other sector in the global economy.

Current Baseline and Future Trajectories

In 2024, global data centers consumed an estimated 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. To put that in perspective, 415 TWh is roughly equivalent to the total annual electricity consumption of France. This represents approximately 1.5% of global electricity consumption. While this figure may appear marginal to the casual observer, the rate of change indicates a looming crunch.

Over the last five years, consumption has grown at 12 percent annually. Looking forward to 2030, the IEA projects this demand to accelerate, outlining three distinct scenarios that market watchers should monitor.

The Base Case: In the most likely scenario, global electricity consumption for data centers is projected to double, reaching roughly 945 TWh by 2030. In this future, the sector would consume just under 3 percent of the world’s total electricity. This doubling in just six years would require the addition of power generation capacity roughly equivalent to the entire current grid of Germany.

The "Lift-Off" Case: This scenario assumes that current supply chain constraints are resolved rapidly and that AI adoption accelerates unchecked by regulation or economics. Under these conditions, demand could surge to 1,700 TWh by 2035—consuming nearly 4.5 percent of the world's electricity. This would place data centers on par with the energy footprint of the entire country of India.

The Headwinds Case: Conversely, if technical bottlenecks, geopolitical fracturing, or slow AI adoption prevail, demand may plateau around 700 TWh. Even in this conservative view, the sector remains a massive industrial consumer, but one that stays below 2 percent of global demand.

Source: IEA

The Carbon Footprint

Beyond raw electricity usage, the carbon implications are significant. Today, data centers account for roughly 180 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 emissions annually, which is roughly 0.5% of global energy-related emissions. While this is currently lower than aviation or shipping, the trajectory is steeper.

If the "Lift-Off" scenario comes to pass, these emissions could rise to 1.4% of the global total. While hyperscalers are offsetting this with renewable purchases, the "location-based" emissions (the actual carbon emitted by the local grid powering the facility) often remain higher than the "market-based" emissions (the net figure after offsets). This discrepancy is key for ESG investors: a data center in a coal-heavy region like Inner Mongolia or West Virginia has a physical carbon footprint that no amount of paper credits can fully erase.

The End of the Efficiency Era

Regardless of which scenario plays out, the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Contextualizing the Surge

Regardless of which scenario plays out—Base, Lift-Off, or Headwinds—the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition, creating a wedge of new demand that the grid was not built to accommodate.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Part III: The Energy Mix and Carbon Reality

There is a significant divergence between the stated decarbonization goals of major technology companies and the physical reality of the grids powering their facilities. Most hyperscalers have aggressive "Net Zero" targets, often aiming to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2030. However, the physical electrons flowing into their servers largely come from fossil fuels and will likely continue to do so through the medium term due to the mechanics of baseload power.

Source: IEA

1. Coal

Despite global efforts to phase out coal, it remains the silent workhorse of the digital economy. Coal is currently the largest single source of electricity for data centers globally, accounting for approximately 30 percent of the sector's power.

This reliance is heavily skewed by geography, specifically China. As the world's second-largest market for data infrastructure, China derives nearly 70 percent of its data center power from coal. However, even in Western markets, the baseload requirements of data centers often necessitate reliance on grid mixes that still contain coal generation, particularly during periods of low renewable output. The IEA projects that while coal's share will eventually decline, it will remain a critical pillar of supply until at least 2035, challenging the "green" narrative of the AI revolution.

2. Natural Gas

Natural gas currently meets 26 percent of global data center demand, but its role is arguably more critical than the raw percentage suggests. Gas is expected to be a primary beneficiary of the AI boom in the short term, particularly in North America.

Data centers operate on a standard of "five nines" (99.999%) of reliability. A power outage is not an inconvenience; it is a catastrophic financial event. Intermittent renewables like wind and solar cannot yet provide this level of uptime without massive battery storage, which is not yet deployed at sufficient scale. Consequently, natural gas serves as the dispatchable generation source of choice.

In the United States, natural gas is already the largest fuel source for data centers, accounting for over 40 percent of demand. Between 2024 and 2030, natural gas and coal combined are expected to meet over 40 percent of the additional electricity demand generated by data centers. For natural gas investors, the data center boom represents a new, durable source of industrial demand that is largely price-insensitive.

3. Renewables

[TITLE]The Hidden Energy Agenda Behind Trump’s Ukraine Peace Framework:
[TEXT]
The recently revealed 28-point peace framework promoted by Donald Trump’s team has been presented as a pragmatic blueprint for ending the war and rebuilding Ukraine. Yet beneath the diplomatic wording sits a highly strategic energy and raw-materials design, one that risks locking Ukraine into a future defined by fossil-fuel dependency, American control over vital resources, and a European Union sidelined at precisely the moment when its leadership is most needed. This is not only a peace plan, but it is also an energy settlement disguised as diplomacy, and Europe must recognise it as such.

Fossil-fuel dependency rebranded as reconstruction

According to coverage from Reuters and others, the 28-point plan includes a long-term economic cooperation framework that explicitly covers energy, natural resources, and industrial reconstruction. At first glance, this may seem like necessary investment thinking for a country devastated by war. But in practice, it follows the same pathway set earlier in the year when the U.S.–Ukraine cooperation framework quietly placed oil, natural gas, and other hydrocarbons at the centre of projected revenue streams for reconstruction.

This means Ukraine is being nudged to double down on fossil-fuel extraction rather than leap toward the renewable, hydrogen-based and European-integrated energy model that would give it long-term independence. Ukraine might indeed earn short-term revenue from exporting more gas or opening new oil fields, but doing so binds its future to volatile global energy markets, exposes it to decarbonisation-driven stranded-asset risks, and cements a structural dependency on external investors and technology holders.

Related: Indonesia Invites Firms to Explore 108 Untapped Oil and Gas Basins

In effect, Ukraine trades the energy future it could build for the energy past the world is trying to leave behind.

Privileged U.S. access to Ukraine’s subsoil wealth

The deeper issue lies in how the plan structures access to raw materials. Earlier cooperation language between Washington and Kyiv already gave U.S. entities priority access to new extractive licences and allowed half of Ukraine’s future revenues from newly developed natural-resource projects to flow into a joint fund shaped by U.S. financial logic. The 28-point plan simply expands and entrenches this approach.

This creates an uncomfortable reality. Ukraine, desperate for capital and military support, is being asked to part with significant control over its subsoil wealth, ranging from hydrocarbons to critical minerals such as lithium, graphite, titanium, and rare earth elements. The U.S. secures strategic advantages in supply chains vital for defence, industry, and the green transition. Ukraine secures much-needed support and a pathway to peace, but at the cost of long-term leverage over its own strategic assets.

Even more troubling is the way the plan implicitly separates military support from political autonomy. As reported by the Financial Times, President Zelenskyy has warned that Ukraine may be forced into a “very difficult choice” between maintaining dignity and risking the loss of a major partner. The pressure is real, and it is encoded directly into the energy terms of the 28-point plan.

Europe watches from the margins when it should lead

For Europe, the implications are profound. Ukraine is not just a neighbour, it is central to Europe’s future energy architecture. A Ukraine rebuilt as a modernised fossil-fuel hub for American supply chains does little for European energy autonomy. It contributes nothing to European hydrogen corridors, to renewable-grid integration, to the diversification of raw-materials processing away from China or to the consolidation of Europe’s own industrial base.

If the U.S. dominates Ukraine’s resource future, Europe’s strategic position weakens further. The EU becomes a payer rather than a partner, a supporter of Ukrainian survival but not a shaper of its reconstruction. This dynamic is entirely avoidable, yet the 28-point plan currently pushes Ukraine toward a model in which Europe becomes a secondary, even peripheral actor.

A restructuring that benefits Ukraine and Europe

Europe can still alter this trajectory, but only by proposing an alternative to the current resource-heavy settlement model. A credible restructuring of the peace and reconstruction framework could benefit both Ukraine and the EU if it rests on principles very different from the U.S. design.

Ukraine should be offered an energy pathway anchored in renewable power rather than hydrocarbons, one where the country becomes a major producer of green electricity and green hydrogen linked directly to European markets. This would give Ukraine sustainable revenue, technological advantage, and long-term geopolitical relevance.

Ukraine’s strategic minerals should be developed in partnership with European processors and manufacturers so that the value is created in Ukraine and Europe rather than simply extracted and exported. This means transparent governance, European regulatory standards and industrial integration, rather than resource concessions tied to external military or financial obligations.

Europe should position itself as the leading architect of Ukraine’s reconstruction, not merely as a donor. This requires a European peace proposal, one aligned with EU energy goals and decarbonisation strategies, that minimises dependence on U.S. political winds and military conditionalities.

Military or financial aid must never be exchanged for privileged access to subsoil resources. This principle protects Ukraine’s sovereignty and prevents exploitation during vulnerability.

If Europe can articulate such a plan, Ukraine would gain an alternative to a heavily U.S.-centred model. Europe, meanwhile, would gain a stronger, cleaner and more resilient energy partner on its eastern border.

The strategic upside of a European-led approach

A European restructuring of the peace and reconstruction framework brings significant advantages. Europe enhances its own energy security by integrating Ukraine into its hydrogen corridors, transmission networks and renewable-energy zones. It strengthens its raw-material sovereignty by working with Ukraine to process and refine critical minerals within the European industrial sphere. And it contributes to a peace settlement that is not built on extraction, dependency or foreign leverage but on long-term stability, economic dignity and mutual benefit.

This is a geopolitical strategy rooted in the future rather than the past. It recognises that Ukraine can either become the last major fossil-fuel frontier in Europe or the first major energy-transition partner on Europe’s eastern flank. The choice is still open, but the window is closing.

Conclusion, a final warning for Europe

The 28-point plan emerging from Washington may lead to a temporary cessation of fighting, yet it entrenches an energy and raw-materials architecture that serves American strategic interests far more than Ukrainian sovereignty or European security. If the EU continues to watch rather than act, Ukraine will rebuild on someone else’s terms, and Europe will inherit the consequences of another generation of dependency, vulnerability and lost opportunity.

Ukraine deserves a better energy future than one based on hydrocarbons and foreign leverage. Europe deserves a partner, not a pawn. And the moment to shape that outcome is now

Sustaining India’s momentum requires significant capital and credit to fuel growth. Unlike China, which relied on government capital, India will need internally generated funds or external capital, Emirates NBD Bank CEO Shayne Nelson told Economic Times as he sat down for his first interview since the UAE financial powerhouse’s $3 billion deal to acquire a majority stake in RBL Bank . Edited excerpts:: We’ve now been in India for more than 25 years, so our commitment to India has been long standing. We had a rep office earlier and opened our maiden branch in 2017 in Mumbai followed by two more in Gurugram and Chennai in 2022. We bank many Indian customers globally—in London, Saudi Arabia, the UAE as well as Singapore. So, when I presented to our board, I highlighted India’s inflection point. I moved to Hong Kong in 1997, around the time the handover to China was taking place. Back then, Chinese banks were relatively small. Today, even mid-sized Chinese banks are bigger than us. That growth happened because the Chinese economy grew at a rate of 8-9% and, to support that growth, the banks needed to fund it and, to have that lending capacity, banks needed capital, which the Chinese government infused.India is now at a similar stage—currently it’s the fourth-largest economy, projected to reach $7 trillion by 2030. That requires significant capital and credit to fuel growth and we felt it is the right time to enter India to capture this growth momentum. Unlike China, which relied on government capital, India will need internally generated funds or external capital like ours. Credit growth in India will accelerate as the economy expands at 6–8%. Large banks with substantial capital will become essential. As you mentioned, both the UAE and India have been strategic allies in the last decade. Relations have improved considerably on the back of the CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) agreement. We are a trusted partner of both India and the UAE government. Dubai is home to a large Indian population. That creates strong cultural, trade and capital flows, making this move a natural fit.: Three billion dollars is affordable for us (laughs), so from a capital perspective, this transaction makes sense. We want control with 60%. While we understand the 26% voting rights and other rules, we believe the deal structure will allow us to consolidate numbers, which has been key to our negotiations. We think the timing is right. India’s growth will require capital and strong banks, and we want to be part of that story. If you try entering China now, it’s too late. With $3 billion, you cannot even scratch the surface. In India, this amount is significant and it's mutually beneficial. It positions us well for future profitability while benefiting India and our existing customers around the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. We see a big opportunity here.: The RBI has always been a very prudent and forward-looking regulator--that’s one of the reasons the Indian banking system is among the strongest globally today. What is evolving in recent years is India’s confidence in its own financial sector. The fact that RBI is open to a well-capitalized and well-governed foreign bank taking a majority position in a sound Indian institution reflects that confidence. It gives long-term investors like us the clarity to commit capital at scale.For us, a minority stake would not have made strategic sense. In most jurisdictions, minority investments in banks can be capital punitive. So yes, the regulatory openness to a controlling stake--combined with India’s growth story and the strength of its institutions--definitely helped move the needle for us. It created the right environment for a serious, long-term, strategic commitment, rather a financial investment.: Of course, we’d love a higher voting right--equivalent to our economic rights, as is the case around the world. We tried very hard, but the 26% voting rights cap (for a single shareholder) is enshrined in banking law and requires a legislative change. I think given the opportunity we had at hand and the way the structure will work, we think we can manage despite the gap between economic and voting rights: One of the most important things for us was control. The key challenge for us was how does one get control of Yes Bank? How would you get over 50%? The way the shareholding was structured and what was being sold was really not going to give us what we needed. This transaction gave us what we have been looking for all along.: I can't comment on IDBI. We are currently fully focused to conclude the RBL transaction.: Our existing three branches will merge with RBL. India doesn’t allow dual modes of operation, so we can’t keep both the WOS (wholly owned subsidiaries) and RBL’s branches. I would say, RBI was very forward-looking. They supported the current structure which is far more simple. Emirates NBD will directly buy shares in RBL, then merge its current existing branches in India into RBL. As per our conversations, RBI will designate RBL as a subsidiary of a foreign bank. So RBL will become a subsidiary of Emirates NBD.: Subject to regulatory approvals, we would think by the end of first quarter of 2026 or early 2Q 2026.: I’m always willing to inject more capital provided we get the returns. But within a year, I doubt we’ll see returns from RBL and there will be any need for additional capital. The $3 billion will sustain growth for quite a while, as we build out and integrate. Full economic benefits will come only after technology integration, and that will take time.: (Laughs) I wouldn’t call it an entrée—it’s more like the main meal, but we’re open to dessert. We’re a conservatively run bank that generates strong profits and retains capital—our dividend payout ratio is

[TITLE]America’s $100 Billion Plan to Ensure Energy Security:
[TEXT]
The US Export-Import Bank, an independent federal agency tasked with helping to facilitate US trade, will invest $100 billion to achieve President Trump's plan to secure US and allied supply chains for critical minerals, nuclear energy, and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Its new chair, John Jovanovic (appointed in September) told the Financial Times that the agency would finance these efforts in order to counter western reliance on China and Russia - and that the first tranche of deals will include projects in Egypt, Pakistan and Europe, adding that the West has been over-reliant on supplies of critical materials that "are no longer fair."

"We can't do anything else that we're trying to do without these underlying critical raw material supply chains being secure, stable and functioning," Jovanovic told the outlet, adding that the bank's first deals would include a credit insurance guarantee for $4 billion of LNG being delivered from Egypt by New York-based commodities group Hartree Partners, as well as a $1.25 billion loan for the Reko Diq mine under development in Pakistan by Barrick Mining.

The bank currently has $100 billion to deploy out of $135 billion authorized by Congress, and has authorized $8.7 billion in new transactions in the 12 months to the end of September, which doesn't include a $4.7 billion loan that was reapproved in March to support an LNG project in Mozambique led by France's TotalEnergies, the FT reports.

Ex-Im Bank is "back in a big way, and it’s open for business," said Jovanovic in his first interview since assuming his new role, adding that the focus would be on bringing "US energy molecules to every corner of the globe."

He also said that the United States "can’t do anything else that we’re trying to do without these underlying critical raw material supply chains being secure, stable and functioning."

Ex-Im was being “inundated” with requests for support for US LNG coming from Europe, Africa and Asia, and a series of multibillion-dollar LNG supply deals would be announced in the coming days, he said.

While some development banks have climate change-related mandates that prevent them from investing in fossil fuels projects, Ex-Im cannot exclude them. Jovanovic said American LNG would be a “stabilising factor in providing energy security to parts of the world that need it most”.

Ex-Im’s increased focus on supporting LNG exports and energy security represents a shift of emphasis for the bank, which had been expanding support for renewable energy under former president Joe Biden. Last year it supported $1.6bn in green energy projects, an increase of 74 per cent compared with 2023. -FT

Meanwhile, Ex-Im is "actively in discussions"

[TITLE]CETY Secures $10 Million Battery Energy Storage Project in New York — First of Multiple Large-Scale Systems Expected to Follow:
[TEXT]
IRVINE, CA., Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETY) (“CETY” or the “Company”), a clean energy technology company delivering scalable solutions in power generation, storage, waste-to-energy, and heat-to-power, today announced that it has secured a $10 million Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project in New York State. This award represents the Company’s largest storage project to date and marks the first of several similar, either front of the meter or behind the meter, BESS deployments across New York State CETY expects to finalize in the months ahead.

The New York project includes the deployment of a 5MW / 20MWh standalone energy storage system, designed to support grid reliability, peak-shaving, and market participation under New York’s Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) program and ancillary grid services markets. The site has the opportunity to increase energy storage capacity to the maximum 20MW/80MWh storage permitted for such locations, subject to grid interconnection availability.

Under the project award, CETY plans to serve as the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor and will deliver:

Full planning, engineering, and system design

Procurement of advanced storage hardware and balance-of-system equipment

Construction, installation, testing, and commissioning

Compliance with prevailing wage, interconnection, and state energy regulations

“This $10 million award is a major milestone for our energy storage business,” said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. “Battery energy storage is essential for grid stability and renewable integration. Securing this project not only validates our EPC capabilities but also sets the stage for a pipeline of additional BESS installations we expect to close soon. We are committed to expanding our footprint in one of the fastest-growing segments of the clean energy sector.”

As CETY expands its storage and clean-energy infrastructure portfolio, CETY is entering the new year with more than $20 million of contracted project backlog, reflecting strong demand for CETY’s EPC, waste-to-energy, and heat-to-power systems.

As CETY scales its pipeline of storage, waste-to-energy, and heat-to-power projects, CETY remains focused on strengthening its financial position. Executing larger, higher-margin projects is central to CETY’s plan to become free-cash-flow positive, improve access to inexpensive capital, and position itself for strategic mergers and acquisitions that can accelerate long-term growth.

This project reinforces CETY’s multi-technology strategy, complementing its waste-to-energy, heat-to-power, and power generation initiatives. By expanding into large-scale storage infrastructure, CETY is positioning itself at the intersection of grid modernization, electrification, and distributed energy resources.

[TITLE]Data Centers, AI, and Energy: Everything You Need to Know:
[TEXT]
The primary bottleneck for AI expansion has shifted from power generation to physical infrastructure, with long lead times for grid upgrades, a global transformer shortage, and geopolitical vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chain (copper, lithium, rare earth elements) creating acute risks.

Despite major tech companies' net-zero pledges, the sheer velocity of the AI buildout forces a reliance on reliable baseload power from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas through 2030, with nuclear power viewed as the long-term, carbon-free solution.

The exponential energy demand of AI-driven data centers, particularly from high-performance accelerated servers (GPUs and ASICs), is rapidly outpacing global energy efficiency trends, leading to a projected doubling of data center electricity consumption by 2030.

For the past decade, the defining narrative of the global energy sector has been the transition of supply. Governments, utilities, and investors have focused almost exclusively on shifting generation assets from fossil fuels to renewables, retiring coal plants in favor of wind farms and solar arrays....

The narrative for the next decade, however, is currently being rewritten by a structural shift in demand that few predicted would happen this quickly: the exponential rise of the data center.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) transitions from theoretical models in research labs to wide-scale commercial deployment, data centers have evolved. They are no longer passive warehouses for email storage and website hosting; they are now active, energy-intensive industrial engines. These facilities have become the "refineries" of the digital age, processing raw data into economic value, and in doing so, they are exerting unprecedented pressure on electricity grids, water resources, and critical mineral supply chains.

The implications for the energy market are profound. We are witnessing a collision between the digital economy's exponential growth curve and the physical economy's linear constraints. This guide provides a comprehensive analysis of how data centers utilize resources, the specific energy mixes powering them across different geopolitical regions, and the systemic risks posed by the integration of hyperscale compute infrastructure with legacy power grids.

Part I: The Anatomy of Consumption

To understand the macro-level impact of the sector on global energy markets, it is necessary to first understand the micro-level physics of the data center itself. These facilities are complex aggregations of IT equipment, environmental controls, and power management systems, each with distinct energy profiles that contribute to the total load.

From CPU to GPU and Custom Silicon

The fundamental driver of increasing energy density is the changing nature of the silicon chip. For decades, the industry relied on Central Processing Units (CPUs) for general-purpose computing. While powerful, CPUs operate within a relatively predictable energy envelope. The rise of Generative AI has necessitated a wholesale shift toward "accelerated servers."

The GPU Explosion

The initial phase of the AI infrastructure buildout has been defined by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). To understand the energy implications, one must understand the architecture. A traditional CPU is designed to do a few complex tasks very quickly in sequence. A GPU, conversely, is designed to do thousands of simple mathematical tasks simultaneously. Since AI training is effectively one giant matrix multiplication problem, the GPU is exponentially more efficient at the task than a CPU.

However, this computational density comes at a severe thermodynamic cost. As the industry packs more transistors onto silicon wafers to process larger models, the power draw per chip has skyrocketed. We have moved from an era of "general purpose" computing to "high-performance" computing, where energy consumption is the primary constraint on performance.

The market for these high-performance chips is currently dominated by a few key players driving the energy intensity of the sector:

Nvidia H100 "Hopper": Currently the industry standard for AI training. A single H100 chip can consume up to 700 watts at peak utilization. When installed in a server rack of 8 to 16 GPUs, the power density exceeds anything legacy data centers were built to handle.

Nvidia B200 "Blackwell": The next-generation architecture. It promises massive performance gains but raises the thermal stakes significantly, with a single chip capable of drawing up to 1,200 watts.

AMD Instinct MI300X: The primary competitor to Nvidia, offering high-density memory configurations that also require significant power and cooling infrastructure.

The deployment of these chips is fundamentally altering the physical requirements of the data center building. A legacy server rack typically draws 5 to 10 kilowatts (kW) of power. A modern rack packed with Blackwell or H100 GPUs can draw between 50 and 100 kW.

This tenfold increase in power density forces a transition from air cooling (fans blowing over metal heatsinks) to liquid cooling. Air is simply not a dense enough medium to carry away the waste heat generated by a 100kW rack. Consequently, the next generation of data centers is being plumbed like industrial chemical plants, with coolant loops running directly to the silicon die to prevent thermal throttling.

The Hyperscaler Rebellion

As energy constraints tighten and power costs rise, the major technology giants—the "Hyperscalers"—are seeking to reduce their dependence on general-purpose GPUs. While GPUs are excellent for AI, they still include legacy graphics logic that AI models do not need. This "silicon bloat" equates to wasted watts.

To solve this, companies are evolving toward Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These are custom chips designed from the ground up to do exactly one thing: run neural networks. By stripping away general-purpose features, these chips achieve significantly higher performance per watt, allowing data center operators to get more compute out of the same grid connection.

The major players have all launched proprietary silicon strategies:

Google (TPU): Google’s Tensor Processing Units are the veterans of this space. The latest 6th-generation "Trillium" TPU is explicitly engineered for energy efficiency, offering a 67% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the previous generation.

AWS (Trainium & Inferentia): Amazon Web Services has bifurcated its silicon. Trainium is built for the heavy lift of training models, while Inferentia is designed for the low-cost, low-energy task of "inference" (running the model for end-users).

Microsoft (Maia): Microsoft has introduced the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator, custom-designed to run large language models on the Azure cloud. It features a unique "sidekick" liquid cooling setup that fits into existing data center footprints.

Meta (MTIA): The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator is designed specifically for Meta's recommendation algorithms, optimizing for the specific math heavily used in social media ranking rather than generative text.

This shift toward ASICs represents the industrialization of AI. Just as the automotive industry moved from general workshops to specialized assembly lines, the data center industry is moving from general-purpose servers to specialized AI pods.

These custom chips allow Hyperscalers to decouple their growth from the broader supply chain constraints of the merchant GPU market. More importantly, they allow for a holistic system design. Because Google designs the TPU, the server rack, the cooling loop, and the data center shell, they can optimize the cooling flow to match the exact thermal profile of the chip, squeezing out efficiency gains that are impossible with off-the-shelf hardware.

Beyond the Silicon Limit

Looking further ahead, the industry recognizes that even custom silicon has a physical limit. As transistors shrink to the size of atoms, electrical resistance creates heat that cannot be easily mitigated. To break this energy curve, R&D labs are exploring exotic architectures that abandon traditional electronics entirely.

Two specific technologies are currently moving from theory to prototype:

Silicon Photonics: Current chips use copper wires to move data. Copper has resistance, which generates heat. Companies like Lightmatter and Ayar Labs are replacing copper with light (photons). Light generates virtually no heat compared to electricity and travels faster, potentially solving the data movement energy bottleneck that currently plagues large clusters.

Neuromorphic Computing: Traditional computers separate memory and processing, wasting energy moving data back and forth (the Von Neumann bottleneck). Neuromorphic chips are designed to mimic the human brain’s architecture, using "spiking neural networks" where processing and memory happen in the same location. These promise orders-of-magnitude reductions in power for specific sensory processing tasks.

This architectural pivot from CPU to accelerated silicon—and eventually to photonics—is not merely a technical detail; it is creating a two-speed energy market. The "old" internet of email and web hosting will continue to run on efficient, low-growth CPU servers. The "new" economy of AI will run on power-hungry accelerated infrastructure.

According to 2024 data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), this split is already visible in the data. Conventional servers are projected to see electricity consumption grow at a modest rate of 9 percent annually. In stark contrast, electricity consumption for accelerated servers (GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs) is projected to grow by 30 percent annually. By 2030, these accelerated servers will account for almost half of the net increase in global data center electricity consumption.

The Breakdown of Power Usage

A data center’s electricity consumption is distributed across five primary categories. Understanding this breakdown is critical for investors and analysts trying to identify where efficiency gains—and energy wastes—are located.

Source: IEA

Servers: Servers account for approximately 60 percent of total demand in a modern facility. This is the electricity actually doing the "work" of computation. As chip density increases, this percentage is rising relative to auxiliary systems, meaning the grid is becoming more directly coupled to the computational workload. When an AI model is training, the load is constant and high; when it is idle, it drops. This variability introduces new challenges for grid operators accustomed to steady industrial loads.

Cooling and Environmental Control: Cooling represents the single largest variable in data center efficiency, accounting for anywhere between 7 percent and 30 percent of total electricity intake. This massive variance highlights a divided market.

"Hyperscale" data centers—those massive campuses owned by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft—utilize advanced techniques to keep cooling demands near that 7 percent floor. They employ hot-aisle containment, free-air cooling, and increasingly, direct-to-chip liquid cooling. The shift to TPUs and high-end GPUs has made water cooling a necessity rather than a luxury, as air alone can no longer dissipate the heat generated by modern silicon.

In contrast, smaller enterprise data centers and legacy facilities are far less efficient. Many of these older facilities burn up to 30 percent of their total electricity intake just fighting the laws of thermodynamics, using energy-intensive air conditioners to keep servers from overheating. This sector is also the primary driver of water usage in data centers.

Storage, Network, and Infrastructure: The remainder of the power wedge is split between storage systems (5 percent), network equipment like switches and routers (5 percent), and general infrastructure like lighting and physical security. While individually small, the sheer volume of data being retained for AI training datasets means that storage energy demands are growing in absolute terms.

This internal distribution of energy—heavily weighted toward the silicon itself—explains why the industry is so focused on chip efficiency. Every watt saved at the server level cascades through the system, reducing the need for cooling, power distribution, and backup infrastructure. However, as the breakdown illustrates, the "low hanging fruit" of cooling efficiency has largely been harvested by the hyperscalers. The next frontier of efficiency gains must come from the compute load itself.

Ultimately, understanding the micro-level physics of the server rack is only the first step. While an individual GPU or TPU is a marvel of engineering, the aggregation of millions of these chips into global fleets creates a macro-economic force. The efficiency gains at the chip level are currently being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of deployment, leading us from the physics of the rack to the physics of the grid.

To grasp the full impact on global energy markets, we must move beyond the walls of the facility and look at the aggregate demand these components are placing on national power systems. The internal struggle between heat and compute is now spilling over into a global struggle for capacity.

Part II: The Scale of Demand

Data centers currently occupy a relatively small niche in global energy usage compared to heavy industry or transportation, but their growth velocity is outpacing almost every other sector in the global economy.

Current Baseline and Future Trajectories

In 2024, global data centers consumed an estimated 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. To put that in perspective, 415 TWh is roughly equivalent to the total annual electricity consumption of France. This represents approximately 1.5% of global electricity consumption. While this figure may appear marginal to the casual observer, the rate of change indicates a looming crunch.

Over the last five years, consumption has grown at 12 percent annually. Looking forward to 2030, the IEA projects this demand to accelerate, outlining three distinct scenarios that market watchers should monitor.

The Base Case: In the most likely scenario, global electricity consumption for data centers is projected to double, reaching roughly 945 TWh by 2030. In this future, the sector would consume just under 3 percent of the world’s total electricity. This doubling in just six years would require the addition of power generation capacity roughly equivalent to the entire current grid of Germany.

The "Lift-Off" Case: This scenario assumes that current supply chain constraints are resolved rapidly and that AI adoption accelerates unchecked by regulation or economics. Under these conditions, demand could surge to 1,700 TWh by 2035—consuming nearly 4.5 percent of the world's electricity. This would place data centers on par with the energy footprint of the entire country of India.

The Headwinds Case: Conversely, if technical bottlenecks, geopolitical fracturing, or slow AI adoption prevail, demand may plateau around 700 TWh. Even in this conservative view, the sector remains a massive industrial consumer, but one that stays below 2 percent of global demand.

The Carbon Footprint

Beyond raw electricity usage, the carbon implications are significant. Today, data centers account for roughly 180 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 emissions annually, which is roughly 0.5% of global energy-related emissions. While this is currently lower than aviation or shipping, the trajectory is steeper.

If the "Lift-Off" scenario comes to pass, these emissions could rise to 1.4% of the global total. While hyperscalers are offsetting this with renewable purchases, the "location-based" emissions (the actual carbon emitted by the local grid powering the facility) often remain higher than the "market-based" emissions (the net figure after offsets). This discrepancy is key for ESG investors: a data center in a coal-heavy region like Inner Mongolia or West Virginia has a physical carbon footprint that no amount of paper credits can fully erase.

The End of the Efficiency Era

Regardless of which scenario plays out, the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Contextualizing the Surge

Regardless of which scenario plays out—Base, Lift-Off, or Headwinds—the trajectory is undeniable: the digital economy is decoupling from the energy efficiency trends of the past decade. For years, global data center energy use remained relatively flat even as internet traffic exploded, thanks to massive improvements in server efficiency and cloud consolidation. That era of "free" growth appears to be over. The thermodynamic intensity of AI compute means that energy consumption is now scaling linearly with digital ambition, creating a wedge of new demand that the grid was not built to accommodate.

This demand shock is distinct from other electrification trends. Unlike electric vehicles, which distribute load across millions of endpoints and can charge during off-peak hours, data centers are concentrated, baseload consumers. A single hyperscale campus can consume as much power as a mid-sized city, demanding that power 24/7 with zero tolerance for intermittency. This creates acute "hot spots" where local transmission infrastructure is overwhelmed long before national generation capacity is exhausted, effectively holding digital growth hostage to physical grid upgrades.

Part III: The Energy Mix and Carbon Reality

There is a significant divergence between the stated decarbonization goals of major technology companies and the physical reality of the grids powering their facilities. Most hyperscalers have aggressive "Net Zero" targets, often aiming to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2030. However, the physical electrons flowing into their servers largely come from fossil fuels and will likely continue to do so through the medium term due to the mechanics of baseload power.

Source: IEA

1. Coal

Despite global efforts to phase out coal, it remains the silent workhorse of the digital economy. Coal is currently the largest single source of electricity for data centers globally, accounting for approximately 30 percent of the sector's power.

This reliance is heavily skewed by geography, specifically China. As the world's second-largest market for data infrastructure, China derives nearly 70 percent of its data center power from coal. However, even in Western markets, the baseload requirements of data centers often necessitate reliance on grid mixes that still contain coal generation, particularly during periods of low renewable output. The IEA projects that while coal's share will eventually decline, it will remain a critical pillar of supply until at least 2035, challenging the "green" narrative of the AI revolution.

2. Natural Gas

Natural gas currently meets 26 percent of global data center demand, but its role is arguably more critical than the raw percentage suggests. Gas is expected to be a primary beneficiary of the AI boom in the short term, particularly in North America.

Data centers operate on a standard of "five nines" (99.999%) of reliability. A power outage is not an inconvenience; it is a catastrophic financial event. Intermittent renewables like wind and solar cannot yet provide this level of uptime without massive battery storage, which is not yet deployed at sufficient scale. Consequently, natural gas serves as the dispatchable generation source of choice.

In the United States, natural gas is already the largest fuel source for data centers, accounting for over 40 percent of demand. Between 2024 and 2030, natural gas and coal combined are expected to meet over 40 percent of the additional electricity demand generated by data centers. For natural gas investors, the data center boom represents a new, durable source of industrial demand that is largely price-insensitive.

[TITLE]Hawaii’s LNG Detour: Why A Fossil Bridge Arriving In The 2030s Makes No Sense:
[TEXT]
Hawaii is re-evaluating its electricity system again and LNG is back on the table as a proposed bridge between oil dependence and a renewable future. The idea is simple at first glance. Hawaii burns more oil for electricity than any other state and Oahu still relies on oil for most of its generation. LNG is cleaner than residual fuel oil at the smokestack and often cheaper per kWh after modern gas turbines extract more energy from the same heat. The argument is that a temporary shift to LNG creates breathing room while the islands continue to build wind, solar, and batteries. The appeal is easy to understand. A familiar thermal solution promises reliability and a measurable reduction in local air pollution. The problem is that the framing leaves out the full system picture and the lifecycle emissions I have been assessing for LNG supply chains for years.

Hawaii’s current electricity landscape makes the pressure to choose something immediate understandable. Most of Oahu’s electricity still comes from low sulfur fuel oil and diesel. Statewide consumption sits around 10 TWh a year, with Oahu dominating demand. Maui and Hawaii Island have higher renewable shares, but they also have lower total loads. Power prices remain the highest in the United States. Solar on rooftops is significant and increasingly central to daytime demand, but there is still a large thermal backbone under those panels. When the last coal plant closed, the gap was filled entirely with oil generation. The state’s legal requirement for 100% renewable electricity by 2045 means every new fossil asset must retire early or convert to something cleaner before it has delivered a full economic life.

Proponents of LNG tend to argue that oil dependence is too expensive, too polluting, and too volatile to maintain. They worry that relying heavily on solar and batteries before the system is fully reshaped risks reliability issues. They point out that residual fuel oil produces sulfur dioxide, particulates and heavy metals at levels that matter for public health. They argue that oil-fired generation is inflexible and that LNG in combined cycle turbines could reduce emissions while keeping firm capacity online. There is truth in all of this. Residual fuel oil is a dirty and expensive fuel. Meeting peak demand with existing oil plants is difficult. The utility does need dispatchable capacity to cover evening ramps and contingencies. These concerns justify a careful assessment of LNG, not a dismissal.

The infrastructure required for LNG in Hawaii is significant. The concept usually centers on a floating storage and regasification unit moored off Oahu, a set of pipelines to shore, and a new gas plant near the old Barbers Point coal site. Existing oil plants would be converted to dual fuel. The total capital cost of all associated facilities is often estimated at more than $1 billion. LNG creates new fixed charges that ratepayers fund regardless of how much the resource is used. Any LNG system built in the 2020s must recover its costs before 2045 or find a way to run on low carbon fuels that are still expensive and scarce. LNG promises lower fuel costs, but comes packaged with new debt and a new fossil interface that competes directly with renewables for dispatch.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are central to this debate. I have assessed LNG production and export chains in the United States for several years. The picture is rarely what the glossy brochures present. Methane leakage from upstream fields, gathering systems, compressors, and pipelines changes the climate math. Liquefaction requires large amounts of electricity and natural gas. Shipping LNG 3,000 miles across oceans is energy intensive. Regasification adds more losses. Combustion at the plant ends the chain, but everything before the plant stacks up behind the CO₂ coming out of the stack. For US LNG export facilities feeding Asian or Pacific markets, the full lifecycle emissions often reach levels close to heavy fuel oil when methane leakage is high. In the best cases, lifecycle LNG is cleaner than oil, but the difference is narrower than many assume when upstream emissions come from basins with known leakage problems.

Hawaii’s potential LNG sources would include British Columbia and the US mainland. BC’s upstream methane performance is better than some US basins, but the liquefaction plants there still impose an energy penalty that shows up in lifecycle emissions. With US LNG exports, the upstream methane issue is likely larger. Data from independent satellite surveys and academic work on the Permian and other basins demonstrates that leakage is not well controlled. When methane leaks, the climate impact grows fast. LNG might deliver a 20% to 40% lifecycle reduction compared to residual fuel oil in a best case supply chain. It might deliver much less in a realistic case. The gap depends on upstream practice and not on anything Hawaii controls.

Local air pollution is one area where LNG delivers clear and measurable improvements. Residual fuel oil produces sulfur dioxide at levels that no modern grid should accept. It also produces particulates and metals that create real health impacts. Natural gas contains very little sulfur and burns more completely. Switching a significant share of Oahu’s generation from oil to gas would cut sulfur dioxide by orders of magnitude. It would reduce particulates and eliminate heavy metal pollution related to fuel chemistry. The health benefit is real. The same benefit also appears when oil generation is displaced by wind, solar, and battery storage, because clean generation does not produce any stack emissions at all. The local pollution case for LNG is

[TITLE]Hyperscalers Crash the Grid as Big Tech Becomes a Power Trader:
[TEXT]
America’s hyperscalers are looking to ensure the electricity for their huge data centers by entering the supply side of the market—power trading.

Meta, Microsoft, and Apple, to name a few, have either requested or obtained authorizations from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale power.

Meta Platforms, for example, seeks to incentivize long-term commitments in power-generating capacity by expanding into power trading and having the flexibility to contract electricity from future power plants, according to Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy.

Currently, power plant developers are careful about committing investments in the long term, which is not enough to meet the demand from AI and data centers.

Power capacity developers “want to know that the consumers of power are willing to put skin in the game,” Meta’s Parekh told Bloomberg in an interview last week.

“Without Meta taking a more active voice in the need to expand the amount of power that’s on the system, it’s not happening as quickly as we would like,” the executive added.

U.S. power utilities are investing a record amount of money into transmission and grid connection. But current forecasts of AI-driven power demand vary so much that there is a massive margin of error, analysts and utility officials told Reuters Events in June.

The U.S. market faces “a moment of peak uncertainty,” according to Rebecca Carroll, senior director of market analytics at energy advisor Trio.

Electric utilities face a high degree of uncertainty over future revenues as the boom of AI data centers generates widely varying forecasts of peak demand in many areas across the country.

If utilities overestimate their future demand, they risk overbuilding new capacity that will not be met by consumption. A possible overbuild would come at the expense of the American ratepayers, who have already seen electricity prices rising at a faster pace than U.S. inflation over the past three years.

The era of stagnated power demand in the United States ended about two years ago when hyperscalers started the race to develop AI-driven solutions and build huge data centers across the U.S.

America’s five largest hyperscalers are set to hike spending on data centers by 50% to over $300 billion in 2025, according to estimates by Wood Mackenzie.

U.S utilities have already committed to add 116 gigawatts (GW) of large load to their networks, equivalent to around 15% of U.S. peak electricity demand in 2024, the energy consultancy reckons.

The venture into power trading from hyperscalers could give utilities more certainty that their future new capacity will find customers.

“We’re seeing a breakdown between the demand and supply sides of the market, with the biggest actors playing on both sides,” WoodMac’s Ben Hertz-Shargel told Bloomberg.

“To better orchestrate growth, you need some of the largest buyers of electricity to actively support the buildout of the supply side.”

If Meta and other tech giants commit to long-term purchase agreements, power capacity developers will be more willing to invest in long-lead plant construction.

Meta alone is investing $600 billion in the U.S. by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion, the company said earlier this month.

The company says it’s making additional investments in energy supply and these have so far helped to add more than 15 GW of new energy projects to the grid across 27 states, representing more than $16 billion in capital investments.

It’s not only clean energy that will power the huge data centers of the hyperscalers—natural gas will play an important role, too.

For example, Meta’s new data center in Richland Parish in Louisiana, worth over $10 billion, will source electricity from three new gas-fired power plants after the Louisiana Public Service Commission this summer approved an agreement that paves the way for Entergy Louisiana to build these plants.

“Importantly, Meta is paying its share of the costs for the infrastructure needed to support its operations, ensuring that other customers are protected from those expenses,” Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO, said in August.
