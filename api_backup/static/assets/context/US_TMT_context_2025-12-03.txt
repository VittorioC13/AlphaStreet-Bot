[TITLE]VC Lightspeed joins race for stake in cloud infra startup Neysa:
[TEXT]
Venture capital firm Lightspeed has entered the fray to pick up a stake in cloud infrastructure startup Neysa , joining Japanese investor SoftBank and private equity firm Blackstone , which have already been in talks, according to people in the know.While Blackstone is negotiating a buyout of Neysa, Lightspeed, much like SoftBank, is discussing picking up a $40-50 million minority stake in the Z47 and Nexus Venture Partners-backed startup.“Blackstone wants to buy a majority stake in Neysa, while SoftBank and Lightspeed are discussing a minority investment that is expected to value the company at around $250-300 million,” said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified. “These are all early stage negotiations.”The $250-300 million valuation will mark a significant jump in valuation for the startup, which was last valued at around $76 million during its October 2024 funding round.Neysa is the second venture of Sharad Sanghi, who founded Netmagic, one of India’s oldest data centre services companies.Mumbai-based Neysa, founded in 2023 by Sanghi and former senior Netmagic executive Anindya Das, offers compute power and software tools to build, run and manage artificial intelligence (AI) applications to businesses ranging from large enterprises to startups and even governments. The company raised $50 million in funding across two rounds in 2024 from Nexus Venture Partners, Z47, Blume Ventures and NTTVC.“Indian founders are going all-in on the application layer of AI, but very few are taking on the infrastructure layer because of its capital-intensive nature… it needs land, power and deep technical talent, and that’s not an easy mix for most startups,” said a technology investor. “That’s why we’re seeing many entrepreneurs from India building software and enterprise tools instead. Neysa’s founding team, though, has already built at that scale with Netmagic, which makes them stand out in the sense that they actually know how to pull off AI infrastructure in India.”Neysa did not respond to ET’s queries till press time. Emails sent to Lightspeed and SoftBank also went unanswered. Blackstone declined to comment.The negotiations for a stake in Neysa signal increasing investor interest in Indian alternatives to hyperscalers. ET reported on December 1 that global hyperscalers and domestic conglomerates are set to invest more than $50 billion in the next five-seven years in India's data centre segment, taking total capacity to

Micron Technology (MU) Makes $9.6B Japan Bet as AI Demand Rises – What's Next for Growth?

Simply Wall St ^ | November 30, 2025 | Sasha Jovanovic

Posted on by SunkenCiv

Recent announcements, including the US$9.6 billion Japan chip plant, have fueled optimism but don’t materially change the current biggest short-term catalyst, tight global memory chip supply, or the main risk of continued heavy capital spending weighing on cash flow and margin stability.

Micron’s investment in the Hiroshima facility may be the most relevant recent announcement, as it enhances the company's manufacturing capacity for advanced memory, positioning it to serve fast-growing AI and data center markets. While this addresses demand surges, it also reinforces the importance of prudent capital allocation given memory market volatility and ongoing competition impacting returns.

[TITLE]Baidu is emerging as a major AI chip player in China to fill the Nvidia gap:
[TEXT]
A general view of the Baidu logo is seen at the Shanghai New Expo Center during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 28, 2025.

Tech giant Baidu is emerging as one of China's key artificial intelligence chip players, positioning itself as a challenger to Huawei as both look to fill the void left by industry leader Nvidia being kept out of the country.

Best-known as China's biggest search business, Baidu has in recent years refocused its business around driverless cars and AI, including a majority-owned subsidiary, Kunlunxin, which designs chips.

Several analysts have upgraded their outlook on Baidu's stock over the past few weeks, citing the semiconductor business and forecasting the unit will gain more domestic orders.

This month, Baidu laid out a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, beginning with the M100 in 2026 and the M300 in 2027. The company already uses a mix of its self-developed chips in its data centers to run its ERNIE AI models, as well as Nvidia products.

Baidu makes money by selling its chips to third parties building data centers as well as renting out computing capacity via its cloud. It has sought to position itself as a so-called "full stack" AI offering with infrastructure made up of chips, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.

And the chip business appears to be gaining traction. Earlier this year, Kunlunxin won orders from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.

"Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high- performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note this month.

While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely regarded as the most advanced chips for training and running AI, the company has been blocked by the U.S. government from selling its top-end product to China. Beijing has also reportedly been persuading local tech companies not to buy the H20, a less powerful Nvidia chip designed for the Chinese market and greenlit for export.

With Huawei — the leading player through its massive clusters of chips — out of the picture, analysts are suggesting Baidu will fill the void and its chip business is set for explosive growth.

"We believe domestic demand for AI compute in China remains intense, and hyperscalers are increasingly sourcing from local solution providers," JPMorgan said in a note on Sunday. "We view Kunlun AI chip as one of the best positioned."

The investment bank analysts forecast Baidu chips sales to increase six-fold to reach 8 billion Chinese yuan ($1.1 billion) in 2026.

Analysts at Macquarie estimate that Baidu's Kunlun chip unit could be valued at about $28 billion.

Baidu is not alone among China's tech giants when it comes to self-developed semiconductors. CNBC reported in August that Alibaba is also developing its next-generation AI chip.

[TITLE]Rare earth magnet sops to lift India’s EV, chip plans: Industry:
[TEXT]
The Union Cabinet’s approval of a Rs 7,280 crore scheme to promote manufacturing of sintered rare earth permanent magnets ( REPM ) will help address a crucial missing link in India’s electric vehicle (EV) and chip supply chains, electronics and semiconductor industry executives said.The programme aims to create 6,000 metric tonnes per annum of integrated REPM capacity through five globally bid projects, backed by sales-linked incentives and capital subsidy over a seven-year period.Under the scheme, India will, for the first time, support end-to-end REPM manufacturing, from rare earth oxides to metals, alloys and finished magnets, in order to cut import dependence and serve fast-growing demand from EVs, renewables, industrial electronics and defence.The government has earmarked Rs 6,450 crore for sales-linked incentives over five years and Rs 750 crore as capital support to set up the targeted 6,000 metric tonnes per annum capacity, with each of the five selected players expected to get up to 1,200 metric tonnes per annum.Officials expect India’s REPM consumption to roughly double between 2025 and 2030, driven primarily by EVs and clean energy, making domestic capacity critical to supply chain security and the country’s Net Zero 2070 roadmap.The scheme’s seven-year timeline includes a two-year gestation period for plants to come up, followed by five years of incentive disbursal linked to magnet sales.The REPM scheme complements ongoing semiconductor and electronics initiatives by addressing a core upstream vulnerability in India’s EV and chip ecosystem, said industry executives.Mayank Shrivastava, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and cofounder of AGNIT Semiconductors that specialises in gallium nitride semiconductor technology, said the programme is “as critical as building fabs”. This is because advanced electronics depends on magnetic materials as much as on silicon, and the initiative shores up a key weak link in the country’s electronics supply chain.Rajoo Goel, secretary-general of the Electronic Industries Association of India , called the government scheme a first of its kind initiative focused on the core of the supply chain for electronics. Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet available, making them critical for emerging technology applications like electric motors for vehicles, defence and aerospace, renewable energy, computer hard drives and smaller electronics such as smartphones, he said.These magnets are efficient, long-lasting, and have higher resistance to corrosion and high temperatures, he explained. With rapidly growing demand for electronic products and technology, magnets and inputs made of rare earth materials have become critical, he added.The electronics industry is becoming increasingly dependent on the same and the countries which control their supply chain and technology have a geopolitical advantage and can dictate terms to the rest of the world, Goel said. Vivek Tyagi , executive council member at the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association, said the scheme could quickly reduce import dependence for two- and three-wheeler manufacturers while also benefiting four-wheeler players over time.Several executives view the move as a logical follow-on to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's India Semiconductor Mission, aligning magnet manufacturing incentives with policies to attract chip fabs and advanced packaging units.The policy push comes as Andhra Pradesh emerges as a hub for downstream electronics and semiconductor manufacturing linked to EVs and industrial applications.Advanced System in Package (ASIP) Technologies is setting up an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility in the state in partnership with South Korea’s APACT, with an initial investment of Rs 468 crore.Chennai-based Syrma SGS, through its unit Syrma Strategic Electronics, is also building a Rs 765 crore multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) plant in Andhra Pradesh under the Centre’s electronic component manufacturing scheme, strengthening local PCB availability for automotive and industrial original equipment manufacturers.ASIP Technologies chief executive Venkata Simhadri said the rapid transition to EV two-wheelers and four-wheelers makes it “very important for India to create the local ecosystem and supply chain”, pointing to both semiconductors and REPMs as key components in the new mobility stack.He highlighted that the REPM scheme, along with ISM incentives for fabs and advanced packaging, addresses crucial elements of the EV supply chain, from permanent magnet motors on the mechanical side to compound semiconductor-based motor control and battery charging systems on the electronics side.While many electronics manufacturing services (EMS) players do not directly process rare earth materials, they expect second-order benefits from improved magnet availability.Syrma SGS managing director Jasbir Singh Gujral said REPMs are critical inputs for EV and semiconductor industries, and a domestic magnet ecosystem will indirectly help EMS companies by making the supply of magnet-based components more predictable and reducing the risk of supply chain disruptions.Syrma’s own operations rely on components made using REPMs, rather than raw magnets themselves, so greater upstream resilience should translate into smoother sourcing for finished parts, he said."It's a very well curated scheme that is coming at the apt time. It's going to take some time for these capacities to get created but the reactions I'm getting from my peers are quite positive," an EMS company executive said on the condition of anonymity."There is a belief that the investments are going to come in. And this is again de-risking from the borderland country which is absolutely prudent," he said.For fabless firms such as BigEndian Semiconductors, which designs custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions from its Bengaluru base while partnering with a foundry in Taiwan, the scheme stresses India’s intent to build deeper hardware value chains.Cofounder and chief executive Sunil Kumar cautioned that gestation-heavy incentive schemes tend to favour already established large organisations. However, innovation often comes from smaller challengers, making it important for policy to be calibrated to company size, he argued.Academia and skill-development experts expect the REPM scheme to catalyse new electronics manufacturing clusters, particularly for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and startups in advanced materials and magnet-based components.T Senthil Siva Subramanian, who heads the Institute Industry Interface programme at Hindustan College of Science and Technology in Mathura, said the scheme can help create MSME-focused electronics clusters that bridge lab-to-market gaps, generate new job roles through skilling, and encourage startups in REPM and related applications.He added that such clusters can feed into broader initiatives like “Vocal for Local” and “One District One Product” by nurturing “swadeshi” proof-of-concepts, while also advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals related to industry, innovation, infrastructure and climate action.Experts argue that domestic REPM capacity carries strategic weight beyond EVs, given its applications in defence, medical devices, nuclear research reactors and precision agriculture equipment.Subramanian pointed out that magnets such as samarium-cobalt and neodymium-iron-boron are critical across defence security systems, electronic traction motors, therapeutic medical equipment, nuclear research reactors and electronic farm machinery, and that local design and production capabilities can enhance India’s strategic autonomy and global ranking in high-tech manufacturing.He also expects the scheme to spur intangible investments in design tools, miniaturised products, software and intellectual property around rare earth magnets, boosting India’s standing in global innovation indices and helping domestic products progress across technology, customer, manufacturing and investment readiness levels.For policymakers and industry, the REPM push is increasingly seen as a foundational layer that strengthens everything from chip packaging and compound semiconductors to EVs, robotics and flexible electronics.(With inputs from Dia Rekhi in Chennai)

TNG Asia and GEA’s combined losses had no impact on the Company’s results from the fourth quarter of 2024 onwards as they were divested before the completion of the de-SPAC merger.

Headquarters expenses and adjustments recorded an EBIT loss of US$9.0 million, mainly contributed by: US$4.3 million in “Operating Expenses” in recognition of the incentive shares granted upon completion of the de-SPAC merger. US$1.5 million for the expenses incurred on developing AI projects. US$2.1 million for professional fees. US$0.8 million for amortization of intangible assets (Tranglo).

As such, from the fourth quarter of 2024 onward, only Tranglo’s (digital remittance and global airtime transfer businesses) and WalletKu’s (Indonesian airtime business) results will be consolidated and reported in the Company’s financial statements.

3 Total 2024 revenues include intercompany transactions.

Management Comments

“While global demand for digital remittance continues to grow, competition across major corridors has intensified,” said Alex Kong, Founder and Executive Chairman of Currenc. “In this environment, we prioritized pricing discipline, maintaining Tranglo’s take rate at 0.36% while delivering US$2.8 billion in TPV in the first half of 2025. Strategically, we continue to deemphasize lower-value airtime services, redirecting capital and resources toward our AI initiatives to deepen engagement with financial-institution clients, broaden our addressable market, and extend our remittance reach across additional high-volume corridors. Looking ahead, we remain committed to strengthening our remittance franchise while broadening our AI portfolio to create a more balanced, higher-quality revenue mix and deliver sustainable long-term value to our shareholders.”

Wan Lung Eng, Chief Financial Officer of Currenc Group, commented, “Our first-half performance reflects solid execution in our remittance business, which largely offset the expected decline in airtime revenues. Tranglo and WalletKu together generated positive EBITDA of US$1.7 million in the first half, while disciplined pricing and cost management kept our gross margin stable at 34.3% and maintained Tranglo’s payout rate at a healthy 0.13%. Operating expenses increased to US$15.1 million, mainly due to US$4.3 million in incentive share expenses associated with the de-SPAC merger and US$1.5 million in investments to develop our new AI offerings. Looking ahead, we will continue to streamline our cost structure, capitalize on our remittance strengths, and scale AI-driven growth to boost our profitability and shareholder value.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, it uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as described below, to understand and evaluate its core operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, is presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Currenc believes that EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the impact of items that Currenc does not consider indicative of the performance of its business. While Currenc believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating its business, this information should be considered supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

[TITLE]Telco Market Tracker Report, 2Q25: Performance for 140 Telcos from 1Q11 Through 2Q25 - Revenue, Labor, Capex, Opex, and Profitability Data:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Telco Market Tracker, 2Q25: Capex pullback persists even as revenues surge 4.6%" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

This report delivers a detailed analysis of the global telecommunications network operator (telco) industry, drilling down into performance for 140 telcos from 1Q11 through 2Q25. It captures revenue, labor, capex, opex, and profitability data with a focus on the most recent quarter (2Q25).

Key findings:

Global telco revenues climbed 4.6% year-over-year (YoY) in 2Q25 to reach $456.8 billion (B), supported by broad-based recovery across major markets. On an annualized 2Q25 basis, revenues grew 1.7% YoY to $1.8 trillion (T). Airtel (20.0%), Etisalat (18.7%), SoftBank (7.3%), Deutsche Telekom (4.6%), and China Unicom (3.7%) led growth in the annualized 2Q25 period, while Vodafone (-11.6%) and Orange (-7.1%) declined sharply.

Capex declined 2.1% YoY in 2Q25 to $67.5B, while the annualized total fell 2.6% to $292.9B. That's the lowest 12-month total since 2011, and the lowest capital intensity since 2013. China Mobile remained the largest investor with $24.4B in annualized capex (+7.8% YoY) in 2Q25, while America Movil (-24.5%), China Telecom (-22.9%), and China Unicom (-17.7%) made significant cutbacks. Telco tech spending continues to shift modestly towards software and services, which may be recorded as opex rather than capex, but telcos remain vigilant cost cutters across the board.

Labor costs fell 1.3% YoY to $258.1B in the annualized 2Q25 period, with telco headcount shrinking to 4.36 million. Labor represented 21.7% of opex (excluding D&A) for the annualized 2Q25 period, down a bit from 22.2% in 2Q24.

Profitability margin inched higher in the latest annualized period from a year ago, with EBITDA at 33.8%, suggesting stable operational efficiency despite cost pressures. EBIT margin also edged up a bit, from 14.9% in 2Q24 to 15.5% for the 12 months ended June 2025.

Regionally, Asia maintained its lead with 36.8% of global telco revenues in 2Q25, slightly ahead of the Americas (36.3%). On the capex spending front, the Americas outspent all other regions, boosted by network spending from AT&T and Verizon.

[TITLE]Telecom operators slam Trai’s draft rules, call 1% turnover penalty excessive:
[TEXT]
India’s telecom service providers have opposed the regulator’s proposal to impose turnover-linked penalties of up to 1% for filing incorrect or incomplete financial reports.

The government relies on these filings to verify operator revenues, compute statutory levies such as licence fees and spectrum usage charges, and intervene to ensure fair competition and protect consumer interest.

In submissions reviewed by Mint, the operators said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) proposed framework, which seeks to link monetary penalties to turnover, is disproportionate and would unfairly penalise inadvertent or minor errors.

“The proposed financial disincentive of up to 1% of turnover appears very stringent and should be reviewed by the Authority (Trai) to ensure that it remains fair, proportionate, and consistent with the existing regulations," Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said in its submissions to Trai earlier this month. COAI represents Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea.

Queries emailed to Trai and COAI remained unanswered till press time.

In FY25, telecom operators collectively reported a gross revenue of over ₹3.72 trillion, an increase of 10.7%, according to Trai data. A proposal for linking financial disincentives to turnover has come at a time when Vodafone Idea is eyeing relief on its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues up to FY17 from the department of telecommunications (DoT), after a recent Supreme Court verdict. Bharti Airtel, too, wants the government to reassess its case for pending AGR dues.

According to the Trai proposal, if a service provider submits a false report, or knowingly leaves out any important information, it will be required to pay a financial disincentive of up to 1% of its turnover, as determined by Trai, according to the draft regulations.

According to the operators, Trai’s draft rules to increase financial penalties for delays in reporting tariff plans and administrative compliances go against the government’s wider goals of promoting ease of doing business, simplifying compliance, and decriminalising minor procedural errors, as per the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023 and the proposed Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0.

“Trai is currently evaluating the inputs received from telecom operators. Any decision on the implementation of the regulations will be taken accordingly," a government official said on the condition of anonymity.

Last month, the telecom regulator proposed steeper fines under amendments to two regulations - the Draft Telecom Tariff Order (72nd Amendment) and the Reporting System on Accounting Separation (Amendment) Regulations, 2025. The tariff order amendment mandates reporting any new tariff plans, or changes to existing ones, to Trai within seven working days of its implementation. The regulator needs the same to review and intervene if a change is anti-competitive, predatory, or harmful to consumer interest.

Similarly, the Accounting Separation Regulations (ASR) are intended to provide transparency and accountability in telecom finances, allowing Trai to monitor the costs and revenues of different services and ensure fair pricing and regulatory decisions.

“The purpose of the regulation is to ensure that telecom service providers report to Trai on a consistent and accurate basis. The present regulation aims to amend the relevant regulatory provisions to enhance the effectiveness of financial disincentives in ensuring regulatory compliance," Trai said in the draft regulations on ASR.

According to telecom operators, ASR-based filings are administrative compliance requirements that do not directly impact the customers, the market behaviour or service quality and there is no loss to the government as well. In fact, the regulator should discontinue the requirement for submission of ASR, and rely on audited financial statements and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) certificates for analytical and statistical assessments.

“Even in the case of compliances related to license fees/spectrum usage charges, non-compliance does not lead to any penalty (post 2021 Cabinet reforms), let alone turnover-based penalty," Bharti Airtel said in its submission to Trai dated 7 November. The operator argued that Trai should first issue advisories and warnings before considering any financial disincentive, and said penalties should not be linked to turnover.

Under ASR, telecom operators must annually submit segment‑wise accounting statements to Trai — breaking down costs, revenues, capital employed, and other relevant financial data by service type (such as wireless access, internet, long‑distance, etc.), and by geographical area/licensed service area — so that the regulator can monitor the financial performance of each service separately and make informed decisions on regulations, and policies.

The regulator said the proposal is also to implement financial disincentive in a graded manner in the case of ASR defaults, which would align with gravity of violation, prescribing a maximum ceiling, and imposing interest on default in payment of financial disincentive.

Under the existing regulations, the penalty is up to ₹10,00,000, without any graded penalty structure.

Reliance Jio called Trai’s proposal for a financial disincentive up to 1% of annual turnover as ultra vires the Trai Act and “unsustainable" in law. “The proposed 1% of turnover disincentive would therefore be punitive, unjustified, and open to challenge as a manifestly arbitrary exercise of power under Article 14 of the Constitution," Jio told Trai in its submission on 7 November. The operator said the draft amendment lacks transparency, as it does not explain why the changes are necessary or how increasing financial disincentives will improve compliance. No data has been provided on the number of past violations or actions taken by Trai, nor any rationale showing how the proposed increase in penalties would lead to better adherence to the rules, it said.

“Linking the financial disincentives with turnover is not the right way for such errors. Further, this is very subjective as to who will decide that there are errors in reporting," said Satya N. Gupta, former principal adviser at Trai.

As part of the amendment to the ASR regulations, if a telecom operator fails to submit reports or provides false reports, the penalty proposed is ₹25,000 for each day of delay for the first seven days. If the default continues beyond seven days, the operators would be liable to pay an additional amount of ₹40,000 for each subsequent day of delay subject to a maximum of ₹1,000,000. For continued violation in the consecutive years, the daily penalty proposed is ₹50,000-75,000, capped at ₹25,00,000. The maximum amount of penalty is linked to turnover.

Similarly, if the service providers don’t report their new plans or prices on time, the regulator has proposed steeper penalties — starting at ₹10,000 a day for the first week of delay, and doubling to ₹20,000 a day after that, up to a maximum of ₹500,000.

Operators argued the regulator should retain or rationalise the current ceiling and rates of financial disincentive to ensure proportionality. The regulator needs to treat first-time or inadvertent delays for first seven days as minor procedural lapses leading to warning letters without financial disincentive, the COAI said.
