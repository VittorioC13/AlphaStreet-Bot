[TITLE]Jim Cramer Says Food Stocks Like Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) Could Benefit From A Merger:
[TEXT]
We recently published 13 Stocks That Jim Cramer Discussed. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.

Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) might have been able to withstand the losses that the broader food sector had faced had it not been for a disastrous 13% share price drop in August. The shares fell after the firm’s third quarter earnings report, which saw its third quarter adjusted EPS and midpoint fourth quarter EPS guide of $0.35 and $0.39 miss analyst estimates of $0.41 and $0.49. After the earnings report, Cramer explained that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was suffering as the disruption in the US beef industry had stripped the firm of its pricing power. This time, he discussed the firm in the context of the broader woes of the food sector as he wondered whether a merger might be a way out for Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) and help it to lower costs:

“But the answer is, you take out costs, but I think you have to begin the great merger of this sector. You have to begin the great merger of this sector. You have to start putting together big deals, take out big costs. . . .They have to just become, this should be like a big three. It’s over. You can’t grow. . .and maybe under this administration you could put together a Hormel, Pepsi, I don’t know what.”

While we acknowledge the potential of HRL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

[TITLE]SECURITIES CLASS ACTION NOTICE: Girard Sharp Law Firm Encourages Current and Former 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) Shareholders Who Received Neogen Corporation (NASDAQ:NEOG) Shares in Connection With Neogen Co:
[TEXT]
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Girard Sharp LLP, a national investment, securities, and consumer class action law firm, has filed a securities class action against Neogen Corporation (“Neogen”). According to the complaint, the class includes “all current and former 3M shareholders who received NEOG common stock in exchange for Garden SpinCo shares pursuant to the Merger Exchange (the “Class”)”.

Neogen is a Michigan corporation that, with its subsidiaries, “manufacture and market a diverse line of products and services dedicated to food and animal safety.” The Company’s Food Safety segment consists primarily of “diagnostic test products and complementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns.” The Company’s Animal Safety segment is engaged in the “development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, diagnostic products, rodenticides, cleaners, disinfectants, insecticides and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal safety market.”

The offering materials for the Merger (“Offering Materials”) stated that the combined Company expected to “have improved EBITDA margins and stronger free cash flow relative to Neogen on a standalone basis, allowing Neogen to deleverage following the [Merger]” and “generate run-rate revenue and cost synergies of $30 million within three years following the closing of the [Merger] due to efficiencies in product innovation, sales, marketing, distribution and production.”

On January 10, 2025, Neogen announced its preliminary 2Q25 financial results and reported a net loss of $456.3 million due to a non-cash goodwill impairment related to the 3M Food Safety Division acquisition. Moreover, Neogen reported that, as of November 30, 2024, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. On April 9, 2025, Neogen announced its 3Q25 financial results, reporting a net loss of $11 million and a drop in revenue of 3.4% to $221 million. The Company also reported that its capital expenditures were expected to be approximately $100 million as a result of “lowered Adjusted EBITDA” and a “pull-forward of integration capex into fiscal 2025.” It also reported the Company’s CEO, John Adent, would be stepping down.

Since September 1, 2022, the date upon which Neogen issued shares to former or current 3M investors, Neogen’s share price has declined by 75%. Girard Sharp’s investigation focuses on whether the Offering Materials may have included misrepresentations and omissions regarding Neogen’s and 3M’s financial conditions and the Merger.
