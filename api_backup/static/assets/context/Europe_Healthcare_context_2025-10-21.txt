Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday informed that India has developed its first indigenously discovered antibiotic " Nafithromycin ", which is effective against resistant respiratory infections , particularly useful for cancer patients and poorly controlled diabetics.He said this antibiotic is the first molecule entirely conceptualised, developed and clinically validated in India, representing a significant leap toward self-reliance in the pharmaceutical sector.According to an official release from the Ministry of Science and Technology , the antibiotic Naphithromycin has been developed by the Government of India's Department of Biotechnology in collaboration with the well-known private pharma house Wockhardt Citing this as an example of a successful industry-academia partnership driving India's biopharmaceutical growth , the Union Minister emphasised the need to build a self-sustainable innovation ecosystem, so that India could reduce its dependence on government funding and create a culture of private sector participation and philanthropic support to achieve global recognition in research and innovation.Inaugurating the 3-day Medical Workshop on "Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Omics Data Integration and Analysis", Jitendra Singh said that India must develop a self-sustainable ecosystem to drive its scientific and research growth. He stated that most nations that have achieved global recognition in science and innovation have done so through self-sustaining, innovation-driven models with extensive engagement of the private sector.Citing another successful story of government-non-government collaboration, the Minister also announced that India has achieved a major breakthrough in gene therapy, marking the first successful indigenous clinical trial for Haemophilia treatment, the trial for which was supported by the Government of India's Department of Biotechnology and done in a non-government sector hospital, Christian Medical College, Vellore.Singh further mentioned that India has already sequenced over 10,000 human genomes and aims to scale this up to one million. The gene therapy trial, he added, recorded a 60-70% correction rate with zero bleeding episodes, representing a milestone in India's medical research landscape. The findings have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, underscoring India's growing leadership in advanced biomedical innovation.Speaking at the occasion, Jitendra Singh said the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is a major step in this direction, with a total outlay of Rs 50,000 crore over five years, of which Rs 36,000 crore will come from non-government sources. This model, he added, reflects a paradigm shift in India's approach to research and development, aligning it with global standards and emphasising greater participation of academia and industry.Jitendra Singh highlighted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most transformative tools of the modern era, reshaping healthcare accessibility, governance efficiency, and decision-making. He mentioned that AI-based hybrid mobile clinics are already serving rural and remote regions, ensuring quality healthcare for all. He also referred to the AI-driven grievance redressal system developed by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), which has achieved a weekly disposal rate of 97-98%, significantly improving citizen satisfaction and service delivery.The Minister lauded institutions like Sir Ganga Ram Hospital for pioneering interdisciplinary approaches by integrating AI, biotechnology and genomics to improve healthcare outcomes. He urged greater collaboration between government departments, private hospitals, and research institutes to realise the vision of Viksit Bharat @2047.Jitendra Singh said that India is entering a new era of self-reliance in biotechnology, AI and genomic medicine. The convergence of innovation, collaboration and compassion, he said, will define India's journey toward a developed nation and establish its leadership in the global science and technology landscape.The event was also attended by Shiv Kumar Kalyanaraman, CEO of Anusandhan National Research Foundation, NK Ganguly, DS Rana, and Ajay Swaroop.

[TITLE]Natural Killer Cell Therapies Lead $254B Immunotherapy Market Transformation:
[TEXT]
Equity Insider News Commentary

Issued on behalf of GT Biopharma, Inc.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity InsiderNews Commentary – MIT and Harvard scientists recently created engineered CAR-NK cells that hide from the immune system and more effectively destroy cancer, opening doors to off-the-shelf treatments doctors can administer immediately after diagnosis instead of waiting weeks for personalized cell production[1]. Eight new oncology approvals between July and September 2025 demonstrate how cellular immunotherapy platforms are solving manufacturing challenges while expanding from blood cancers into solid tumors, with researchers discovering ways to reprogram immune cells to fight cancer for days without fatiguing[2]. This convergence of natural killer cell activation, T-cell engagers, personalized vaccines, and precision delivery systems positions GT Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GTBP), Evaxion A/S (NASDAQ: EVAX), RenovoRX, Inc. (NASDAQ:RNXT), EDAP TMS S.A. (NASDAQ: EDAP), and Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR).

The global cancer immunotherapy market stood at $105.7 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $254.6 billion by 2033, driven by increasing cancer incidence and rapid developments creating better tailored therapies[3]. Biomarker-driven drug development accelerates across oncology as companies advance novel mechanisms targeting previously difficult populations, with recent clinical data demonstrating high response rates in molecularly defined patient subgroups creating favorable conditions for immune-activating therapies offering reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy.

GT Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GTBP) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company headquartered in San Francisco that's focused on harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer. The firm is currently advancing innovative immunotherapy treatments designed to combat some of the most challenging cancer types, with recent progress showing promise in its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of GTB-3650. The company has successfully enrolled both patients in the trial's third dosing group (Cohort 3), with neither patient experiencing concerning side effects or dose-limiting toxicities thus far. GT Biopharma expects to commence treatment for Cohort 4 patients before the end of 2025, with further data releases planned for early 2026.

The Phase 1 study is testing GTB-3650 in patients battling relapsed or refractory blood cancers that express the CD33 protein, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These represent some of the most difficult cancer cases to treat, involving patients whose disease either came back after initial therapy or never responded to conventional treatment options.

GTB-3650 works by stimulating the patient's natural killer cells, a type of immune cell that naturally hunts down and destroys abnormal cells, to specifically target cancer cells. Patients receive the therapy through continuous infusions following a structured schedule: two weeks of treatment followed by two weeks of rest, repeating this cycle for up to four months based on how they respond.

After thorough safety assessments, the company successfully advanced into Cohort 3 following formal reviews of the initial two patient cohorts that found no safety or tolerability issues. The early results are particularly encouraging based on biomarker data, objective biological measurements that indicate whether the drug is working as designed. Blood analysis from the first four patients revealed measurable increases in both natural killer cell activity and proliferation.

The initial patient in Cohort 3 has shown encouraging signs of immune activation at levels comparable to those seen in patients from the earlier, lower-dose cohorts. This biological response suggests GTB-3650 is functioning precisely as intended: activating the immune system and directing it to attack cancer cells.

The Phase 1 design calls for testing GTB-3650 in approximately 14 patients across seven cohorts, with two patients per cohort receiving progressively higher doses from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 up to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7. The trial will continue escalating doses into higher ranges expected to translate immune activation into meaningful clinical benefits.

"We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule," said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO of GT Biopharma. "Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650. We look forward to sharing more data later this year to reinforce the ability of our TriKE constructs to activate endogenous NK cells, and the potential for broader utility with other targets to treat solid tumors (GTB-5550) and autoimmune indications (GTB-7550)."

Beyond blood cancers, the company is developing GTB-5550, which targets B7H3, a protein commonly found across various solid tumor types including breast, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancers. GT Biopharma plans to file its regulatory application to begin human trials of GTB-5550 in the fourth quarter of 2025. GTB-5550 is being designed as a subcutaneous injection that patients might eventually self-administer at home.

Both candidates utilize GT Biopharma's proprietary TriKE platform technology, which employs specialized antibody fragments originally found in camels and llamas. These molecules offer advantages over conventional antibodies due to their smaller size and greater stability. The company holds an exclusive worldwide license from the University of Minnesota for this technology.

As of June 30, 2025, GT Biopharmareported approximately $5.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, with management projecting this capital would support operations through the first quarter of 2026.

[TITLE]Sensei Biotherapeutics Reports New Clinical Results Highlighting Durable Progression Free Survival Data for Solnerstotug in PD-(L)1 Resistant Tumors at the ESMO Congress 2025:
[TEXT]
6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 50% in the higher 15 mg/kg dose cohort compares favorably to historical PD-(L)1 refractory settings –

All clinical responses, including a complete response, observed in the higher 15 mg/kg dose cohort –

Favorable safety profile with six cases of mild, manageable grade 1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) across all patients treated to date, all of which occurred in the 15 mg/kg dose cohort –

Data support advancement to Phase 2 studies, currently being planned in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Merkel Cell Carcinoma –

Sensei to host investor webcast Monday, October 20th at 8:00 AM ET –

BOSTON, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sensei Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNSE), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of next-generation therapeutics for cancer patients, today announced results from the dose expansion portion of its Phase 1/2 trial evaluating solnerstotug (formerly SNS-101), a conditionally active monoclonal antibody targeting VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation). The data will be shared today during a mini oral session at the ESMO Congress 2025.

The Phase 1 dose expansion is a multi-center, open-label study evaluating solnerstotug as monotherapy and in combination with Libtayo® (cemiplimab), Regeneron’s PD-1 inhibitor. The study enrolled patients with a basket of “hot” tumor types (that typically respond to immunotherapy) (n=44), of whom 41 had previously received and progressed on PD-(L)1 therapy, as well as patients with “cold” tumor types (that typically exhibit primary resistance to immunotherapy) (n=20).

Patients who progress following treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitors (“secondary resistance”) face a particularly poor prognosis, as resistance to immune checkpoint blockade is a significant challenge in oncology. For patients who develop secondary resistance, the likelihood of benefiting from a rechallenge with the same therapy is estimated to be 5% or less.1

Currently, treatment options for PD-(L)1 resistant tumors are limited, with many patients receiving chemotherapy, experimental therapies in clinical trials, or palliative care in the absence of effective alternatives. While historical benchmarks in this setting are limited, docetaxel, which is widely used in the 2nd line post-PD-(L)1 setting for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), typically has a 6-month PFS of 10-20% in similar patient populations.2 To date, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combination therapies have not been approved in this setting.

Emerging Clinical Signal and Favorable Tolerability Profile

As of the September 8, 2025, data cutoff, 35 efficacy-evaluable “hot tumor” patients had received cemiplimab with either 15 mg/kg (n=19) or 3 mg/kg dose (n=16) of solnerstotug. Six clinical responses, including five in patients with PD-(L)1 resistant tumors, occurred at the higher 15 mg/kg solnerstotug dose, and no objective responses were observed at the 3 mg/kg dose.

Among 41 “hot tumor” patients that received and progressed on a prior PD-(L)1 therapy, the overall 6-month PFS rate was 37%, which compares favorably with historical benchmarks in this setting. At 15 mg/kg, 6-month PFS reached 50% among PD-(L)1 resistant patients, surpassing rates historically seen in this treatment-refractory population. At 3 mg/kg, 6-month PFS was 24% among PD-(L)1 resistant patients.

Solnerstotug was well tolerated at both 3 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg doses in combination with cemiplimab:

Only six mild (Grade 1) CRS events were observed across all patients in Phase 1 (n=98), all manageable.

No new safety signals were identified across dose expansion (n=64).

The safety profile remains consistent with prior data and compares favorably to other checkpoint inhibitor combinations in this population.

“We believe solnerstotug’s emerging dose-dependent activity in refractory ‘hot’ tumors, combined with a favorable tolerability profile, support its advancement into Phase 2 studies,” said Ron Weitzman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Sensei Biotherapeutics. “The data suggest that selective blockade of VISTA within the tumor microenvironment may help re-engage exhausted T cells, even after PD-1 failure, a goal long considered out of reach.”

In addition to the “hot” tumor cohorts, 20 patients with Microsatellite Stable Colorectal (MSS CRC) “cold” tumors were treated with either solnerstotug as monotherapy or in combination with cemiplimab (350 mg). No responses were observed and the safety profile was consistent with previously reported data.

Durable Disease Control in “Hot” Tumors Followed by Late Onset Responses

Four out of six responders demonstrated prolonged disease control, followed by a late onset response (occurring between 18 and 54 weeks). PD-(L)1 therapies typically have a time to response of 2–3 months, indicating that the combination of solnerstotug plus cemiplimab has a unique and differentiated pattern of activity.

At the 15 mg/kg dose of solnerstotug, notable responses included:

A Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) patient with a durable complete response at week 18 and a duration of response of 54+ weeks

A Microsatellite Instability-High Colorectal Cancer (MSI-H CRC) patient with a partial response (PR) at week 36 and a 33+ week duration

An NSCLC patient with a tumor proportion score less than 5% that was PD-1 naïve had a PR at week 54 and duration of response of 15+ weeks

An Esophageal Cancer patient with a PR at Week 24 and a duration of response of 6 weeks

“This pattern of delayed, durable responses is unusual among immunotherapies,” said Kyriakos Papadopoulos, M.D., Co-Director of Clinical Research at START, San Antonio. “It may indicate that solnerstotug acts through a mechanism that is complementary to PD-(L)1 in resistant tumors.”

Next Steps: Planned Phase 2 Studies to Evaluate Efficacy in a Commercially Attractive Indication and Potentially Pursue Accelerated Approval in a PD-1 Resistant Population

Sensei is planning two Phase 2 studies to begin in 2026, subject to FDA feedback and the Company’s ability to raise sufficient capital. The first is expected to be a randomized trial in 2nd line NSCLC where patients have received and failed anti-PD-(L)1 treatment. Patients would be randomized to receive either the combination of solnerstotug + a PD-(L)1 inhibitor or chemotherapy.

The second trial is expected to be a single arm study in PD-(L)1 resistant MCC patients where there is limited therapeutic optionality and potential for accelerated approval, subject to FDA feedback.

“We’re pleased by the emerging signs of dose-related activity, durability, and a favorable safety profile—key characteristics of a potentially differentiated immunotherapy,” said John Celebi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sensei Biotherapeutics. “These results provide a foundation for our planned Phase 2 development program as we work to better define solnerstotug’s role in treating challenging patient populations.”
