EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025.

Financial Summary:

Three Months Ended

October 31, $ in millions 2025 2024 % Increase Revenues $ 47.3 $ 31.5 50.0 % Gross Profit $ 11.1 $ 7.1 56.6 % Operating Expenses $ 10.3 $ 6.6 57.5 % Net Income $ 0.5 $ 0.4 31.7 % Earnings per Share (Diluted) $ 0.01 $ 0.01 24.1 % Adj. EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 3.8 $ 1.7 118.0 %

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 & Subsequent Operational Highlights:

Acquired the business of Crown I Enterprises (“Crown 1”), a full-service manufacturer of value-added proteins and ready-to-heat meals, from Sysco Corporation for $17.5 million. All-cash, accretive acquisition fully funded through a $20.0 million private placement, further supported by an amended $27.4 million long-term credit facility with M&T Bank. Adds $56.8 million in revenue (12 months ended June 28, 2025) with a recently upgraded and expanded 42k sq. ft. USDA facility ~10 miles from the Company’s existing Farmingdale, NY facility. Brings premium, incremental customers where the Company did not yet maintain a presence as well as meaningful cross-selling potential. Significant new operational capabilities, including incremental grill capacity and MAP technology, and potential manufacturing cost synergies.

Secured new tier-one national placements at Target and Food Lion. At Target, two branded sleeved items are to begin shipping in February with a staged rollout to 1,995 stores and additional items in the final set up stages for later distribution, with Food Lion shipments to 1,100 stores starting later this month.

The Company’s first ever National Costco Multi-Vendor Mailer (MVM) with branded Beef Meatballs is underway, driving a meaningful potential increase in sales and brand awareness.

Invited to attend leading investor conferences nationally, including the Lake Street 2025 BIG9 Conference, 16th Annual Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference, Stephens NASH25 Conference, and 14th Annual ROTH Deer Valley Event.

Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025 totaled $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025. The change in cash and cash equivalents was driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of Crown 1.

Management Commentary

Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “Our third quarter demonstrated meaningful momentum in scaling the business. With the integration of the business of Crown 1 underway, we delivered broad-based growth across our protein portfolio, deployed high-return trade and marketing investments, leveraging newly added retail doors and cross-selling. We also implemented targeted price increases across both our beef and chicken portfolios to help offset commodity headwinds, while improvements in chicken operations enhanced throughput and lowered overtime, helping us meet our margin objectives.

“With the acquisition of Crown 1’s assets, we began a straightforward integration supported by proximity and shared grill platforms. Crown’s initially lower gross margins weighed on the quarter, but we are executing a clear plan to lift the acquired Bay Shore facility’s margin performance through procurement scale, throughput and overhead efficiencies, shared services, and best-practice sharing – which we expect to lift consolidated corporate gross margins from the low-20% range to the mid-20% range over the next year.

“We continue to see strong sales momentum across the portfolio, with Crown opening access to hard-to-penetrate customers and creating new cross-sell channels using its premium product offerings, while expanding SKU penetration across its base remains a core priority. This traction is reinforced by new tier-one wins at Target and Food Lion; at Target, we expect first shipments to begin in February, while our products should hit Food Lion’s shelves this month. This, paired with our ongoing National Costco collaboration, positions us for significant growth in the coming quarters.

“As we look ahead, our strategic path toward becoming a $1 billion deli prepared foods company is becoming even clearer. We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and maintain strict discipline around capital allocation, prioritizing integration ahead of a new acquisition. With expanded capacity, access to premium retail accounts and ongoing grandma-quality innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and improved margins in the quarters to come,” concluded Michaels.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50.0% to $47.3 million, as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to both the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as robust double-digit growth in the core business on a pre-acquisition basis.

Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to operational efficiency improvements across the organization and stabilized chicken commodity prices, partially offset by higher beef commodity prices as well as the addition of lower-margin Crown 1 sales, which the Company expects to bring in-line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year.

Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as $1.0 million in non-recurring professional fees and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses remained below 20% of revenue.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118.0% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter.

Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025, primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of the Crown 1 business. As of October 31, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $6.3 million as of October 31, 2024.

[TITLE]Suzy Amis Cameron’s Inside Out Grows With Research-led Design and Strategic Acquisitions:
[TEXT]
PARIS — If you’ve followed Suzy Amis Cameron’s work as an early pioneer in sustainable fashion, you know her journey began with Red Carpet Green Dress, the campaign that put eco-conscious design on the map, proving that elegance and ethics could coexist.

But RCGD had limits — it gained attention, but it couldn’t scale the systemic change Amis Cameron wanted.

“Certainly, Red Carpet Green Dress started a big conversation, but it wasn’t making huge impact. I was at this place in my life where I was like, something has to be done, and if there’s a way for me to do that, I will,” she told WWD.

That’s why she closed that chapter in March 2024 and founded the international holding company Inside Out.

“The idea was to build a holding company that reimagines how business interacts with both people and the planet,” Amis Cameron said of the privately backed venture. Inside Out approaches fashion from a biological and psychological perspective, to create what she calls “healthy clothes.”

“Not only are we solution-oriented, we actually have solutions,” she said. “And they are lucrative.”

[TITLE]Star Group, L.P. Reports Fiscal 2025 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Results:
[TEXT]
STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Star Group, L.P. (the "Company" or "Star") (NYSE:SGU), a home energy distributor and services provider, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2025 full year and fourth quarter, the three months ended September 30, 2025.

Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2024

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, Star reported a modest rise (approximately 1.0 percent) in total revenue to $1.8 billion, reflecting higher volumes sold and higher sales of installations and services, offsetting a decline in selling prices in response to lower wholesale product costs. The volume of home heating oil and propane sold during fiscal 2025 increased by 29.2 million gallons, or 11.5 percent, to 282.6 million gallons, reflecting the additional volume provided from acquisitions and colder temperatures, more than offsetting net customer attrition and other factors. Temperatures in Star’s geographic areas of operation were 8.2 percent colder than during the prior-year period but 8.3 percent warmer than normal, as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Star’s net income increased by $38.3 million for fiscal 2025, to $73.5 million, primarily due to a $32.4 million favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments, $24.8 million of higher Adjusted EBITDA, and a gain of $3.8 million from the sale of real estate, partially offset by a $16.1 million increase in income tax expense, $3.9 million higher depreciation and amortization expenses (D&A), and a $2.7 million increase in interest expense. D&A and net interest expense rose largely due to acquisitions.

For fiscal 2025, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $24.8 million, or 22.2 percent, to $136.4 million compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to an $18.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the base business and a $16.9 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA from recent acquisitions, partially offset by a $10.6 million increase in expense related to the Company's weather hedge contracts. The higher Adjusted EBITDA in the base business was driven by an increase in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins, higher home heating oil and propane volume sold (due to colder weather), and an improvement in service and installation profitability. Regarding its weather hedge, as previously reported, the temperatures experienced during the hedge period ending March 31, 2025 were colder than the strike prices and, therefore, the Company recorded an expense under those weather hedge contracts of $3.1 million. This compares to the prior-year period during which, due to warmer weather, the Company recorded a credit of $7.5 million under its weather hedge contract.

“As we close out fiscal 2025, it’s time to reflect on our recent accomplishments and near-term outlook,” said Jeff Woosnam, Star Group’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We completed a sizable acquisition earlier this year, have kept overhead expenses largely in check, and maintained disciplined margin management. We also continue to invest in complementary installation and service offerings – which posted revenue growth of nearly 10 percent over fiscal 2024. The resulting bottom line impact of these efforts, coupled with colder temperatures, fueled a year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $24.8 million, or 22.2 percent. We are steadfast in our mission to grow and diversify the Company by continuing to make both heating oil and propane acquisitions, keeping net attrition as low as possible, and maximizing installation and service profitability over time. We look forward to taking advantage of further opportunities to improve the organization, and its performance, in fiscal 2026.”

Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024

For the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, Star reported a 3.1 percent increase in total revenue to $247.7 million compared with $240.3 million in the prior-year period, largely reflecting higher sales of installations and services. The volume of home heating oil and propane sold during the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter rose by 1.5 million gallons, or 8.1 percent, to 20.0 million gallons, as the additional volume provided from acquisitions and other factors more than offset the impact from net customer attrition.

Star’s net loss declined by $6.4 million in the quarter, to $28.7 million, largely reflecting a favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $12.2 million and a gain of $3.8 million from the sale of real estate, partially offset by a $3.6 million lower income tax benefit, a $3.3 million greater Adjusted EBITDA loss, a $1.4 million increase in net interest expense and $1.2 million higher depreciation and amortization expenses (“D&A”). As previously noted, D&A and net interest expense rose largely due to acquisitions.

The Company reported a fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss (a non-GAAP measure defined below) of $33.0 million, versus an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $29.7 million in fiscal 2024, due to slightly higher operating expenses and lower home heating oil and propane per-gallon margins in the base business and an Adjusted EBITDA loss from recent acquisitions – as is typical during a non-heating season.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measures)

EBITDA (Earnings from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, (increase) decrease in the fair value of derivatives, other income (loss), net, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge, gain or loss on debt redemption, goodwill impairment, and other non-cash and non-operating charges) are non-GAAP financial measures that are used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users of the Company’s financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess Star’s position with regard to the following:

compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements;

financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis;

operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other companies in the retail distribution of refined petroleum products, without regard to financing methods and capital structure;

ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners; and

the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities.

The method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA both have limitations as analytical tools and so should not be viewed in isolation but in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows:

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash used for capital expenditures;

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized often will have to be replaced and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements for such replacements;

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash necessary to make payments of interest or principal on indebtedness; and

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to pay taxes.

REMINDER:

Members of Star's management team will host a webcast and conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time tomorrow, December 9, 2025. The webcast will be accessible on the company’s website, at www.stargrouplp.com, and the telephone number for the conference call is 888-346-3470 (or 412-317-5169 for international callers).

[TITLE]Optimism Prevails Among Brands and Buyers at FFANY and FSNYE During Footwear Market Week:
[TEXT]
The overall mood was upbeat at FFANY and FSNYE this week.

For the first time this year, U.S. President Donald J. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs were not a major part of the conversation. With the framework for many agreements in place, trade concerns were relegated to the rearview mirror.

That change allowed all attendees and brands to focus primarily on their fall/winter 2026 collections as well as some spring fill-in product for warmer climates and intermediate deliveries.

Providing a boost to the optimism that prevailed this week were strong consumer buying patterns for footwear over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in the U.S. that included the BlackFriday/Cyber Monday shopping events.

From the new styles on view, it was evident that brands were knee-deep in their focus on bringing the right balance between creativity and value to their lines to excite both buyers and consumers alike.

While FFANY was held across multiple venues and showrooms across Manhattan, the main pop-up was at 1370 Avenue of the Americas in New York City.

“We experienced a record level of activity this market week, marking the busiest FFANY we have seen in many years,” said Sandi Mines, FFANY president and vice president of corporate engagement at the Footwear Distributors and Retailers Association.

This time around, the show also included some fresh names.

“The FFANY Pop Up welcomed a significant influx of new and prominent brands, including Stoke, Ecco, Greats, Camper and Oliver Cabell,” Mines said. “Buyer sentiment was upbeat, driven by product lines that felt significantly more exciting than in previous years. This excitement was centered on innovation, featuring more dynamic materials, new heights, fresh colors, and overall greater design creativity.”

Over at Footwear Show New York Expo (FSNYE) at the Park Lane New York, president and chief executive officer Phyllis Rein was also bullish. “We delivered a strong, high-energy show with a great vibe throughout the week,” Rein told FN. “Retailer attendance was outstanding.”

She noted that retailers like Belk, Bloomingdale’s, Anthropologie, Von Maur, Nordstrom, Shoe Carnival, Shopbop, Ross, TJX, Urban Outfitters, and many more all stopped by over the span of the week.

Rein added that the footwear industry is heading into 2026 with “real optimism as momentum builds around innovation, e-commerce growth, and consumers who care deeply

Delivered Net Sales of $1.472 Billion, a 9% Increase Versus Prior Year, Exceeding Expectations

Operating Results and Earnings Exceed Expectations

REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Victoria’s Secret & Co. (“VS&Co” or the “Company”) (NYSE: VSCO) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended November 1, 2025.

Hillary Super, VS&Co Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a standout third quarter, with outperformance on net sales and earnings per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Net sales increased 9% over last year, driven by strength across Victoria’s Secret, PINK and Beauty, and supported by momentum across channels and geographies.

As we continue to advance our Path to Potential strategy, we are accelerating global growth, elevating brand distinctiveness, and unlocking greater value across our ecosystem to drive long-term profitable growth.”

Scott Sekella, VS&Co Chief Financial and Operating Officer, said, “Building on strong first-half results, our third quarter exceeded expectations. We delivered robust adjusted gross margin expansion of 170 basis points, driven by a reduced promotional approach and higher regular-priced selling, while leveraging the strength of our business model. We remain focused on managing costs while prioritizing investments in product innovation, brand strength, and customer experience. These efforts, along with the solid operational foundation we have built enables us to scale effectively and support the Company’s growth, giving us confidence in delivering a strong finish to the year and positioning VS&Co for long-term success.”

[TITLE]Meet the branding agency behind the buzzy TBPN podcast:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

How can a new media company make a big splash in the tech world?

One answer: call Day Job, a Los Angeles-headquartered creative agency.

That's what the hosts of the "Technology Business Programming Network" — better known as TBPN — did when they wanted help nailing the podcast's branding and style.

Day Job cofounder Rion Harmon described the vision: a "cacophony of logos" slapped all over the screen (a nod to Formula 1 racecars), a "country club" forest green, and a VHS visual effect.

It'd be somewhere between a news station and a sports-casting channel — hence the rebranding from the "Technology Brothers Podcast" to TBPN.

"They're doing something new," Harmon told me. "It doesn't feel like a stuffy, sort of normal sort of journalism thing. It feels more alive. It feels vibrant. We were trying to capture their energy, right? It's funny to just be overly sponsored."

TBPN has had a big year. The podcast, which launched in 2024, has become a new center stage for a rotation of headline-making Big Tech guests like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Palantir's Alex Karp, and Anduril's Palmer Luckey. Both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal profiled the hosts, John Coogan and Jordi Hays, reporting that the media company expects $5 million in revenue this year.

That, in turn, has helped make Day Job a hot commodity in the tech world, as startups and VCs seek to stand out with their branding. The growing attention from Silicon Valley is paying off. Harmon said that this year, Day Job has doubled its revenue and head count.

"With Day Job, what separates them is they will make four or five different brand directions that are all viable and all justifiable in different ways," Hays said.

[TITLE]Stock market today: Dow slips as JPMorgan slides, S&P 500, Nasdaq little changed with all eyes on Fed decision:
[TEXT]
US stocks were mixed on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting kicked off and federal data showed job openings unexpectedly ticked higher even as layoffs jumped.

The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed just below the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which initially led stocks down, turned around to gain around 0.1%.

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.4%, dragged down by shares of JPMorgan (JPM). The stock fell over 4% after an executive warned that the bank's costs would rise in 2026 amid competition in the credit card space and higher spending on AI.

The small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT), meanwhile, closed at an all-time high ahead of Wednesday's Fed rate decision.

Long-delayed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed job openings ticked up in October, in a move that ran contrary to forecasts. But labor market worries persist — even in the JOLTS report, which also found layoffs increased in the month.

The spotlight is on the Fed's two-day meeting and its final policy decision of the year, due Wednesday. Markets are all but convinced of getting a quarter-point rate cut to match similar moves in September and October, with nearly 90% odds currently priced in.

Given that, investors have switched to watching the Fed for clues to whether 2026 will bring more easing — but the chances of that are less certain in the wake of December's "hawkish cut." White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, largely seen as the favorite for the next Fed chair, has struck a cautious tone, saying it would be "irresponsible" to set out plans for the next six months.

[TITLE]Trump announces $12B aid package to U.S. farmers hit hard by China trade war:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package on Monday — a boost to farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war.

He unveiled the plan Monday afternoon at a White House roundtable with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers from farm states, and farmers who thanked him for the help.

“With this bridge payment, we’ll be able to farm another year,” Iowa farmer Cordt Holub told Trump during the event.

Rollins put the immediate value of the program at $11 billion — money that the White House said will offer one-time payments to row-crop farmers.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package on Monday — a boost to farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war.

He unveiled the plan Monday afternoon at a White House roundtable with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers and farmers who raise cattle and grow corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, rice, wheat, and potatoes.

“$12 billion is a lot of money,” Trump said, adding that the additional aid will help provide certainty for farmers. The money is coming from tariff revenue, he said.

Rollins said that $11 billion is being announced on Monday, while another $1 billion is being held back for specialty crops as the administration works to better understand the circumstances for those farmers. The aid will move by the end of next February, Rollins said.

“We looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,” Trump said in explaining how the administration came up with the size of the package. “We figured out a very exact number, and it was

[TITLE]Mama’s Creations Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
Revenues Grow 50% YoY to $47.3 Million, Driven by Double-Digit Organic Sales Momentum and Integration of Crown 1 Asset Acquisition

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025.

Financial Summary:

Three Months Ended

October 31, $ in millions 2025 2024 % Increase Revenues $ 47.3 $ 31.5 50.0 % Gross Profit $ 11.1 $ 7.1 56.6 % Operating Expenses $ 10.3 $ 6.6 57.5 % Net Income $ 0.5 $ 0.4 31.7 % Earnings per Share (Diluted) $ 0.01 $ 0.01 24.1 % Adj. EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 3.8 $ 1.7 118.0 %

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 & Subsequent Operational Highlights:

Acquired the business of Crown I Enterprises (“Crown 1”), a full-service manufacturer of value-added proteins and ready-to-heat meals, from Sysco Corporation for $17.5 million. All-cash, accretive acquisition fully funded through a $20.0 million private placement, further supported by an amended $27.4 million long-term credit facility with M&T Bank. Adds $56.8 million in revenue (12 months ended June 28, 2025) with a recently upgraded and expanded 42k sq. ft. USDA facility ~10 miles from the Company’s existing Farmingdale, NY facility. Brings premium, incremental customers where the Company did not yet maintain a presence as well as meaningful cross-selling potential. Significant new operational capabilities, including incremental grill capacity and MAP technology, and potential manufacturing cost synergies.

Secured new tier-one national placements at Target and Food Lion. At Target, two branded sleeved items are to begin shipping in February with a staged rollout to 1,995 stores and additional items in the final set up stages for later distribution, with Food Lion shipments to 1,100 stores starting later this month.

The Company’s first ever National Costco Multi-Vendor Mailer (MVM) with branded Beef Meatballs is underway, driving a meaningful potential increase in sales and brand awareness.

Invited to attend leading investor conferences nationally, including the Lake Street 2025 BIG9 Conference, 16th Annual Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference, Stephens NASH25 Conference, and 14th Annual ROTH Deer Valley Event.

Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025 totaled $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025. The change in cash and cash equivalents was driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of Crown 1.

Management Commentary

Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “Our third quarter demonstrated meaningful momentum in scaling the business. With the integration of the business of Crown 1 underway, we delivered broad-based growth across our protein portfolio, deployed high-return trade and marketing investments, leveraging newly added retail doors and cross-selling. We also implemented targeted price increases across both our beef and chicken portfolios to help offset commodity headwinds, while improvements in chicken operations enhanced throughput and lowered overtime, helping us meet our margin objectives.

“With the acquisition of Crown 1’s assets, we began a straightforward integration supported by proximity and shared grill platforms. Crown’s initially lower gross margins weighed on the quarter, but we are executing a clear plan to lift the acquired Bay Shore facility’s margin performance through procurement scale, throughput and overhead efficiencies, shared services, and best-practice sharing – which we expect to lift consolidated corporate gross margins from the low-20% range to the mid-20% range over the next year.

“We continue to see strong sales momentum across the portfolio, with Crown opening access to hard-to-penetrate customers and creating new cross-sell channels using its premium product offerings, while expanding SKU penetration across its base remains a core priority. This traction is reinforced by new tier-one wins at Target and Food Lion; at Target, we expect first shipments to begin in February, while our products should hit Food Lion’s shelves this month. This, paired with our ongoing National Costco collaboration, positions us for significant growth in the coming quarters.

“As we look ahead, our strategic path toward becoming a $1 billion deli prepared foods company is becoming even clearer. We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and maintain strict discipline around capital allocation, prioritizing integration ahead of a new acquisition. With expanded capacity, access to premium retail accounts and ongoing grandma-quality innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and improved margins in the quarters to come,” concluded Michaels.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50.0% to $47.3 million, as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to both the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as robust double-digit growth in the core business on a pre-acquisition basis.

Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to operational efficiency improvements across the organization and stabilized chicken commodity prices, partially offset by higher beef commodity prices as well as the addition of lower-margin Crown 1 sales, which the Company expects to bring in-line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year.

Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as $1.0 million in non-recurring professional fees and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses remained below 20% of revenue.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118.0% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter.

Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025, primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of the Crown 1 business. As of October 31, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $6.3 million as of October 31, 2024.

[TITLE]Suzy Amis Cameron’s Inside Out Grows With Research-led Design and Strategic Acquisitions:
[TEXT]
PARIS — If you’ve followed Suzy Amis Cameron’s work as an early pioneer in sustainable fashion, you know her journey began with Red Carpet Green Dress, the campaign that put eco-conscious design on the map, proving that elegance and ethics could coexist.

But RCGD had limits — it gained attention, but it couldn’t scale the systemic change Amis Cameron wanted.

“Certainly, Red Carpet Green Dress started a big conversation, but it wasn’t making huge impact. I was at this place in my life where I was like, something has to be done, and if there’s a way for me to do that, I will,” she told WWD.

That’s why she closed that chapter in March 2024 and founded the international holding company Inside Out.

Erik Stangvik, the former The Body Shop executive behind the beauty brand’s U.S. expansion, joined as managing partner, tasked with solidifying the structure of the company.

“The idea was to build a holding company that reimagines how business interacts with both people and the planet,” Amis Cameron said of the privately backed venture. Inside Out approaches fashion from a biological and psychological perspective, to create what she calls “healthy clothes.”

“Not only are we solution-oriented, we actually have solutions,” she said. “And they are lucrative.”

[TITLE]PVH Stock Drops 11.8% as Wall Street Waits for Fundamentals to Improve:
[TEXT]
Updated 4:13 p.m. ET Dec. 4

Wall Street is still waiting for PVH Corp. to take off.

Shares of the company fell 11.8 percent to $77.21 on Thursday, after the company beat its third-quarter earnings estimates, but didn’t raise its outlook for the year, signaling that business will be spread out between the two quarters.

“PVH shares look cheap, but they sure aren’t making it easy for value investors to step in,” said Tom Nikic, an analyst at Needham. “Trends continue to be very volatile.”

The Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent company saw third-quarter revenues increase 2 percent to $2.3 billion, making for a drop of less than 1 percent in constant currencies. PVH expects revenues to be flat to slightly positive for the year, in constant currencies.

Nikic zeroed in on the company’s “negative inflection” in the Europe, Middle East and Africa division, which trended down 2 percent in constant currencies.

“This was expected to be one of the growth drivers of the business following last year’s reset of the market — a gross margin miss didn’t help either,” the analyst said. “We continue to believe that shares are too cheap, particularly since they can probably buy back a high-single-digit percent of the float annually at these levels, if not more.

“Third-quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points, missing guidance by 25 basis points, driven by tariffs (110 basis point negative impact), the impact of bringing licenses in-house (50 basis points) and higher promotional mix, partially due to the … Calvin Klein product shipment delays,” he said.

PVH has been busy taking back licenses for its North American wholesale business from G-III Apparel Group, absorbing some of the businesses and finding other licensees for some categories, including dresses.

In conjunction with that take-back, the company set up a “global product kitchen” for Calvin Klein in New York, a complicated switch that had an uneven start.

Stefan Larsson, chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call Thursday that the “delays from the transitory Calvin global product challenges put extra strain on our European distribution center, impacting shipments for both Calvin and Tommy, which made us lose a few critical weeks of full-price selling.”

But Larsson, who’s been busy remaking the company since stepping into the corner office in 2021, suggested it was growing pains the company was feeling.

“We are on track both from on-time delivery coming into spring ’26 and the margin recapture that we set out to take back. On both fronts, we are on track, which is really good,” he said. “It’s painful now, but we had to do it because in order to build premium products, differentiated product franchises with innovation, we need the global capability to do that. And now we have it for both Calvin and Tommy. And so do all of our best competitors in the premium space also have it. But we had to build that. And now you start to see it.”

But Wall Street is still waiting.

Matthew Boss, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said: “While we see multiyear brand ‘unlock’ underway with the new leadership team focused on driving increased desirability of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands through improved product design and marketing, we see an elongated path to reaching management’s mid-teens operating margin target given a slower top-line recovery with continued macroeconomic challenges globally, in addition to a competitive external promotional backdrop, and foreign exchange pressures.”

This year, PVH expects its adjusted operating margin to come in at about 8.5 percent.

[TITLE]How Our 2025 Predictions Held Up: A Year-End Scorecard:
[TEXT]
A year ago, Bill D’Alessandro and I sat down to record our predictions for 2025. We made calls on everything from Trump’s tariff policy to Google’s search dominance.

Many years, revisiting predictions is a humbling exercise. We’ve had some absolute stinkers in the past—predictions so off-base they’re almost impressive in their wrongness.

How did we fare for 2025? Read on to find out.

—

Prediction #1: Trump = Tariffs + Tax Cuts

My Call: Trump would raise tariffs on China around 10%, and we’d see tax policy like QBI extension and further tax cuts.

What Happened: I got the direction spot-on, but badly underestimated the magnitude. China tariffs debuted at 150% before settling around 30-40% effective rates. My “plausible 10%” call wasn’t even in the ballpark.

My “plausible 10%” call wasn’t even in the ballpark. China tariffs debuted at 150% before settling around 30-40% effective rates.

On the tax front, I nailed it. The Big Beautiful Bill came through with QBI extension and additional business-friendly tax cuts as predicted.

Grade: 8/10. Right on the trends, wrong on the scale.

#2: Google Shows First Real Weakness

My Call: Google would drop below 90% search market share for the first time in 10 years as AI assistants like ChatGPT stole queries.

What Happened: Google did dip under 90% in early 2025—the first time in a decade they’d fallen below that threshold. For a brief moment, it looked like the prediction would play out perfectly.

But Google didn’t roll over. Gemini 3 turned out to be legitimately strong, and they’ve done an impressive job integrating AI into search. The armor cracked, but they patched it fast.

Grade: 6/10. They stumbled, but recovered faster than I expected.

#3: SEO for AI LLMs Emerges

My Call: A new industry would be born around ranking inside ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI models—essentially SEO for large language models.

What Happened: “GEO” (Generative Engine Optimization) is now a real thing. Terrible name, but the discipline exists. Tools have launched, consultants are selling services, people are talking

[TITLE]The Retail Media Rush: What’s in Store for 2026?:
[TEXT]
As 2026 approaches, we examine what could be in store for retail media. As the sector booms, we asked experts from across the ad tech ecosystem what they expect from the year ahead.

As we progress through Q4, it’s the season to impress. Brands are going big on festive campaigns, with advertisers looking to capitalise on consumers’ spending frenzy.

Like always, the recent Black Friday weekend was one of the biggest yearly events in the retail calendar. US consumers spent a total of USD$11.8bn (£8.84bn) on just online purchases. On Cyber Monday a couple of days later, sales globally were said to have hit over USD$17bn (£12.74bn).

For retailers, it’s an ever-golden opportunity.

The retail media landscape has boomed this year, with new retail media networks appearing from every direction. Some of the biggest ones announced this year include American Express’ Amex Ads, and WHSmiths’ WHS Media. This expansion is increasing opportunities for advertisers and facilitating more effective ad campaigns, with improved targeting opportunities, more channels, and better activation.

And as the landscape evolves, new doors continue to open. Gen AI is changing the game: data just released by Adobe found that traffic from the technology to retailers grew by 830% year-over-year in the first part of November, as consumers increasingly turn to chatbots to assist them with their shopping. Not only is traffic higher, but conversion rates are too: the data revealed that shoppers who landed on retail sites via an AI service were 30% more likely to convert than those who had arrived via a traditional search.

Combining this with the agentic AI developments on the horizon, the retail industry is poised for a complete reimagining of the online shopping experience.

Now, what’s in store for retail media next year? We gathered insights from a range of industry experts.

Ability to scale will hinge on harmonisation and standardisation

As retail media accelerates toward the 2026 ‘gold rush’, the industry’s ability to scale will hinge on harmonisation and standardisation. Fragmentation across measurement, formats, and reporting limits efficiency and comparability currently, creating friction for both brands and retailers. By adopting measurement standards and certification developed by IAB Europe, retailers can unlock trust, transparency, and investment at scale.

At the same time, one untapped frontier lies in in-store. By integrating digital precision with the physical shelf, retailers can transform point-of-sale into a dynamic media channel, bridging online and offline journeys, enriching shopper experiences, and driving incremental value.

Programmatic capabilities will also be instrumental to the continued development of retail and commerce media, enabling automation, targeting, and real-time optimisation that elevate on-site retail media from static placements to scalable, data-driven ecosystems. The convergence of standardised practices, programmatic innovation, and in-store activation will define the next era of retail media.

Retailers who own their own models will stand out

We will see creative storytelling and more holistic multichannel campaigns come into retail media. The largest enterprise retailers will be able to connect their advertiser brands through innovative campaigns across onsite, instore and offsite. Brands will love the impact this will provide, as well as what they prove out in terms of ROAS.

Mid-size retailers will tighten up their offering and make it simpler for large brands to buy from their vertical audiences, and smaller brands to get involved in retail media via self service sophistication. These offerings begin to provide the industry standardisation demanded from the buy side.

AI will also evolve through the hype cycle, only the most useful applications will cut through and stay in the ecosystem, providers will have to prove the value it creates. Retailers who own their own models, and can deploy on their own terms into targeting, optimisation and efficiency will stand out.

Neil Cameron, VP, Marketing, Kevel

Third-party insight is what will unlock real competitive advantage

Retail media’s momentum will accelerate in 2026, as more retailers look to monetise their data and close the loop between advertising and sales. First-party data alone has limits, so enriching it with third-party insight is what will unlock real competitive advantage. Combining demographic, behavioural, and market-wide spend signals gives retailers a complete view of shopper journeys, while helping brands target the right audiences across more channels. As commerce becomes increasingly fragmented, those who connect identity across digital and offline touchpoints will create smarter attribution, stronger collaboration with advertisers, and ultimately, better consumer experiences.

Sarah Robertson, Chief Product Officer, Experian Marketing Services

Proving performance

2026 will be the year retail media matures – not because of more inventory, but because of the forces reshaping how performance is proven. AI is the obvious catalyst: agentic systems will increasingly double as advertising surfaces, while the conversational context around them becomes a new monetisable signal. As privacy constraints tighten across mobile platforms, creative (not granular targeting) becomes the real differentiator. We’re only at the beginning of crowd-sourced UGC and short-form, CLIP-style creative fueling algorithms with the contextual cues needed to find the right audiences.

At the same time, incrementality becomes the industry’s pressure point. Everyone is talking

[TITLE]CEO TALKS: Galeries Lafayette’s Nicolas Houzé Talks Big Investment Bets as ‘Boring Retail Is Dead’:
[TEXT]
PARIS — Retail runs in Nicolas Houzé’s blood.

A fifth-generation member of the French family behind Galeries Lafayette, Houzé joined the business in 2006, led the department store as chief executive officer for more than a decade, then followed his father’s footsteps into the role of chair of the group’s executive board last year.

In addition to steering the Galeries Lafayette Group, he chairs France’s strategic committee for fashion and luxury and presides over the union of city-center retailers. On Dec. 1, he was also named president of the International Association of Department Stores, taking the helm as global retail continues to seek recovery.

Last month, Houzé marked a milestone for the group by opening Galeries Lafayette’s first store in India, which is the country’s first stand-alone high-street department store. He has been central to leading the company’s post-pandemic recovery while expanding its international footprint and navigating the shifting trends in fashion, e-commerce and rapidly-changing consumer habits.

In a wide-ranging interview in his office with sweeping views of the Sacré-Cœur, Houzé said the group is doubling down on its department-store model even as much of the industry pulls back, and gaining traction from a growing demand for watches, jewelry and beauty, following the overall rebound at its Paris flagship.

Early acquisitions of multibrand retailers Louis Pion and Royal Quartz, and later the Mauboussin jewelry brand, helped secure the group’s position in the watch and jewelry segment and reinforced relationships with brands such as Rolex — all of which were aimed at strengthening Galeries Lafayette’s core business.

While many were sounding the death knell for brick-and-mortar retail during the pandemic, the group took a counterintuitive bet with a 400 million euro investment to renovate its flagship on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris over four years. The move paid off, with sales returning to 2019 levels by 2024.

A further 400 million euros is now earmarked for upgrades in Paris — including a full overhaul of the stand-alone men’s building to be completed by the end of 2027 — and across its regional network, positioning the family-owned retailer for a new phase of growth.

Galeries Lafayette is still pursuing measured international expansion and strengthening its brand globally. It is reexamining its China strategy, and has an eye on opportunities in the Middle East, including Riyadh.
