[TITLE]Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’:
[TEXT]
Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda.

In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.”

“BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’)

Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration.

Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups.

Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion.

BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story.

Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.”

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital.

Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.”

Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024.

“Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.”

Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.”

“Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar.

“What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said. (RELATED: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office)

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance Greg Brown told the AP that the reason behind these buyouts are “very simple. Because there’s a lot of money to be made.”

Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases.

“There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.”

ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition.

“BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.”

Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.”

Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May.

The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb.

The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.”

Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.

Shares of Bloom Energy soared early Monday after it made a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers. Brookfield will spend up to $5 billion to use Bloom Energy’s technology. This is Brookfield’s first investment in its strategy to support large AI data centers with both power and computing infrastructure.Bloom Energy’s fuel cells are “fuel-flexible” and can run on natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen, according to the company. Brookfield and Bloom will collaborate to design and build “AI factories” around the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year, as stated by CNBC report. Bloom energy stock surgeBloom Energy shares jumped almost 30% in early trading after the announcement. Bloom’s fuel cells provide onsite power and can be installed quickly because they don’t rely on a connection to the electric grid.The company has already installed hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities like American Electric Power and data center developers such as Equinix and Oracle , according to Bloom Energy, as mentioned in the report by CNBC.AI data centers need off-grid powerThe AI industry’s data center plans are growing fast. For example, Nvidia and OpenAI recently announced a partnership to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, which equals the power used by New York City during peak summer.AI companies face a problem: the U.S. electric grid is old and often slow to provide extra power. Building new data centers could also raise electricity prices for homes. Deploying “behind-the-meter” power solutions (off the grid) is essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories, said Sikander Rashid, Brookfield’s global head of AI infrastructure KR Sridhar, Bloom Energy CEO, said, “AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week, “Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that.” Huang added that the AI industry will need off-grid power to quickly meet demand and protect consumers from rising electricity prices.FAQsBecause Bloom Energy made a $5 billion deal with Brookfield to supply fuel cells for AI data centers.They will build “AI factories” using Bloom’s fuel cells to provide fast, off-grid power for AI data centers worldwide.

[TITLE]Power sector opening up for new players: DG AIDA:
[TEXT]
Opening of the power distribution sector to more than one player in an area, if accepted, may take India’s electricity sector to a more competitive region. “You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up for private,” said former Power Secretary Alok Kumar, who is currently the Director General of All India Discoms Association (AIDA). In the draft amendment proposal to the Electricity Act, recently put out by the government for stakeholders’ comments, there is a move to have multiple players operating in the same area, and the player can be from private sector, too. Kumar shares the challenges that exist and the way forward. Edited excerpts:

The government has released draft amendments to the Electricity Act that propose opening up electricity distribution to private companies and refined regulatory mechanism. How different is it from the existing regulations and norms?

You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up the segment for new players. In privatisation, it is at the discretion of the present owner — the State government — whenever they want to rope in private sector into the business. What the draft Bill is attempting, in my understanding, is that it is allowing more than one player to operate in an area, and it can be a private player or a government company. The law itself provides for what we normally call a parallel licence, or second or subsequent licence.

In Section 14 of the Act, it provides that any person who fulfils the conditions laid down by the government can apply to the Regulatory Commission for a second or a new licence in the same area in which there is already a licence. Earlier, the new entrant was mandated to build their own distribution network. But now it will not be mandated under the proposed draft. The entrant can use the network of the existing licensee. As regards the proposed electricity authority, in simple terms, it will work to build consensus on reforms on the lines of the GST Council.

Recently, the apex court ordered clear-cut guidelines on the creation and amortisation of regulatory assets. It has mandated the clearance of accumulated regulatory assets (past dues) within four years, with new assets to be liquidated within three years. What is your take on this?

Rules and Tariff Policy already provide for this. The Court has ordered time-bound compliance. If this is followed, it will make tariffs cost reflective. The tariff policy made an exception in some cases — in case there is a natural calamity or something else, it is not possible to immediately raise the tariffs. You can create a regulatory asset, but it has to be very expeditiously liquidated. However, there are State regulators who have not liquidated these regulatory assets for very long. We must acknowledge that non-compliance increases interest cost on consumers, and the subsequent political regime will never like to raise tariff to clear past regulatory assets.

The Supreme Court has only affirmed the situation, and has directed the regulatory commissions to follow the law. It is a very good development. I know some have gone to the Supreme Court, asking for some time. Meanwhile, Rajasthan has already taken a step forward to liquidate regulatory assets.

Is capacity-swapping a doable solution for bettering continued availability? How does it work for discom health?

Traditionally, in our Power Purchase Agreements, three aspects were bundled — you buy capacity, you also buy your right on energy, and you also buy ancillary services required. But now, the penetration of renewable energy is creating mismatch in demand and supply. So, in that context, you must have sufficient capacity to meet the demand in any scenario — more than expected demand or less than expected generation. So, that available capacity can be swapped as per the need of the players. Energy can be purchased from such capacity through markets. There is a urgent requirement to have a separate capacity market framework, and the utilities must be bound to enter into contracts for adequate capacity. This will minimise stranded fixed costs.

Is the grid ready to take the energy mix. What is your take on it?

We have robust grid and reached a stage where General Network means once you are connected, you can sell your electricity anywhere in India. However, now the energy mix is changing because of the increased penetration of variable generation sources. So, we need more flexible resources like battery storage or pump storage capacity to take care of variations in demand and supply. In addition, we need digitisation to make the grid work because we need a lot of data in near real time or for operations and for future forecasts.

Is there a mechanism to work on a comfortable tariff that is suitable to all stakeholders?

The word comfortable is not appropriate. What we should aim at is a tariff based on efficient costs. Efficient cost of generation, efficient cost of transmission, efficient cost of distribution. So, if these activities are taken efficiently, whatever is the cost, that has to be reflected into the tariff. There is no other way to sustain this power sector. For example, if you keep on adding generation plants, it is not efficient cost. Some of the very peak demand can be met through demand response at a much lesser cost using digital technologies and efficient market.

So, tariffs should be based on efficiency in generation, transmission and distribution, and in markets. Whatever is the efficient cost, it should be passed through tariff. More importantly, the tariff is an outcome of a process of allocation of cost to different consumers. There is a pool of cost which you have incurred. Allocation happens in two stages. First, the determination of the demand charges and energy charges. And then you give some cross subsidies to the different consumer categories. So, my take is the allocation of cost should be very fair and transparent.

To make tariff comfortable, the State government already have a discretion by giving subsidy the needy consumers.

[TITLE]Oil Pipeline Threatens Catastrophe for Tribes in Michigan – Again:
[TEXT]
Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

This Indigenous Peoples Day, the approximately 2,700 Ojibwe tribal members of the Bay Mills Indian Community in northern Michigan are marking the holiday amid fear that their region could face another environmental catastrophe like the one that occurred in 2010, when Enbridge’s Line 6B oil pipeline burst and spilled over a million gallons of tar sands crude oil, contaminating the Kalamazoo River and over 40 miles in its watershed.

Today, the community is afraid that an even more potentially devastating event is looming: a future rupture of another Enbridge relic, the antiquated 72-year-old Line 5 pipeline, which originates and ends in Canada but travels across Wisconsin and Michigan, and crucially, through the Great Lakes under the Straits of Mackinac.

“There were two questions everyone asked when Line 6B broke,” tribal president Whitney Gravelle told Truthout. “It felt like the entire state of Michigan was like, ‘There’s pipelines in Michigan? ’And then… ‘Where are they?’” After members of the public learned that Line 5 ran under the Straits where Lakes Michigan and Huron conjoin, and that it had been installed in 1953 without consideration of treaties with the Anishinaabeg tribes — the Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi — or even informing them, the momentum to decommission Line 5 really grew, she said. Fifteen years later, the fight to uphold their rights under the Washington Treaty of 1836 — and to forestall a monumental tragedy for all of humanity — is still ongoing, as every passing day without a spill in the Straits is a tenuous miracle defying increasingly losing odds.

Fifteen attorneys from Earthjustice and Native American Rights Fund, plus their internal team, have been writing comments and briefs; collecting evidence; and submitting documents, information, and expert testimonies in order to push multiple federal agencies to eradicate the risks to the waters that comprise 20 percent of the world ’ s remaining fresh water supply and provide drinking water for 40 million people in the U.S. and Canada.

“The Environmental Protection Agency only responds if there’s an oil spill on land,” Gravelle explained, “while the U.S. Coast Guard responds if there’s an oil spill on water. We’ve challenged them both with our worst-case scenario: ‘What if there’s an oil spill in January, and the straits are covered with ice? What are you able to do when the break is four miles beneath the water, pluming oil up, and covered in a foot of ice. How are you gonna get to it? How?’ They have no answer, they just stare at us blankly.”

The unfortunate reality is that even without a catastrophic oil spill, the Great Lakes are under serious threats from climate change; extractive industry; plastic and shipping pollution; invasive species like the Quagga mussels; algae blooms in Lake Erie; and what Gravelle described as a general lack of care. “We have seen a major decline in the volume of our treaty fishery as well as a major decline in the water quality of the Great Lakes,” she said. The pipeline, built to last 50 years but already operating over 70, has spilled oil multiple times along its 645 miles, sometimes in their treaty territory. The single 30-inch pipeline becomes two 20-inch pipelines for the 4.5 miles it runs under the Straits “and if it opens in the straits, that’s the be all and end all. We’re done after that, the Great Lakes are done,” Gravelle warned. “That’s the heart attack that kills the Great Lakes.”

It would also be an attack on the fundamental way of life for Anishinaabeg, whose teachings passed down from time immemorial describe the relationship between humans and the waters as sacred and reciprocal — “If we take care of the lakes, they will take care of us,” Gravelle said. “That’s why we do the work we’re doing.” But their resistance, inspired by the Idle No More movement and the uprising against DAPL at Standing Rock, has been frustrated, especially since Trump’s Day One executive order declaring a national energy emergency. That order, Gravelle said, empowered Enbridge, which is aggressively pursuing three permits to build the Great Lakes Tunnel, a never-before attempted feat of engineering that will try to encase Line 5 in concrete and move it from where it currently is on the lake bed. One permit was granted from the Michigan Public Service Commission, but an appeal will be heard by the Michigan Supreme Court; another is before the Environment Great Lakes and Energy Division, and is currently in a comment period; and a third from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is expected to be granted. Additionally, there are two cases proceeding in federal court with the state of Michigan, one in which Attorney General Dana Nessel sued Enbridge under the Public Trust Doctrine to permanently remove Line 5 and another, where Enbridge sued Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for revoking their permits to operate on the lake bed, which is on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court — a turn of events Gravelle calls “worrisome.”

In the weeks running up to Indigenous People’s Day, the broader communal focus turned to ceremony, culture, history, community engagement, and preparing for the traditional harvest of manoomin (wild rice). Members of all three confederated tribes — the Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi — and their guests were invited to build a lodge and gather for Three Fires, One People, “a four-day ceremony held on the north and south shores of the Straits of Mackinac with fires lit on each side of the water. We gather to honor the ancestors who rest here, to lift prayers and make offerings together.”

“These Waters Are Everything to Us”

Paula Carrick, the tribal historic preservation officer in the Bay Mills history department, told Truthout that manoomin was essential to their origin story.

“At the beginning of time, we came from the great salt seas of the east, and we were told to leave the east to go and find the food that grows on water — manoomin,” she said. According to teachings, their ancestors were led west by ajiijack (cranes), who brought them to the rapids where the St. Marys River reached Lake Superior, which is how they became Boweting inini — the People of the Falls.

“This is where we ended up, Ontario is just across the river,” Carrick said, pointing to the mountains that explain why Enbridge found it cheaper to build their pipeline on the U.S. side where the terrain is flatter, having been carved out by an enormous glacier.

The common wisdom is that the Ojibwe were not forcibly removed to Oklahoma like the tribes in Southern Michigan because the fur traders and settlers that might’ve displaced them could not survive so far north without them. “They would’ve starved, sickened and died if we hadn’t helped them,” Carrick said. But ownership of the territory of their ancestral lands was greatly curtailed.

“These waters are everything to us — we work with clams shells in art or crushed for binder in pottery, we eat clams too. We make clay pots — slab and coil or pinch pots — the clay comes from the Big Lake [Lake Superior]. We fish of course, commercially and subsistence fishing, we have cranberry bogs,” Carrick explained. Traditionally, they also used the markings on the shells of sand turtles for calendars — 13 spaces (moons) ringed by 28 smaller spaces. “Everything

[TITLE]New Gas Find Set to Transform India's Upstream Production:
[TEXT]
India’s latest gas discovery in the under-explored Andaman-Nicobar Basin could prove to be a valuable stepping stone towards increased domestic upstream production and greater energy security for the country – but whether the basin can become a significant contributor to India’s domestic gas supply and pull in more long-term national and international oil company interest will hinge on several factors, not least the size of the reserves. The presence of hydrocarbons within the Oil India-led Sri Vijayapuram-2 well in the Andaman deepwater region was confirmed at last week’s Basin Analysis conference in Mumbai.

The well – part of a three-well exploration campaign that Oil India kickstarted last year within Andaman Block AN-OSHP-2018/1, awarded under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) Bid Round II in 2019 – was drilled on the east coast of the Andaman Islands at a water depth of 295 meters and to a target depth of 2,650 meters. Hardeep Singh Puri, India’s Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, also confirmed that “initial production testing of the well in the range of 2,212 to 2,250 meters has established the presence of natural gas with intermittent flaring, with approximately 87% methane”.

This deepwater discovery and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’s (ONGC) dual announcement last year – Konark and Utkal in the Mahanadi Basin, off the east coast of India – signal the maturing of India’s offshore exploration efforts, reflect policy success, collaborative efforts from governing bodies such as the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), and the national oil companies (NOC). However, how transformative these discoveries become will depend on the size of the reserves, how fast they can be developed, cost, environmental management, and how they fit within India’s long-term energy-transition strategy.

This new gas discovery in the Andaman basin could be transformative, both for the basin itself and for India’s broader energy strategy, as the country undertakes Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Samudra Manthan’ (‘Churning of the Ocean’) mission – an initiative to explore the unexplored deepwater oil and gas potential. The Andaman deepwater region, which includes many others such as Krishna-Godaveri and Mahanadi, remains under-explored primarily due to associated costs and technical challenges, and it is significantly crippled by the lack of high-quality deepwater seismic data. Despite its geological promise, and significant discoveries in the analogue basins, the Andaman-Nicobar Basin has seen only a handful of exploration wells over several decades. The sparse drilling activity underscores the historically limited industry interest, with operators reluctant to commit capital in the absence of proven success. This lack of sustained well campaigns highlights the basin’s frontier status and the cautious approach companies have taken toward its exploration.

However, the announcement of this discovery will help validate the hydrocarbon potential of India’s deepwater region and encourage further investments and exploration drilling, likely triggering the development of new offshore infrastructure, including production platforms, pipelines and possibly floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. This could turn the basin into a significant contributor to India’s domestic gas supply, but it remains to be seen whether the size of the reservoir and its production potential will make it economically viable.

As domestic production continues to slump, new gas discoveries are increasingly critical to India’s energy landscape. They offer a pathway to enhanced energy security, economic growth and a smoother transition to a low-carbon future – but, more importantly, can help move the country transition from its heavy reliance on imports. Moreover, natural gas serves as a relatively cleaner fossil fuel, supporting the country’s climate goals by enabling a shift away from coal in power generation and industrial use. Additionally, for a nation heavily dependent on its NOCs, the establishment of deepwater potential combined with relevant fiscal terms could help stimulate investment in infrastructure, technology, and offshore exploration, primarily attracting international oil companies (IOC) to invest in the nation’s under-explored basins.

Deepwater exploration is technologically demanding and capital-intensive, therefore continuous efforts by the NOCs could help attract IOCs with better technologies, which in turn could accelerate discovery and extraction. Additionally, the Andaman find will likely spur more high-quality 3D seismic surveys and exploration drilling, not just in the Andaman-Nicobar Basin but in other under-explored deepwater areas and help ramp up the country’s reserves base. Nonetheless, above-ground risk such as environmental challenges will play a key role as deepwater operations and exploration offshore Andaman-Nicobar will need to carefully manage environmental risks, including impacts on marine ecosystems, potential spill risks and greenhouse gas implications. Hence, beyond a supply of energy, the new gas reserves could provide a strategic buffer, strengthen negotiating power in global markets, and support industrial growth by ensuring stable feedstock for industrial growth and stable domestic supplies, laying the foundation for sustainable, secure and economically efficient energy development.

India continues to see a growing interest from IOCs – showcased by the July 2025 memorandum of understanding (MoU) between ONGC and BP to collaborate on drilling stratigraphic wells in the Indian offshore sedimentary basins of Andaman, Mahanadi, Saurashtra and Bengal – aiming to enhance geological understanding and unlock untapped hydrocarbon potential, thereby strengthening the country’s long-term energy security. As such partnerships continue to mature, announcements of new discoveries could act as a catalyst for an influx of foreign investments. However, India’s dependence on its NOCs, such as ONGC and Oil India, is undeniable and will continue to be a defining feature of its energy sector. Enticing IOCs to actively engage in exploring the nation’s frontier basins will require a significant upgrade in the regulations and transparency in data sharing so, until then, these NOCs will remain indispensable partners in securing the country’s hydrocarbon future, even as collaborations with private and foreign entities expand.

[TITLE]Republicans try to weaken 50-year-old law protecting whales, seals and polar bears:
[TEXT]
By PATRICK WHITTLE

BOOTHBAY HARBOR, Maine (AP) — Republican lawmakers are targeting one of the U.S.’s longest standing pieces of environmental legislation, credited with helping save rare whales from extinction.

Conservative leaders feel they now have the political will to remove key pieces of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, enacted in 1972 to protect whales, seals, polar bears and other sea animals. The law also places restrictions on commercial fishermen, shippers and other marine industries.

A GOP-led bill in the works has support from fishermen in Maine who say the law makes lobster fishing more difficult, lobbyists for big-money species such as tuna in Hawaii and crab in Alaska, and marine manufacturers who see the law as antiquated.

Conservation groups adamantly oppose the changes and say weakening the law will erase years of hard-won gains for jeopardized species such as the vanishing North Atlantic right whale, of which there are less than 400, and is vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear.

Markets started the week on a weak note, taking a breather after the recent rebound. Tariff escalation concerns—particularly after the US President’s statement on the possibility of imposing an additional 100% duty on Chinese goods—triggered risk aversion across global equities, which in turn dampened domestic sentiment.Looking ahead, earnings will remain the key focus, though global developments may continue to induce volatility.

[TITLE]Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’:
[TEXT]
Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda.

In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.”

“BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’)

Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration.

Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups.

Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion.

BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story.

Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.”

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital.

Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.”

Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024.

“Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.”

Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.”

“Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar.

“What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said. (RELATED: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office)

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance Greg Brown told the AP that the reason behind these buyouts are “very simple. Because there’s a lot of money to be made.”

Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases.

“There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.”

ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition.

“BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.”

Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.”

Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May.

The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb.

The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.”

Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.

[TITLE]New Gas Find Set to Transform India's Upstream Production:
[TEXT]
India’s latest gas discovery in the under-explored Andaman-Nicobar Basin could prove to be a valuable stepping stone towards increased domestic upstream production and greater energy security for the country – but whether the basin can become a significant contributor to India’s domestic gas supply and pull in more long-term national and international oil company interest will hinge on several factors, not least the size of the reserves. The presence of hydrocarbons within the Oil India-led Sri Vijayapuram-2 well in the Andaman deepwater region was confirmed at last week’s Basin Analysis conference in Mumbai.

The well – part of a three-well exploration campaign that Oil India kickstarted last year within Andaman Block AN-OSHP-2018/1, awarded under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) Bid Round II in 2019 – was drilled on the east coast of the Andaman Islands at a water depth of 295 meters and to a target depth of 2,650 meters. Hardeep Singh Puri, India’s Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, also confirmed that “initial production testing of the well in the range of 2,212 to 2,250 meters has established the presence of natural gas with intermittent flaring, with approximately 87% methane”.

This deepwater discovery and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’s (ONGC) dual announcement last year – Konark and Utkal in the Mahanadi Basin, off the east coast of India – signal the maturing of India’s offshore exploration efforts, reflect policy success, collaborative efforts from governing bodies such as the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), and the national oil companies (NOC). However, how transformative these discoveries become will depend on the size of the reserves, how fast they can be developed, cost, environmental management, and how they fit within India’s long-term energy-transition strategy.

This new gas discovery in the Andaman basin could be transformative, both for the basin itself and for India’s broader energy strategy, as the country undertakes Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Samudra Manthan’ (‘Churning of the Ocean’) mission – an initiative to explore the unexplored deepwater oil and gas potential. The Andaman deepwater region, which includes many others such as Krishna-Godaveri and Mahanadi, remains under-explored primarily due to associated costs and technical challenges, and it is significantly crippled by the lack of high-quality deepwater seismic data. Despite its geological promise, and significant discoveries in the analogue basins, the Andaman-Nicobar Basin has seen only a handful of exploration wells over several decades. The sparse drilling activity underscores the historically limited industry interest, with operators reluctant to commit capital in the absence of proven success. This lack of sustained well campaigns highlights the basin’s frontier status and the cautious approach companies have taken toward its exploration.

However, the announcement of this discovery will help validate the hydrocarbon potential of India’s deepwater region and encourage further investments and exploration drilling, likely triggering the development of new offshore infrastructure, including production platforms, pipelines and possibly floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. This could turn the basin into a significant contributor to India’s domestic gas supply, but it remains to be seen whether the size of the reservoir and its production potential will make it economically viable.

As domestic production continues to slump, new gas discoveries are increasingly critical to India’s energy landscape. They offer a pathway to enhanced energy security, economic growth and a smoother transition to a low-carbon future – but, more importantly, can help move the country transition from its heavy reliance on imports. Moreover, natural gas serves as a relatively cleaner fossil fuel, supporting the country’s climate goals by enabling a shift away from coal in power generation and industrial use. Additionally, for a nation heavily dependent on its NOCs, the establishment of deepwater potential combined with relevant fiscal terms could help stimulate investment in infrastructure, technology, and offshore exploration, primarily attracting international oil companies (IOC) to invest in the nation’s under-explored basins.

Deepwater exploration is technologically demanding and capital-intensive, therefore continuous efforts by the NOCs could help attract IOCs with better technologies, which in turn could accelerate discovery and extraction. Additionally, the Andaman find will likely spur more high-quality 3D seismic surveys and exploration drilling, not just in the Andaman-Nicobar Basin but in other under-explored deepwater areas and help ramp up the country’s reserves base. Nonetheless, above-ground risk such as environmental challenges will play a key role as deepwater operations and exploration offshore Andaman-Nicobar will need to carefully manage environmental risks, including impacts on marine ecosystems, potential spill risks and greenhouse gas implications. Hence, beyond a supply of energy, the new gas reserves could provide a strategic buffer, strengthen negotiating power in global markets, and support industrial growth by ensuring stable feedstock for industrial growth and stable domestic supplies, laying the foundation for sustainable, secure and economically efficient energy development.

India continues to see a growing interest from IOCs – showcased by the July 2025 memorandum of understanding (MoU) between ONGC and BP to collaborate on drilling stratigraphic wells in the Indian offshore sedimentary basins of Andaman, Mahanadi, Saurashtra and Bengal – aiming to enhance geological understanding and unlock untapped hydrocarbon potential, thereby strengthening the country’s long-term energy security. As such partnerships continue to mature, announcements of new discoveries could act as a catalyst for an influx of foreign investments. However, India’s dependence on its NOCs, such as ONGC and Oil India, is undeniable and will continue to be a defining feature of its energy sector. Enticing IOCs to actively engage in exploring the nation’s frontier basins will require a significant upgrade in the regulations and transparency in data sharing so, until then, these NOCs will remain indispensable partners in securing the country’s hydrocarbon future, even as collaborations with private and foreign entities expand.

[TITLE]Power-hungry data centres threaten Australia’s energy grid. Here are 3 steps to make them more efficient:
[TEXT]
The Australian Energy Market Operator estimates data centres will consume 6% of Australia’s grid-supplied electricity by 2030.

To put that in context, that’s more than the current share of Australia’s healthcare and social assistance industry.

This reflects the rapid growth of Australia’s data centre industry – the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI). This growth is, in part, being driven by multi-billion-dollar investments from major tech players including AWS, Microsoft, CDC and NextDC. Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar has even suggested Australia could become Southeast Asia’s data centre hub.

The federal government is also fertilising the data centre industry. In August, for example, Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced the development of “national interest principles on data centres” as an outcome of the economic reform roundtable.

The power-hungry nature of data centres, however, poses major problems for the current energy grid in Australia. But there are three steps Australia can take to help power these facilities reliably and sustainably.

Increased volatility, increased risks

Unlike households and most industries, data centres require constant power. This adds pressure to an energy grid designed for variable consumption.

As more people use AI for more complex tasks, the workloads on data centres will intensify. This leads to increased baseload demand. But it also leads to unpredictable spikes and drops in demand which the grid was not built to manage. This volatility creates real risks.

In 2024, 60 data centres in northern Virginia suddenly disconnected from the grid due to a tripped safety mechanism. This unleashed a massive surge of excess electricity – which, were it not for network operators implementing emergency countermeasures, would have caused a massive blackout.

This near-miss highlighted the fragility of the grid when faced with sudden, large-scale data centre disconnections.

Clean energy can’t do it alone

The limitations of Australia’s current energy mix are another source of volatility.

While renewable energy is central to the clean energy transition, it alone can’t meet baseload and peak demands from data centres. The problem is twofold. First, renewables are intermittent. Second, energy storage and backup options can only be scaled to a limited degree.

This means most data centres will continue to rely on coal or gas in some form.

Most data centre operators have committed to 100% renewable energy by 2030. But in practice, this often means purchasing annual renewable credits or power purchase agreements.

These mechanisms don’t guarantee clean energy during actual operations – they simply help offset annual consumption. Meeting real-time demand with clean energy is a far more complex challenge. It requires greater investment in renewables, storage and transmission infrastructure. It also requires better coordination between energy regulators, utility companies and data centre operators.

These challenges were reflected in Australia’s new climate target – a 62–70% cut below 2005 levels by 2035. This sits below the 65-75% range initially proposed by the Climate Change Authority last year. Why the reduction? Among the cited “transition risks” is the significant growth of data centres.

Mick Tsikas/AAP

Becoming a global champion

Australia has an opportunity to develop policies that synchronise data centre expansion with more efficient energy and grid management.

First, Australia should promote computing methods at scale that reduce emissions but don’t compromise capabilities.

For example, smart scheduling software can automatically shift energy-intensive tasks, such as model training, to off-peak periods when renewable energy is most abundant. This wouldn’t affect more everyday, less energy-intensive tasks, such as using ChatGPT, that require immediate responses. Companies such as Google have already adopted this approach to reduce grid strain without impacting user experience.

Alongside this, data centres should be required to inform power companies in advance of large-scale AI training runs that can cause dramatic energy spikes. Companies such as Hitachi Energy have called on governments to implement such rules to support grid management, citing other energy-intensive industries, such as smelting, where prior warning is already a common practice.

Second, Australia needs to accelerate advanced energy storage innovations, including batteries, pumped hydro and thermal energy storage. Research in many of these technologies is already underway, backed by government initiatives and private investments.

Data centre company AirTrunk, for example, is exploring different ways of implementing battery energy storage systems in its new data centres. However, more targeted financial incentives and support – such as through the Future Made in Australia and the National Reconstruction Fund – can help to bridge the gap between research and commercial scalability.

Third, Australia can require data centres to set what are known as “power usage effectiveness” – or PUE – targets to drive energy efficiency.

PUE targets are calculated by dividing the data centre’s total energy use by its IT equipment energy use. A PUE closer to 1.0 indicates greater energy efficiency.

PUE limits in China helped reduce its average PUE from 1.54 to 1.48 in just one year. Similarly, voluntary initiatives such as the European Union’s code of conduct for data centre energy efficiency, have consistently lowered the average PUE among participating facilities.

There is no shying away from the reality that data centres are energy-hungry behemoths. However, with the right planning and policies, Australia could be a global champion for data centre growth that supports, not derails, the clean energy transition.

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:
[TEXT]
This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defense, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world's cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world's lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60%–70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union—long-term trading partners with African nations—have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa's resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa's position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasize local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa's critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another "resource curse."

The emerging 'New World Order'

A Chinese-led "New World Order" is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea.

[TITLE]Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’:
[TEXT]
Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda.

In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.”

“BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’)

Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration.

Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups.

Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion.

BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story.

Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.”

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital.

Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.”

Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024.

“Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.”

Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.”

“Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar.

“What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said. (RELATED: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office)

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance Greg Brown told the AP that the reason behind these buyouts are “very simple. Because there’s a lot of money to be made.”

Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases.

“There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.”

ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition.

“BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.”

Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.”

Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May.

The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb.

The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.”

Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.

Shares of Bloom Energy soared early Monday after it made a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers. Brookfield will spend up to $5 billion to use Bloom Energy’s technology. This is Brookfield’s first investment in its strategy to support large AI data centers with both power and computing infrastructure.Bloom Energy’s fuel cells are “fuel-flexible” and can run on natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen, according to the company. Brookfield and Bloom will collaborate to design and build “AI factories” around the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year, as stated by CNBC report. Bloom energy stock surgeBloom Energy shares jumped almost 30% in early trading after the announcement. Bloom’s fuel cells provide onsite power and can be installed quickly because they don’t rely on a connection to the electric grid.The company has already installed hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities like American Electric Power and data center developers such as Equinix and Oracle , according to Bloom Energy, as mentioned in the report by CNBC.AI data centers need off-grid powerThe AI industry’s data center plans are growing fast. For example, Nvidia and OpenAI recently announced a partnership to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, which equals the power used by New York City during peak summer.AI companies face a problem: the U.S. electric grid is old and often slow to provide extra power. Building new data centers could also raise electricity prices for homes. Deploying “behind-the-meter” power solutions (off the grid) is essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories, said Sikander Rashid, Brookfield’s global head of AI infrastructure KR Sridhar, Bloom Energy CEO, said, “AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week, “Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that.” Huang added that the AI industry will need off-grid power to quickly meet demand and protect consumers from rising electricity prices.FAQsBecause Bloom Energy made a $5 billion deal with Brookfield to supply fuel cells for AI data centers.They will build “AI factories” using Bloom’s fuel cells to provide fast, off-grid power for AI data centers worldwide.

[TITLE]Power sector opening up for new players: DG AIDA:
[TEXT]
Opening of the power distribution sector to more than one player in an area, if accepted, may take India’s electricity sector to a more competitive region. “You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up for private,” said former Power Secretary Alok Kumar, who is currently the Director General of All India Discoms Association (AIDA). In the draft amendment proposal to the Electricity Act, recently put out by the government for stakeholders’ comments, there is a move to have multiple players operating in the same area, and the player can be from private sector, too. Kumar shares the challenges that exist and the way forward. Edited excerpts:

The government has released draft amendments to the Electricity Act that propose opening up electricity distribution to private companies and refined regulatory mechanism. How different is it from the existing regulations and norms?

You have to understand the difference between privatisation and opening up the segment for new players. In privatisation, it is at the discretion of the present owner — the State government — whenever they want to rope in private sector into the business. What the draft Bill is attempting, in my understanding, is that it is allowing more than one player to operate in an area, and it can be a private player or a government company. The law itself provides for what we normally call a parallel licence, or second or subsequent licence.

In Section 14 of the Act, it provides that any person who fulfils the conditions laid down by the government can apply to the Regulatory Commission for a second or a new licence in the same area in which there is already a licence. Earlier, the new entrant was mandated to build their own distribution network. But now it will not be mandated under the proposed draft. The entrant can use the network of the existing licensee. As regards the proposed electricity authority, in simple terms, it will work to build consensus on reforms on the lines of the GST Council.

Recently, the apex court ordered clear-cut guidelines on the creation and amortisation of regulatory assets. It has mandated the clearance of accumulated regulatory assets (past dues) within four years, with new assets to be liquidated within three years. What is your take on this?

Rules and Tariff Policy already provide for this. The Court has ordered time-bound compliance. If this is followed, it will make tariffs cost reflective. The tariff policy made an exception in some cases — in case there is a natural calamity or something else, it is not possible to immediately raise the tariffs. You can create a regulatory asset, but it has to be very expeditiously liquidated. However, there are State regulators who have not liquidated these regulatory assets for very long. We must acknowledge that non-compliance increases interest cost on consumers, and the subsequent political regime will never like to raise tariff to clear past regulatory assets.

The Supreme Court has only affirmed the situation, and has directed the regulatory commissions to follow the law. It is a very good development. I know some have gone to the Supreme Court, asking for some time. Meanwhile, Rajasthan has already taken a step forward to liquidate regulatory assets.

Is capacity-swapping a doable solution for bettering continued availability? How does it work for discom health?

Traditionally, in our Power Purchase Agreements, three aspects were bundled — you buy capacity, you also buy your right on energy, and you also buy ancillary services required. But now, the penetration of renewable energy is creating mismatch in demand and supply. So, in that context, you must have sufficient capacity to meet the demand in any scenario — more than expected demand or less than expected generation. So, that available capacity can be swapped as per the need of the players. Energy can be purchased from such capacity through markets. There is a urgent requirement to have a separate capacity market framework, and the utilities must be bound to enter into contracts for adequate capacity. This will minimise stranded fixed costs.

Is the grid ready to take the energy mix. What is your take on it?

We have robust grid and reached a stage where General Network means once you are connected, you can sell your electricity anywhere in India. However, now the energy mix is changing because of the increased penetration of variable generation sources. So, we need more flexible resources like battery storage or pump storage capacity to take care of variations in demand and supply. In addition, we need digitisation to make the grid work because we need a lot of data in near real time or for operations and for future forecasts.

Is there a mechanism to work on a comfortable tariff that is suitable to all stakeholders?

The word comfortable is not appropriate. What we should aim at is a tariff based on efficient costs. Efficient cost of generation, efficient cost of transmission, efficient cost of distribution. So, if these activities are taken efficiently, whatever is the cost, that has to be reflected into the tariff. There is no other way to sustain this power sector. For example, if you keep on adding generation plants, it is not efficient cost. Some of the very peak demand can be met through demand response at a much lesser cost using digital technologies and efficient market.

So, tariffs should be based on efficiency in generation, transmission and distribution, and in markets. Whatever is the efficient cost, it should be passed through tariff. More importantly, the tariff is an outcome of a process of allocation of cost to different consumers. There is a pool of cost which you have incurred. Allocation happens in two stages. First, the determination of the demand charges and energy charges. And then you give some cross subsidies to the different consumer categories. So, my take is the allocation of cost should be very fair and transparent.

To make tariff comfortable, the State government already have a discretion by giving subsidy the needy consumers.
