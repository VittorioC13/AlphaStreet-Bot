[TITLE]From tracks to tech: Siemens India stakes claim in manufacturing, mobility:
[TEXT]
NEW DELHI: As India pushes to transform its manufacturing and infrastructure landscape, Siemens Ltd is betting billions on electrification, automation and digitalization to become a backbone of the country’s industrial future.

“The demerger has allowed us to sharpen focus on our core businesses and drive shareholder value," said Sunil Mathur, managing director and chief executive officer of Siemens, in an exclusive interview with Mint. “Each business is now moving independently and on track."

Government-led capital expenditure remains a major growth driver for Siemens, with the company expecting private investment to follow as income tax measures announced in the budget and GST reforms begin to stimulate consumption.

“The government has done what it could to drive demand—now it depends on consumer behaviour and global conditions," Mathur noted.

Despite global volatility, Siemens views India as a resilient and fast-growing market. Its three business verticals—Smart Infrastructure, Digital Industries, and Mobility—align closely with national priorities such as clean energy, modern manufacturing and urban mobility.

The company’s mobility division has emerged as a major growth engine, buoyed by marquee projects such as the ₹26,000-crore electric locomotive order and the high-speed rail signalling contract.

“These projects take our mobility business to the next level," Mathur said. “We now have a complete presence across rolling stock, electrification, and signalling."

Siemens is also expanding its propulsion and bogie manufacturing capacities in Aurangabad and Nashik and tapping into India’s rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) charging market. “We’re already supplying chargers for commercial fleets, and that segment will expand rapidly," he added.

Siemens holds a leading position in transport solutions, particularly in rail infrastructure. The company offers a full suite of products spanning signalling, electrification, and rolling stock components. It competes with global majors such as CRRC Corp. and Alstom, but its strength in automation keeps it among the top three players in rail and metro signalling, and among the top five in railway rolling stock.

Localization and global integration

Make in India remains central to Siemens’ expansion plan. The company operates around 25 factories across India, achieving up to 99% localization for the electric locomotive project.

The Aurangabad facility exports rail bogies to Europe, and nearly 20% of Indian production is now integrated into Siemens’ global supply chain.

“Localization isn’t a one-day job; it’s a journey involving engineering, design, and supplier development," Mathur explained. “We’re continuously deepening that localization. India is emerging as a global manufacturing base for Siemens."

Strategic acquisitions for new markets

While organic expansion remains the foundation, Siemens is actively pursuing inorganic opportunities that open new markets or add technology capabilities.

The 2021 acquisition of C&S Electric gave Siemens a strong foothold in India’s mid-market electrical equipment space. More recently, an acquisition in EV charging technology has added cost-effective solutions tailored to Indian conditions.

“Inorganic growth is a key part of our strategy—but we’re selective," Mathur said. “An acquisition must bring us a new market, product, or cost-level technology."

Digitalization and automation remain central to Siemens India’s transformation. The company is investing heavily in digital twins, AI (artificial intelligence), and industrial IoT (internet of things) to enhance manufacturing efficiency and integrate India’s plants into its global innovation ecosystem.

“Earlier, India was seen as a low-cost base," Mathur said. “But technology is now the great equalizer. The future lies in combining India’s software strength with advanced manufacturing."

“The current situation bodes well for infrastructure firms as raw material prices, particularly steel prices currently are subdued," said A.S. Firoz, former chief economist at the steel ministry and a steel sector expert. “Besides, steel prices don’t really get impacted by global geo-political situation but have other issues impacting pricing that follows an extremely cyclical path. So, infrastructure sector companies, using steel as raw material, should do well without bothering about cost pressure and shrinking margins."

Siemens also runs structured in-house learning and digital training initiatives to build next-generation capabilities. “Upskilling is essential, but technology will drive productivity leaps," he added.

The company's order book now exceeds ₹42,000 crore, driven by robust demand across energy, infrastructure, and mobility projects. With the government aiming to raise manufacturing’s share of GDP from 15% to 25%, Mathur believes Siemens is well positioned to power that transformation.

“Our technologies support India’s push for sustainable, intelligent infrastructure," he said. “As India grows, Siemens grows with it. We’re deeply intertwined with the country’s industrial and infrastructure journey—and we’re here for the long run."

[TITLE]Electronics Industry Warns Mexico Tariffs Could Undercut U.S. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Resilience:
[TEXT]
Bannockburn, Illinois, USA, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As negotiations over U.S.–Mexico trade policies near an October 29 deadline, the Global Electronics Association today released a new policy brief, From Risk to Resilience: Why Mexico Matters to U.S. Manufacturing. The report warns that proposed 30% tariffs on electronics imports from Mexico would fracture North American supply chains, raise costs for U.S. manufacturers, and undermine efforts to reshore production and strengthen domestic competitiveness.

Authored by the Association’s Chief Economist, Shawn Dubravac, and the Industry Intelligence team, the report concludes that Mexico has developed into a full-fledged production hub within the North American ecosystem, drawing on a diversified global network of suppliers Data shows that Mexico’s imports from China have declined significantly since 2017, with sourcing shifting to Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and the European Union.

“Electronics manufacturing today depends on cross-border collaboration,” said Lorena Villanueva, director of the Global Electronics Association’s Mexico office. “Mexico has become an essential partner in strengthening North American manufacturing. Our supply chains are not competitors; they are collaborators. Policies that recognize this partnership will ensure both nations remain competitive in a rapidly changing global market.”

The Association emphasized that maintaining a strong trade partnership with Mexico is a top priority for manufacturers on both sides of the border. Many of its members report that U.S.–Mexico trade is their single most important policy issue.

The release of the report comes at a critical moment: the current extension for U.S.–Mexico trade negotiations expires on October 29, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is accepting public comments on the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) through November 3. The Global Electronics Association will submit formal comments on behalf of the industry and plans to testify at the USTR’s public hearing on November 17.

“U.S.–Mexico trade isn’t just important—it’s indispensable to a resilient North American electronics ecosystem,” said Chris Mitchell, vice president of global government relations at the Global Electronics Association. “Boosting U.S. manufacturing and supporting Mexico’s industrial growth are two sides of the same coin.”

The report underscores that many electronics systems and components cross the U.S.–Mexico border multiple times before final assembly, reflecting deeply integrated supply chains that support competitiveness, jobs, and security across the region. Disrupting these flows with tariffs would drive up costs, slow delivery times, and threaten the survival of small and medium-sized manufacturers.

The Association urges policymakers to finalize a bilateral trade agreement that preserves tariff-free access, strengthens enforcement, and reinforces Mexico’s role as a co-builder of North American manufacturing resilience.

“Mexico’s manufacturing evolution is one of the clearest examples of nearshoring success,” the report concludes. “Protecting that progress is essential to the region’s economic stability and to building truly resilient supply chains.”

[TITLE]Hyundai supports renewed US-South Korea trade talks:
[TEXT]
HMG’s exports to the US are down 7% in 2025

Hyundai Motor Group’s (HMG) executive chairman, Chung Euisun, recently visited the US to join the leaders of several other major South Korean chaebols and support the South Korean government’s renewed efforts to negotiate better access to the world’s largest economy.

A similar mission in August failed to change the US Trump administration’s decision to impose a 25% import duty on South Korean imports, while duties on imports from Japan and the EU were recently set at 15%, and at 10% for the UK. This has created a significant disadvantage for South Korean companies operating in the US market.

HMG’s Hyundai Motor and Kia Corporation, and GM Korea, are estimated to have exported a combined 1.6 million vehicles to the US last year, worth around US$ 38 billion. Hyundai and Kia together sold around 1.7 million vehicles in the US in 2024, with shipments from South Korea amounting to 1.145 million units, while GM Korea’s US exports are understood to have amounted to a further 425,000 units.

Despite the toughening trade conditions, Hyundai Motor Group’s sales in the US increased by over 10% to 1.37 million vehicles in the first nine months of 2025. Imports from South Korea dropped by almost 7% to 736,000 units in this period, as the group stepped up local sourcing. The company’s new 300,000 unit/year vehicle assembly plant in Savannah, in the US state of Georgia, became operational around this time last year, with production yet to be fully ramped up.

Key sticking points in the South Korea-US bilateral trade negotiations include US access to some key South Korean markets and South Korea’s failure to convince the US that it will follow through on its stated commitment to investing US$ 350 billion in US manufacturing. At the last count, around US$ 150-200 billion had been committed to actual investment projects.

[TITLE]Covenant Logistics Group Announces Third Quarter 2025:
[TEXT]
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. (NYSE: CVLG) (“Covenant” or the “Company”) announced today financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. The Company’s conference call to discuss the quarter will be held at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Thursday, October 23, 2025.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David R. Parker, commented: “Our third quarter results of $0.35 per diluted share, or $0.44 per diluted share on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, reflect essentially flat year-over-year performance in our asset-light business units and lower performance in our Truckload business units, mainly attributable to higher costs and under-utilized equipment. It was a busy quarter internally as we continued to invest in the future while managing costs during a prolonged period of overcapacity and muted demand.

“We continued to invest in and grow within certain industries that our dedicated fleet services with new start-up contracts, which weighed on third quarter margins but are expected to improve over time. Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate contracts in the rest of our Truckload business for improvement or exit. Overall, we expect modest contraction in our combined Truckload fleet and growth in our asset light segments as we allocate capital toward better returning business units. This process may impact quarterly financial results as we grow and shrink certain segments, adjust staffing needs, and dispose of equipment in potentially volatile used equipment markets.

“Our 49% equity method investment with Transport Enterprise Leasing (“TEL”) contributed pre-tax net income of $3.6 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to $4.0 million, or $0.11 per share, in the prior year quarter. The decline in TEL’s earnings is a result of customer bankruptcies that have accelerated over the past twelve months. While TEL’s overall business model remains healthy, we expect this headwind to continue for the foreseeable short term.

“Finally, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the unexpected passing of Lew Thompson, founder of Lew Thompson and Son Trucking Company, which we acquired in April 2023. Lew was a great friend and business partner, and his wisdom, humor, and storytelling will be missed by all. Lew was also a great mentor to the team that assumed day-to-day management of the business. We are confident this talented team will continue to ensure an exceptional customer experience, and we will honor Lew by continuing to serve our customers in a manner that would make him proud.”

(1) Represents non-GAAP measures.

Mr. Parker continued, “The third quarter included approximately $0.1 million in net items that have been excluded from adjusted financial results. Among these items was a $3.8 million gain from discontinued operations relating to a litigation settlement associated with our factoring business that was exited in 2020. Offsetting this gain was $3.7 million of expenses in severance and abandonment of certain underutilized leased facilities and systems related to exiting a large Managed Freight contract and the planned exit of legacy Dedicated contracts not providing sufficient returns. While these decisions were difficult and created a cost headwind in the quarter, we believe they needed to be made to improve the long-term cost profile of the Company. A detail of these costs is summarized in the table below.”

Combined Truckload Revenue

Paul Bunn, the Company’s President commented on truckload operations, “For the quarter, total revenue in our truckload operations increased 0.3%, to $199.7 million. The increase in total revenue consisted of $1.7 million more freight revenue and $1.1 million less fuel surcharge revenue, which varies with the cost of fuel. Freight revenue grew by $1.7 million, or 1.0%, as a result of a 4.6% increase in the average tractor fleet, partially offset by lower equipment utilization.”

Expedited Truckload Revenue

Mr. Bunn added, “Freight revenue in our Expedited segment decreased $7.2 million, or 8.2%. Average total tractors decreased by 31 units, or 3.4%, to 861, compared to 892 in the prior year quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week decreased 5.0% as a result of a 5.4% decrease in utilization, partially offset by a small increase in freight revenue per total mile.”

Dedicated Truckload Revenue

“For the quarter, freight revenue in our Dedicated segment increased $8.9 million, or 10.8%. Average total tractors increased by 136 units, or 9.7%, to 1,539, compared to 1,403 in the prior year’s quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week increased 1.0% as a result of a 7.0% increase in freight revenue per total mile, partially offset by a 5.7% decrease in utilization.”

Combined Truckload Operating Expenses

Mr. Bunn continued, “Rising operating costs in our Truckload segment negatively impacted operating margins compared to the prior year quarter. Higher costs primarily include salaries, wages and related expenses, insurance, and both variable and fixed expenses necessary to seat and operate our equipment. Some expense increases were expected, as they relate to growth in high-service and low-mileage operations. The expense increases were partially offset by a 5.0% increase in freight revenue per total mile.

“Salaries, wages and related expenses increased year-over-year by 5 cents, or approximately 4%, on a per total mile basis. The increase was driven primarily from the year-over-year impact of significant growth in our dedicated protein supply chain business as well as employee separation costs incurred during the quarter. As we grow our dedicated fleet in niche services, it requires hiring and retaining skilled drivers and maintenance professionals to operate and maintain specialized equipment on loads that typically move heavy weights on non-paved roads with shorter lengths of haul, resulting in higher costs on a per total mile basis. Additionally, as the freight market improves and the driver market tightens, we anticipate that driver pay will continue to rise.

“Safety continues to be our priority as we consistently strive to raise our own standards by hiring highly qualified drivers, implementing proactive training sessions, and investing in and implementing safety equipment and technology. For the past several years, our safety statistics have been at or near the best in our history. However, given the self-insured portions, potential additional premiums in certain layers based upon experience, and limits of our insurance program, and the risk of extremely large awards and settlements in our industry (so-called “nuclear verdicts/settlements”), the amount of expense recognized from period to period can fluctuate materially. Insurance and claims expense for the current quarter was 4 cents per mile, or 24% higher than the prior year on a per total mile basis as a result of the incurrence and development of certain large claims. At a minimum, we anticipate the fourth quarter insurance expense to remain elevated compared to historical amounts.

“Equipment related expenses, including Operations and maintenance and Depreciation and amortization, increased approximately 8 cents per total mile, or approximately 15%, compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to an increased amount of unproductive equipment. In addition, costs associated with seating our equipment, including recruiting and onboarding expenses, contributed to the increase compared to the prior year. Going forward, as the driver market tightens, we anticipate the cost of recruiting and onboarding to remain elevated.

“For the quarter, Managed Freight’s freight revenue increased 14.0%, from the prior year quarter. Operating income improved 0.4% and adjusted operating income improved 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2024. The growth in this segment is attributable to new business awarded in the year by a large customer that will no longer continue in the fourth quarter.”

“For the quarter, Warehousing’s results were fairly comparable to the prior year with reduced revenue of $0.4 million and operating income and adjusted operating income reduced $0.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter, we are anticipating growth in this segment from a large new facility start up with an existing customer scheduled to begin in November 2025.”

Capitalization, Liquidity and Capital Expenditures

Tripp Grant, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, added the following comments: “At September 30, 2025, our total indebtedness, composed of total debt and finance lease obligations, net of cash (“net indebtedness”), increased by $48.7 million to approximately $268.3 million as compared to December 31, 2024. In addition, our net indebtedness to total capitalization increased to 38.8% at September 30, 2025, from 33.4% at December 31, 2024.

“The increase to net indebtedness in the first three quarters of the year is primarily attributable to acquisition-related payments of $19.2 million and repurchasing approximately $36.2 million of common stock outstanding.

“At September 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2.7 million. Under our ABL credit facility, we had no outstanding borrowings, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of $19.9 million, and available borrowing capacity of $90.1 million.

“At the end of the quarter, we had $1.2 million in assets held for sale that we anticipate disposing of within twelve months. The average age of our tractors increased to 23 months compared to 20 months a year ago.

“Our expectations for net capital equipment expenditures in the fourth quarter is $15 million to $20 million.”

Outlook

Mr. Parker concluded, “Our outlook is impacted by both short-term and long-term factors. In the short term, we expect our Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter to be sequentially lower than our Adjusted EPS for the third quarter. The reasons include expected lower profits from our minority investment in TEL attributable to credit losses in their small-carrier customer base, the impact of the U.S. government shutdown on our Department of Defense business, an expected increase in claims accruals, and loss of a large Managed Freight customer rolling off faster than the results of Star Logistics Solutions ramp. These negative factors are expected to more than outweigh our current expectation of a modest peak season boost to Expedited and Managed Freight.

“Over the intermediate to long term, I am more excited today than I have been in the last three years. From a freight environment perspective, capacity exits seem to be accelerating based on publicly announced bankruptcies of small carriers and our observation of TEL’s customer base, as well as increased enforcement of government policies concerning English language and non-domiciled drivers. In addition, there are potential demand drivers from unwinding excess inventories from import pull-forwards, tax and monetary policies, and clarification of trade policy. We have internal plans and opportunities to continue to grow certain dedicated and warehouse business that has the potential to yield acceptable margins and hold or downsize our other Truckload capacity until returns improve. To the extent we downsize capacity, we may experience severance, equipment disposal, and other costs that create uneven results in a given quarter but are expected to lead to stronger and more sustained results over time.

“In sum, we expect improving market conditions and our internal plan to produce operating leverage and higher earnings and return on capital over time, although individual quarters may be volatile. With an experienced team, an attractive business mix, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we believe Covenant is well-positioned for the future.”

QB Action Plan Update and Q3 Performance

Production at QB continues to be constrained by the pace of development of the tailings management facility (TMF), requiring downtime in the concentrator to manage the rate of tailings rise. Our priority remains enabling safe, unconstrained production by raising the crest height of the dam. This is being delivered through construction of additional rock benches while continuing to progress efforts to improve sand drainage to support construction of the sand dam.

Ultimately, a sand wedge will be constructed using hydraulically placed sand, which will enable steady-state TMF operation. While sand currently being produced meets design specifications, slow drainage caused by the presence of ultra-fines has delayed progress in development of the sand wedge. As a result, the mechanical construction of rock benches continues to be required, which has led to additional downtime through 2025, particularly in Q3, and is expected to result in incremental downtime in 2026, as reflected in our 2026 annual production guidance for QB. It is currently expected that from 2027 onwards, the TMF development should no longer be a constraint on throughput levels.

Significant work has been undertaken through 2025 to improve sand drainage times with some improvement realized to date. Further progress is needed to reach design targets, and two key initiatives were advanced in Q3 2025:

Ultra-fines removal: Test work in collaboration with cyclone manufacturers and third-party experts has shown positive results in improving sand drainage through the removal of ultra-fines. As previously disclosed, we are modifying the cyclone facility this quarter to incorporate alternative technologies designed to remove ultra-fine material.

Refinement of sand placement techniques: Improvements to paddock design, and sand placement and drying, are also being implemented to enhance drainage efficiency.

Q3 2025 copper production at QB was 39,600 tonnes, which was 12,900 tonnes lower than the same period last year. As outlined above, ongoing TMF development has constrained production through 2025 resulting in additional downtime of the concentrator, particularly in Q3 2025. September production was 5,800 tonnes, impacted by 20 days of downtime required to raise the tailings dam crest.

Molybdenum production at QB was 480 tonnes in the third quarter as ramp-up of the molybdenum plant continued. Molybdenum production was constrained by downtime in the concentrator due to ongoing TMF development work, outlined above.

The shiploader at QB's port facility is under repair, as previously disclosed, and is expected to return to service in the first quarter of 2026. The outage is not expected to impact production as we have been shipping concentrate through our alternative port arrangements and have maximized shipments to local customers.

On October 7, 2025, we announced updates to our previously disclosed guidance. Our annual 2025 copper production for QB is expected to be 170,000 to 190,000 tonnes and our annual molybdenum production for QB is expected to be 1,700 to 2,500 tonnes. QB net cash unit costs1 for 2025 are expected to be between US$2.65 – $3.00 per pound.

[TITLE]Enhanced Oil Recovery Forecast Report 2025: A $68.38 Billion Market by 2033 Featuring Baker Hughes, BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Halliburton, Praxair, Shell, Schlumberger, TotalEnergies, Weatherford:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Enhanced Oil Recovery Global Market Report by Technology, Application, Countries and Company Analysis, 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Enhanced Oil Recovery Market is expected to reach US$ 68.38 billion by 2033 from US$ 47.64 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 3.04% from 2025 to 2033

Some of the key reasons driving the market include the growing number of aged wells, the decreasing oil production from existing oilfields, the ongoing development of innovative EOR techniques, and the growing desire for enhanced oil production. With its large-scale projects and cutting-edge technologies, North America dominates the EOR industry, although Asia-Pacific and the Middle East have significant development potential because of mature resources, growing energy demand, and encouraging government policies.

A collection of cutting-edge procedures used in the oil and gas sector to extract more hydrocarbons from reservoirs than can be recovered with traditional approaches is known as enhanced oil recovery, or EOR. EOR techniques modify reservoir conditions and fluid behavior in an effort to optimize production. Thermal, chemical, and miscible gas injection are common EOR techniques.

By raising the reservoir temperature, thermal techniques like steam injection lower oil viscosity and facilitate flow. In order to alter fluid characteristics and facilitate oil displacement, chemical approaches entail infusing polymers or surfactants. Injecting a miscible gas, usually carbon dioxide or nitrogen, improves oil mobility and lowers reservoir resistance. EOR methods are extremely technical and site-specific, taking into account variables including fluid composition, reservoir characteristics, and viability from an economic standpoint.

The growing demand for higher oil production is driving the global market. Global demand for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) solutions has increased due to the growing number of aging wells and the decreasing oil production from existing oilfields. When contrasted with conventional oil extraction techniques, these solutions have demonstrated an amazing ability to greatly increase overall production.

In order to improve oil recovery rates, EOR technologies are essential for increasing the permeability of established oil reservoirs and enabling more fluid hydrocarbon flow. Furthermore, EOR projects frequently call for large upfront expenditures in equipment, technology, and research. By assisting in the creation and execution of these projects, available investment and funding can stimulate the EOR industry.

Additionally, the creation of innovative EOR methods including chemical, thermal, and microbial EOR can spur market expansion and create new prospects for oil recovery. Furthermore, conventional oil reservoirs are not the only places where EOR techniques can be used. The potential market can be increased by applying them to unconventional reservoirs such as heavy oil deposits and shale oil.

Key Factors Driving the Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Growth

Reduced Production from Conventional Oil Reservoirs:

Natural reservoir pressure decreases as oil fields throughout the world get older, which lowers production rates. Only a part of the total oil in place is usually extracted using traditional primary and secondary recovery techniques. Producers can access the remaining reserves - which frequently comprise more than 50% of the initial oil volume - by using enhanced oil recovery techniques. With a growing number of aging fields globally, oil firms are increasingly resorting to EOR technology to sustain production levels and maximize the return on existing assets. One major factor driving the EOR market is the move away from investing only in new exploration and toward optimizing recovery from existing assets.

Technological Developments for EOR Techniques

Rapid advancements in chemical formulation, injection methods, and reservoir analysis are greatly enhancing the viability and efficacy of EOR. For example, advances in surfactant-based chemical flooding and CO2 injection technology have improved oil recovery rates while maximizing cost-efficiency. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), real-time monitoring, and digital reservoir modeling, smart EOR techniques provide more accurate targeting and operational management. These developments are opening up EOR to a wider range of geological environments, such as deep and offshore reservoirs. Future field development plans are increasingly including technology-driven EOR as a means of increasing recovery rates and reducing extraction costs per barrel.

Growing Oil Prices and Global Energy Demand

Oil firms are being pushed to extract more from their existing reserves due to the growing demand for energy worldwide, particularly from developing nations. Recovery techniques like EOR that were previously expensive or marginal become profitable when oil prices increase. EOR offers a means of greatly increasing output without venturing into uncharted territory, which frequently entails more environmental dangers and legal obstacles. It is anticipated that investments in effective, high-yield technologies like EOR will increase as long-term energy needs continue to rise due to industrial expansion and transportation fuel usage. One of the main drivers of EOR adoption is the financial incentive to extract more oil per field, especially when the market is doing well.

Challenges in the Enhanced Oil Recovery Market

High Operating and Capital Expenses

Large upfront investments in infrastructure, specialist technology, and equipment are necessary for the implementation of enhanced oil recovery projects. For instance, thermal and chemical EOR techniques frequently require large energy inputs, intricate logistics, and precise control systems, all of which raise operating costs. Furthermore, compared to traditional extraction techniques, EOR projects usually have longer payback periods, which raises financial risk, especially in unstable oil markets. Adoption may be hampered by these expenses for smaller companies or nations with tighter finances. This economic barrier limits the possibility for market expansion and is particularly noticeable in areas with low oil prices or restricted access to capital.

[TITLE]How to fund the data-center boom?:
[TEXT]
UDHAY MATHIALAGAN: The amount of data that’s being used in the world is growing at such a fast rate that the pieces of infrastructure that need to support it haven’t just been assembled at the scale and at the level of complexity that’s required. So we see an enormous opportunity.

ERIC JANSON: Huge amount of capital is needed. It’s needed all over the world in all different countries. And I think, by the sheer nature of that, you’re going to see more formalized blended models of financing, where public and private capital figure out ways to work together.

UDHAY: Data centers are not islands of infrastructure. They’re actually only effective if they are interconnected with other data centers. So there is an ecosystem of connectedness that creates almost a flywheel of economic activity that comes from a particular start, if you will, of infrastructure in a new area.

FEMI OKE: In this series, we’ve been exploring new opportunities for business and society when we do things differently—and how industries will meet to solve complex needs. But without enough money to pay for it all, businesses will miss out. So how can the way projects are funded drive a real change across industries?

LIZZIE O’LEARY: This is a time for new, creative financing models to develop—and an opportunity for the financial services sector, and beyond. I’m Lizzie O’Leary, a podcaster and journalist.

[TITLE]Hyundai supports renewed US-South Korea trade talks:
[TEXT]
HMG’s exports to the US are down 7% in 2025

Hyundai Motor Group’s (HMG) executive chairman, Chung Euisun, recently visited the US to join the leaders of several other major South Korean chaebols and support the South Korean government’s renewed efforts to negotiate better access to the world’s largest economy.

A similar mission in August failed to change the US Trump administration’s decision to impose a 25% import duty on South Korean imports, while duties on imports from Japan and the EU were recently set at 15%, and at 10% for the UK. This has created a significant disadvantage for South Korean companies operating in the US market.

HMG’s Hyundai Motor and Kia Corporation, and GM Korea, are estimated to have exported a combined 1.6 million vehicles to the US last year, worth around US$ 38 billion. Hyundai and Kia together sold around 1.7 million vehicles in the US in 2024, with shipments from South Korea amounting to 1.145 million units, while GM Korea’s US exports are understood to have amounted to a further 425,000 units.

Despite the toughening trade conditions, Hyundai Motor Group’s sales in the US increased by over 10% to 1.37 million vehicles in the first nine months of 2025. Imports from South Korea dropped by almost 7% to 736,000 units in this period, as the group stepped up local sourcing. The company’s new 300,000 unit/year vehicle assembly plant in Savannah, in the US state of Georgia, became operational around this time last year, with production yet to be fully ramped up.

Key sticking points in the South Korea-US bilateral trade negotiations include US access to some key South Korean markets and South Korea’s failure to convince the US that it will follow through on its stated commitment to investing US$ 350 billion in US manufacturing. At the last count, around US$ 150-200 billion had been committed to actual investment projects.

[TITLE]Major Investor for Louisiana LNG as Construction Ramps up:
[TEXT]
Australia’s Woodside Energy has enlisted U.S.-based Williams as an investor and pipeline operator of its Louisiana liquefied natural gas plant, to tap its infrastructure experience and ease cost pressures as construction ramps up.

Under the arrangement, Williams will get a 10% stake in Louisiana LNG’s holding company and 80% of the Driftwood pipeline that will supply feed gas to the $17.5 billion project.

Williams, which operates more than 33,000 miles (53,108 km) of pipeline across 24 U.S. states, will pay Woodside $378 million and contribute $1.9 billion towards the project’s construction costs.

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill told Reuters her company had expertise with developing LNG projects, but it needed to partner with an experienced operator of onshore pipelines in the U.S. like Williams.

The Louisiana LNG venture forms part of Woodside’s major expansion strategy into North America, betting on a pro-fossil fuel U.S. administration and growing global demand for gas.

O’Neill said Woodside was “off to the races” with the project and its construction workforce had ramped up ahead of first production expected in 2029.

Woodside is looking to sell a further 10% to 20% in the holding company after the Williams deal to reduce its overall interest in the project to 50%.

“We do want to bring other investors into the project,” O’Neill said. “We’re not going to set a timeline on it. We’ll continue to be patient, but the window is narrowing.”

Williams is the first partner Woodside has added since giving Louisiana LNG the final go-ahead in April.

Before that, it sold a 40% stake in the project’s infrastructure company to U.S. investor Stonepeak for $5.7 billion.

MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said Williams was a “very strong partner” and would help ease balance sheet pressures associated with the huge project.

“It’s going to really raise the profile of the project within the U.S.,” he said. “From an investor perspective, the sell-down is viewed positively.”

But further sell-downs would be needed to affirm the project’s value, he added.

Shares in the Australian company gained as much as 4.1% to A$24.11 on Thursday.

Once Louisiana LNG is complete, Woodside is keen to tap European markets in particular as they cut LNG imports from Russia, O’Neill said.

Louisiana LNG already has a supply deal with Germany’s Uniper and a heads of agreement with Turkey’s BOTAS.

“There’s very strong interest in LNG from our project from those customers in Europe,” she said.

“They’re absolutely going to need LNG from other sources, and the U.S. is going to be one of those key sources.”

Louisiana LNG is expected to have an initial annual production capacity of 16.5 million metric tons of the super-chilled fuel.

[TITLE]Canada's first 'nation-building' nuclear project relies on US suppliers:
[TEXT]
During a joint announcement with Ontario Premier Doug Ford in Bowmanville, Carney described the project as a generational investment aimed at extending Canada’s leadership in clean energy while ensuring long-term prosperity for Ontario workers and communities.

Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the federal government will invest $2 billion in Ontario’s Darlington New Nuclear Project — a plan that has stirred controversy since the eruption of a trade war with the US.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

The $3-billion partnership includes $1 billion from Ontario’s Building Ontario Fund . Ontario Power Generation will remain the majority owner and operator, with the federal and provincial governments holding minority stakes.

In the weeks after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and critical minerals, demand grew for Ontario to cancel its contract with US-based GE Hitachi, the company supplying the small modular reactors (SMRs) and enriched uranium for the $21-billion project. Both Carney and Ford have promoted “buy Canadian” policies to shield domestic industry from US tariff threats. Yet, despite the project’s reliance on American suppliers, both leaders defended the investment as essential to meeting Ontario’s soaring energy needs.

“This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach,” Carney said. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity, and opportunities.”

Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Ottawa had earlier committed $970 million to the project.

Canada’s first major “nation-building” investment is going toward a small modular reactor project that depends heavily on US suppliers for key technology and components.

Carney said the project marks the start of a broader plan to fast-track large infrastructure and clean energy projects through Ottawa’s new major projects office as proof that “Canada can build big things again.”

Construction on the first reactor began in May, with completion expected in 2030. Once online, the four reactors will supply

[TITLE]Why one of the world’s greenest countries is betting its future on oil:
[TEXT]
This story is a partnership between Grist and Foreign Policy , with support from the Pulitzer Center.

As Paramaribo, Suriname, flooded with shin-high water during a rainstorm in June, hundreds of taxis jostled for space on a recently paved street on the outskirts of the capital city. Passengers in suits disembarked alongside an overgrown canal. The visitors, some of whom had come from as far away as Texas and Malaysia, were there to commemorate this small country’s entry into the ranks of the world’s major oil producers.

Paramaribo sits on the northeast coast of South America, at the edge of a relatively undisturbed section of the Amazon rainforest. This massive jungle covers more than 90 percent of Suriname’s landmass, making it the world’s most forested country by percentage. It also allows Suriname to claim itself as “carbon-negative,” meaning that the nation absorbs more greenhouse gases than it emits.

As a result, Suriname is one of the few countries that can make an unimpeachable claim to being on the right side of the climate crisis. But all that is

[TITLE]Thyssenkrupp warship spinoff TKMS taps into Europe’s defense boom with Frankfurt IPO:
[TEXT]
TKMS , the German warship manufacturer which has spun out from parent group Thyssenkrupp , plans to capitalize on the expected surge in Europe's defense spend with "prudent, margin-oriented growth" after debuting on Frankfurt's stock exchange Monday.

The initial public offering saw TKMS launch at around 60 euros ($70) per share — giving it a market value of around 3.8 billion euros ($4.4 billion) — drawing strong demand from investors. Industrial engineering giant Thyssenkrupp will continue to hold a 51% stake in the company following the offering.

The company, also known as Thyssenkrupp Marine Services, builds both submarines and surface vessels, as well as electronics and software technology, which TKMS CEO Oliver Burkhard called the "jewel in the chest box" of the company.

This includes sonar equipment and certain autonomous devices, which are critical in the so-called multi-domain operations "which is the next big thing in military warfare," Burkhard told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday.

The IPO will enable the company to raise capital and expand capacity amid an anticipated ramp-up in demand for stronger defense capability, particularly in the naval sector, in Europe in the coming decades.

The U.S. has 71 submarines, while Russia has an estimated 64. Germany, by comparison, has just six, and has ordered six more.

Burkhard said TKMS has an order backlog of 18.6 billion euros, which will mean the company will likely remain at full capacity towards 2040, with one submarine typically taking between 5 and 15 years to build.

ASELSAN shines as defense stocks ride global rally

ISTANBUL

Defense and aerospace companies have delivered strong returns to investors as countries increase defense budgets and continue major projects, with Türkiye's ASELSAN standing out for its remarkable performance.

Following the Russia-Ukraine war and heightened security threats, many European nations have decided to boost defense investments. This surge in spending has fueled rapid gains in the share prices of defense and aerospace firms. NATO leaders’ decision to raise defense expenditures to 5 percent of GDP by 2035 has further strengthened the sector’s momentum in global markets.

Against this backdrop, stock performance over the first nine months of the year shows significant gains for investors: South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace rose 239 percent, Germany’s Rheinmetall 221.9 percent, Türkiye’s ASELSAN 196.6 percent, Sweden’s Saab 145.8 percent, the U.K.’s Rolls-Royce 109.3 percent, Italy’s Leonardo 108.3 percent and the U.K.’s BAE Systems 79.3 percent.

ASELSAN continues to play a pioneering role in the development and transformation of Türkiye’s defense technologies while also impressing with its financial results. The company became the first listed firm on Borsa Istanbul to surpass a market capitalization of 1 trillion Turkish Liras.

ASELSAN is working toward its goal of ranking among the world’s top 30 defense companies by 2030. Currently, it holds the highest market value within the BIST 100 index.

Meanwhile, on Borsa Istanbul, shares of Onur Yüksek Teknoloji remained unchanged, while SDT Space and Defense fell 3.1 percent and Altınay Defense dropped 11.8 percent. Other Turkish defense companies also showed mixed performances over the nine-month period. Papilon Savunma gained 26.2 percent, Otokar advanced 5.8 percent, Onur Yüksek Teknoloji ended flat, SDT Uzay ve Savunma declined 3.1 percent and Altınay Savunma recorded a sharper loss of 11.8 percent.
