[TITLE]Commercial, not tech-savvy: India risks foreign-led growth trap amid FDI euphoria:
[TEXT]
Every day seems to bear news of India's success as a pre-eminent tech-savvy nation. Other than India's homegrown UPI, however, none of these can be ascribed to indigenous traffics and innovation. One such toast of the town is Apple , which has clocked over $10 bn worth of iPhone exports from India this year, up 75% from H1 FY25.To add to the euphoria, Foxconn Interconnect Technology, Hyderabad, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Taiwanese contract manufacturer for Apple products, plans to invest nearly ₹4,800 cr to double monthly AirPods production to service US, European and Indian demand. Then there's Google's announcement that it will invest $10 bn to establish a 1 GW capacity data centre cluster in Visakhapatnam, projected to be Asia's largest when it becomes operational in 2028.Also, Elon Musk's Starlink has applied for 600 Gbps of capacity for its 4,408 low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite service, which will facilitate gateway stations in 9 Indian cities. Farther upstream, Sify Technologies is being celebrated for having been chosen by Meta as its preferred landing partner for Project Waterworth, a $10 bn undersea cable connecting the US to Brazil, South Africa and India.These opportunities don't come without concessions, like PLIs and proposed tax amendments provided to Apple's contract manufacturers, tax exemptions for data centres in Tier-3 cities, and indemnification for AI firms against copyright infringement while using personal data to train their models. But they also promise to boost capital and employment. Along with all the other chatter centred on intended AI partnerships and investments, it's little wonder that India's future dazzles citizen and foreigner alike.The assumption that FDI and foreign direct participation (FDP) are key to a successful developing nation's playbook has its origin in the 1980s, when the benefits of globalisation - including free capital inflows, deregulated markets, tariff reduction and privatisation - were aggressively pushed by institutions like IMF and World Bank. One European trade representative even stated in 1995 that FDI and FDP were finally being seen for what they were: a source of capital that had no country, 'a contribution to a healthy external balance, a basis for increased productivity, additional employment, effective competition and rational production'.For all that, the truth is more nuanced. In Nigeria, for instance, global corporations have exploited its vast petroleum reserves for years. But the country has been unable to develop its own refineries and allied industries. Similarly, in Mexico, auto plants produce vehicles for export, while local manufacturers are relegated to making low-value ancillaries and components. On the other hand, countries like China, South Korea and Taiwan were able to build both mid-tier and hi-tech industries, and even indigenous MNCs of their own.A large part of this success may be attributed to the way in which they kept foreign capital and participation within defined guard rails and used them to pursue clear national priorities. By forcing JVs on foreign entrants, insisting on IP access, mandating use of local suppliers where possible and actively supporting domestic corporations, these Asian nations were able to promote global champions and challengers.Today, India is at a new crossroads. But the wisdom of carefully navigating FDI and FDP remains the same. This is critical because India suffers from structural weaknesses that include unequal education and skill level of its workforce, preponderance of SMEs, and narrow industry diversification at scale. As a result, foreign investments and units could simply replace domestic investment and industry rather than augmenting them.In such a situation, as with many Latin American nations including Brazil and Argentina, foreign players can, in the near term, decimate less efficient local companies, consume disproportionate resources, and create a low-skill and mid-tech equilibrium that will reinforce existing comparative advantages without future upside like textiles, assembly work, IT services, etc.This will not advance India's high-end manufacturing and service development ambitions. In the long term, this could be even worse. Conducting empirical research with data spanning four decades, G K Martins showed that countries with higher foreign ownership in 1980 suffered significantly reduced income growth - up to 40% lower - by 2019.Ultimately, GoI should be mindful that becoming the other factory of the world through assembly plants, landing stations and GCCs is a commercial target, not an economic vision. To achieve its true potential, India will need to invest heavily in building its own capabilities, while judiciously enabling foreign ownership through JVs and mandatory technology transfer.Otherwise, when the music stops playing and the applause ends, the country may find itself in an irreversible ownership, capability and income trap of its own devising.

[TITLE]New dynamics over Russian oil:
[TEXT]
The US President, Donald Trump, believes that imposing sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies will impact Kremlin’s finances. According to reports, Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has said they will not have much of an impact on its economy.

While the two battle it out, what it will do is test the diplomatic strength of big oil consumers like India and the overall vulnerability of the global oil market due to uncertainty in pricing. No sooner were the sanctions announced, there was a spike in prices before stabilising.

Technically, Indian refiners are not banned from buying Russian-origin crude, but they must avoid transactions with the sanctioned companies and their subsidiaries.

On its part, India has been maintaining the stance that its economy comes first and wherever it gets cheap oil it will opt for it. There has been no diktat yet to the oil companies to cut down on sourcing Russian oil, according to those associated with the developments.

The concern for New Delhi is not supply but pricing. As much as 85-90 per cent of India’s crude requirement is met through imports. The Budget has taken an average of $70/barrel for crude pricing; as of October 24, 2025, Indian refiners sourced their crude oil at $68.37 a barrel.

Not only India, even the US will be affected by high crude oil prices.

According to energy expert Narendra Taneja, “Rosneft and Lukoil are key players in the global oil supply system. Rosneft, in fact, is the third biggest producer in the world. The American president has sanctioned these two big Russian corporations, but not the Russian oil per se — so there are still no American or European sanctions on Russian oil. The American game is clear: harass the buyers of Russian oil without causing any significant disruption in the supply of Russian oil into the global oil supply chains.”

The two sanctioned companies are estimated to account for 50 per cent of Russia’s oil production. Therefore, prices can hurt even if supplies are not a problem.

“Clearly, the US has left enough headroom for Russian oil to find its way for exports one way or another. Trump knows any major disruption in oil supply from Russia will lead to higher oil prices, hitting American economy and his loyal voters the most.... However, the fear of secondary sanctions by the US against any buyer of Russian crude is real and may force many buyers to recalibrate their sourcing strategy,” Taneja added.

“My sense is Trump does not want to go full force after Moscow yet, leaving all channels open for negotiations on Ukraine. Given a chance, Trump wants to build business bonhomie with the Kremlin,” he said, adding “therefore, let us wait and watch how all this new sanctions business go.”

Array of obstacles

According to Umud Shokri, Energy Strategist and Senior Visiting Fellow at George Mason University, “By hitting Rosneft and Lukoil, Washington anticipates generating formidable hurdles for any business dealings with them, effectively curbing Russia’s petroleum outflows and eroding its energy-driven income streams. For India, a top importer of Russian oil, these measures pose a thorny array of obstacles.”

Major Indian refineries — both public and private — depend heavily on Russian supplies routed through pathways dominated or shaped by Rosneft and Lukoil, he said, adding that “the penalties heighten the threat of delivery interruptions and regulatory entanglements, compelling these operators to swiftly overhaul their sourcing tactics. To sustain vital inputs for refining and chemical production, India might need to broaden its supplier base or pivot to unaffected Russian intermediaries and traders.”

“The impending November 21 enforcement date injects immediate pressure, demanding that refineries adapt to shifting regulatory landscapes and supply chains in a compressed time-frame. Even if Indian purchasers turn to round

[TITLE]The fear haunting global finance:
[TEXT]
Financial regulators and central banks in the US, the UK and Europe, spooked by revelations emerging from the bankruptcy of little-known firms like First Brands (a producer of windshield wipers and brake pads) and Tricolor (an automobile loan provider), are being haunted of fears of a return to 2008.

To recall, at the centre of the 2008 financial crisis was a speculative frenzy involving opaque derivative instruments riding on mortgage loans, stretching from straight mortgage backed securities to synthetic derivatives and credit default swaps, among other “innovative” financial assets. That chain created an impression that rapidly rising credit risk was spread so thin across instruments and investors that the volume of loss for any individual player was small and systemic risk was minimal. On the other hand, such financial “innovation” was seen as facilitating a credit boom that was good for growth without increasing financial vulnerability. Those presumptions were proved wrong.

One of the few lessons learnt was that the system was bigger than the individual players involved and can be downed by the herd-like adoption of actions that individual players consider normal or even beneficial. Banks argued that Glass-Steagall style regulation, that limited diversification in activity warranted by their access to savings and their physical reach, was a constraint on the flexible decision making that is good for both their business and the economy.

All players held that regulation should be light and market mediated. And assessment of risk should be left to market players with banks allowed to use internal ratings-based approaches to assess risk and regulators confining themselves to specifying market-mediated parameters like capital adequacy requirements, accounting standards and disclosure norms. That “consensus” generated by the epistemic community of finance paved the way for a crisis which, though still with us, was reined in at the cost of trillions of dollars in public money.

Similar trend

Yet First Brands and Tricolor have collapsed after having ridden a wave that has similar characteristics and gave rise to similar vulnerabilities. The common features between the 2008 crisis and the current troubles are systemic drivers that led to an unsustainable expansion of credit with no due diligence.

In both cases unregulated non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), that are “non-banks” in that they are not licensed to receive deposits from ordinary depositors whose savings are insured by deposit guarantees, excessively lent funds mobilised from “investors” to suspect borrowers that were “allowed” to conceal the uses to which they put that money.

This has been made possible by the entry of private equity into the credit markets, encouraged by the availability of large volumes of liquidity at interest rates that are low relative to that which can be charged to borrowers unable to access traditional credit sources like the banking system. The higher risk associated with lending to these borrowers makes them unapproachable targets for banks and institutions that must comply with ratings standards or capital adequacy norms that dissuade lending to entities that attract higher risk weights.

It is into that space that the NDFI’s stepped in. Non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI) have been growing rapidly over the last decade, outpacing the growth of the banking sector. According to data from the Financial Stability Board’s 2024 report, with financial assets valued at $239 trillion in 2023, the NBFI sector accounted for 49 per cent of the stock of global financial assets.

These institutions, especially private equity firms and hedge funds, were willing not just to lend to firms that banks avoided, but when faced with the prospect of default were willing to accept “payment in kind”, involving the deferment of payments that were added to the principal a cost (such as a higher interest rate).

The higher rate was seen as adequate compensation for the risk of lending to stressed borrowers.

CLO factor

In the case of First Brands, for example, that reported borrowing and other liabilities in excess of $10 billion had been supported by collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), lending vehicles designed to take on tradable debt. These CLOs were the creation of asset managers such as PGIM, Franklin Templeton, Blackstone, and Oaktree.

These institutions in turn were financed by traditional financial firms especially banks.

The loans they provided First Brands included credit against invoices, or immediate liquidity against evidence of expected future receipts, and “supply chain finance” or paying First Brands bills due to suppliers for recovery against a charge from the implicit borrower.

There are allegations of fraud in First Brands evidence of unencumbered receipts supplied to the creditors, though their greed for high returns led to inadequate scrutiny or due diligence on their part.

The fear that the bankruptcy of First Brands and Tricolor has generated is not only related to the huge losses running into billions of dollars in the private equity segment of the credit market. It also arises because of the exposure of the commercial banking system to this new-fangled lending space.

As Chart 1 shows US bank lending to NDFIs has risen from $215 billion at the beginning of 2015 to $1.3 trillion by mid-October 2025. That growth has meant that a substantial share of the exposure of US banks is to non-bank institutions: 23 per cent to private equity funds, 21 per cent to business intermediaries, 18 per cent to mortgage intermediaries, 9 per cent to consumer intermediaries and 30 per cent to all others (Chart 2).

Loans by US banks to NDFIs are also concentrated in private credit intermediaries (23 per cent or the same as to mortgage intermediaries who were more important in 2007), and in business intermediaries (21 per cent) (Chart 3). The problem is not restricted to the US alone.

According to the IMF October 2025 Global Financial Stability Report: “Banks’ exposure to NBFIs is large: in Europe and the United States, NBFI loans represent, on average, 9 percent of banks’ loan portfolio, with exposures amounting to about $4.5 trillion, of which $2.6 trillion corresponds to loans and the rest to undrawn commitments.”

Entanglement has gone further. The Financial Times reports that Allianz, Coface and AIG “have written policies shielding trading partners or investors (of or in First Brands) from losses through their trade credit businesses.” Entangled exposures of this kind are raising fears that a 2008-style financial collapse can occur.

That warning has come from financial circles in the US, and also from the Bank of England that according to Bloomberg has warned of parallels between the $1.7 trillion private credit boom and the subprime debt crisis. The story has perhaps just begun.

HNI today announced that it has extended the expiration date of its previously announced (A) offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) any and all outstanding Existing Steelcase Notes for New HNI Notes and (B) related solicitation of consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) from the Eligible Holders of the Existing Steelcase Notes to, among other things, eliminate certain covenants and restrictive provisions from the Steelcase indenture dated August 7, 2006, governing the Existing Steelcase Notes (as amended and supplemented, the “Existing Steelcase Indenture”) and the Existing Steelcase Notes (the “Proposed Amendments”) from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 27, 2025, to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 5, 2025, unless further extended (the “Expiration Date”).

On the early tender date and consent revocation deadline of October 9, 2025, HNI received consents sufficient to amend the Existing Steelcase Indenture to effectuate the Proposed Amendments. The supplemental indenture to the Existing Steelcase Indenture was executed on October 9, 2025 in order to effect the Proposed Amendments (the “Existing Steelcase Notes Supplemental Indenture”). The Existing Steelcase Notes Supplemental Indenture will become operative only upon the settlement date for the Exchange Offer and the Consent Solicitation, which is expected to be within five business days after the Expiration Date (the “Settlement Date”).

The Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including among other things, the consummation of the Acquisition. The parties’ obligations to complete the Acquisition are conditioned upon (i) certain HNI and Steelcase shareholder approvals, (ii) the receipt of antitrust approvals and (iii) certain other customary closing conditions. The consummation of the Acquisition is not subject to the completion of the Exchange Offer or Consent Solicitation or a financing condition.

To the extent the consummation of the Acquisition is not anticipated to occur on or before the then-anticipated Settlement Date, for any reason, HNI anticipates extending the Expiration Date until such time that the Acquisition may be consummated on or before the Settlement Date. To further extend the Expiration Date, HNI will notify the Information & Exchange Agent and will make a public announcement thereof before 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date.

Tenders of Existing Steelcase Notes in the Exchange Offer and related consents validly delivered (and not validly revoked) prior to the extension of the Expiration Date remain valid. All Existing Steelcase Notes previously tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in an extended Exchange Offer will remain subject to such Exchange Offer and may be accepted for exchange by HNI.

[TEXT]
MEXICO CITY, Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación, S.A.B. de C.V.

Enrique Beltranena, President & Chief Executive Officer, said: “This quarter once again demonstrated that Volaris’ agility and discipline set us apart. We acted decisively, fine-tuning our network, strengthening profitability, and capturing the sequential improvement in demand across our markets. The recovery we anticipated for the second half is unfolding as expected, supported by stable domestic demand in a rational supply environment and resilient cross-border traffic showing steady improvement. Despite external headwinds, we controlled what we can control and delivered on each line of guidance.

As we close the year, forward bookings and holiday demand trends are building momentum, paving the way for a solid start to 2026. Volaris will continue to control growth with discipline, efficiently reintegrating aircraft returning from engine inspections, and maintaining capacity aligned with market demand to ensure every aircraft we fly contributes to sustained profitability.”

[TITLE]Leader of top federal worker union calls for end of US government shutdown:
[TEXT]
The head of America’s largest federal workers union says it is time to end the government shutdown, now the second-longest in US history, as hundreds of thousands of employees miss another round of paychecks.

Everett Kelley, who leads the American Federation of Government Employees representing more than 800,000 workers, avoided assigning blame to either party in the Monday morning letter but said lawmakers must stop playing politics and pass a stopgap funding measure to reopen the government, its closure now eclipsing the four-week mark.

“Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,” Kelley wrote in the statement. “Today I’m making mine: it’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship.” NBC News first reported the letter.

A “clean” continuing resolution is a temporary spending bill that keeps the government running at current funding levels without attaching other political demands. Republicans say they have offered that in their measure, but Democrats argue the bill shortchanges key services and are using their power in the Senate to push for a deal on health insurance subsidies that expire at year’s end.

Because of this stalemate, hundreds of thousands of federal and Washington DC government employees are either working without pay or furloughed. The union represents workers across nearly every federal agency, from Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers and army nurses to food safety inspectors and veterans affairs staff, many of whom are now lined up at food banks after missing their second paycheck, Kelley said.

“These are patriotic Americans – parents, caregivers, and veterans – forced to work without pay while struggling to cover rent, groceries, gas and medicine because of political disagreements in Washington,” Kelley said. “That is unacceptable.”

But the crisis extends beyond federal workers: roughly 42 million Americans who receive food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program face losing their benefits as soon as 1 November if the shutdown continues, after the US agriculture department warned states it would run out of money to pay for the program.

Senate Democrats have blocked a Republican-backed continuing resolution 12 times, demanding commitments on extending Affordable Care Act health subsidies. Three Democrats and one independent who caucus with the party have broken ranks to support the measure, but it remains short of the 60 needed to advance. The Republican senator Rand Paul is the sole Republican to defect on the measure.

The AFGE is already suing the Trump administration over mass layoffs organized during the shutdown and over partisan emails sent from government accounts without employees’ knowledge.

Kelley called for three immediate steps: reopening the government under a continuing resolution, ensuring full back pay for all affected workers, and addressing policy disputes through normal legislative debate rather than shutdown tactics.

“When the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren’t looking for partisan spin,” he said. “They’re looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they’re being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.”

The shutdown reaches the one-month mark this week, with no negotiations scheduled between the parties.

The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, told CNN on Sunday that he and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, requested a meeting with Donald Trump to discuss the shutdown before he went out of the country but had been rebuffed. The president has said he will only meet with Democrats after they vote to reopen the government.

“A strong America requires a functioning government – one that pays its bills, honors its commitments, and treats its workforce with respect by paying them on time,” Kelley wrote. “The government belongs to all of us. Let’s open it back up and keep America moving forward.”

[TITLE]Gaming and Leisure Properties to Acquire Land and Fund Hard Costs of Live! Casino & Hotel Virginia:
[TEXT]
WYOMISSING, Pa., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ: GLPI) (“GLPI”) announced today that it agreed to acquire the real estate in Petersburg, Virginia, the future site for Live! Casino and Hotel Virginia (“Live! Virginia”), a joint venture of affiliates of The Cordish Companies and Bruce Smith Enterprise (“Live! Virginia Group”). In addition, GLPI committed to fund the hard costs associated with the development of the destination casino and hotel project. The cap rate on both the $27 million land purchase and the $440 million hard cost funding is 8.0% and will be accretive to GLPI’s operating results. Closing of the transaction is subject to usual and customary closing conditions, including receipt of licenses and any approvals by the Virginia Lottery Commission.

The transaction represents an expansion of GLPI’s relationship with The Cordish Companies (“Cordish”), as the development will mark the fourth Cordish property for which GLPI will own the real estate assets. GLPI intends to fund the $27 million land purchase in the first quarter of 2026, with the remaining $440 million of committed financing anticipated to be drawn beginning in the second half of 2026 and continuing through the first quarter of 2028, post the Live! Virginia Group’s equity funding. During the construction phase, Cordish will pay rent on the GLPI funding, as drawn. After the first anniversary of the opening of the permanent casino project, rent will escalate at a rate of 1.75% per annum.

Live! Virginia is located just off I-95, less than 25 miles south of Richmond, VA. The approximately $600 million project will sit within a large 98-acre site and serve as the centerpiece of a broader $1.4 billion planned development, expected to include additional hotels, retail, dining, entertainment, and residential features.

The permanent facility is expected to open in late 2027 and will feature an 80,000 sq. ft. casino with 1,440 slots and 84 tables, over 10 food and beverage outlets, 200 hotel rooms, a 70,000 sq. ft. conference and event center, a 3,200-seat concert venue, and an array of other amenities. A temporary casino facility at the site is scheduled for a late January 2026 opening, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals.

Peter Carlino, GLPI’s Chairman and CEO, commented, “Our partnership with The Cordish Companies continues to expand, with this unique opportunity to further diversify our portfolio, both on a geographic basis and through an expansion with an existing tenant. This accretive transaction plants a Gaming and Leisure Properties flag in Virginia, which will represent the 21st state for our portfolio, and allows us to partner again with a strong, proven tenant on this exciting development project in Petersburg, Virginia. Additionally, this announcement marks our third transaction in the last two months, as the pipeline continues to build, setting the stage for accelerating growth in the coming years.”

David Cordish, Cordish’s Chairman, added, “As a multi-generational, family-owned and operated business, GLPI is an ideal partner for us to continue growing our Gaming Division. GLPI supports what we have done successfully for decades and will continue to do: develop, own, and operate best-in-class entertainment destinations under our Live! brand. We look forward to opening this best-in-class gaming facility.”

Greenhill, a Mizuho Affiliate, acted as financial advisor to Gaming and Leisure Properties.

For further information, GLPI has posted a transaction presentation to its website, which can be accessed at https://investors.glpropinc.com/events-and-presentations.

[TITLE]Petrofac's 7,300 Jobs at Risk:
[TEXT]
UK energy services provider Petrofac Ltd has filed to enter administration after the latest plans to restructure its balance sheet unexpectedly fell through, putting thousands of jobs at risk.

The company has applied to the High Court of England and Wales to appoint administrators, according to a statement on Monday. It comes after European grid operator TenneT canceled Petrofac’s work at a large offshore energy project in the North Sea, rendering the financial restructuring unviable.

The firm employs around 7,300 people globally and has been trying to strike a deal with creditors for over a year, while safeguarding key business deals that could keep the firm afloat. Its collapse would raise the pressure on the UK government to protect British jobs, with the Labour administration already coming under fire for blocking new North Sea oil licenses.

[TITLE]GE Vernova Turbine Will Power New Indiana Gas-Fired Plant:
[TEXT]
Energy development group Maple Creek Energy LLC said it has secured an agreement to purchase a GE Vernova 7HA.03 gas turbine in a single-shaft configuration, along with associated services, for the first phase of the company’s two-phase Maple Creek natural gas-fired power project in Sullivan County, Indiana.

The installation is being developed by Advanced Power, a privately-owned global developer, manager, and owner of power generation infrastructure, along with BDC Power Holdings, a Bechtel company. Advanced Power is headquartered in Switzerland, with U.S. offices in Boston, Massachusetts, and Houston, Texas. Infrastructure investor ArcLight Capital Partners is the owner of Maple Creek and is funding the equipment procurement.

GE Vernova is a sponsor of POWER’s Experience POWER event in Denver, set for Oct. 29-31 at the Hyatt Regency Convention Center hotel. Clive Nickolay, CEO—Heavy Duty Gas Turbines & Aeroderivatives for GE Vernova, will sit down with POWER Senior Editor Darrell Proctor at the event on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 4 p.m., for a discussion of the company’s technology and the future of gas-fired power generation.

The agreement announced October 27 includes existing permits, land control, and transmission interconnection. The companies said they expect the project, a two-phase, gas-fueled electric-generation facility with more than 1.2 GW of generation capacity,, will enter commercial operation as soon as 2029. Officials in a news release on Monday said the “project will utilize lower-carbon natural gas and recovered steam in a combined-cycle configuration to deliver flexible, more sustainable energy to the MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator] grid.”

“Advanced Power’s expertise is delivering complex, modern power projects on time and on budget, while navigating the hurdles that emerge in a changing energy landscape,” said Tom Spang, CEO of Advanced Power. Spang told POWER, “Long equipment lead times have become one of those challenges, yet through disciplined planning, rigorous due diligence, and structured execution, we continue to develop facilities that generate reliable power and help empower communities.”

Bechtel Serves as EPC Lead

Bechtel Infrastructure & Power Corp. will serve as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor for the facility.

“Developing these grid-scale generation projects typically takes years, and this agreement with GE Vernova marks a pivotal milestone in the execution of a project that began in 2021,” said Spang. “Maple Creek will soon be ready to deliver reliable, dispatchable power to one of the fastest-growing load centers in the country. Advanced Power’s depth of experience in developing CCGT [combined-cycle gas turbine] facilities will strive to deliver a project designed for speed, flexibility, and performance—exactly what Indiana utilities and hyperscalers need to support growing demands for power and grid reliability.”

The companies noted that “securing GE Vernova’s power generation equipment eliminates a critical development risk: long-lead equipment procurement, at a time when global supply chain constraints continue to challenge other new generation projects. MISO projects an increase of up to 30 gigawatts [GW] in additional demand over the next decade, driven by ongoing factors such as the onshoring of manufacturing, continued electrification of the economy, and now, advancements in centers in the digital economy. We believe Maple Creek is uniquely positioned to meet this surge with scalable, lower-carbon power sooner than other proposed projects.”

“GE Vernova is honored that Advanced Power and BDC Power Holdings LLC have selected to develop the Maple Creek project with our most advanced 7HA.03 gas turbine technology, a testament to our commitment to helping accelerate new generation capacity to support demand growth in the United States,” said Dave Ross, president and CEO of GE Vernova’s Gas Power business in the Americas.

Maple Creek is part of Advanced Power’s broader development portfolio, which includes more than 12 GW of thermal and renewable generation projects and more than 9 GWh of energy storage. Click here to learn more about Advanced Power’s projects in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

ROCK HILL, S.C., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD) and the Saudi Arabian Industrial Investments Company (Dussur) owned by the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Aramco, and SABIC, established the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Company (NAMI) in 2022 to help enable Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 Program. NAMI brings world class metal and polymer 3D printing and application expertise to the Kingdom with the support of 3D Systems’ advanced hardware solutions, materials and applications.

In commenting on the progress 3D Systems is making in Saudi Arabia, Dr. Jeffrey Graves, president and CEO of 3D Systems said, “In Saudi Arabia, we’re witnessing a thoughtful yet rapid transformation across every aspect of the economy and society. Vision 2030, launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is building a vibrant, diverse, and innovative economy anchored by a strong local manufacturing base. This creates tremendous opportunities for disruptive technologies like 3D printing to thrive. Through our partnership with Dussur, we’re proud to contribute to this progress by bringing advanced application expertise and additive manufacturing technologies into the Kingdom. With NAMI, we can deliver everything from component manufacturing to the sale and servicing of printer fleets, enabling OEMs to localize production. Our ambition is to be a key technology partner supporting the Kingdom’s industrial future. We’re especially pleased to welcome Saudi Electric Company as a partner in our joint venture and both Lockheed Martin and MIF as key customers for NAMI moving forward.”

[TITLE]Jamie Dimon Declares JPMorgan Chase's $2B AI Investment 'Paid For Itself,' Warns 'There'll Be Fewer Jobs In Certain Functions':
[TEXT]

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s $2 billion annual investment in artificial intelligence has already "paid for itself," according to CEO Jamie Dimon.

AI now drives major savings and operates across nearly every business line of the nation's largest bank, Dimon told Bloomberg TV earlier this month.

Big Payoff For Big Investment

The bank has been investing in AI since 2012 — long before the recent boom — and now spends about $2 billion a year. Dimon told Bloomberg, "We have shown that for $2 billion of expense, we have about $2 billion of benefit."

According to Dimon, roughly 150,000 employees now use JPMorgan's in-house AI model weekly to summarize reports, conduct research and analyze contracts. He also said these gains are "just the tip of the iceberg," with hundreds of use cases already running — from fraud detection to risk management.

AI's Impact On Jobs And Roles

"People shouldn't put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs," Dimon told Bloomberg, warning that AI adoption will reshape the workforce. He said automation is already streamlining operations across the bank and added that "there'll be fewer jobs in certain functions," while emphasizing the importance of retraining and redeployment.

CFO Jeremy Barnum said during the bank's annual investor presentation in May that the firm is "asking people to resist headcount growth where possible" while still hiring in "high-certainty areas."

Expanding Its Reach Amid Uncertainty

JPMorgan recently announced a 10-year plan to facilitate and finance roughly $1.5 trillion in domestic industries critical to U.S. economic and national security. The effort will deploy up to $10 billion in direct equity and venture-capital investments and target four strategic pillars — supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience, and frontier and strategic technologies such as AI and quantum computing.

Dimon added that the goal is to reduce America's dependence on foreign suppliers for critical materials and manufacturing.
