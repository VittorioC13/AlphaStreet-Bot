[TITLE]Feature: Rising Blood Pressure In The Young: A Growing Concern:
[TEXT]
For decades, hypertension commonly known as high blood pressure was regarded as a disease of old age. That perception is rapidly changing. Across the world, health experts are warning that hypertension is creeping into younger populations at an alarming rate, quietly setting the stage for a future public health crisis.

Once seen as a condition of the 50s and 60s, high blood pressure is now striking people in their 20s and 30s, and in some cases, even teenagers. The global rise among young adults is driven by a perfect storm of factors: unhealthy diets, obesity, lack of physical activity, excessive alcohol and energy drink consumption, chronic stress, and inadequate sleep.

A Global Wake-Up Call

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1.4 billion people worldwide are living with hypertension one in every three adults. Worryingly, over half of them do not know they have the condition. While it has traditionally been prevalent among older adults, new research shows that 20% of adults aged 20–39 years already have elevated blood pressure, and that figure continues to climb each year.

In high-income countries such as the United States, hypertension among young adults has more than doubled in the last 20 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that one in five adults aged 18–39 is now hypertensive. Meanwhile, data from Asia and Europe mirror the same pattern young people leading fast-paced, high-stress lives, consuming more processed foods and moving less.

This global shift, experts warn, is a ticking time bomb. Young people are now living longer with elevated blood pressure, which means the long-term damage to their organs especially the heart, kidneys, and brain will be more extensive by the time they reach middle age.

Sub-Saharan Africa’s Double Burden

In Africa, the challenge is twofold. The continent continues to grapple with infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis while facing an accelerating rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The WHO estimates that more than 40% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa live with hypertension, many of whom are undiagnosed or untreated.

Researchers have found that hypertension is appearing earlier among African populations than in other regions, often between the ages of 25 and 35. This early onset increases the likelihood of complications such as stroke and kidney failure later in life.

Several factors are fueling this surge. Rapid urbanization has brought changes in diet and lifestyle. Traditional diets rich in grains, fruits, and vegetables are being replaced by fast foods high in salt, saturated fats, and sugar. Urban residents spend long hours in traffic or behind desks, leading to physical inactivity. In many African cities, including Accra, Lagos, and Nairobi, high living costs and work stress compound the problem.

The Situation in Ghana

Ghana mirrors this troubling regional pattern. The Ghana Health Service (GHS) reports that

[TITLE]Creating balance in India-EU FTA:
[TEXT]
While US tariffs have hogged headlines, the end of 2025 deadline for India-EU Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) looms large. India has consistently sought a “balanced and mutually beneficial” FTA. That balance is key. Potential headlines such as “EU reduces tariffs on 99 per cent of goods, India on 94 per cent” hide the fact that nearly 80 per cent of Indian exports to the EU even now face miniscule tariffs below 1 per cent. The only sector with genuine scope for gains is textiles, now under pressure from US tariffs. Agri-goods look less promising since EU tariffs are complicated, and access based on shifting standards.

Since talks resumed, the EU has added several new chapters on non-trade areas such as state-owned enterprises, energy, transparency, sustainable food systems, and anti-corruption. These go far beyond the single “Trade and Sustainable Development” chapter that existed before 2013. India has resisted these demands.

A Chief Trade Enforcement Officer has been recently appointed in Brussels to monitor compliance. India has no comparable structure, creating an inevitable asymmetry.

The EU is increasingly aggressive in enforcing its FTAs. It now pressures partners on issues ranging from coal use to alcohol taxes and labour laws. Countries such as Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Canada have been forced to amend domestic laws and ratify ILO conventions because of EU demands.

Crafting a balance

Since the BTIA will tilt towards the EU both in market access and in non-trade commitments, India requires balancing provisions to find compelling value in the BTIA. Some possible asks in non-trade issues are:

Investment-linked trade access: EU investment in green sectors under India’s Paris Agreement commitments should be tied to tariff concessions. Real climate finance has been missing, while EU companies spend crores on doubtful carbon credits claiming green action. Such commitments will enable to act as the climate leader in deed.

Regulatory carve-outs: India’s exports must be shielded from excessive EU environmental rules such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the Deforestation Regulation, and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. These rules are already straining EU industry, especially SMEs, and risk pushing production outside Europe. The EU has carved out exemptions for the US. Granting exemptions to the biggest polluter on the one hand, and pushing developing country imports to submit to one-sided regulatory burdens, will prove a dampener on whatever little tariff advantage is gained through the BTIA

Equal say in rule changes: India should be consulted whenever EU regulations affecting its exports are amended. Brussels is keen on influencing public policy of its partner countries through its market-muscle. Consultations built into the FTA would obviate the constant tussle with each relevant partner. For instance, CBAM challenged formally and informally; EUDR challenged formally and so on.

Safeguards in dispute settlement: Any attempt by the EU to raise non-trade issues which are outside the DS (Dispute Settlement) chapter should allow India to reverse trade concessions. While EU avers one thing in the texts, it begins consultations/disputes on areas that were never meant for being disputed. Korea was quite surprised with the auto dispute based on labour rights. Vietnam would have to lower taxes on alcohol, or that it would have to change its labour laws so fundamentally pursuant to the FTA.

Such guardrails would prevent EU’s non-state actors from misusing FTA texts with innovative interpretations and increase trust in EU.

Health emergencies: EU must agree to TRIPS waivers for medicines and vaccines in crises, necessary for the health of populations of the entire global south. The commitment should entail an automatic TRIPS waiver for related pharmaceutical products from EU companies once a pandemic has been declared by the WHO.

Consumption cuts: The EU should commit to per capita consumption cuts in line with India’s LiFE principles, for fundamental climate action. EU’s per capita consumption is way above global averages. Social cost of carbon in $220 per tonne of carbon US Environmental Protection Agency.

Climate finance: EU promises on climate finance must be implemented and be subject to review. In 2023 EU applied only €0.1 billion of its ETS (Emissions Trading System) €46.7 billion revenues on international finance. If tied to trade and market access, EU will have to prioritise its climate finance promises. That will help EU stand true to its promises and in its bid to be seen as the chief global actor in the arena of climate change. Investment in India will give much better returns in terms of emissions reduction.

A narrowing window

The BTIA has been under negotiation for nearly 20 years. India has moved forward, while the EU has lost ground both in India’s market and in its own manufacturing strength. The imbalance is stark: India gives the EU a growing market, while EU’s own growth is under question.

By constantly expanding the non-trade agenda and dragging talks for almost two decades, the EU has lost valuable market share in India. In 2010, its share of India’s imports was almost 12 per cent. By 2025 it had dropped to just over 8 per cent, while China’s rose sharply to over 15 per cent. At the same time, India’s own manufacturing has strengthened, while Europe’s reliance on China has only grown.

If EU industry and policymakers continue to chase regulatory overreach, they may miss out altogether. For Europe, the smartest move now is to recognise how much the ground has shifted, accept a fair deal, and conclude the agreement with the world’s fastest-growing economy.

The shophouses of Penang, Malaysia, have long been admired from the outside. Shane Low wanted travelers to experience what they're like inside, too.

He grew up in a family involved in property development and was inspired by how countries like Japan had reimagined traditional homes into guest accommodations.

He's now doing the same in Penang's George Town — a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2008.

The rows of shophouses in George Town, Penang's capital, are what give the city its unmistakable character. Amanda Goh for Business Insider.

In 2023, Low started Aayu Homes, a property management company, with his wife, Chong Xin Pei, an architectural designer. His childhood friend, Andy Ooi, joined the company a year later and oversees daily operations and business development.

"We felt that whenever you travel, staying in something very local is more authentic than staying in high-end hotels," Low, 33, told Business Insider.

[TITLE]US tariffs severely hit India's textile exporters; industry seeks moratorium, raw material reforms: CITI survey:
[TEXT]
India's textile and apparel exporters are facing severe disruptions following the United States' imposition of a 50 per cent additional tariff, according to a nationwide survey conducted by the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI). The survey revealed that the US, which accounts for India's 28 per cent of total textile and apparel shipments, has become significantly less accessible due to the steep tariff structure, eroding India's export competitiveness.

Nearly one-third of the respondents reported a turnover decline of more than 50 per cent following the tariff increase. The major contributing factors included requests for price discounts from US buyers (30 per cent), order cancellations or postponements (25 per cent), and a reduction in order volumes (20 per cent). Around 85 per cent of the firms reported inventory build-up due to declining orders, while two-thirds were compelled to offer discounts, mostly around 25 per cent, to retain business in the US market.

Liquidity pressures have intensified sharply, with 82 per cent of respondents citing extended credit cycles, and more than half reporting an increase of three to six months. Around 40 per cent noted that their working capital requirements had risen by over 30 per cent, reflecting severe cash flow challenges across the value chain. More than half of the respondents urged the government to announce a moratorium on repayment of existing loans, while 42 per cent recommended collateral-free loans to ease the financial burden.

[TITLE]Tiruppur’s textile heroes: How small firms are fighting 50% US tariffs:
[TEXT]
Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu: It was not easy for N.C. John Garments Pvt. Ltd, a tiny textile manufacturer with ₹30 crore in revenue, to become a supplier to Walt Disney Company. Negotiations stretched for over three years; many apparel samples were exchanged. The company’s sustainable manufacturing efforts worked in the end—it uses natural and recycled raw material and operates its plant entirely on renewable energy.

The American entertainment giant placed its first order with this Tiruppur-based company earlier this year.

For Alexander Job Neroth, N.C. John Garments’ director, the joy was short-lived.

On 27 August, US President Donald Trump punished India for buying Russian oil, slapping additional tariffs on textile imports and taking the rate up to 50%. The high tariffs made Indian textile exports uncompetitive compared to other Asian economies such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia and Sri Lanka.

“We did not anticipate such high tariffs," said Neroth. But he couldn’t let the Walt Disney order slip through as well. “I renegotiated with the buyer, offered a large discount, and continued to supply at wafer thin margins," he added.

This narrative runs across all companies in the town, known as India’s knitwear capital. As much as 34% of Tiruppur’s ₹44,747 crore in exports are generated from the US.

While Indian exporters do not want to lose their customers, the buyers cannot switch suppliers right away. In the minimum, it takes at least 90 days for buyers to vet new suppliers and then place orders. So, both the sides, in many cases, have re-negotiated, keeping supplies intact, said A. Sakthivel, honorary chairman, Tiruppur Exporters Association, an industry body. Some buyers have even agreed to share the losses.

That explains why there is no visible sign of gloom and doom in the town. Small trucks zig-zag the cluster carrying materials for processing. And scores of workers remain busy stitching t-shirts and other garments. Elsewhere, malls and shopping centres brim with people; theatres appear to be running full with hundreds of people queuing up for films like Kantara: Chapter 1 and Idly Kadai. Hotels reported no significant fall in occupancy rates—all underlining the fact that economic activity still remains robust in Tiruppur as of October first week.

But this normalcy masks a problem. The ability of the town’s exporters, mostly small companies like N.C. John Garments, to bear the loss is limited. Banks, some say, have already begun to pile on the pressure. Also, buyers would not share the loss for too long—they could shift to other countries if tariffs don’t change.

While the impact appears manageable now, things could turn for the worse, going ahead, industrialists warn. Industry associations, particularly, appear more alarmed.

“The pain started when the first 25% tariff was imposed by the US. With the additional 25%, we are today in the intensive care unit (ICU) but fighting," said Kumar Duraiswamy, joint secretary, Tiruppur Exporters Association. “If this continues for some more time without any government support, we will slip into a coma."

On 27 August, US President Donald Trump punished India for buying Russian oil, slapping additional tariffs on textile imports and taking the rate up to 50%.

Job losses so far have been minimal. But that could change post-Diwali, when existing orders are exhausted. Many units have cut down the number of days they operate. Migrant workers who go home for Diwali may be asked to not return till companies have more visibility.

Tiruppur is a spectacularly resilient cluster—the town has seen through many headwinds, be it the covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, or even the Red Sea crisis in recent years. But the tariff blow is a different, possibly harder test. If companies here can hold on, for a few months more, there could be light at the end of the tunnel. More on this later.

20% discount

Indian manufacturers simply can’t ignore the US market when it comes to textiles. Any exporter who wants to grow eyes it, said V. Dinesh Kumar, a first generation entrepreneur. The US imports more than what the 27 European Union (EU) member states buy together. “Volumes are huge and products are basic items, not fashionable ones that Europe typically orders," he added.

Orders from the US are typically large as well—as much as 100,000 pieces at a time. This means higher yarn procurement, more work for spinning, knitting and dyeing units. “Though shipments to the US are 34% of Tiruppur’s exports in value terms, the economic impact through job creation is much more," Kumar said.

In April this year, he bagged a US customer. He bought the raw materials in June and the samples were approved by July. Production was

Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing reported double-digit revenue and profit growth in North America in the current fiscal year, as its U.S. expansion defied tariff volatility sparked by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

The Japanese clothing retailer, known for its functional basics including T-shirts, sweatpants and down jackets, saw North America revenue and business profit grow 24.5% and 35.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended August 2025, according to its earnings statement on Thursday.

That performance led robust international gains across Europe, Southeast Asia and South Korea, helping offset a continued slump in China — long Fast Retailing’s largest overseas market — where consumer demand has remained weak since the COVID-19 pandemic.

[TITLE]Lezzat Launches Amazon Europe Expansion Services as US Amazon Sellers Seek Global Growth:
[TEXT]
Reading, UK, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lezzat, one of UK’s oldest Amazon full-service agencies, has announced the launch of its 2026 Amazon Europe Expansion services, a comprehensive program designed to help mature US Amazon sellers establish a strong presence across Europe’s rapidly expanding Amazon marketplaces. The program is strategically timed to align with Amazon’s continued investment in logistics, infrastructure, and marketplace development across the continent, including new rollouts in Ireland and expanded same-day delivery coverage across major European cities.

The new initiative provides a structured pathway for US Amazon sellers seeking to diversify their sales beyond the saturated US market. Europe’s e-commerce sector offers multiple developed yet underpenetrated markets with strong consumer trust and consistent online shopping demand. By addressing critical challenges such as VAT compliance, marketplace localization, and logistics coordination, Lezzat enables sellers to scale internationally with clarity and minimize the risks typically associated with cross-border selling.

“Less than one percent of US Amazon sellers are currently active in Europe, despite the region including Germany – Amazon’s second-largest global marketplace that’s constantly expanding,” said Alexandros Karagiannis, Director at Lezzat. “Our program bridges that gap by removing the barriers that often make international expansion seem unattainable. For ambitious brands, this is an extraordinary opportunity to capture growth in markets where competition remains thin.”

A Timely Expansion Opportunity

Lezzat’s 2026 Amazon Europe Expansion service provides sellers with the expertise, infrastructure, and on-the-ground support needed to navigate the full-scope of cross-border e-commerce. It covers every aspect of international Amazon growth, offering end-to-end support that allows sellers to focus on scaling their brand while the agency manages compliance and operational demands.

Coordinated cross-border logistics, stock allocation, and cross-border fulfillment strategies to prevent delays and optimize cost efficiency. Review and Reputation Management: Continuous monitoring and response strategies to help sellers build trust and long-term credibility with European customers.

“Our goal is to make international growth attainable and sustainable,” added Karagiannis. “Many sellers underestimate how fragmented the European landscape can be. By centralizing all the moving parts – compliance, operations, and marketing – we’re helping them focus on what really matters: scaling their brand.”

Supporting Sellers from Strategy to Execution

Lezzat’s team brings together experienced Amazon sellers, strategists, and multilingual marketing professionals who understand the operational realities of scaling internationally. They work closely with clients to manage the complexities of cross-border e-commerce freeing them from operational bottlenecks and ensuring consistency in branding, compliance, and customer engagement across regions.

“Early expansion into Amazon Europe positions sellers for long-term competitive advantage,” added Karagiannis. “With Amazon continuing to grow its footprint, the sellers who act early will not only diversify and protect their businesses but will also secure positions of strength in markets that continue to grow year after year.”

This major grocery store distribution win with Southeastern Grocers (SEG), the #19 grocery retailer in the United States, comes at a pivotal time for American Rebel as it enters the heart of the spring reset cycle — when retail buyers finalize key shelf space decisions for the upcoming year.

“This milestone with Southeastern Grocers represents a transformational leap forward for American Rebel Light Beer and a clear validation of the retail strategy we laid out last summer,” said Andy Ross, CEO of American Rebel Holdings, Inc. “Securing placement across 416 stores with one of America’s top grocery chains not only accelerates our path to meaningful revenue growth but also positions American Rebel as a scalable, national player in the $100+ billion U.S. light beer market. We’re executing against a long-term plan designed to build shareholder value — expanding distribution, increasing brand visibility, and capturing market share in a category hungry for innovation and authenticity.”

American Rebel Light Beer wasn’t brewed to blend in — it was built for patriotic consumers who believe in American values and want a beer that reflects their way of life. This retail win opens the door for additional product placement for American Rebel Light Beer across the Southeastern U.S.A., where American Rebel’s message of freedom, bold taste, and unapologetic patriotism resonates loud and clear.

“This isn’t just a win — it’s a launchpad,” added Todd Porter, President of American Rebel Beverage. “SEG gives us scale, visibility, and access to consumers who share our values. With 416 stores across five states, we’re building real momentum and laying the foundation for long-term growth and continued rapid retail expansion.”

Initial Product Lineup – American Rebel Light Beer

As part of the Southeastern Grocers rollout, American Rebel will introduce two flagship SKUs designed to maximize consumer trial, drive repeat purchase, and establish strong shelf presence across the light beer category:

American Rebel Light Lager 12 Pack, 12oz Can

American Rebel Light Lager 12pk, 16oz Can

Continued Execution of the American Rebel Beverage Strategic Retail Roadmap

The achievement builds directly on the Company’s July 2025 strategic retail announcement, in which American Rebel outlined a clear roadmap to scale beyond the independent channel. That strategy — focused on accelerating sales velocity, expanding brand visibility, and leveraging spring and fall reset windows — has fueled significant momentum heading into 2026.

In the first half of 2025 alone, American Rebel Light Beer secured over 1,100 independent retail accounts, which now account for more than 57% of total sales. That independent footprint laid the foundation for larger retail conversations, demonstrating strong consumer demand and proven sell-through metrics that have now been translated into a top-tier grocery partnership.

“We said back in July that reset season is where shelf space gets decided — and this win with Southeastern Grocers proves that strategy works,” said Pamela Turner, National Account Manager for American Rebel Light Beer. “Independent velocity, brand advocacy, and consumer enthusiasm have positioned us as a must-carry product heading into 2026. We’re now turning that momentum into significant grocery placement, expanding access to millions of consumers in one of the country’s most competitive beer markets.”

Existing Industry Strategic Partnerships Fuel Scalable Growth for American Rebel Light Beer

American Rebel’s ability to execute at scale is supported by its production and supply chain partnerships with AlcSource and City Brewing Company — two industry leaders that enable the Company to meet rising demand efficiently and consistently.

Through AlcSource’s vertically integrated beverage development and sourcing platform, American Rebel Light Beer leverages advanced production capabilities, quality control, and nationwide logistics support. City Brewing’s large-scale contract brewing network further enhances capacity and flexibility, allowing the Company to fulfill large retail orders and maintain on-shelf availability as distribution grows.

“Partnerships with AlcSource and City Brewing are fundamental to our ability to execute at this level,” added Ross. “They ensure that we can deliver exceptional quality at scale and capitalize on every new retail opportunity — from local independents to major national chains. This new distribution deal is more than a logistics win — it’s a milestone for our patriotic fans across America who have been waiting to see American Rebel Light Beer on the shelves of their local grocery store. This is a major retail victory not just for us as a company, but for every freedom-loving customer who believes in what our brand stands for.”

American Rebel Light Beer Positioned for Continued Rapid Expansion

With this latest retail addition, American Rebel Light Beer now boasts a significantly expanded grocery footprint across the southeastern U.S., complementing its existing independent, convenience, and on-premise distribution base. The Company expects the Southeastern Grocers rollout to materially enhance brand visibility, consumer trial, and market share growth as it continues pursuing additional chain authorizations and geographic expansion throughout 2026.

“We’re just getting started,” added Ross. “This is the first of several major chain announcements we expect over the next 12 months. Our retail partners are responding to strong consumer pull, and our team is executing on the plan we laid out last summer — with measurable results for our shareholders.”
