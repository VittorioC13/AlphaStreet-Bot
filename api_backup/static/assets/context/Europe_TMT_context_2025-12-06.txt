The tension between decentralized finance and traditional Wall Street players resurfaced this week after Uniswap founder Hayden Adams publicly accused Citadel Securities of influencing U.S. regulators to impose stricter rules on the DeFi sector.

Adams’ comments, shared across social media, sparked a wide-ranging debate over who should be considered a financial intermediary in blockchain-based markets, and whether the rules of traditional finance should apply to open-source developers.

Adams claimed that Citadel, led by CEO Ken Griffin, has been lobbying the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to classify DeFi developers, validators, liquidity providers and even front-end operators as broker-dealers.

Citadel’s Filing Raises Concerns Over Tokenized Markets

At the center of the dispute is Citadel’s December 2 filing to the SEC. The document argues that many blockchain-based systems effectively bring together buyers and sellers in ways that resemble traditional exchanges.

As such, Citadel says they should be regulated under the same standards, even if those systems operate through smart contracts rather than centralized infrastructure.

Citadel warned that tokenized U.S. equities trading on DeFi platforms could create a “shadow equity market” outside the national market system, reducing regulatory oversight and fragmenting liquidity.

The firm’s letter also rejects the idea that technology differences justify regulatory exemptions, insisting that “the same activity should face the same rules” regardless of whether it is powered by algorithms or legacy systems.

DeFi advocates counter that this perspective ignores the design of decentralized protocols, which can function without centralized control and often rely on open-source contributions rather than corporate governance.

Adams Pushes Back Against “Fair Access” Claims

Adams criticized Citadel’s assertion that DeFi systems cannot provide “fair access,” calling the argument inconsistent with how traditional market makers operate. He argued that open-source protocols can lower barriers to participation, unlike centralized trading venues where access is limited by intermediaries.

Developers and community members echoed this point, noting that the DeFi ecosystem encompasses a broad range of models, from fully permissionless exchanges to platforms that rely on more centralized components.

Some community voices added that regulatory conversations often lack clarity because “DeFi” itself encompasses many different structures.

Regulatory Pressure Builds as SEC Signals Broader Scrutiny

The exchange comes at a time when the SEC has repeatedly taken enforcement action against DeFi teams. The agency has emphasized that it assesses economic realities rather than decentralization labels, citing past cases such as the Rari Capital settlement in 2024.

If regulators adopt Citadel’s framing, entities involved in developing or maintaining DeFi protocols could face registration requirements designed for traditional broker-dealers.

Industry participants warn that such a shift could make open-source projects difficult to operate, raising questions

[TITLE]NCC Vows Stronger Action to Combat Piracy in Nigeria:
[TEXT]
The Director-General of the Nigerian Copyright Commission, Dr John Asein, has reiterated the commission’s commitment to combating piracy.

The DG spoke on Thursday during the Nigeria Publishers Association’s diamond jubilee and AGM, held at the Lekan Are Hall, Kakanfo Inn and Conference Centre, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.

Asein stated that NCC had expanded awareness campaigns, strengthened regulatory frameworks, and scaled up operations of its Special Taskforce to curb piracy both online and offline, in line with the Copyright Act 2022.

He said, “NCC had expanded awareness campaigns, strengthened regulatory frameworks and scaled up operations of its Special Taskforce to curb piracy both online and offline, in line with the Copyright Act 2022.”

Speaking at the occasion, the Chairman, Solomon Adeleke, said publishers have been playing a crucial role in preserving intellectual property and supporting learning at all levels. However, he noted that abrupt changes in education policies have often resulted in losses for publishers who invested heavily in textbooks.

He stressed the need for consistent consultations with the association before policy formulation or curriculum review. Adeleke, who described book piracy as a major threat to creativity and industry growth, advocated stricter enforcement of existing copyright laws to protect publishers and authors and ensure fair returns on investments.

He commended the resilience of publishers despite high production costs and economic challenges, adding that the sector deserved government support because of its importance to Nigeria’s knowledge economy.

Delivering the keynote speech, the Secretary-General of the Pan-African Writers Association, Dr Wale Okediran, traced the evolution of publishing in Nigeria and said technological innovation, while expanding access to books, also introduced quality control challenges, particularly within self-publishing, urging collaboration to maintain professional standards.

In his address, the 25th President and Chairman of the NPA Council, Mr Dauda, said the association had consistently promoted quality education through the production of affordable instructional materials aligned with approved curricula. He appealed to education authorities to review the implementation of proposed curriculum changes, urging that the scrapping of some subjects be phased with a transition period of at least two years.

Additionally, Dauda suggested that the new curriculum should commence from the 2026/2027 academic session for primary one, with other classes joining progressively, to ensure the timely availability of relevant textbooks nationwide.

The Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, Dr Kingsley Udeh, represented by the Acting Director-General, Dr Peter Oluwafisoye, urged NPA to sustain efforts toward making literacy and education more accessible.

In her remarks, the Executive Director of the Universal Basic Education Commission, Mrs Aisha Garba, represented by Mrs Zainab Abubakar, lauded the association’s six decades of impact and encouraged members to keep evolving with changing technologies.

The celebration featured awards for excellence and meritorious service to notable industry stakeholders, including NCC DG, Dr Asein; the Managing Director of Booksellers Limited, Dr Kolade Mosuro; and former NPA President, Mr Samuel Kolawole.

[TITLE]Digital trade in Africa can cut costs by 30% says Afreximban:
[TEXT]
The African Export Import Bank Group Chief Economist and Managing Director of Research and Trade Intelligence, Yemi Kale, says digital trade systems can reduce transaction costs across Africa by as much as 30 per cent, a shift he described as essential to unlocking the continent’s competitiveness and lifting barriers that have held intra-African trade at low levels for decades.

Kale made the point on Thursday at a forum on trade intelligence and digital innovation held at the Afreximbank Africa Trade Centre in Abuja.

He said research had shown that “digital trade platforms can reduce transaction costs by up to at least 30 per cent”, adding that such efficiencies were no longer optional for African economies facing high logistics costs, fragmented markets, and slow cross-border payment processes.

Kale told participants that Africa stood at “a defining inflection point in its economic trajectory”, noting that the African Continental Free Trade Area had created a $3.4tn unified market of over 1.3 billion people.

However, he warned that integration alone would not deliver transformation unless digital systems were deployed at scale to solve long-standing structural problems.

According to him, intra-African trade still hovers between 15 and 18 per cent, far below Europe’s 60 per cent and Asia’s 40 per cent.

He said this gap was rooted in “fragmented markets that function in silos, high transaction and logistics costs that erode competitiveness, gaps in trade-related data and intelligence, and persistent cross-border payment frictions”.

Kale explained that digital technologies were already reshaping value chains globally and demonstrated how African economies could benefit from similar adoption.

He cited Rwanda’s digital single window, which “reduced export processing time by more than 90 per cent”, and the rise of mobile money systems processing more than $800bn annually as proof of what was possible when innovation meets trade.

He added that the African Payments and Settlement System was projected to save the continent billions by enabling cross-border payments in local currencies, removing one of the biggest frictions in regional commerce.

“Digital innovation is not just the engine of trade. It is the new highway on which African commerce will travel,” he said, stressing that early adopters would shape the continent’s competitive future.

Kale argued that digital transformation also democratises access for small businesses, which make up over 90 per cent of African enterprises. He recalled the example of a young leather-goods entrepreneur from Kano who struggled with export bottlenecks for years until she switched to digital trade platforms and digital payment tools.

“Her world changed almost overnight,” he said, noting that she now exports to Rwanda, Côte d’Ivoire, and Europe and employs more than 25 people. He said such stories showed how digital systems could convert local talent into continental and global opportunities, but warned that the impact would depend on the strength of the innovation ecosystem.

“Trade does not flourish in isolation. It thrives within ecosystems that enable ideas to grow and enterprises to scale,” he added. Kale described Nigeria’s youthful tech community as a major strategic asset, with 65 per cent of the population under 25.

He said young Nigerians were already “founding technology startups, writing software codes and shaping entirely new industries”, positioning the country to lead Africa’s digitally enabled trade expansion if infrastructure, regulation, skills, and finance keep pace.

He also highlighted Afreximbank’s ongoing work, including the Africa Trade Gateway, which integrates trade information, due diligence tools, secure payment systems, and market insights, and the network of Africa Trade Centres being developed across the continent.

The Abuja centre, he said, was designed as “a hub of innovation, integration and investment”, bringing under one roof conference facilities, SME incubation spaces, trade intelligence services and access to digital infrastructure.

Kale also urged African businesses and institutions to commit to digital transformation and collaboration. “If we are bold and forward-looking, Africa will not only participate in the global economy but will help to shape it,” he said.

He added that reducing costs, easing payments, and expanding access to market intelligence were critical steps if the continent was to unlock the full promise of the AfCFTA and allow its entrepreneurs to compete confidently on the world stage.

Also speaking, the Manager of Real Estate and Administration at Afreximbank, Oluwaseun Alabi, said the Africa Trade Centre in Abuja was conceived not just as a regional office but as a one-stop trade hub providing integrated trade information, finance, and business facilities to catalyse intra-African and extra-African trade.

He explained that the Abuja centre is the first in a planned network of Africa Trade Centres across the continent and the Caribbean, with the next facility in Harare scheduled to open to the public in June 2026.

Alabi disclosed that the Abuja ATC cost over $100m, was delivered in 41 months, and has already recorded more than 47,500 visitors, 34 trade-focused events, and hundreds of trade enquiries since its commissioning on April 10, 2025.

He added that the building is the first LEED Platinum-certified facility in Nigeria, the second in West Africa, and the 19th in Africa, underscoring Afreximbank’s push for sustainable infrastructure.

He stressed that the ATC will serve as a practical link between buyers, sellers, service providers, governments, financial institutions, and the wider trade community while hosting key Afreximbank platforms such as PAPSS and the Mansa due diligence system to support businesses from information to finance.

REMARKS BY SHMUEL JONAS, CEO

IDT delivered consolidated revenue growth and record levels of gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. NRS led the top-line expansion, while all three of our growth segments reported strong bottom-line results. Our Traditional Communications segment again provided steady cash generation.

NRS recurring revenue increased 22% year-over-year, helping to drive a 35% increase in income from operations and a 33% increase in Adjusted EBITDA. This quarter we continued to launch and build-out innovative premium services – delivery integrations, couponing, and product data scan programs to name a few. Our premium offerings are becoming important growth drivers, and factored into the large increase in average recurring revenue per terminal* this quarter. There is tremendous opportunity for additional, long-term growth through innovation both in NRS’s current and in adjacent markets.

At BOSS Money, our digital channel continues to outperform retail, and that trend may accelerate as implementation of the new federal excise tax on cash remittances begins on January 1st. The Fintech segment’s income from operations and Adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled year-over-year, aided by BOSS Money’s increasing operating leverage and the enhanced profitability of other, smaller Fintech initiatives. Our push to integrate tailored AI and machine learning into BOSS Money customer service and fraud detection activities have helped to significantly improve unit economics. Looking ahead, we will soon introduce the first generation of the BOSS Wallet, enabling our U.S. customers to share cash and receive rewards.

During the quarter, net2phone began offering its AI agent to both our existing and new customers, and added our Coach AI solution at the quarter’s end. Increasingly, our customers are ordering multiple net2phone offerings to enhance their operations and streamline workflows. As a result, we have pivoted from stand-alone product offerings to holistic solutions comprised of multiple offerings tailored to customers’ communications and workflows. This approach plays to net2phone’s product and distribution strengths, and we are very excited

[TITLE]Mobilicom to Transition its ADSs to Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq in Line with Company’s U.S.-Based Global Growth Strategy:
[TEXT]
Ordinary shares will commence trading on Nasdaq on December 8, 2025

Benefits include facilitating eligibility for some core U.S. indices and ETFs that exclude ADRs, further broadening institutional and retail investor access

Offers broader access and ease of trading for retail investors, brokers, and institutions while also reducing costs for shareholders and Mobilicom

Palo Alto, California, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mobilicom Limited (Nasdaq: MOB, MOBBW) (“Mobilicom” or the “Company”), a provider of cybersecurity and robust solutions for drones and robotics, today announced its American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) will be transitioned to a direct listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market, effective at the opening of trading on December 8, 2025.

“For Mobilicom, this change reflects our commitment to making trading in our shares as accessible and efficient as possible for investors, as we execute on our U.S.-based growth strategy in the autonomous systems market,” said Oren Elkayam, CEO and Founder of Mobilicom. “Shareholders will benefit from direct ownership and a clearer path to U.S. index inclusion.”

Direct listing of U.S.-listed ordinary shares facilitate eligibility for certain core U.S. indices and ETFs that exclude ADRs, further broadening institutional and retail investor access.

The transition from ADSs to ordinary shares reflects the Company’s ongoing efforts to streamline its corporate structure and improve accessibility for U.S. investors. By eliminating the ADR program, Mobilicom removes associated administrative complexities and depositary fees, simplifies corporate actions, and strengthens the connection between the Company and its shareholders. The move also aligns Mobilicom with practices adopted by other global issuers, enhancing U.S. investor access and reducing operational frictions.

The American depository receipt program and the related Deposit Agreement are expected to terminate after market closes on December 5, 2025, in conjunction with a 1-for-275 reverse share split of the Company’s ordinary shares. At such time, the Company's ADSs will be mandatorily cancelled and the Company’s ordinary shares underlying the ADSs will be distributed to holders of the ADSs. Each holder of one ADS will receive one ordinary share of the Company. The Company expects its ordinary shares will be listed and commence trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the Company’s existing ticker symbol “MOB” when market opens on December 8, 2025, the trading day immediately after termination of the ADR program.

The Company's board of directors has determined that termination of the ADR program and listing of the ordinary shares directly is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.

ADS holders do not need to take any action to convert their holdings. The depositary bank responsible for the ADS program will provide guidance regarding the conversion process and the final cancellation of the ADSs.

[TITLE]Global Payments Inc. (GPN): A Bull Case Theory:
[TEXT]
We came across a bullish thesis on Global Payments Inc. on Value investing subreddit by logical-dreamer. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GPN. Global Payments Inc.'s share was trading at $75.76 as of November 28th. GPN’s trailing and forward P/E were 11.50 and 5.61 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Global Payments Inc. provides payment technology and software solutions for card, check, and digital-based payments in the Americas, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific. GPN has recently pulled back from around $84 to $74, creating what appears to be an attractive entry point given its solid fundamental performance.

The company delivered a mostly upbeat earnings print, with EPS rising roughly 12% year over year and revenue growing in the mid-single digits, demonstrating steady underlying demand. At current levels, the stock trades at a compelling 7–8× forward earnings and generates an estimated 12% free cash flow yield, suggesting meaningful value for long-term investors.

However, the pressure on the share price is driven largely by its sizeable debt load. With $13.6 billion of debt against an $18 billion market cap, the company is far more leveraged than its headline valuation implies. Rising interest costs are weighing on profitability, as roughly $600 million of interest expense consumed a notable portion of the company’s $2.5 billion in operating income. This leverage, combined with a moderating topline, has led investors to discount the stock despite otherwise stable fundamentals.

Still, Global Payments is actively positioning itself for long-term growth through its acquisition of EVO Payments, designed to accelerate its shift toward a more technology-enabled, software-centric business model. If execution improves and debt is gradually reduced, the current valuation could represent a compelling opportunity, given the company’s durable cash generation and potential for enhanced operating leverage once financing burdens ease.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Global Payments Inc. (GPN) by Excelsior Capital in November 2024, which highlighted steady EPS growth and strong long-term fundamentals. The company's stock price has depreciated approximately by 35.29% since our coverage. This is because the thesis didn’t fully play out amid market concerns. The thesis still stands as fundamentals remain solid. logical-dreamer shares a similar view but emphasizes the valuation reset.

Global Payments Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 57 hedge fund portfolios held GPN at the end of the second quarter which was 65 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of GPN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]Nexperia’s standoff puts a core part of the chip supply chain under strain — U.S export controls and red tape may threaten consumer continuity without governance:
[TEXT]
Nexperia’s position in the semiconductor space has rarely drawn mainstream attention. The Dutch-headquartered firm specializes in the kind of components that disappear into circuit boards by the billions. Yet, its devices sit inside automotive powertrains, industrial controllers, consumer chargers, and virtually every category of electronics.

When the Netherlands moved in October to suspend the authority of Nexperia’s Chinese ownership under its emergency economic-security rules, it set off a sequence of actions in Washington and Beijing, pushed European carmakers into a fresh scramble for parts, and raised wider questions about how long a firm with global roots can operate across competing jurisdictions without becoming a diplomatic flashpoint.

Nexperia was once part of Philips and later NXP, before being acquired privately by China’s Wingtech Technology in 2018. That transaction placed a European industrial supplier within a Chinese electronics conglomerate with links to government-backed investment programmes. Wingtech grew aggressively after the acquisition, and by 2025, Nexperia was producing roughly 110 billion parts per year across its fabs in Hamburg and Manchester and its assembly centres in Asia.

These were not cutting-edge processors, but high-volume power semiconductors, regulators, and discrete logic. They underpin far more sophisticated systems built by others. In sectors such as automotive, a vehicle can contain hundreds of these devices, and the failure of even one category of them cascades into production delays.

That backdrop set the scene for a major reaction when the U.S. added Wingtech to the Entity List in late 2024. The controls did not immediately apply to Nexperia, but Washington made clear that any effort to route restricted technology through its European subsidiary would be treated as a violation. The following summer, the U.S. introduced its “affiliates” rule, extending those restrictions to any majority-owned unit of a listed entity. That swept Nexperia into the same category.

On 30 September 2025, the Dutch government invoked the Emergency Goods Availability Act to prevent what it called the “possible relocation” of critical assets and to stabilise Nexperia’s operations inside the EU. The statute had been dormant for decades and had never been used for a semiconductor firm. It allowed The Hague to suspend the authority of Nexperia’s then-CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, who also founded Wingtech, and to transfer voting rights on behalf of the parent company to a court-appointed administrator while an investigation into management practices was opened.

Within days, the provisional measures were upheld by the Dutch courts, and the newly installed leadership halted shipments from Nexperia Europe to its Chinese arm, citing uncertainty over export compliance. Chinese state media responded by arguing that Europe was politicizing a commercial dispute. Beijing then introduced export restrictions on certain finished semiconductors produced by Nexperia’s Chinese subsidiaries and, crucially, on contract manufacturers that handled assembly for European-bound parts. The restrictions came with carve-outs only after several weeks of negotiation.

Several major carmakers warned of renewed shortages of basic power components. In 2021 and 2022, the automotive industry had already become a case study in how a lack of cents-worth parts could stall production of systems costing tens of thousands of dollars. This time, the shortages were rooted not in pandemic shutdowns but in the regulatory limbo created by overlapping national controls. Suppliers scrambling for substitute components reported lead times stretching into the following year. European regulators noted that Nexperia’s parts are embedded across hundreds of platforms, and a sudden loss of even a small share of output would propagate across multiple production lines.

A long build-up

The dispute did not materialise out of nowhere. Nexperia’s 2021 acquisition of Newport Wafer Fab in Wales had already drawn scrutiny from UK officials. Although the deal initially cleared without a review — the UK’s national-security screening regime had not yet begun — it was later called in under the National Security and Investment Act.

In late 2022, the UK ordered Nexperia to divest most of its stake under national security legislation. Nexperia appealed, saying it was "shocked" by the order and arguing that Newport was a mature-node facility with no access to sensitive R&D, and that its acquisition secured local jobs. The standoff remains unresolved. While the UK case is separate from the Dutch intervention, the two episodes show how a firm that once operated quietly across Europe has found itself pulled into a widening set of national priorities.

By 2025, that picture had shifted again. Chinese industrial policy had elevated Wingtech as a model of integration across design, manufacturing, and final assembly. European authorities, faced with their own efforts to strengthen chip supply under the EU Chips Act, regarded this consolidation with more caution. At the same time, the U.S. sought to close what it saw as gaps in its export-control regime. When China responded to the Dutch measures by restricting Nexperia’s outbound shipments, the overlap of these positions hardened.

What this means for the supply chain

The core technical challenge revealed by the Nexperia dispute is that the semiconductor supply chain remains deeply interdependent even in areas considered low risk. Power transistors, diodes, and level shifters do not sit at the centre of geopolitical strategy papers. They are manufactured on older processes, with tooling that predates the EUV era by decades. Because they are simple, they have long been viewed as interchangeable. The past four years have demonstrated that this assumption is fragile. Production is concentrated in a small number of companies, and for certain categories, Nexperia is one of only a handful of suppliers with the scale to support global automotive platforms.

Those characteristics complicate efforts to localise supply or insulate operations from political pressure. When the Dutch government intervened in Nexperia’s management, China’s countermeasures did not target rare earths or advanced lithography equipment, but the output of subcontracting facilities handling packaging and test. It was a reminder that the finishing stages of semiconductor production are often outsourced. Even when front-end wafer capacity sits in Europe, back-end work can be vulnerable to administrative decisions thousands of miles away.

The U.S. sanctions add a further layer. Under the affiliates rule, Nexperia could face the same restrictions as its parent on receiving U.S.-origin technology. This rule is currently suspended for a year as part of the U.S.-China trade deal, but there are no guarantees for the future.

A new normal for cross-border chipmakers?

The partial suspension of the Dutch order in November created space for negotiations, but it did not unwind the deeper issues. The court-appointed administrator remains in place while the mismanagement inquiry continues, and the U.S. has shown no sign of relaxing its sanctions.

China carved out exemptions for automotive-grade parts after weeks of pressure and a growing cash-flow risk, yet the episode highlighted how quickly supply can be weaponized in both directions. For companies in adjacent segments — analog components, sensors, power modules — it seems that ownership structures now carry operational risk, even for those that don’t handle cutting-edge or strategically important tech.

This is the environment in which Nexperia will operate for the foreseeable future. The firm has the manufacturing scale and customer base to remain central to global electronics, but its position between European regulators, a Chinese parent, and U.S. export controls has narrowed the room for manoeuvre.

The question is whether a long-term governance structure can emerge that satisfies all three camps while preserving the continuity that its customers depend on. Until that happens, the full implications of the 2025 intervention will continue to reverberate across one of the most fundamental layers of the semiconductor supply chain.

[TITLE]Why Analysts Say ASML Is the Top Semiconductor Pick Heading Into 2026:
[TEXT]
ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the AI Stocks in Focus This Week. On December 1, Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock with a €1,000.00 price target. The firm is optimistic on the stock driven by positive momentum for lithography demand.

Analysts have labeled ASML as its Top Pick in European semiconductors as demand strengthens across memory and logic, and new EUV tool cycles and DRAM transitions signal healthier margins heading into 2026.

DRAM cycle and foundry spending are anticipated to support ASML’s order book and sales through fiscal years 2026 and 2027. A recent Asia trip by the firm has further reinforced its belief regarding a memory supercycle and likely near-term upside for ASML’s orders.

Analysts have also highlighted "unprecedented memory demand" with limited DDR5 inventory visibility and DDR4 tightness. ASML is well-positioned to benefit from continued DRAM demand, including commodity DRAM, strong memory pricing, and DRAM technology transitions to HBM4.

It has also been confirmed that TSMC will add 3nm capacity in Taiwan instead of Japan. This implies increased foundry spending and is likely to translate into more 3600d shipments in fiscal year 2026 and provide near-term EUV sales upside for ASML.

ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) develops and sells advanced semiconductor equipment, including lithography, metrology, and inspection systems for chip manufacturing.

While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

[TITLE]AST SpaceMobile surges on 2 major expansion sites:
[TEXT]
AST SpaceMobile surges on 2 major expansion sites

The satellite company’s new Texas and Florida manufacturing facilities send stock soaring amid production plans

AST SpaceMobile delivered news Thursday that sent its stock climbing nearly 15%, proving that big bets on satellite manufacturing can capture Wall Street’s imagination. The space-based cellular connectivity company announced plans to establish two new production facilities that will dramatically scale up manufacturing of its next-generation BlueBird satellites, marking a significant expansion of American-based satellite production capabilities.

The stock traded up 14.96% by midday Thursday, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm that has seen the company’s shares swing from $52.20 to $70.58 over recent weeks. This volatility reflects both the speculative nature of space-based technology investments and growing confidence in AST SpaceMobile’s ability to execute on ambitious plans that could reshape how cellular connectivity reaches underserved areas globally.

1. Texas and Florida become satellite production hubs

AST SpaceMobile’s decision to plant manufacturing flags in both Texas and Florida represents more than simple geographic expansion. The company is betting heavily on US-based production for its BlueBird satellite constellation, devices designed to drastically improve space-based cellular broadband connectivity. These aren’t incremental improvements over existing technology. The new BlueBird satellites promise higher bandwidth capacity and faster data transmission speeds that could make reliable cellular service available in remote locations where traditional tower infrastructure proves economically unfeasible or physically impossible to build.

The mass production approach signals that AST SpaceMobile has moved beyond prototype phases into genuine commercial-scale operations. Establishing dedicated manufacturing sites rather than relying on contracted production demonstrates confidence in sustained demand and suggests the company expects to produce satellites at a pace that justifies the overhead costs of running its own facilities.

2. Investment banks raise their expectations

The expansion announcement comes amid a broader reassessment of AST SpaceMobile‘s value by major financial institutions. Deutsche Bank recently elevated its price target to $81 while maintaining a Buy rating, signaling strong conviction in the company’s growth trajectory. Clear Street went even further, boosting its target to $87 following positive third quarter results. These aren’t minor adjustments. They represent substantial votes of confidence from analysts who spend their careers evaluating space and telecommunications companies.

The timing of these upgrades alongside the manufacturing expansion suggests that institutional investors see concrete progress rather than empty promises. For a company operating in the speculative realm of space-based infrastructure, earning Buy ratings from established banks provides validation that can attract additional capital and partnership opportunities.

Financial reality behind the growth story

AST SpaceMobile’s third quarter 2025 financial results paint a picture of a company experiencing dramatic revenue growth while still navigating the expensive reality of building space infrastructure. Revenue jumped to $14.7 million from just $1.1 million the previous year, though the figure fell short of the $19.9 million analysts expected. The company posted a net loss of $0.45 per share, an improvement from the $1.10 loss per share a year earlier but still firmly in negative territory.

What provides comfort to investors despite continued losses is the company’s substantial financial cushion. With $3.2 billion in cash and liquidity, AST SpaceMobile possesses the resources needed to transform ambitious satellite deployment plans into operational reality. Building and launching satellites requires enormous upfront capital before generating returns, making that cash reserve essential for surviving the long runway to profitability.

European partnership adds international dimension

Beyond American manufacturing expansion, AST SpaceMobile‘s collaboration with telecommunications giant Vodafone adds an important international component to its strategy. The partnership will establish a Satellite Operations Centre in Germany, positioning Europe to assert greater digital independence through space-based connectivity infrastructure. This strategic decision fits within broader European Union goals of launching satellite networks focused on mobile broadband service, particularly for regions underserved by traditional cellular infrastructure.

Choosing Germany for this operations center brings AST SpaceMobile into alignment with European industrial policy while opening access to a market that values technological sovereignty. The Vodafone partnership also provides credibility, as established telecommunications companies typically conduct extensive due diligence before committing to infrastructure partnerships with emerging space technology firms.

What this means for the satellite industry

AST SpaceMobile’s expansion reflects broader momentum in the space-based connectivity sector. As launches become more affordable and satellite technology improves, the economic case for providing cellular service from orbit strengthens. Traditional telecommunications infrastructure requires massive capital expenditure to build tower networks across vast territories, particularly in rural or developing regions where subscriber density doesn’t justify the investment. Satellites bypass this limitation by providing coverage from above, potentially serving customers in locations that would never support ground-based infrastructure.

The company’s commitment to American manufacturing also aligns with national priorities around maintaining domestic space industry capabilities. As satellite constellations become increasingly important for both commercial and national security purposes, producing these systems domestically rather than relying on foreign manufacturing has strategic implications beyond simple business decisions.

[TITLE]Adtech company Teads is laying off staff 10 months after closing its merger with Outbrain:
[TEXT]
This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Adtech company Teads told employees this week that it's laying off staff across its global offices, Business Insider has learned.

A spokesperson for Teads confirmed the layoffs, adding that they affected less than 10% of the company's head count. They declined to provide further comment. Teads had roughly 1,800 employees as of November.

The news comes roughly 10 months after Outbrain, the adtech company best known for its content recommendation widgets, closed its $900 million acquisition of Teads from the European telecommunications giant Altice. Though Outbrain was the acquirer, it rebranded to become Teads.

David Kostman, formerly Outbrain's CEO, became CEO of Teads once the merger was completed. At the time of the deal's closing in February, Kostman said the deal would create a company that addressed "a large gap in the advertising industry," combining Teads' video expertise with Outbrain's performance marketing capabilities to build "a scaled end-to-end platform that can drive outcomes, from branding to consideration to purchase, across screens."

It's not been smooth sailing.

Teads' share price is down more than 90% year to date. Its market cap was about $58 million in early trading on Thursday. The company missed on both revenue and earnings per share in its third quarter and warned that the fourth quarter would continue to be challenging.

Kostman said on the company's November earnings call that Teads had experienced complexities due to the merger process, as well as "macro volatility in certain geographies and verticals."

The company recently hired adtech veteran Mollie Spilman as its chief commercial officer, as part of its plan to turn around its business. Elsewhere, Jeremy Arditi, a 15-year Teads veteran, is leaving his role as co-president and chief business officer of the Americas this month to start a new company in the AI business applications space, he confirmed to Business Insider.

Kostman said in November that the company was conducting a "comprehensive business review" to identify new growth and profit opportunities, and that Teads would provide a more detailed three-year plan and road map at an investor day in March.

Fortunes have been mixed for companies across the adtech industry this year. Overall, the global advertising market is set to grow by 7.4% to reach $1.17 trillion in 2025, per a September forecast from the research firm WARC. Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon are expected to capture more than half (55.8%) of total ad spend outside China.

Taboola, which for years fiercely competed with Outbrain in the content-recommendation space, has pulled ahead by diversifying its offering beyond native ads and striking key partnerships with the likes of Apple and Paramount. Taboola's third-quarter earnings beat expectations, and its stock is up more than 7% year-to-date, with its market cap exceeding $1 billion.

During Teads' November earnings call, the company also highlighted some specific challenges within its business that had affected its recent performance.

A "cleanup" of underperforming, lower-quality supply partners in the legacy Outbrain business resulted in a $10 million year-over-year headwind in the third quarter, the company said. The Outbrain legacy business was also affected by the broader web traffic declines that publishers have experienced, a trend accelerated by the rise of AI summaries in search results, Kostman said on the call. The sales pipeline for the legacy Teads business saw volatility as well, the company said.

[TITLE]Gulf region aims to become digital data hub – DW – 12:
[TEXT]
Qatar and Saudi Arabia are investing in new terrestrial cable systems to relieve the strain on underwater cables in the Red Sea. This is part of a fundamental modernization strategy.

Ooredoo, a Qatar-based communications company, plans to spend $500 million (€430 million) on new terrestrial fiber optic cable systems in the coming years. The cables will stretch from the Arabian Peninsula to Europe. According to a report by the Qatari news agency QNA, they will start in Oman, run from there to Iraq and Turkey and finally to France.

Notwithstanding, according to press reports, Syria and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to build a similar system of data cables that would also run from the Arabian Peninsula — more precisely, Saudi Arabia — to Europe.

Ayad Al-Ani, a Professor for Change Management and Consulting in Berlin, told DW that it was noteworthy that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were attempting to establish a land connection.

"This implies that both Iraq and Syria are safe transit countries that can be invested in," he said. "It will integrate the two countries more into the international data communication system, from which the local digital economy will benefit. This is likely to promote their economic development."

Alternative routes to bypass Red Sea challenges

According to QNA, Aziz Al Uthman Fakhroo, CEO of Ooredoo, suggested at a conference in Doha that the system would "strengthen the resilience of global networks, create alternative routes that bypass current challenges in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz."

From the perspective of network operators, both sea regions are considered risky. The Strait of Hormuz separates Iran from the Arabian Peninsula and, therefore, from countries with which Tehran has had a fierce rivalry, namely Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Iran has had several confrontations with Saudi Arabia in particular in the Straight of Hormuz. Qatar, meanwhile, maintains good relations with Iran.

The situation in the Red Sea is more fragile. Every year, 22,000 ships pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. It's also a main route in the digital network: There are currently 15 intercontinental undersea cables running through the area, and according to HGC Global Communications, 80% of data traffic between Asia, Africa and Europe runs through them.

The cables have repeatedly been the target of attacks — or might have been, because there is not always clear evidence of damage having been caused deliberately.

There were several outages in 2008 when, according to a study by the Henry Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington, five cables were damaged in different incidents. Three of the cables connected Asia and Europe, and as a result 70% of Egypt's internet connectivity was temporarily lost, while India experienced a 50% to 60% loss of bandwidth.

Houthi attacks on shipping routes and cable systems

In the recent war between Israel and the militant Islamist group Hamas in Gaza, the latter received support from the Houthi rebel group in Yemen. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the EU, the US and others.

Houthis attacked hundreds of ships in the Red Sea to disrupt international trade. According to HGC, the group also damaged four cable systems in the spring of 2024, including the Asia-Africa-Europe 1 cable, which connects the three continents. A good quarter of data traffic was reportedly affected.

In a statement, HGC described how it was maintaining international communication by rerouting data traffic to Europe via mainland China, the US or undamaged cables in the Red Sea.

The idea is that the new systems will prevent such incidents. According to the QNA report, Aziz Al Uthman Fakhroo of Ooredoo said that "cross-border cooperation has become both an operational and strategic necessity, especially given that the Middle East is a global logistical and digital hub, with 30% of the world's data and 90% of the data exchanged between Europe and Asia passing through it."

Qatar expands telecommunications sector

Qatar is systematically expanding its telecommunications industry. Last fall, Qatar National Broadband Network (QNBN) and Gulf Bridge International (GBI) announced their intention to merge their telecommunications divisions. This merger has now been completed. QNBN specializes in fiber optic cables, while GBI focuses on underwater and terrestrial cables.

The Peninsula, an English-language daily in Qatar, reported that the "integration of QNBN and GBI brings together two highly complementary businesses to create a carrier-neutral digital and AI infrastructure leader, further connecting Qatar to the world."

Ayad Al-Ani pointed out that the projects were not focused only on infrastructure but also on Qatari digital technology, such as data centers.

"The infrastructure alone is already considered a significant source of revenue today. But in conjunction with data and innovation centers, it provides the prerequisites for a successful digital economy," he told DW.

According to GBI, Qatar is currently trying to attract innovative AI companies from Europe and Asia and to offer a "seamless gateway to interconnect within the Middle East region," the Gulf Times reported in October 2024. "The combined company will focus on maximizing opportunities within the international data traffic market," the Qatar-based English-language newspaper continued. "By leveraging its combined resources and expertise, the company aims to position itself as a key player…, driving innovation and expanding its presence globally to meet increasing demand for data connectivity across borders."

Ayad Al-Ani said that Qatar, like Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, was also looking to the post-fossil fuel era by creating these systems.

"The region also has almost unlimited solar energy, which is relatively inexpensive, for operating data centers," he said. "This is a significant advantage in this energy-intensive industry. No additional nuclear power plants are needed, as is the case in the US, for example."

[TITLE]U.K. Actors Union Equity Threatens Industrial Action Over AI:
[TEXT]
U.K. performers union Equity is set to ballot members over potential action related to AI protections.

Negotiating partner Pact, the U.K. producers union, has been notified that the union is threatening industrial action short of strike, which would involve refusing to be digitally scanned when asked.

“Nobody wants further instability in our industries ahead of what we hope will be a positive year in 2026,” said Equity general secretary Paul W Fleming. “However, with the inadequacy of the deal on the table, Equity has no choice but to recommend members support industrial action. It’s time for the bosses to step away from the brink and offer us a package, including on AI protections, which respects our members.”

In a letter to Pact’s members (which Variety has seen), Pact deputy CEO Max Rumney acknowledged that re-negotiations over their collective agreements with Equity have stalled but raised concerns that the question the union plans to ballot its members on was “vague and does not explain the only outstanding issue clearly.”

Popular on Variety

The ballot, which is set to run from Thursday until Dec. 18, asks members: “Are you prepared to refuse digital scanning on set to secure adequate AI protections?”

It reflects the increasing anger among Equity’s members over AI. “There is a reason all of the streamers are coming now to Europe and the U.K. to take advantage of our cheaper availability of actors and talent because we’re not as protected as SAG-AFTRA‘s members,” one actor told Variety on condition of anonymity, relaying a situation encountered last year on the set of a prominent studio production in the U.K. where the cast were asked, without warning or any wording previously agreed in their contracts, to submit to body scans on set. Ostensibly the scans were to aid visual effects but no clarity was given to the actors over how and for how long their likeness would be used by the U.S. studio.

Another Equity member told Variety: “I do think they’ll get the votes [to strike]. A lot of actors are very angered at the thought of AI taking their roles.”

However, there is scepticism in the U.K. that any industrial action could achieve similar results to its U.S. counterpart SAG-AFTRA because in the U.K. actors are not required to be members of a union to work and many — including some prominent names — are not.

“I would hope that our union would have the ability to make meaningful change, but the fact that actors who are not in the union benefit from being able to work under Equity contracts makes the union powerless,” said the actor who was asked to submit to a body scan on set.

The initial Equity ballot is an indicative ballot, meaning the results will not be legally binding. Equity would need to hold a further statutory ballot to mandate a strike.

On Thursday, just after the news broke, one of Equity’s legal advisors, Mathilde Pavis, appeared on a panel
