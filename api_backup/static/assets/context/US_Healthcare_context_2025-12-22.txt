[TITLE]The Healthcare Sector is Gaining Momentum. Watch This Stock Chart for a Reversal Setup.:
[TEXT]
While most investors remain focused on mega-cap tech and index performance, a different story has been unfolding beneath the surface. In a recent Market on Close livestream, Senior Market Strategist John Rowland, CMT, highlighted a signal that often precedes sector leadership: broad participation, improving momentum, and confirmation from both economic data and price action.

That story is playing out right now in healthcare .

Why Healthcare Momentum Matters Right Now

One of the most telling signs of a healthy trend isn’t headlines; it’s participation. When John examined the healthcare sector, what stood out immediately was how many stocks were trading above their key moving averages .

Across the sector, a growing percentage of names are holding above their 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. That alignment signals sustained demand, not just short-term speculation.

At the same time, the latest jobs report added fuel to the thesis. Of the roughly 69,000 private-sector jobs added, nearly two-thirds came from healthcare alone. That kind of concentration points to real economic momentum, not just market rotation.

This combination — technical strength paired with labor-market confirmation — is often where durable trends begin.

Beating the Index Starts With the Right Filters

Rather than guessing which healthcare names might work, John leaned on a framework taught by our Chart of the Day columnist Jim Van Meerten: if you want to outperform, start by identifying stocks already beating the index.

Using Barchart’s market sector tools and Custom Views , healthcare stocks were sorted by weighted alpha — a metric designed to measure performance relative to the broader market. While the broad healthcare ETF ( XLV ) is performing roughly in line with the S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ), many individual names inside the sector are already pulling ahead.

That dispersion is important. It tells us leadership is emerging at the stock level, even if the sector ETF hasn’t fully broken out yet.

Bristol-Myers ( BMY ): Value Meets Momentum

Bristol-Myers Squibb is a name John has followed — and owned — in the past, and it recently checked multiple boxes at once.

From a longer-term perspective, BMY had already gone through a multi-year decline, resetting expectations and valuations. What changed was structure. The stock began forming higher lows, then broke out of a well-defined range, signaling a shift from distribution to accumulation.

That breakout turned what began as a value idea into a momentum-driven trade, and so far the follow-through has been constructive. At current levels, John noted he’d be more focused on managing gains and watching for consolidation — a reminder that momentum trades can evolve into longer-term investments when conditions stay favorable.

Pairing Momentum With a Tactical Setup: AHR

While BMY illustrates what healthcare momentum can look like once it’s established, John also flagged a developing opportunity — one that fits a very different profile.

American Healthcare REIT ( AHR ) operates in senior housing, skilled nursing, and medical office real estate — an area directly tied to one of the strongest secular trends in the U.S.: an aging population.

From a technical perspective, AHR is approaching a critical resistance zone near $48.50. Clearing that level would complete the trigger phase of a classic 3-Candle Drop reversal setup, a pattern John has traded throughout his career.

If price can break and hold above that level, the next resistance zone sits near $51, with a measured upside target closer to $55. Failure to clear resistance, however, would invalidate the setup — making this a defined-risk, rules-based trade rather than a prediction.

Importantly, this technical setup is reinforced by fundamentals. AHR has completed more than $950 million in acquisitions year-to-date, focused squarely on operating senior healthcare assets that management expects to drive growth into 2026 and beyond.

John has disclosed that he owns shares, reinforcing that this is not a hypothetical chart pattern, but an actively monitored opportunity.

Why Healthcare Deserves a Spot on Your Watchlist

Healthcare doesn’t move like high-beta tech. It rarely makes headlines at the top or bottom. Instead, it tends to build quietly — supported by demographics, employment growth, and steady capital deployment.

Right now, the sector is showing:

Improving breadth beneath the surface

Individual stocks outperforming the index

Technical structures shifting from basing to trending

Real-world economic demand supporting price action

That combination is exactly where traders and investors should be paying attention.

Martin Shipton

The Welsh Government has been accused of trying to disguise the fact that a new £120m diagnostic centre branded as a “health park” will be operated by a private sector company.

Planning permission was granted in September 2025 for the construction of a regional diagnostic and treatment hub on land near the Royal Glamorgan Hospital at Llantrisant in Rhondda Cynon Taf. It will be located at the former British Airways avionics engineering building at Gwaun Elai industrial estate

[TITLE]Cytokinetics Announces FDA Approval of MYQORZO™ (aficamten) for the Treatment of Adults with Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy to Improve Functional Capacity and Symptoms:
[TEXT]
MYQORZO, a Cardiac Myosin Inhibitor, Directly Addresses Underlying Hypercontractility Associated with Obstructive HCM

FDA Approval Based on Results of SEQUOIA-HCM

MYQORZO is Company’s First FDA-Approved Medicine

Company to Host Investor Conference Call Today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytokinetics, Incorporated (Nasdaq: CYTK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved MYQORZO™ (aficamten), 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg tablets for the treatment of adults with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) to improve functional capacity and symptoms. MYQORZO is an allosteric and reversible inhibitor of cardiac myosin motor activity. In patients with oHCM, myosin inhibition with MYQORZO reduces cardiac contractility and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction.

“This is a historic moment for our company and for the patients we serve, as we fulfill our promise to translate our science into medicines that may make a meaningful difference in patients’ lives,” said Robert I. Blum, Cytokinetics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our first FDA approval stands as a testament to the strength of our science and the bold, trailblazing research that has defined Cytokinetics’ leadership in muscle biology. I’m pleased that the approved label and REMS reflect the distinct characteristics of MYQORZO including a straightforward, flexible dosing regimen, no requirement for drug-drug interaction monitoring and a predictable safety profile. I am profoundly grateful for the many years of passion and persistence shown by patients with obstructive HCM, as well as healthcare professionals, advocates, partners and employees who have contributed so importantly to reaching this key milestone.”

The full U.S. Prescribing Information for MYQORZO includes a Boxed WARNING for the risk of heart failure. MYQORZO reduces left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and can cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Echocardiogram assessments are required prior to and during treatment with MYQORZO to monitor for systolic dysfunction. Initiation of MYQORZO in patients LVEF <55% is not recommended. Decrease the dose of MYQORZO if LVEF <50% and ≥40%. Interrupt the dose of MYQORZO if LVEF <40% or if the patient experiences heart failure symptoms or worsening clinical status due to systolic dysfunction. Because of the risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, MYQORZO is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the MYQORZO REMS Program. Please see additional Important Safety Information including Boxed WARNING below.

MYQORZO is expected to be available in the U.S. in the second half of January 2026. Cytokinetics will support patients with MYQORZO & You™, a personalized program for patients prescribed MYQORZO in the U.S. to help navigate the treatment journey, provide disease and product education, and offer support with insurance benefits investigations or financial assistance for those eligible.

[TITLE]Patent cliffhanger: will China biotech throw Big Pharma a lifeline?:
[TEXT]
The dynamics are well understood in an industry where a handful of blockbusters can underwrite years of costly research and where patents may run 20 years on paper, but far less in practice once years of development are taken into account.

Pfizer is not alone. Biopharma multinational Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) chief executive Chris Boerner also warned of a "stacking effect" as multiple drugs lose protection in quick succession.

"There is clearly a loss of exclusivity wave coming," Bourla said. "This will cost us between US$17 billion and US$18 billion and it's coming in gradually in 2026, 2027 and 2028."

Countdown anxiety was on display in San Francisco earlier this year at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, where pharmaceutical giant Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla warned investors and analysts of an approaching "loss of exclusivity" wave.

Morgan Stanley estimates US$171 billion of 2025 revenue at large-cap biopharma companies will go off-patent by the end of 2030, forcing the industry into a race to replace ageing blockbusters.

For US drug makers, all of these shifts are approaching like icebergs shearing off a glacier: slowly at first, then all at once.

The Biosecure Act, awaiting final passage in the US Senate and US President Donald Trump's signature to become law, has added uncertainty to an industry that is simultaneously trying to refill pipelines at speed.

And the patent cliff is not the only headwind. US drug makers are also operating in a tougher political environment as Washington takes a harder line on Chinese life sciences and supply chains.

For Immediate Release: December 19, 2025

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking input from venture capital firms on developing a new contracting approach to strengthen collaboration between the agency and America’s most innovative companies.

The FDA recognizes that many breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions relevant to its public health mission — including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, medical devices, and regulatory technology — are being developed by firms within venture capital portfolios. However, longstanding challenges, have limited engagement with innovative companies. Many existing federal contracting mechanisms favor large systems integrators and intermediaries that focus on labor-based work rather than scalable technologies. In addition, small business set-aside programs can be difficult for early-stage companies to access and have faced concerns

Nowadays, the globe is promoting seamless, building-block MES platforms that adapt to complex needs, including tailored medicine. Recently, Tulip debuted a composable MES for life sciences, focusing on validated workflows and adaptability.

On the other hand, the AI, ML, and digital twin platforms segment is predicted to expand rapidly. Especially, AI and patient digital twins simulate patient responses, particularly in Alzheimer's or G12C KRAS mutation cases, for minimising trial durations and identifying efficient therapies rapidly, bypassing some physical trials. Furthermore, immersive Dassault Systèmes facilitates "Virtual Twin as a Service" for healthcare and life sciences, employs AI for virtual human body twins ("Emma") and improves processes. PapAI/Datategy offers AI layers by integrating with digital twins to provide predictive insights and boost operations across the value chain.

What Made the On-Premises Segment Dominant in the Market in 2024?

The on-premises segment led with the largest share of the digital manufacturing in life sciences market in 2024. Many life science firms, specifically pharma companies, deal with highly sensitive patient data, R&D, and intellectual property, which makes on-premises a preference for maximum control against breaches. The latest developments include Siemens Xcelerator adoption, FDA support for Process Analytical Tech (PAT), and modular, lean manufacturing cells for devices.

Moreover, the public cloud/SaaS segment is estimated to witness the fastest growth. Their adoption is bolstered by data explosion (AI/ML needs), regulatory compliance, legacy system modernization, expedited time-to-market, and escalated R&D/clinical trial assistance. Currently, advanced solutions comprise GE HealthCare's cloud-first clinical apps (CareIntellect) for better care and Carrier's Lynx FacTOR SaaS for automated pharma cold chain release.

[TITLE]‘More Kids Will Die’: Measles Is on the Rise — and Doctors Say There’s No End in Sight:
[TEXT]
Richard Eby knew things were getting bad when the schools shut down.

Eby is a family medicine doctor based in Andrews, in West Texas. It’s a quiet town of 14,000, chock full of all-American touches — a Buffalo Wild Wings sits a few doors down from La Hacienda, a bottomless Mexican buffet with neon cacti on its facade and brightly colored papel picado strung across its interior.

Like many other towns nestled in Texas’ Permian Basin — of Friday Night Lights fame — it is also unapologetically high-school-football-crazy: Andrews High School’s astroturfed Mustang Bowl, capacity 8,000, sits at the northwestern border of Mustang Drive, which forms a necklace around town. (The Mustangs, who have a long legacy of district championships tracing back to 1953, went 5-7 last year — though they refused to go down without notching three blowout wins against district rivals.)

Come last January, there were new whispers around town. Eby had heard from colleagues that measles was circulating in Gaines County, 30 miles north. And by the end of the month, he’d seen a few cases himself.

That was, in some respects, to be expected. After a 2019 outbreak in West Texas, a couple more confirmed cases in the South in 2023, and given that neighboring counties’ school districts have some of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state —13 times the national average — Eby has gotten used to keeping the potentially life-threatening virus on his radar.

“It’s always at the back of your mind,” he says.

But it wasn’t until some local schools started shutting down in the ensuing weeks that Eby realized how bad this outbreak could get. Something felt off to the pediatrician — he says that, at the time, he recalls the official case count being a dozen. “That just tells you how far undercounted the cases were,” Eby says.

In the months that followed, more than 750 measles cases were diagnosed — 414 in Gaines County alone. Ninety-nine patients were hospitalized for severe symptoms such as inability to breathe and inflammation in the brain. Two otherwise healthy, stone-cold-normal children died. Editor’s picks

To pediatricians like Eby, the outbreaks meant every typically innocuous symptom in clinic — every cough or sniffle, every hive or wheal or welt — put him and his staff on high alert. That’s because measles can start as just a stuffy nose and a red dot on the abdomen, but the illness rapidly evolves into whole-body bumps and blisters accompanied by difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it produces a child so sleepy they can’t be woken up, or seizures that won’t stop, because of swelling in the brain. And it can all happen within days of the itch starting.

So, Eby hasn’t been taking chances. “All of a sudden, a same-day appointment that’s on the schedule as a cough and rash,” he says, “you need to ask, ‘Did anyone clarify?’”

That style of medicine — the kind where a previously largely-forgotten foe was now lurking in the community, in the waiting room, and in doctors’ minds — also felt a bit like a step back in time, Eby says. At various points during the outbreak, he found himself thinking, “Is every kid going to have measles for the next couple weeks?”

That style of medicine is also becoming the norm, and not just in Texas. Even as attention has turned elsewhere — shutdowns, boat strikes, Epstein — the measles outbreak continues to rage throughout the country.

As of Dec. 2, almost 2,000 cases have been confirmed across 43 states. (The Centers for Disease Control is not publicly sharing the number of so-called probable cases — ones that were not tested. During previous international outbreaks, between 10 percent and 70 percent of cases were not tested.) That number is the highest in the United States since 1992. And after a summer lull, cases are climbing again: The week before Thanksgiving, the number of cases was the highest since May. Related Content

Should the spikes continue into January, the U.S. will lose its “measles-free” designation from the World Health Organization — a label achieved in 2000. That’s part of a larger trend: In November, the WHO stripped the Americas of its measles-free label amid historic outbreaks in both Canada and Mexico. (Mexican officials say their outbreak was seeded from Texas; Canadian officials say theirs started with an “internationally imported” case, but did not specify whether it was American.)

“This loss represents a setback,” Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, the region’s WHO oversight body, said of removing the measles-free label. “We call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen vaccination rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases. Cooperation, solidarity, and science are stronger than any virus.”

To some domestic public health officials, the issue isn’t just that the outbreaks are a step backward. It’s that they’re entirely preventable.

“Life has enough curveballs and trauma that to have a tragedy like someone passing away from a completely preventable disease — that’s just hard to believe,” James McDonald, pediatrician and commissioner of the New York Department of Health, says.

It’s not just measles. Cases of whooping cough increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, above pre-pandemic highs. Hospitalizations from flu this past year were at the highest rates in more than a decade. In 2024, almost 4,000 infants were born with syphilis infections — a figure eight times higher than the 2015 number. “We’re still dealing with things that First World nations shouldn’t even be talking about,” McDonald says.

But under the current Trump administration, health officials say, it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under them — from under public health, as an institution.

There have been the obvious, explicitly damaging measures. Take, for instance, the administration’s all-out assault on vaccines, which most recently, in early December, led the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to nix the decades-long recommendation to immunize all newborns against hepatitis B. The same day, a presidential memo directed Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to “review best practices” related to vaccines and update the childhood immunization schedule accordingly.

There have also been less obvious measures. Billions of dollars in cuts to the CDC, buried in the fine print of federal budgets. Billions more public health dollars to states clawed back, hidden in cases winding their way through the federal courts. Mass layoffs to the epidemiologists, and lab workers and data collectors responsible for responding to, diagnosing, and tracking disease outbreaks in real time.

Taken together, experts worry that the steps to hamstring the CDC (and other state departments) have imperiled the public’s health for political purposes. These actions are “seeding doubt …[and] hijacking resources away from families…[with] significant consequences,” says Susan Kressly, pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. (On Dec. 17, The Washington Post reported that HHS axed millions of dollars in funding to the Academy, which has repeatedly criticized Secretary Kennedy. The organization’s work “no longer align[s] with the Department’s mission or priorities,” a spokesman said in a statement.)

In the meantime, the measles outbreak is “continuing to grow,” Kressly adds, “with no end in sight.”

Code Lavender

Somewhere in Lubbock, Texas, stashed away in the corner of a hospital closet, there’s a cart stocked to the teeth with lavender-scented products. There are rollerballs and brushes. There are sachets and steamers. There are lavender-colored journals and pens, too.

The cart — and the team of counselors, chaplains, peer coaches, and therapy dogs that accompany it — was borne out of necessity during the Covid pandemic, says Shannon Bates, chief nursing officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital. The goal, she says, was to use aromatherapy, reflection, dialogue, and community to combat the “secondary trauma response” associated with death after death from that virus.

For a while after the height of the pandemic, the cart got less mileage. But during the measles outbreak, the Covenant team has been pulling it out again. That’s partially because, in some ways, the script has flipped on clinical staff. With the unavoidable, politically charged conversations around vaccines that accompany the outbreak, “it’s kind of the opposite of Covid, where everyone was the health-care hero,” Bates says. “Now, you’re seen as the bad guy, the one who can’t be trusted.”

It’s also because, in addition to staff enduring rhetoric around health workers that’s ranged from distrust to resentment, they’ve witnessed firsthand just how harmful the measles outbreak can be. In February, a six-year-old girl died after being admitted to Covenant — the nation’s first death from the outbreak. That “definitely has taken a toll on staff,” Bates says. Since then, she adds, “we have done some proactive rounding.” In other words, rather than waiting for someone to ask for a rollerball or a sachet, they’ve taken to roaming the halls with the cart, the chaplains, and the puppies.

Summer Davies also recalls the start of the outbreak, when the first call came in. It was the early afternoon, just after the team finished rounding. Davies, a pediatrician and associate professor at Texas Tech University, was patched through to a doctor who told her the child had a fever, and a rash, and needed to be admitted precautionarily. “I remember thinking at the time, ‘I don’t know, maybe it’s not measles,’” Davies says. That changed within moments of seeing just how sick the child was.

Davies was there when the six-year-old died, too — an experience she calls “devastating.” The death stuck with her: Long after it happened, she and her colleagues wondered, “Could we have done something different to help that child?”

Amid the circumstances, Davies says her hospital, as well as the county and state public health departments, was incredibly supportive. “We have had people…advocating for us, taking all of the right steps, making sure we’re safe and that patients are safe,” she says.

Off the wards, though, things were harder.

As the outbreak raged, federal agencies ignored pleas for help from Texas officials. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, wrote in emails obtained by KFF Health News just days after children with measles started getting hospitalized. “We weren’t allowed to do anything,” a CDC official told KFF Health News. It took weeks until any agency officials dispatched to Texas — at which point HHS pressured them to highlight Vitamin A, rather than vaccines, as a solution to the outbreak. (In multiple interviews since January, Secretary Kennedy has claimed that Vitamin A can reduce measles deaths. Studies have consistently found that the salve demonstrates no effect in the greater than 99 percent of Americans who have adequate levels of the vitamin.)

“As a health-care professional, that’s scary to hear,” Davies says of being all but abandoned by the federal government. “[But] it makes a big difference to feel supported by your hospital system,” she adds, “to know that they’re in our corner, if nobody else is.”

Then there are the anti-vax politics — including baseless allegations made by Robert Malone, a pathologist turned biotechnology executive, on his personal Substack. Malone’s influencer era kicked off in part thanks to a 2021 Joe Rogan interview in which he claimed, without evidence, that antacids cured his case of Covid and that the vaccine could cause narcolepsy. When it came to measles, he claimed that the two deaths from measles were the hospitals’ fault, the result of “medical mismanagement” rather than anything to do with vaccination. Those allegations were never refuted by the administration. And two months after they were posted, Secretary Kennedy appointed Malone as vice chair of the CDC vaccine advisory committee. “It’s impossible not to read some of those comments,” Davies says. Since then, though, she’s tried to stop reading the news.

Despite it all, Davies and her colleagues have pressed on. “We’ve really had tunnel vision: Let’s take care of our patients and do our job, boots on the ground,” she says. And on Aug. 18, the Texas outbreak was declared over.

While that means Covenant’s staff can breathe a little easier — for now — in hindsight, Davies says, “it makes it even harder to know [that] this could have been prevented.”

Likewise, her experience has made her fear for colleagues across the country. “With the nature of the disease and the high mortality rate from it,” Davies says, “more kids will die.”

‘Purposeful chaos’

Across the country, Davies’ compatriots are steeling themselves.

To Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease specialist at University of Kansas Medical Center, every child with a cough is “very high stakes” right now. “It’s only a matter of time” until an outbreak happens in his state, too, Hawkinson says.

To Alexandra Cvijanovich, pediatrician at Presbyterian Medical Group in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in today’s environment, “well child checks aren’t always well child checks.” Cvijanovich isn’t leaving any stones unturned: “I always worry: When am I going to have a child in my waiting room who has measles?” she says. The level of vigilance is in part from a deadly measles case she saw during residency that she described as “the worst death of my pediatric career.” The current outbreak, Cvijanovich says, “has brought back all those memories.”

And to Douglas Fleck, pediatrician and medical director of quality at University Hospital Rainbow Babies & Children’s in Ashtabula, Ohio, even figuring out where to put sick patients is “straight-up a challenge.” Fleck doesn’t want to put them in the waiting room because “we take an oath to do no harm,” he says. But he also doesn’t want to turn them away, since that could lead patients who already distrust the health-care system to become even more entrenched. As a result, “we’re dusting off the Covid playbook,” Fleck says — doing as much as they can by telehealth, triaging patients in the parking lot, and so on.

Try as they may, all three doctors know their clinics may need help should things get out of hand. But ever since the first days of Trump’s second term, whether counties and states will have the resources to do so remains an open question.

One of the earliest threats came on March 24, when HHS summarily terminated $11 billion in funding to states under the premise that those dollars, initially granted during Covid, were “no longer necessary…now that the pandemic is over,” according to a notice issued by the agency. That “immediately triggered chaos for State and local health jurisdictions,” according to an April 1 lawsuit brought by nearly two dozen states against HHS and RFK Jr. In May, a district court judge ruled in favor of the states; by July, HHS had appealed that ruling. As of this writing , the case continues to snake its way through the courts.

According to Sameer Vohra, pediatrician and director of the Illinois Department of Health, HHS’ logic is nonsensical. All the public health measures required to combat Covid — promoting vaccination, purchasing essential equipment, expanding labs, conducting contact tracing, assisting localities during outbreaks — serve as “infrastructure to allow us to be prepared for future emergencies as well,” Vohra says. His state saw nearly $500 million disappear overnight, $125 million of which had already been allocated. “This will have a debilitating impact,” Vohra says , should the federal government win its appeal.

In New York, commissioner McDonald is reckoning with similar whiplash. In the immediate aftermath of the clawback, they laid off the majority of contract employees needed to support the department’s efforts. Other states, like Utah and Maine, likewise were forced to fire dozens of employees — further intensifying public health workforce shortages that the federal Government Accountability Office, in January , described as so severe as to threaten the nation’s ability to “conduct key public health functions…[and]respond to emergencies.”

“Nationally, public health is really being threatened,” McDonald says.

Simultaneously, at the federal level, HHS — the backstop for states in situations of crisis — is roiling.

In late March, HHS slashed over 10,000 jobs, closed half its regional offices, and shuttered entire divisions, like those responsible for ensuring workplace safety standards, monitoring levels of environmental toxins, and supporting children with birth defects. National databases upon which public health departments, researchers, and clinicians depend are also fading to black as the data collectors are fired. Some of the gold-standard labs responsible for performing testing on illnesses like measles were shuttered, smack in the middle of the measles outbreak. And the disease detectives responsible for on-the-ground response in places like Texas were gutted, too. Which is perhaps in part why Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, heard crickets in response to her pleas for help in February.

“It is unheard of that, in an active outbreak, [CDC] just says, ‘No…we’re not going to send people,’” Demetre Daskalakis, physician and former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says. “[But] I don’t know who’s left.”

“[They] are paralyzing the organization,” Daskalakis adds in reference to the federal government’s actions. “It is purposeful chaos.”

For doctors like Fleck in Ashtabula, it’s hard not to notice all of this — or, what it means

[TITLE]Exploring a Digital Health Solution to Collect and Manage Health-Related Needs for Patients Who Undergo Complex Surgery: Mixed Methods Study:
[TEXT]
Conclusions: Digital solutions could provide a streamlined approach for the collection and management of health-related needs in surgery, with the goal of addressing unmet needs and improving patient activation. This approach is critical to ensure that patients, especially patients who undergo complex surgery, have positive health outcomes. We identified preferences for specific features in a proposed digital solution based on our systematic assessment that will inform future work.

Results: Extensive themes emerged from interviews with patients (n=20) and care team members (n=24), capturing their health-related and surgical experiences as well as desired features for a digital solution. Our swimlane diagram demonstrated four critical gaps in workflow: (1) heterogeneity in the approach to screening, monitoring, and managing health-related needs; (2) patients felt uncomfortable reporting health-related needs, particularly behavioral and social needs, to their care team; (3) lack of access to referral resources to resolve needs; and (4) the need for a closed-loop intervention for patients and care team members. A subset of participants from phase 1 (n=5 patients and n=9 care team members) provided feedback on preferred features, drawing from digital tools currently available in the EHR at our academic medical center. Among the 3 existing EHR tools tested, there were variations in how patients and care team members felt

[TITLE]The Impact of Patient-Generated Health Data From Mobile Health Technologies on Health Care Management and Clinical Decision-Making: Narrative Scoping Review:
[TEXT]
Conclusions: Patient-generated health data have the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and person-centered practices. However, integration into routine practice is hindered by technological challenges, professional hesitancy, and a lack of standardization. Future research should prioritize supporting integration, improve data presentation, and evaluate the long-term effects on clinical workflows. Addressing these barriers and establishing clear policy frameworks will be crucial for realizing the potential of mHealth in health care delivery.

Results: A total of 16 studies met the inclusion requirements, which were primarily high-income countries focusing on rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. The studies reported on how mHealth data were integrated into workflows, influenced health care decisions, and shaped patient-provider interactions. mHealth patient data were found to support patient-centered care and facilitate proactive holistic care, though in some instances, the data were shown to reinforce medical agendas removing agency from patients. There is also a gap between the intended use of the data and their implementation in clinical practice. The reported barriers included professional skepticism, integration challenges, and concerns

[TITLE]Cytokinetics Announces FDA Approval of MYQORZO™ (aficamten) for the Treatment of Adults with Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy to Improve Functional Capacity and Symptoms:
[TEXT]
MYQORZO, a Cardiac Myosin Inhibitor, Directly Addresses Underlying Hypercontractility Associated with Obstructive HCM

FDA Approval Based on Results of SEQUOIA-HCM

MYQORZO is Company’s First FDA-Approved Medicine

Company to Host Investor Conference Call Today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytokinetics, Incorporated (Nasdaq: CYTK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved MYQORZO™ (aficamten), 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg tablets for the treatment of adults with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) to improve functional capacity and symptoms. MYQORZO is an allosteric and reversible inhibitor of cardiac myosin motor activity. In patients with oHCM, myosin inhibition with MYQORZO reduces cardiac contractility and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction.

“This is a historic moment for our company and for the patients we serve, as we fulfill our promise to translate our science into medicines that may make a meaningful difference in patients’ lives,” said Robert I. Blum, Cytokinetics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our first FDA approval stands as a testament to the strength of our science and the bold, trailblazing research that has defined Cytokinetics’ leadership in muscle biology. I’m pleased that the approved label and REMS reflect the distinct characteristics of MYQORZO including a straightforward, flexible dosing regimen, no requirement for drug-drug interaction monitoring and a predictable safety profile. I am profoundly grateful for the many years of passion and persistence shown by patients with obstructive HCM, as well as healthcare professionals, advocates, partners and employees who have contributed so importantly to reaching this key milestone.”

The full U.S. Prescribing Information for MYQORZO includes a Boxed WARNING for the risk of heart failure. MYQORZO reduces left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and can cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Echocardiogram assessments are required prior to and during treatment with MYQORZO to monitor for systolic dysfunction. Initiation of MYQORZO in patients LVEF <55% is not recommended. Decrease the dose of MYQORZO if LVEF <50% and ≥40%. Interrupt the dose of MYQORZO if LVEF <40% or if the patient experiences heart failure symptoms or worsening clinical status due to systolic dysfunction. Because of the risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, MYQORZO is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the MYQORZO REMS Program. Please see additional Important Safety Information including Boxed WARNING below.

MYQORZO is expected to be available in the U.S. in the second half of January 2026. Cytokinetics will support patients with MYQORZO & You™, a personalized program for patients prescribed MYQORZO in the U.S. to help navigate the treatment journey, provide disease and product education, and offer support with insurance benefits investigations or financial assistance for those eligible.
