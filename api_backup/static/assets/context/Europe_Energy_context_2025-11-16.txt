[TITLE]Zeo Energy Corp. Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results:
[TEXT]
NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla., Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zeo Energy Corp. (Nasdaq: ZEO) (“Zeo,” “Zeo Energy,” or the “Company”), a Florida-based provider of residential solar and commercial long-duration energy-storage solutions, today reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Recent Financial and Operational Highlights

Third quarter net revenue was approximately $23.9 million, a 32% increase from the second quarter and a 22% increase from the third quarter of 2024.

Third quarter Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2.0 million, an improvement from $1.4 million in the second quarter and $(0.2) million in the third quarter of 2024.

The Company’s completed acquisition, during the third quarter, of Heliogen, a provider of on-demand clean energy technology solutions, provides the company with an opportunity to establish a division focused on long-duration energy generation and storage for commercial and industrial-scale facilities, including artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing data centers.

As a result of the acquisition of Heliogen, the Company has begun to receive strong interest from potential customers interested in solutions supported by Heliogen’s technology, including data centers and other energy infrastructure projects.

Management Commentary

“While the broader residential solar market remains challenging, we believe that we have demonstrated a consistent ability to maintain revenue and manage our costs, positioning us well as conditions improve,” said Zeo Energy Corp. CEO Tim Bridgewater. “In the third quarter we generated approximately $23.9 million in net revenue, up more than 20% from the third quarter of 2024. Looking ahead, we expect Q4 net revenues to be consistent with Q3, having stabilized in the near term as we navigate typical seasonality associated with the year end. At the same time, we are continuing to expand into favorable new markets, like Virginia, and attract top sales talent that values our competitive differentiation, both of which we believe have us set up well for future growth in 2026.

“Separately, our recently completed acquisition of Heliogen has begun to create additional interest and awareness for the business with exciting potential new opportunities on the horizon. More specifically, we are engaged in several discussions with potential data center and commercial end customers seeking large-scale behind-the-meter energy solutions utilizing photovoltaic (PV) solar and storage. As our diversified platform for energy solutions thesis begins to emerge, we intend to balance select opportunities while remaining committed to profitable growth of our core business.”

Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Results comparing the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 to the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Total net revenue was approximately $23.9 million in Q3 2025, a 21.6% increase from approximately $19.7 million in the comparable 2024 period. The increase was largely due to an increase in installations and revenues compared to the prior year.

Gross profit increased to approximately $13.7 million (57.4% of total net revenue) in Q3 2025 from approximately $9.6 million (48.8% of total net revenue) in the comparable 2024 period. The increase was driven in part by an increase in the average selling price of contracts to customers compared to the prior year.

Net loss for Q3 2025 was approximately $1.9 million compared to approximately $2.9 million in the comparable 2024 period. The decrease was primarily due to an net increase in revenue during the third quarter of 2025.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance reconciled below, increased to approximately $2.0 million (8.2% of total net revenue) in Q3 2025 from approximately $(0.2) million (1.2% of total net revenue) in the comparable 2024 period. The change was primarily related to the improvement in net revenue in the third quarter of 2025.

First Nine Months 2025 Financial Results

Results compare the nine months ended September 30, 2025 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Total revenue was $50.8 million, a 7.0% decrease from $54.6 million in the comparable 2024 period. The primary reason for the decrease in revenue was a decrease in deferred revenue recognized in first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024. The first quarter of 2024 benefited from systems which were installed at the end of 2023 that were recognized in 2024.

Gross profit increased to $28.1 million (55.3% of total revenue) from $23.2 million (42.5% of total revenue) in the comparable 2024 period. The increase was driven primarily by an improvement in cost of goods sold, mainly driven by the impact of the costs associated with the deferred revenue in 2023 being deferred to 2024. There were no such costs in 2025.

Net loss was $17.9 million compared to $8.7 million in the comparable 2024 period. The increase is primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to softer residential solar market conditions in the first half of the year.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance reconciled below, decreased to $(1.9) million (3.8% of total revenue) from $0.1 million (0.2% of total revenue) in the comparable 2024 period. The change was primarily related to lower revenues and bad debt associated with the bankruptcy of a customer.

[TITLE]India’s Refiners Turn to the U.S. in Break from the Gulf:
[TEXT]
India’s state-run refiners have locked in their first-ever long-term deal to import U.S. liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), awarding tenders to Chevron, Phillips 66, and TotalEnergies Trading for delivery beginning in 2026—a move that marks a geopolitical and commercial break from the Middle East and a step toward appeasing Washington.

The deal covers around 2 million metric tons of LPG—some 48 very large gas carrier cargoes—jointly purchased by Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum. It’s the first time the three refiners have banded together for long-term U.S. supply of the fuel, which is still subsidized at home. While pricing details haven’t been disclosed, the contracts give suppliers leeway to source one in four cargoes from outside the U.S., a flexibility likely designed to manage logistics and pricing swings.

India currently imports about 65% of its LPG consumption—roughly 31 million tons annually—nearly all of it from Middle Eastern suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE. The shift toward the U.S. reflects both energy security diversification and trade diplomacy: Washington’s 50% tariff on Indian goods has become a sore point for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and buying more American energy is part of New Delhi’s effort to rebalance that ledger.

It’s also a message to Riyadh. Saudi Aramco recently cut official selling prices for propane and butane to two-year lows after India signaled plans to diversify away from Gulf dependence. For producers like Aramco and ADNOC, the loss of India’s long-term security as a captive market comes just as China’s demand has slowed.

Behind the trade shuffle lies realpolitik. Trump’s administration has pushed India to curtail Russian crude purchases, and in return, Washington has opened its export gates to U.S. LPG. For India, securing cleaner, affordable fuel while easing tariff pressure is a diplomatic two-for-one deal—one that quietly redraws the map of global LPG flows.

[TITLE]A Power-Hungry Southeast Asia Wants China’s Energy:
[TEXT]
For the United States, the key was oil and gas. Its oil giants proved formidable geoeconomic players, whether working with U.S. friendly regimes during the Cold War or providing liquefied natural gas to Europe as it struggles with Russia today. In turn, they have shaped U.S. policy, including the country’s decades-long entanglement in the Middle East.

Geopolitical power has long been linked with literal power. Britain’s status as the world’s leading coal producer fueled not just the Industrial Revolution domestically but gave it enormous global influence.

Geopolitical power has long been linked with literal power. Britain’s status as the world’s leading coal producer fueled not just the Industrial Revolution domestically but gave it enormous global influence.

For the United States, the key was oil and gas. Its oil giants proved formidable geoeconomic players, whether working with U.S. friendly regimes during the Cold War or providing liquefied natural gas to Europe as it struggles with Russia today. In turn, they have shaped U.S. policy, including the country’s decades-long entanglement in the Middle East.

Now, some see China as a new type of energy power—an electrostate. It is not only installing renewable energy faster than any country in the world, but it is also exporting the technologies for producing renewable energy on a massive scale, according to energy think tank Ember. In 2025, the value of these exports hit $20 billion—a new record. What does this mean in practical terms? Energy-hungry neighbors in Southeast Asia provide an interesting glimpse.

Like most developing countries, nearly all member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are unwilling to embrace an energy transition unless they see the chance for profit in it. From partners, they want green energy that is cheap, and if possible, they want to see some domestic production of goods such as solar panels. Alongside this, fossil fuels will persist, so long as they represent a good business proposition. As they make inroads in ASEAN, renewables are not replacing fossil fuels but being layered on top, much as in China.

The United States and its, for the time being, allies in Asia and Europe still have a considerable role in the region’s energy sector—but are confined to oil and gas. Similarly, ASEAN’s own governments have powerful domestic fossil companies, such as Petronas in Malaysia, that they can leverage. Renewable energy, however, is heavily dominated by China.

China has been the single-most significant investor in ASEAN’s power sector. From 2015 to 2024, China accounted for 31.9 percent of all foreign direct investment in the generation and transmission of electricity and gas (excluding pipelines), according to data provided by ASEAN. Intra-ASEAN FDI provides a shade more, but much of this comes from the international financial entrepôt of Singapore. Japan, South Korea, and to a lesser extent Europe have played noticeable roles, too. Meanwhile, the United States seems to have almost quit the field—even before the onset of President Donald Trump’s second term.

While more detailed breakdowns are not easily available, a variety of datasets suggest that Chinese dominance in energy is only set to grow.

Take, for example, solar panels, where China’s leadership is now a truism. Between 2010 and 2024, China produced

[TITLE]A Power-Hungry Southeast Asia Wants China’s Energy:
[TEXT]
For the United States, the key was oil and gas. Its oil giants proved formidable geoeconomic players, whether working with U.S. friendly regimes during the Cold War or providing liquefied natural gas to Europe as it struggles with Russia today. In turn, they have shaped U.S. policy, including the country’s decades-long entanglement in the Middle East.

Geopolitical power has long been linked with literal power. Britain’s status as the world’s leading coal producer fueled not just the Industrial Revolution domestically but gave it enormous global influence.

Geopolitical power has long been linked with literal power. Britain’s status as the world’s leading coal producer fueled not just the Industrial Revolution domestically but gave it enormous global influence.

For the United States, the key was oil and gas.

In turn, they have shaped U.S. policy, including the country’s decades-long entanglement in the Middle East.

Now, some see China as a new type of energy power—an electrostate. It is not only installing renewable energy faster than any country in the world, but it is also exporting the technologies for producing renewable energy on a massive scale, according to energy think tank Ember. In 2025, the value of these exports hit $20 billion—a new record. What does this mean in practical terms? Energy-hungry neighbors in Southeast Asia provide an interesting glimpse.

Like most developing countries, nearly all member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are unwilling to embrace an energy transition unless they see the chance for profit in it. From partners, they want green energy that is cheap, and if possible, they want to see some domestic production of goods such as solar panels. Alongside this, fossil fuels will persist, so long as they represent a good business proposition. As they make inroads in ASEAN, renewables are not replacing fossil fuels but being layered on top, much as in China.

The United States and its, for the time being, allies in Asia and Europe still have a considerable role in the region’s energy sector—but are confined to oil and gas. Similarly, ASEAN’s own governments have powerful domestic fossil companies, such as Petronas in Malaysia, that they can leverage. Renewable energy, however, is heavily dominated by China.

China has been the single-most significant investor in ASEAN’s power sector. From 2015 to 2024, China accounted for 31.9 percent of all foreign direct investment in the generation and transmission of electricity and gas (excluding pipelines), according to data provided by ASEAN. Intra-ASEAN FDI provides a shade more, but much of this comes from the international financial entrepôt of Singapore. Japan, South Korea, and to a lesser extent Europe have played noticeable roles, too. Meanwhile, the United States seems to have almost quit the field—even before the onset of President Donald Trump’s second term.

While more detailed breakdowns are not easily available, a variety of datasets suggest that Chinese dominance in energy is only set to grow.

Take, for example, solar panels, where China’s leadership is now a truism. Between 2010 and 2024, China produced

[TITLE]Your electric bill has replaced the price at the pump as the hot-button, political bellwether:
[TEXT]
Soaring electric and utility bills nationwide are the new political bellwether for consumers heading into a pivotal 2026 midterm election cycle for the first time in recent history. They replace the typical hot-button items of fuel prices and grocery costs—eggs, most notably, last year.

While costly grid and severe weather upgrades have accounted for many of the price hikes of late, utility bills are projected to continue spiking for years to come because of the AI-driven data center boom and surging natural gas exports driving demand for new power generation and more fossil fuels.

“It’s become very clear that we’re entering a new era of politics in America, which is a new politics of electricity,” Charles Hua, executive director of the nonprofit PowerLines, told Fortune. “This is a new political force that is here to stay, and all politicians and policymakers will need to have a response for how they’re going to lower utility bills.”

Electricity and natural gas for heating and cooking are now the leading pressures on inflation in 2025, even exceeding food and grocery costs, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.

Residential electricity prices have skyrocketed almost 30% since 2021. As of the end of August, electricity costs are up more than 6% in 2025 from the prior year, while piped natural gas costs jumped close to 13%, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

“The pace at which utility bills have risen is really quite staggering,” Hua said. “People really feel powerless because they feel like they have no choice but to pay. We’re seeing a breaking point where people are so frustrated and confused as to why their bills are going up that they feel they have no choice but to make their voices heard.”

Utility prices were major issues in Democratic election wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and beyond in early November. Democrats in Georgia ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s normally sleepy Public Service Commission elections. A restaurant in Indiana even recently announced it would stop serving utility workers as a protest.

But the focus has already pivoted to the 2026 elections that will determine control of Congress, and many state races. What is historically a more localized or regional utility issue has spread nationwide.

Apart from pass-on costs from wholesale electricity or natural gas, utility prices are largely determined by rates approved at state levels. Rate hikes are typically implemented for new power generation and grid upgrades. But, in the first three quarters of 2025, utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled over $34 billion nationwide, more than double the $16 billion from the same period in 2024, which was already a record high, according to PowerLines.

Utility costs aren’t always very transparent, but the increases are so large that consumers realize much more of their incomes are going to their electric and heating bills.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy and a leading expert on prices at the pump, says the shift in perception is noticeable. “Consumers always complain
