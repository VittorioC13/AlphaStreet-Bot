[TITLE]Indian IT sees pockets of H2 recovery in US, EU as BFSI revs up:
[TEXT]
India’s IT services exporters showed pockets of recovery in the second quarter in North America and Europe, with renewed momentum for the industry’s largest vertical – the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector.This helped offset the lingering pressure from telecom, retail and automotive clients.Healthy deal bookings, rise in headcount and protected margins signalled a stronger outlook for the second half of the ongoing fiscal year ending March 2026, showing a slow recovery from a prolonged global technology spending slump of the past three years for the $283 billion outsourcing industry.“In the Americas, BFSI has turned into a real growth engine,” tech research firm ISG said in an analyst call. “Banks are reporting record earnings this quarter, which could lead to a loosening of discretionary technology spending.”Industry executives and analysts view the Q2 results as a pivot point. Even as large clients are still in wait-and-watch mode, smaller transformation deals and AI projects are increasing greenshoots in tech spending cycles.This reflected in the performance of India’s second and third largest software exporter Infosys and HCLTech , which led the industry's revenue growth rate exceeding 5% sequentially, and YoY gains of more than 8% and 10%, respectively.Defying market uncertainties, both companies projected optimistic guidance raising their full-year guidance, with HCLTech lifting its services revenue projection to 4-5% from 3-5%, while Infosys increased its lower band to 2-3% from 1-3%. Wipro posted modest revenue growth and dip in profit numbers, also improved its sequential guidance of -0.5% to +1.5% growth in Q3.Bellwether Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) posted more modest gains of 3.2% quarter-on-quarter and 2.4% year-on-year, with CEO K Krithivasan highlighting that BFSI continues to grow globally, particularly in North America. “And similarly, if you look at Europe, it has done well compared to last quarter,” said an analyst.Noting reduced project deferrals, Krithivasan, in an interview with ET , added, “There is a small, positive bias in terms of the commentary. Last quarter, we did report

Japanese luxury beauty products maker Shiseido may evaluate manufacturing in India as it scales up, joining global peers such as Estee Lauder Companies and The Body Shop , which are also in talks with local partners to kickstart or step up production in the country and tap into the world’s fastest-growing market in the segment.“Local manufacturing would get the company inherent advantages, including lower duties, in the rapidly expanding India market,” Sanjay Sharma, country head of Shiseido Group in India, told ET. “It’s a global decision and will depend on scale which we will evaluate.” The brand currently imports its entire range.India’s luxury beauty products market is estimated to expand to $4 billion in sales by 2035, from $800 million in 2023, at a time when China is facing economic headwinds and dampened consumer spending in the segment, according to a report by consulting firm Kearney , along with luxury products retailer LuxAsia. “As scale builds up, makers of luxury cosmetics are starting to make in India,” Sharma said. “A few have already set up such facilities,” he added, though he declined to specify a time frame for starting manufacturing in the country.The past year alone has seen luxury beauty labels Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez, Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty, Anomaly by Priyanka Chopra, H&M Beauty and Dubai’s Huda Beauty entering the Indian market.“We have enquiries from two global celebrity-owned luxury beauty brands to find local partners to make in India,” an executive at a Delhi-based cosmetics importer said on condition of anonymity. “Even if these would likely be third-party associations to begin with, the global brands are looking for partnerships that are exclusive, for mid-tier pricing.”US’ Estée Lauder Companies , which owns Mac Bobbi Brown and Clinique, and the UK’s The Body Shop, which sells imported cosmetics in India through its local partner Quest Retail, along with other global brands such as Kiehl’s, Avon, Kylie Cosmetics and Max Factor, too are in the process of finalising manufacturing partners in the country.Estee Lauder, which has nine global production sites across the US, Europe and Japan, has already launched some limited-edition products made in India through a third party. Its global president and chief executive Stéphane de La Faverie had said at a Barclays Consumer Staples conference in September that the cosmetics maker had approved a “massive investment” in India to cater to increasing aspirational demand. Without specifying the amount of investment, he had said, “In India, one of the winning strategies has been the deployment of small sizes. The ability to bring luxury products at a mass affordable price points, is going to be critical for us to win in the market.”An executive at an American cosmetics firm, who declined to be identified since he is not an authorised spokesperson, said, “We have started making two lip colour lines and foundation in India, and we sold during Diwali at prices 25% lower than our imported lines.”Shiseido’s other flagship brand in India, French label Nars Cosmetics, recently entered into retail partnerships with online platforms Reliance Retail’s Tira and Nykaa, and set up its second standalone store.The luxury beauty products segment is classified on the basis of pricing, with products priced above $15 (

FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines started pouring customers Champagne Bollinger in its top-tier lounges and cabins this fall. But at headquarters, it's not time to celebrate — yet. American has fallen behind large rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines in the post-Covid luxury travel boom that has taken Seoul spa vacations and 40th birthday bashes abroad out of the chat and armed millions of consumers with high-end rewards credit cards. In the first nine months of this year, Delta made $3.8 billion and United made $2.3 billion. American made $12 million. That means that American, which offers more flights than any other airline, according to OAG, accounted for just 2% of the profit the biggest three U.S. carriers generated so far in 2025. American ranked last in a J.D. Power's North American airline customer satisfaction ranking this year. The carrier has also been working to undo damage from a failed business-travel sales strategy. And American, which branded itself the "on-time machine" in the 1980s, in the first half of this year ranked ninth out of 10 airlines for on-time arrivals, according to the Department of Transportation. The airline is trying to change all of that and uplift its brand after strategy errors, some skittishness

[TITLE]From Delhi to small towns, one-size-fits-all planning is failing India’s cities. Here’s what must change:
[TEXT]
India’s cities and towns are acutely feeling the strain of weak planning, as visible in infrastructure and governance systems that are one-size-fits-all and not context-specific. In my previous article ‘ Indian cities are in urgent need of a complete systems overhaul ’ ( Mint , 23 April 2025), I made a case for a systems approach to cities focused on three city-systems: planning and design, participatory governance and state capacities.

In this piece, I detail three measures to strengthen local governments, unlock more effective planning and governance, and ensure India’s urbanization translates into better outcomes for all.

Reorient MoHUA and state urban departments for local governance and regional development: At present, the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) dedicates most of its resources and efforts to disbursing funds to states and urban local governments (ULGs or municipalities) through Finance Commission grants and missions such as AMRUT, Swachh Bharat and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.

This has made it, in effect, a schemes-and-infrastructure ministry, rather than one focused on the planning, economy and governance of cities.

Also Read | Urban renewal: Indian cities need a governance overhaul

MoHUA also oversees organizations such as the Central Public Works Department, National Buildings Construction Corp (NBCC) and the Delhi Development Authority, all of which follow mandates that mostly relate to infrastructure and service delivery, not governance. However, MoHUA’s department of local self government, which was envisaged to strengthen urban local self-governments, remains all but defunct.

By contrast, rural India has the ministry of panchayati raj (MoPR), whose principal mandate is to strengthen panchayati raj institutions and, through them, local governance systems and processes in villages. MoPR is distinct from the ministry of rural development, which focuses on schemes covering rural employment, housing and roads.

To make MoHUA fit for purpose, it should be reorganized along two dimensions:

First, a regional/typology focus: Efforts must be adapted to the diversity of our cities, which range from metropolitan areas (with 4 million-plus populations) and cities in large urbanized states (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat) to those in large less-urbanized states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal), small urbanized states (Goa), small less-urbanized states (Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh) and hill states (Uttarakhand and Northeast states).

This would lead to greater place-based specialization and an integrated approach across the three Es of economic growth and job creation, environment sustainability and equitable access to opportunities, urban infrastructure and services, unlike the current approach, which over-indexes urban infrastructure.

Sectoral expertise needs to be deployed as well. Specialized divisions in critical infrastructure areas such as mobility, water and sanitation and housing should be staffed with an adequate number of empowered subject-matter experts, rather than token advisors. This would differ from the current way that sectoral schemes are handled.

These principles apply to state governments as well. Many states have separate departments for housing and urban planning and for municipal administration, with development authorities and parastatals under the former while municipalities report to the latter. This creates further avoidable fragmentation.

Adopt a differentiated approach to governance for metropolitan, emerging and small cities: Urban governance in India remains largely one-size-fits-all at both the Union and state levels. Yet, the 2011 Census reveals a clear pattern: we have 45 cities with populations above 1 million; 470 cities with headcounts between 100,000 and 1 million, and

[TITLE]Bangladesh Now Aligns With China, India Worries:
[TEXT]
China has long aimed to be the top dog in Asia. Historically, the Chinese have called their state Zhōngguó, which literally means the Middle Kingdom. For centuries, China was the dominant global economy and the most powerful empire in the world. Beijing sees itself as reclaiming its rightful position in the world after the century of humiliation that began with the First Opium War (1839–1842) and ended with the defeat of Japan in World War II (1945).

The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission tells us that China’s strategy in South Asia is to check the rise of India. To do so, Beijing is exploiting the India-Pakistan rivalry. It is also cultivating influence among other South Asian countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

The China-Pakistan relationship is well known. Not so well-known is the fact that China has deepened its relationship with Bangladesh. Beijing has entwined itself deeply into Bangladesh’s economy, infrastructure, digital systems and security matrix.

The courting of Dhaka: How the Dragon slipped in

Bangladesh was born in 1971 thanks to India’s going to war against Pakistan. Thanks to its role in liberating Bangladesh, India earned much goodwill in the young nation on the Bay of Bengal. Relations between the two countries remained close for decades.

Warning signs for the India-Bangladesh relationship appeared as early as 2004. That year, China replaced India as Bangladesh’s “top source of imports.” One of these was cotton, a key ingredient for Bangladesh’s booming textile industry that churns out jeans, t-shirts, shirts, etc, for Western retailers like Costco, Walmart and Amazon.

Bangladesh has given China special economic zones, such as one in the strategic port city of Chittagong and the other in the national capital of Dhaka. China has also invested and continues to invest in roads, bridges, power plants and ports. Bangladesh became the first country in South Asia to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Dhaka and the two countries, upgrading the China-Bangladesh relationship to “a strategic cooperative partnership.” Since 2016, Chinese investment has flowed into Bangladesh. As in many other parts of the world, China is involved in huge infrastructure projects. Importantly, China has a near-monopoly in high-tech construction and a key presence in key transportation corridors.

Early this year, Bangladesh made a major foreign policy shift. Under Sheikh Hasina, the previous leader who was ousted by street protests in July-August 2024, Bangladesh walked the diplomatic tightrope, balancing India and China. Wahiduzzaman Noor and Samantha Wong of the Atlantic Council point out that China became Bangladesh’s top trading partner during the last ten years of Hasina’s rule. Worryingly for India, China also became Bangladesh’s top supplier of military hardware. Yet Hasina was able to keep India onside. It helped that her party had historic links with India. Her father was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh, who began the Awami League, and Hasina inherited his legacy.

Since Hasina was ousted, relations between Bangladesh and India have steadily and dramatically deteriorated. Historically, every new Bangladeshi leader has made India the first foreign destination after taking power. Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of the Bangladeshi interim government, broke with tradition and made his first state visit to Beijing, not Delhi. Bangladesh has now very publicly made a “pivot toward China.”

Closer Bangladesh-China relations threaten India

The March 2025 Yunus Beijing visit has led to increased Chinese investments in Bangladesh. Yunus secured $2.1 billion in investments, loans and grants. Notably, the Chinese will invest $400 million to modernize Mongla Port. This is Bangladesh’s second-largest seaport, and just before Hasina was defenestrated, India had secured operating rights to a terminal at Mongla. Last year, India scored “a strategic win” in the port wars of the two Asian giants. In March, China came out tops.

Chinese investment in Mongla raises Indian concerns because it is part of Beijing’s “String of Pearls” strategy. China is building the ports of Chittagong in Bangladesh, Gwadar in Pakistan, Colombo and Hambantota in Sri Lanka, Marao in the Maldives, Kyaukpyu in Myanmar, Lamu in Kenya and Bagamoyo in Tanzania. Beijing claims that these facilities are for commercial use, but in the future, the Chinese navy could use these ports as naval bases or logistical hubs. This geopolitical string of pearls contains India and ties up China’s populous southern neighbor in its own backyard.

China will also help Bangladesh in the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project. This alarms India. Originating in the Indian state of Sikkim, the Teesta flows into Bangladesh, and its water secures the lives and livelihoods of millions of Bangladeshis. India has built the Teesta Barrage to generate electricity and supply water to farmers in the state of West Bengal (note that West Bengal and Bangladesh were both part of the state of Bengal in British India till independence in 1947). Both India and Bangladesh want more of Teesta’s water. A population explosion since independence means that northern West Bengal and northern Bangladesh have a greater demand for water. The Teesta Water Dispute is one of the rising number of geopolitical tensions over water.

There is another matter of critical geopolitical importance of which coon of the authors has considerable personal experience. The first author served extensively in India’s northeast and commanded Assam Rifles, a body of troops engaged in the region. India’s northeast is connected to the rest of India through what has come to be known as the “Chicken’s Neck.” This 20–22 kilometer stretch of land surrounded by Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh is a key choke point for India, akin to the Strait of Malacca for China. Exacerbating Indian concerns

[TITLE]The Race to Recycle Renewable Energy:
[TEXT]
With the renewable energy sector growing rapidly on a global scale, as many governments pursue a green transition, the need to recycle more components has become evident. Finding innovative ways to recycle renewable energy equipment could help significantly cut costs and reduce waste, further supporting the sector’s green ambitions. There is great potential for a range of components to be reused and recycled, from solar panels to wind turbines and electric vehicle (EV) batteries. However, greater research and investment must be contributed to the sector to improve practices and make recycling options more accessible. As interest and investment in renewable energy increase, we are seeing more technological advancements across the sector. Wind turbines have become bigger and more powerful, while solar panels have been getting cheaper and more efficient. This means that old technologies are becoming outdated more quickly, leading to their replacement. Once a renewable energy component reaches the end of its lifecycle, it is normally removed and replaced by something bigger, stronger, and better. What is done with these old components varies massively from country to country.

Often, old turbine blades or photovoltaic (PV) panels are stockpiled for long periods of time as companies decide what to do with them. Waste from the renewable energy sector is significant, with Europe expected to dismantle around 14,000 wind turbines by the end of the decade. This would result in between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of blade waste, according to WindEurope. Meanwhile, in the United States, wind turbine blade waste could reach anywhere between 200,000 to 370,000 tonnes a year by 2050.

Greater innovation in recycling could help reduce waste and cut costs by putting old components to good use. However, recycling old renewable energy parts is not always so simple. Steel and other materials that can be easily recycled account for around 85 to 90 percent of the makeup of a wind turbine, but the glass fibre or carbon fibre blades are much more complicated to recycle. The difficulties in recycling have not put operators off, with more innovative solutions being seen year on year. In a bid to become more sustainable, after years of discarding old blades and other components, several wind firms have pledged to invest in recycling operations to prevent old components from going to landfill.

In Scotland, old blades from the Hagshaw Hill windfarm are being recycled to provide a hybrid polymer to be used to produce precast concrete alternatives or replace virgin plastics. Meanwhile, Spanish energy firm Iberdrola aims to transform 10,000 tonnes of blade waste annually at its blade recycling facility on the Iberian Peninsula. It will use glass fibres and resins from the turbines to produce new blades to be used across a range of sectors, from aerospace to construction.

Related: Spain’s Clean Energy Dilemma

In the solar energy sector, various innovations are being seen. For example, in Brisbane, Australia, solar panels are being transformed into silver and copper. Operators are removing aluminium and wires from PVs that can no longer produce energy to grind them up into plastic, glass, silicon, silver, and copper. Pan Pacific Recycling is now processing around 30,000 panels a year and hopes to eventually increase its annual capacity to 240,000 panels.

Global solar panel waste is currently far higher than the recycling capacity for this waste, meaning that greater investment is needed in the sector to expand capacity and improve sustainability by preventing old solar panels from going to landfill. In addition, experts suggest that many of the solar panels being replaced with more efficient models are still capable of producing energy and could be reused in a different context rather than discarded. Several startups, such as Australian Second Life Solar, are working to encourage the reuse of old solar panels in alternative settings to provide clean energy and prevent unnecessary waste.

Some of the greatest advancements have been seen in EV battery recycling, as companies worldwide strive to improve their critical mineral supply chains. The lithium supply used for EV battery production is finite, meaning that once supplies are depleted, we will no longer be able to produce this type of battery. However, extracting the lithium from old EV batteries could allow EV makers to reuse the critical mineral, rather than relying wholly on mining projects for their lithium supply. Other minerals that can be extracted from these batteries include nickel, cobalt, and graphite.

Various companies from different regions of the world are now investing in expanding and improving recycling practices, although the industry’s recycling capacity still falls far behind the production of new wind turbine blades and solar panels, suggesting that greater funding is needed to accelerate the global component recycling capacity. In addition, governments could encourage companies to invest in recycling activities by introducing stricter rules and regulations on renewable energy waste, thereby helping the industry to become more sustainable.

The European Union is developing a new plan to curb its reliance on Chinese critical raw materials , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday, as she criticised Beijing for its expanded restrictions on the export of rare earths.The European Union has for years attempted to reduce its dependence on China for the minerals that are needed for the transition to cleaner energy, the defence sector and electric vehicle production.Von der Leyen said the EU would seek to speed up critical raw materials partnerships with countries such as Australia, Canada, Chile, Greenland, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine.The plan would also include greater efforts to recycle critical raw materials in products sold in Europe, she said."The aim is to secure access to alternative sources of critical raw materials in the short, medium and long term for our European industries," she told a conference in Berlin. The scheme, called RESourceEU , would be similar to a plan the EU developed after Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine to cut its reliance on Russian energy, known as REPowerEU, she said."We will focus on everything from joint purchasing to stockpiling. We will boost investment in strategic projects for the production and processing of critical raw materials here in the European Union," she added.On October 9, China imposed export restrictions on rare earths and battery materials. Western governments and analysts view the increased curbs as part of China's response to trade tariffs imposed by the United States.But von der Leyen said it also had a huge impact on Europe, in industrial sectors, including automotive, defence, aerospace, AI chips and data centres. "If you consider that over 90% of our consumption of rare earth magnets comes from imports from China, you see the risks here for Europe and its most strategic industrial sectors," she said."In the short term, we are focusing on finding solutions with our Chinese counterparts. But we are ready to use all of the instruments in our toolbox to respond if needed," she said.

[TITLE]Airbus, Leonardo, Thales Join Forces to Reshape European Space Landscape:
[TEXT]
Three of Europe’s largest aerospace and defense companies are joining forces to reshape the continent’s space industry. Airbus, Leonardo, and Thales have signed a memorandum of understanding to merge their space operations into a new joint venture that will unify much of Europe’s satellite, communications, and Earth-observation capabilities under one organization.

The new company will bring together Airbus’s Space Systems and Space Digital businesses, Leonardo’s Space Division—including its holdings in Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space—and Thales’s stakes in Thales Alenia Space, Telespazio, and Thales SESO. Based on pro‑forma 2024 figures, the venture will employ around 25,000 people, generate roughly €6.5 billion in annual revenue, and carry an order backlog covering more than three years of projected sales. Ownership will be split with Airbus holding 35% and Leonardo and Thales each holding 32.5%, with a balanced governance structure under joint control.

The companies anticipate the combination could generate mid‑triple‑digit million‑euro annual synergies within five years of closing, mainly through operational efficiencies in engineering, manufacturing, and project management. The merger will focus on end‑to‑end space infrastructure and services but will exclude launch vehicles. The venture is expected to be operational in 2027, subject to employee consultations and regulatory approvals.

Why This Consolidation Matters

The new joint venture represents a major step in consolidating Europe’s fragmented space industry. By unifying three established aerospace and defense leaders, the company aims to achieve the scale and expertise needed to compete more effectively with global players, including SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin. The merger also aligns with Europe’s broader goal of strategic autonomy, reducing reliance on non-European technology for critical capabilities such as secure satellite communications, navigation, and defense intelligence.

Yet one notable absence from this consolidation is OHB, a German aerospace company with a strong track record in satellite development. This makes OHB a key outlier, continuing its independent trajectory amidst the consolidation trend. Despite not joining the new venture, the company continues to pursue its own initiatives, most prominently leading the consortium for the planned Odin's Eye missile warning system—a key element of Europe’s future space-based defense architecture. This positions OHB as both a competitor and potential collaborator in the evolving European space landscape.

Potential Program Impacts

The merger is expected to influence several key European space programs:

Navigation: The new entity could take a leading role in the development, manufacturing, and sustainment of Galileo and EGNOS, Europe’s global and regional navigation systems.

Earth Observation: It is likely to become a principal contractor for Copernicus programs, providing end-to-end satellite and service solutions.

Defense and Secure Communications: The consolidation of military space assets will affect government programs such as GOVSATCOM and next-generation secure networks like IRIS².

National Military Satellites: Programs such as France’s Syracuse, Italy’s SICRAL, and the UK’s Skynet may benefit from shared technology development and cost efficiencies.

Satellite Operations and Data Services: With significant stakes in companies like Telespazio, the new venture will be positioned to influence commercial and public satellite operations and downstream data services.

By combining industrial capabilities, technical expertise, and service networks, the joint venture aims to provide a more integrated, competitive, and resilient European space presence on both commercial and government fronts.
