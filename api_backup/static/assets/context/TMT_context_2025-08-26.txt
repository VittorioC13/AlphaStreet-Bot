[TITLE]How Nvidia's chips became central to the U.S.-China trade war:
[TEXT]

When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed Friday that the company is working with the Trump administration on a new computer chip designed for sale to China, it marked the latest chapter in a long-running debate over how the U.S. should compete with China 's technological ambitions.The reasoning has sometimes changed - with U.S. officials citing national security, human rights or purely economic competition - but the tool has been the same: export controls , or the threat of them.Nvidia believes it can eventually re$50 billion from artificial intelligence chip sales in China. But it so far has been held back by restrictions imposed by President Joe Biden's administration and then reinforced by President Donald Trump before negotiating a quid pro quo deal.How did these chip export controls start? China has its own chip foundries, but they have historically supplied only low-end processors used in autos and appliances. Beginning in 2014, the Chinese government tried to change that with a new "Big Fund" that invested huge amounts of money into hundreds of semiconductor companies.Meanwhile, the U.S. government, starting in Trump's first term, began cutting off China's access to a growing array of tools to make chips for computer servers, artificial intelligence and other advanced applications.China was particularly irked when it was blocked from buying a machine available only from a Dutch company, ASML, that uses ultraviolet light to etch circuits into silicon chips. The restrictions stalled Chinese efforts to make transistors faster and more efficient by packing them more closely together on fingernail-size slivers.Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei became the public face of the trade tensions, with U.S. claims of its products' potential use for espionage a backdrop for a broader struggle for economic and technological dominance."We don't want their equipment in the United States because they spy on us," Trump said in 2020 as the administration tightened restrictions to block Huawei from accessing chip technology, at the same time as he was threatening to ban TikTok on similar grounds.Biden ups the ante on chip restrictions President Joe Biden maintained those restrictions after taking office in 2021, but also ramped them up with a series of export controls that blocked sending to China the world's most advanced chips and factory equipment.That affected Chinese sales for California chipmaker Nvidia, the leading designer of the specialized chips needed for artificial intelligence technology.After the first restrictions took effect in 2022, blocking chips including Nvidia's H100, the company designed a new kind of chip that was not quite advanced enough to meet the threshold for restrictions.The Biden administration escalated its restrictions in 2023 to block those newer chips. Then Nvidia again came out with a new kind of chip that could slip into China: the H20.Trump's back-and-forth on the H20 The Trump administration in April halted the sale of the H20 and other advanced computer chips to China over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of their chips, which are used in AI development.After taking a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during the February-April period, Nvidia estimated the export crackdown in China would cost the company another $8 billion in potential sales from May through July.The squandered opportunities fueled Huang's efforts to persuade Trump and other administration officials that the restraints would do more harm than good for the U.S."The question is not whether China will have AI, it already does," Huang told analysts during a conference call in late May. "The question is whether one of the world's largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position."Nvidia and AMD also agreed in August to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. government, as part of a deal to secure export licenses for the semiconductors.

The US government has taken an $8.9 billion, 9.9% stake in Intel, buying 433.3 million shares in the chipmaker at a price of $20.47 per share. Via Yahoo News:

The government’s investment in Intel will be passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights, Intel said in a statement. Intel said the government also agreed to vote with the company's Board of Directors.

Sure, except when Trump picks up the phone and tells you what to do!

Intel said the government's equity stake will be funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded but not yet paid to Intel under the US CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program. Intel will continue to deliver on its Secure Enclave obligations and reaffirmed its commitment to delivering trusted and secure semiconductors to the US Department of Defense. The $8.9 billion investment is in addition to the $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants Intel has received to date, making for a total investment of $11.1 billion.

[TITLE]AT&T announces $43 billion deal to merge WarnerMedia with Discovery:
[TEXT]
Shares of Discovery were up as much as 9% Monday morning before falling 5% at the end of regular trading. AT&T's stock price fell 2%.

If approved by regulators, the deal effectively reverses AT&T's years-long plan to combine content and distribution in a vertically integrated company. The companies said the deal is expected to close in the middle of 2022.

AT&T said it would receive an aggregate amount of $43 billion in a combination of cash, debt and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&T shareholders would receive stock representing 71% of the new company, while Discovery shareholders would own 29%, it added.

Under the agreement, AT&T will unwind its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which closed just under three years ago and form a new media company with Discovery. The deal would create a new business, separate from AT&T, that could be valued at as much as $150 billion, including debt, according to The Financial Times .

Telecom giant AT&T announced Monday a deal to combine its content unit WarnerMedia with Discovery , paving the way for one of Hollywood's biggest studios to compete with media giants Netflix and Disney .

AT&T said Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav will lead the new company, which will have a new name announced in coming days. The board would consist of 13 members, seven initially appointed by AT&T including the chair, and Discovery would appoint six members, including Zaslav.

"It is super exciting to combine such historic brands, world class journalism and iconic franchises under one roof and unlock so much value and opportunity," Zaslav said, adding that AT&T and Discovery's assets "are better and more valuable together."

The new firm's singular mission, Zaslav said, is "to focus on telling the most amazing stories and have a ton of fun doing it."

However, the future of WarnerMedia's current CEO, Jason Kilar, is uncertain. On a press call Monday morning following the announcement, Stankey said Kilar still holds his title, but it will be up to Zaslav to decide if Kilar still has a job with the new company.

AT&T owns CNN, HBO and Warner Bros. after it acquired Time Warner, since renamed to WarnerMedia. Discovery's channels include Animal Planet, TLC and the Discovery Channel.

Zaslav said on the press call Monday that he believes the combined company will be able to differentiate itself from top streaming services like Disney+ and Netflix by offering a combination of news and sports on top of its entertainment properties like "Game of Thrones" and Harry Potter.

Zaslav also expressed confidence in CNN, which some had speculated would be spun off from WarnerMedia. Zaslav said Monday his new company plans to keep CNN with the intention "to take everything we have in news, combine it with CNN and be a world leader in news."

Stankey and Zaslav said the two companies already spend a combined $20 billion per year on content, putting them in the same realm as Netflix, which currently spends about $17 billion on content per year. In an interview Monday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street," Zaslav said he has a goal for his new company to reach up to 400 million streaming subscribers across the world, up from the 100 million subscribers the two separate companies have today.

Zaslav also said on "Squawk on the Street" that the deal was possible now after Stankey collected many of WarnerMedia's various media properties under a single brand instead of selling its content to third parties like it had done before the AT&T acquisition.

"John had the vision to bring all that content together," Zaslav said.
