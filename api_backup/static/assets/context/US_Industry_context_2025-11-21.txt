[TITLE]Toyota CEO goes full MAGA at NASCAR event as carmaker unveils $912M investment in US manufacturing:
[TEXT]
Toyota on Tuesday unveiled a $912 million investment in US manufacturing, days after CEO Akio Toyoda hosted a red, white and blue NASCAR event in Japan while sporting a Trump-Vance shirt and red MAGA hat.

The Sunday spectacle at Toyota’s Fuji Speedway featured top drivers, a crowd waving American flags and an appearance from US Ambassador to Japan George Glass, according to Automotive News.

The top Toyota exec nodded to recent US-Japan trade tensions during his bold display of pro-Trump sentiment.

“I’m not here to argue whether tariffs are good or bad. Every national leader wants to protect their own industry,” Toyoda said ahead of the endurance race.

“We are exploring ways to make tariffs a winner for everyone. The people we want most to be winners are our customers.”

Japan is facing a roughly 15% baseline tariff on auto imports, slashed down from 27.5% as part of a trade agreement in September.

“Start your engines!” Glass’ account tweeted Sunday alongside pics of him and Toyoda, who’s the grandson of Toyota Motors founder Kiichiro Toyoda. “Looking forward to celebrating the culture of [US] motorsports again next year” as part of America’s 250th-anniversary festivities in Japan, he added.

Toyota, the second-largest seller of new vehicles in the US behind General Motors, on Tuesday announced its nearly $1 billion investment will ramp up hybrid vehicle production across the Southern US.

It’s part of a previously announced plan by the Japanese automaker to invest up to $10 billion in the US by 2030, which President Trump revealed last month. Most of the investments are expected to be completed by 2027.

Toyota already leads hybrid vehicle production with more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data.

But the company is looking to further increase manufacturing of hybrid-compatible engines and vehicles at certain American facilities.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our US manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president of manufacturing operations, said in a statement.

“Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our US footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”

Of the investments announced Tuesday, the largest is $453 million toward Toyota’s Buffalo, W. Va., plant to ramp up the assembly of four-cylinder, hybrid-compatible engines.

Another $204.4 million is going toward the automaker’s Georgetown, Ky., plant to increase production of the same engines.

Toyota says it is also sending $125 million to expand production of Corolla vehicles and add hybrid vehicle production at its Blue Springs, Miss., factory.

The automaker is also investing $71.4 million in its Jackson, Tenn., plant and $57.1 million in its Troy, Mo., facility.

The investments are expected to create 252 new jobs, according to Toyota.

[TITLE]Government selects 17 projects worth ₹7,172 crore investment in electronics manufacturing:
[TEXT]
The Centre on Monday approved 17 projects entailing around ₹7,172 crore investment across six categories under the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS), underlining India’s resolve and its decisive push into producing high-value components.

These projects will lead to production of electronics worth ₹65,111 crore and 11,808 direct jobs cumulatively.

The ECMS would drive the next phase of value chain integration and steer India’s electronics manufacturing to $500 billion by 2030–31, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw said here.

The approved units are spread across nine states -- Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh, reinforcing the government’s commitment to balanced regional growth and creation of high-skill jobs beyond metropolitan clusters, he said.

The second tranche of the scheme includes a wide range of components and sub-assemblies, such as India’s first-ever Optical Transceiver (SFP) manufacturing facilities by Jabil Circuit India and Zetchem Supply Chain Services; Oscillators for precise timing applications in communication devices, computers, and industrial electronics by Rakon India Private Limited; high-end precision enclosures for laptops and smartwatches by Aequs Consumer Products; and camera modules by ASUX Safety Components, Uno Minda Limited, and Syrma Mobility.

Meanwhile, talking about electronics manufacturing in India, Vaishnaw said that developing design teams is crucial for long-term success and global competitiveness because the way geo-economics are emerging, the challenges will be bigger.

He also urged the industry to focus on getting six sigma quality in every product that they manufacture and support each other in the process.

“Make sure that you hold hands and get them up the value chain. That will define your success in the coming years because sooner or later when the world the way geopolitics, the way geo-economics are emerging, the challenges will be bigger and in those challenging periods your ability to have a good control of the supply chain behind you will define your resilience and will define your ability to compete during the difficult times,” Vaishnaw said.

He added that with schemes like ECMS, India could get some of the global large manufacturers of finished products into the country, and that has given the opportunity to create the market and demand for components.

On quality manufacturing, he said, already the manufacturing sector has created new standards, especially in the automobile sector, aerospace sector, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, where the quality is today compared with the global benchmarks.

The government also continues to focus on skilling of youth using these facilities and capabilities. “Hopefully very soon we’ll come out with a new skilling framework also for electronics manufacturing where we will be tying up with certain organisations who have done very good work in the social fields,” he added.

[TITLE]Canada stuck in ‘vicious circle’ of low productivity, Bank of Canada says:
[TEXT]
Open this photo in gallery: The Bank of Canada's deputy governor Nicolas Vincent made the case on Wednesday that Canada is facing a 'systemic problem' when it comes to productivity.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

The Bank of Canada said the country is “stuck in a vicious circle” of low productivity and suggested lowering the regulatory burden for companies and increasing competition as part of a co-ordinated push to improve the country’s growth prospects.

In a speech on Wednesday, deputy governor Nicolas Vincent made the case that Canada is facing a “systemic problem” when it comes to productivity – which can be understood as output per worker, or how efficiently labour and capital are combined to produce goods.

Canada’s productivity growth has lagged peer countries for the past two decades, leaving Canadians poorer than they would otherwise be and the economy less resilient to shocks, such as a sharp protectionist turn from our largest trading partner. This, he said, is the result of structural problems that lead to low business investment, limit competition and prevent companies from growing.

“To put it bluntly, we’re stuck in a vicious circle. When productivity is weak, it’s much harder to meet current challenges and seize opportunities for the future,” he told a group of economists in Quebec City, according to the English text of his speech.

“There is no quick or easy way to improve productivity, and no single sector can do it alone. The challenge is complex, and long-standing structural issues are at play. If we want to fix this, we’ll need to be thoughtful, systematic and resolute.”

Opinion: Waste, not the cost of labour, is at the root of our productivity problem

Fed minutes show officials were divided on October rate cut

This is the latest attempt by the Bank of Canada to put a spotlight on the country’s weak productivity growth. In a 2024 speech, senior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers called it a “break-the-glass” emergency, touching off a national conversation

[TITLE]O5 Group Buys Retail Building Across From Penn Station for $30M:
[TEXT]
O5 Group, a real estate investor and manager, has acquired a retail building across the street from Midtown’s Penn Station.

New York-based O5 Group, which rebranded from Oved Group in 2022 and specializes in apparel, real estate and finance, purchased the three-story building at 425 Seventh Avenue from United Pacific Development for $30 million, according to city records made public Wednesday.

Ralph Dweck, an attorney at Wachtel Missry, signed the deal for the buyer, which used the entity FO 425 Seventh Avenue, while Sze Chan signed for the seller, records show.

It’s unclear who brokered the deal. A spokesperson for O5 Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Chan could not be reached for comment.

United Pacific bought the property between West 33rd and West 34th streets — and across Seventh Avenue from Penn Station — in 2006 for $4.1 million, property records show. The low-rise building’s ground-floor retail space is currently home to Rose’s Pizza.

It’s unclear what O5 Group plans to do with its new property, but the company owns nearly 10 other retail properties throughout New York City in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, according to its website.

News of the deal also comes after a slew of big leasing news near Penn Station, an underground train and subway hub in New York City that is said to be the busiest transportation facility in the Western Hemisphere.

Earlier this month, fintech firm Robinhood signed a sublease for 125,392 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust’s Penn 2, which sits above the train hall, as Commercial Observer previously reported. At the same time, Dick’s Sporting Goods signed a lease for 125,284 square feet of office space at Penn 2, while fintech firm Current took more than 62,000 square feet at the property.

This latest acquisition is a strategic investment to further align our capital deployment with our thesis on the drybulk market and specifically the Capesize and Newcastlemax sector. Moving ahead, Genco’s significant financial strength positions us to act decisively to capture attractive growth opportunities while further reducing debt and paying sizable dividends to shareholders.”

[TITLE]Shutdown deal adds $850M for B-21, Sentinel construction projects:
[TEXT]
This story has been updated to include a statement from the Air Force.

As lawmakers negotiated an end to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, they added hundreds of millions of dollars for projects related to the B-21 bomber and Sentinel ICBM programs.

The three-bill funding package signed into law on Wednesday night gives the Air Force $3.9 billion for military construction projects, some $204 million above the service’s 2026 budget request. And it includes more than $850 million for flexible spending beyond the continuing resolution for at least 11 projects related to the B-21 and Sentinel.

The allocations for military construction show continued bipartisan support for the Air Force’s nuclear modernization efforts, which have seen massive cost overruns on the Sentinel effort and shutdown-stalled talks

[TITLE]Doroni Aerospace Launches a Reg CF Raise to Accelerate Commercial Production of H1-X Personal Aircraft:
[TEXT]
Coral Springs, USA, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FAA-Certified Aviation Startup Is Raising Capital to Deliver the First Generation of Personal eVTOL Aircraft in $1T+ Urban Air Mobility Market

Doroni Aerospace, the advanced air mobility company pioneering personal electric flight, has launched a new Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) raise to scale toward commercial production of its flagship personal eVTOL aircraft, the Doroni H1-X.

After eight years of R&D and rigorous flight testing, Doroni has developed a first-of-its-kind personal aircraft designed for everyday people. With intuitive controls and advanced safety systems, the H1-X is positioned to become a breakthrough in the $1 trillion Urban Air Mobility (UAM) sector.

With the H1-X showroom model nearly completed and set to debut early next year, this new capital raise supports Doroni’s transition from prototyping to production. FAA-certified and already approved for manned flight testing, Doroni is building for a future where short-distance air travel is safe, personal, and practical.

The H1-X is engineered for real-world use, built to fit in a two-car garage and takeoff and land directly from driveways. From there, it can reach top speeds of 120 mph, travel up to 100 miles on a single charge, and recharge in as little as 25 minutes. With enclosed ducted fans instead of exposed propellers, it offers increased safety and efficiency. And after just 25 hours of training, anyone can pilot this joystick-driven, user-friendly aircraft.

“While the industry races to build flying taxis, we are focused on something far more transformative: empowering individuals with the freedom of personal flight,” said Doron Merdinger, Founder & CEO of Doroni Aerospace. “We aren’t just creating a new vehicle; we are creating a new era of mobility where people take back control of their time and their travel.

Interest is already mounting. Doroni has received over 600 pre-orders, representing an estimated $175M+ in potential revenue, and is targeting first deliveries in 2028.

Regulatory advancements are now unlocking certification for personal eVTOL aircraft, making the dream of flying your own vehicle a reality. Doroni is a key player in this revolution, having successfully achieved one of the first-ever manned test flights in the U.S.

Doroni’s investment round is now open to the public. Learn more and invest at invest.doroni.io
