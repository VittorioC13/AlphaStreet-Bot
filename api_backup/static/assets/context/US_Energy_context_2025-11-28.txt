[TITLE]Genesis Energy signs exclusivity deal with Yinson for New Zealand wind projects:
[TEXT]
Genesis is also exploring offshore wind opportunities.

Genesis and Taranaki Offshore Partnership, the joint venture between the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and Copenhagen Investment Partners, have entered a memorandum of understanding to assess future offshore opportunities.

“With our ownership in the Kupe JV [gas well] nearby and our ability to firm renewable supply and write long-term offtakes, there is strong strategic alignment in exploring this potential together,” Hickman said.

She said Genesis – which runs the coal- and gas-powered Huntly Power Station – now had a diversified, high-quality portfolio pipeline across solar, wind, battery storage and geothermal power generation.

The company’s new solar project in Canterbury – Lauriston – is in operation, and the company this week decided to press ahead with another solar project, Edgecumbe, in Bay of Plenty.

Yinson Holdings has been listed for more than 25 years and has a market cap of about $2.5 billion.

Yinson Renewables has been developing a portfolio of onshore wind projects in New Zealand for more than four years. It has a team of experts here and a country manager.

Yinson will be responsible for the delivery of the projects and Genesis will have an ability to participate in the projects as they mature.

In addition, Genesis said consents for a development at Castle Hill in Wairarapa would allow the company to build and operate a wind farm with capacity in the order of 300MW.

“We’re building an investment case, progressing design and development activities and, subject to further due diligence, will progress the project to a final investment decision,” the company said.

Genesis reported $470 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and financial instruments (ebitdaf) for 2025, up 15% year-on-year.

The company is aiming for ebitdaf of about the mid to upper $500m level by the 2028 financial year, which chair Barbara Chapman said the company was on track to deliver.

[TITLE]Oil Prices Sink as Ukraine Agrees to Peace Deal:
[TEXT]
Traders anticipate that a peace deal could lead to the easing of sanctions on Russia's energy exports, compounding existing concerns about an already oversupplied oil market.

The agreement, which still has minor details to be sorted out, was confirmed by a U.S. official and a statement from Ukraine's Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Rustem Umerov.

Oil prices, with WTI dropping below $60 per barrel, extended losses following reports that Ukraine has mostly agreed to a peace deal with the U.S.

Oil prices extended losses early on Tuesday after news broke that Ukraine has mostly agreed to a peace deal, with “minor details” to discuss and settle.

As of 8:35a.m. ET on Tuesday, the U.S. benchmark crude futures, WTI Crude, dropped by 1.29% to further slip below $60 per barrel, at $58.08.

The international benchmark, Brent Crude, was trading down by 1.23% at $62.59.

Prices reacted to reports early on Tuesday that the U.S. plan for peace in Ukraine has received support from Ukrainians. The development added to persistent concerns about an already oversupplied oil market.

“The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,” a U.S. official told CBS News today.

“There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal,” the U.S. official added.

Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, posted on X early on Tuesday “We appreciate the productive and constructive meetings held in Geneva between the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations, as well as President Trump’s steadfast efforts to end the war.”

“Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,” Umerov added.

“We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine’s President to the US at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump.”

A peace deal that President Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could agree on as early this week is weighing on oil prices as traders expect that some sanctions on Russia’s energy industry and exports could be eased.

While Ukraine and the U.S. were negotiating in Geneva, U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi for discussions with Russian officials, sources told CBS News.

As of early Tuesday, there was no reaction or comment from Russia on a peace deal.

[TITLE]Global oil prices drop to multi-month lows amid optimism for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal – NaturalNews.com:
[TEXT]
Global oil prices drop to multi-month lows amid optimism for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal

Brent crude fell to $62.67 and WTI to $58.29 after rumors of a U.S.-brokered Russia-Ukraine ceasefire, reflecting traders' premature optimism despite unresolved geopolitical tensions.

The drop reveals how quickly oil prices react to diplomatic rumors, erasing the war-driven "risk premium" while ignoring deep-seated conflicts and political hurdles to actual peace.

Analysts warn of a projected 4 million barrel/day surplus by 2026 due to rising non-OPEC production, further pressuring prices regardless of geopolitical developments.

Proposed terms favoring Russia are politically untenable for Ukraine, while a strong U.S. dollar and weak PMI data threaten global demand, trapping oil in a volatile lower range.

New U.S. sanctions on Russian oil firms and the potential for sudden supply disruptions mean prices could spike again, exposing the fragility of the current market optimism.

In a dramatic shift that has stunned energy markets, global oil prices have plummeted to multi-month lows—a descent fueled not by a fundamental improvement in global stability, but by the fragile hope of peace.

On Friday, Nov. 21, the international benchmark Brent crude fell to $62.67 per barrel, while the U.S. standard West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped to $58.29, as traders bet on a U.S.-endorsed agreement to end the protracted Russia-Ukraine war. The drop in oil prices served as a welcome respite for consumers at the gas pump.

However, this sharp decline underscores a perilous gamble by financial markets on a geopolitical detente that remains far from certain. It also reveals the profound vulnerability of the global economy to the whims of war and diplomacy.

The immediate catalyst for the sell-off was a widely leaked draft peace plan, reportedly brokered by the U.S. administration, which proposes an end to the devastating conflict. The mere suggestion of a truce was enough to trigger a massive recalculation by traders.

For months, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has acted as a substantial risk premium baked into the price of oil, a fear tax paid by the world for the constant threat of supply disruptions from one of the planet's largest energy producers. The potential for a deal caused this premium to rapidly evaporate, as markets priced in the possibility of normalized Russian crude exports returning to global markets without the friction of wartime logistics and shadow sanctions.

Beyond the headlines of peace, a more mundane but equally powerful force is driving prices down: the fear of too much oil. Analyst Nadir Belbarka of XMArabia pinpointed rising expectations of oversupply as a core reason for the price collapse.

The International Energy Agency has projected a significant surplus of approximately four million barrels per day by 2026, driven by robust oil production growth from non-OPEC nations. This fundamental shift in the supply-demand balance suggests that even without peace, the market was already tilting toward a state of plenty, a bearish signal that has been amplified by the prospect of a geopolitical resolution.

Market mirage: Between false peace and geopolitical chaos

However, this market optimism appears dangerously premature. The proposed peace terms, which would require Ukraine to cede contested territories like Crimea and abandon its ambition to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,, have been met with profound skepticism by analysts and European allies.

The plan, widely seen as favoring Russian interests, faces monumental political hurdles in Kyiv. The notion that such a complex and painful resolution could be swiftly implemented is a triumph of hope over the grim realities of a hardened conflict. The market's celebration is, in essence, a bet on a deal that has not yet been struck, between parties whose fundamental positions remain miles apart.

Compounding the bearish sentiment are powerful macroeconomic headwinds. A strengthening U.S. dollar, driven by fading expectations of an immediate interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, thereby dampening international demand.

Furthermore, traders are anxiously awaiting key economic indicators, known as flash Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMIs), from major economies. These PMIs are a crucial barometer of economic health; weak readings could signal a looming recession, destroying demand for energy and pushing prices even lower.

In this volatile climate, analysts warn that oil is likely to remain trapped within a new, lower trading range for the remainder of the year. The market is caught in a tug-of-war between bearish fundamentals—the threat of oversupply and economic slowdown—and the ever-present potential for a bullish shock.

The recent imposition of new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil is a stark reminder that the geopolitical risk has not vanished. Rather, it has merely been temporarily overshadowed by peace talk headlines. BrightU.AI's Enoch engine warns that U.S. President Donald Trump's sanctions on the two entities risk destabilizing global energy markets by triggering secondary and third-order sanctions that could punish unintended targets, including businesses and individuals tangentially linked to Russian oil transactions.

This moment is a painful echo of past energy crises, where short-term price relief blinded policymakers and the public to underlying structural fragilities. A single breakdown in diplomacy or an unexpected supply outage could reverse the current price plunge in a matter of hours.

Watch as President Donald Trump and Hungarian PM Viktor Orban discuss Ukraine war, Russian oil and immigration.

[TITLE]Stewardess disease: 5 natural home remedies to deal with Perioral Dermatitis:
[TEXT]
Perioral dermatitis or Stewardess disease may sound like a complicated skin condition, but if you’ve ever noticed tiny bumps, redness, or a rash-like patch around your mouth, nose, or even eyes, you already know exactly how annoying it feels. It’s one of those stubborn skin issues that shows up uninvited and simply refuses to leave. And winter makes it worse - dry air, heavy creams, and constant touching of the face can easily trigger flare-ups.

While severe cases do need a dermatologist’s intervention, many mild to moderate episodes can actually be calmed at home with simple, natural remedies. These aren’t magical overnight fixes, but they help soothe inflammation, reduce redness, and prevent irritation from getting worse.

Here are five natural, gentle home remedies that your skin will genuinely thank you for.

[TITLE]Norwegian billionaire left to rue Mainstream Renewable deal as losses hit €1.2bn:
[TEXT]
Mainstream has racked up huge losses amid turbulence in its main market Chile and challenges in the green energy development sector

For Aker ASA, the Norwegian industrial powerhouse that began life as a boat builder, a deal to buy Eddie O’Connor’s Mainstream Renewable Power in January 2021 was a springboard to float one of its portfolio companies weeks later.

“Combining Mainstream’s global organisation and renewable assets with Aker’s 180-year track record of building and developing industrial companies is another step in line with our long-term strategy for value creation,” said Øyvind Eriksen, chief executive of Aker ASA.

Aker Horizons, the unit going through the initial public offering (IPO), was handed Mainstream, after the group agreed to buy a 75 per cent stake, in a deal that valued the Irish business at €900 million.

A 20 per cent spike in Aker ASA’s own shares within days of the Mainstream deal suggested investors in Oslo thought it had snapped up a bargain in the wind and solar energy developer, with projects spanning Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific.

But it was a moment many of the 600 wealthy Irish individuals who backed O’Connor when he set up the company in 2008 – with hopes he could replicate the stunning €1.8 billion achieved for Airtricity, his previous venture – had long doubted would ever arrive.

Theirs had been a hair-raising ride. The financial crisis battered initial plans, and for a decade the company survived by selling developments early – and on the cheap – to keep the lights on. Things finally turned with the transformational sale of a large wind farm project off the coast of Scotland for more than €600 million in 2018.

For O’Connor, who died early last year, the 2021 deal delivered a fifteenfold gain on the €30 million he had put into Mainstream. He and a handful of others rolled over a 25 per cent stake.

However, 60 cent of the small Irish investors opted to sell out entirely in 2021, rather than reinvest some money in the Aker Horizons deal – walking away with

[TITLE]Why an ASEAN power grid is key to tapping Southeast Asia’s green potential:
[TEXT]
The International Energy Agency reports that energy demand across Southeast Asia rose at twice the global average rate in 2024 and finds that consumption is set to double by 2050. To maintain rising living standards, economies across the region are pushing into higher-value and more energy-intense industries, data centres being one obvious example.

That creates a problem.

The ASEAN nations enjoy vast but as yet largely untapped potential for renewable energy, especially PV solar, and onshore and offshore wind. The IEA puts potential supply at 20 terawatts, roughly 55 times the region’s present generation capacity. And this energy would be cheap. But the increase in overall demand is for now far outpacing new supply from renewables. Until that changes, ASEAN nations remain dependent on rising fossil fuel imports that expose them to price risk, potential supply disruptions, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Asian corporate executives have focused recently on coping with tariffs and trade restrictions, potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical insecurity—rather than energy and power. In the latest EY-Parthenon Global CEO Outlook survey, Asia-Pacific CEOs expressed greater unease than their peers in Europe and the Americas

Green Hydrogen: An Alternative That Reduces Emissions And Cares For Our Planet

The decarbonisation of the planet is among the objectives that countries around the world have set for 2050. The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels.

Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen.

Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market

This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points:

100 % sustainable: green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production.

green hydrogen does not emit polluting gases either during combustion or during production. Storable: hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production.

hydrogen is easy to store, which allows it to be used subsequently for other purposes and at times other than immediately after its production. Versatile: green hydrogen can be transformed into electricity or synthetic gas and used for commercial, industrial or mobility purposes.

However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind:

High cost: energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain.

energy from renewable sources, which are key to generating green hydrogen through electrolysis, is more expensive to generate, which in turn makes hydrogen more expensive to obtain. High energy consumption: the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels.

the production of hydrogen in general and green hydrogen in particular requires more energy than other fuels. Safety issues: hydrogen is a highly volatile and flammable element and extensive safety measures are therefore required to prevent leakage and explosions.

Impact of green hydrogen

Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future:

Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner.

Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter.

Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

[TITLE]California Is About to Cut Power Company Profits to Historic Lows. Your Bill Will Barely Drop:
[TEXT]
Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A number of factors go into those rates, including wildfire mitigation costs. PG&E in particular has attracted the ire of California customers for its frequent rate hikes within the last year.

Baked into those bills is the return on equity, money meant to compensate shareholders for the risk of doing business. These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%. If approved, PG&E’s rate would be 9.93% (down from 10.28%), Edison would be 9.98% (down from 10.33%), and San Diego Gas & Electric would be 9.88% (down from 10.23%). These rates are not automatically guaranteed – utilities can fall short of this return if they don’t keep down costs, such as project overruns or unexpected lawsuit fees.

A small change in this rate can be a difference of millions of dollars for ratepayers. The return is a percentage of the rate base, the total value of a utility’s assets it can earn a return on; this includes projects such as building a new power plant, for example. The rate bases for California’s three large investor-owned utilities have steadily grown each year as they add new customers and projects, increasing the amount that shareholders can receive.

PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million. Had it been 1% lower, the potential return would have been $12.5 million less.

“The proposed cost of capital decision needs refinement to better reflect California’s unique risks and market realities,” said Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford. “Making those refinements in the final decision will enhance SCE’s ability to finance essential infrastructure projects for a more reliable, resilient and ready electric grid.”

PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison echoed this sentiment, saying the decision “fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems.”

[TITLE]Abu Dhabi to Fund $1 Billion Clean Energy and Grid Projects in Yemen:
[TEXT]
Abu Dhabi-based energy firm Global South Utilities (GSU) will implement solar, wind, and distribution networks expansion projects in Yemen worth $1 billion as the United Arab Emirates continues to fund energy projects in the war-torn country.

“This one-billion-dollar portfolio expands an energy system capable of supporting a larger economy and a more active market in Yemen,” GSU’s chief executive Ali Al Shimmari said in a statement carried by Reuters.

Global South Utilities (GSU) was founded with a mission to deliver sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy and water infrastructure to the Global South. The company operates power and water supply projects in Africa and the Middle East.

Earlier this year, GSU, part of Abu Dhabi’s firm Resources Investment, inaugurated the Shabwah Solar Power Plant in Yemen, which has the capacity to deliver clean electricity to 330,000 households. The Shabwah solar plant has a generation capacity of 53 megawatts (MW) and a 15 MWh battery storage system.

GSU is also expanding the Aden Solar Power Plant, which, when completed in 2026, will be capable of delivering clean power to 687,000 households in Yemen. The expansion of the Aden Solar Power Plant in Bir Ahmed will add 120 MW of capacity to the current output. Once the expansion is completed in 2026, the plant’s total capacity will reach 240 MW, making it the largest solar power project in Yemen, GSU said in August.

“Delivering clean and reliable electricity to more than one million homes in Aden and Shabwah is not just an engineering achievement, but a vital step towards improving people’s lives and strengthening economic and social stability,” GSU’s Al Shimmari told the Emirates News Agency (WAM) at the time.

The UAE noted that the projects in Yemen “underscore the UAE’s commitment, alongside its partners, to empower communities through integrated clean energy solutions that expand access to sustainable power while reducing reliance on imported fuels, reinforcing Yemen’s pathways to stability and development.”
