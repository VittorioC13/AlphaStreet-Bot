[TITLE]What BGC Group (BGC)'s Macro Hive Acquisition Means For Its Technology-Driven Growth Strategy:
[TEXT]
Earlier this month, BGC Group announced the acquisition of Macro Hive Limited, a provider of global macro market analytics and strategy, aiming to enhance its agency business and AI-driven capabilities in the Rates and FX markets.

This move signals BGC’s commitment to technology-led innovation, as Macro Hive’s leadership joins BGC to accelerate the integration of advanced analytics into its core broking and execution platform.

We'll examine how Macro Hive's AI analytics integration could reshape BGC Group's investment narrative and technology growth outlook.

Uncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward.

BGC Group Investment Narrative Recap

To own BGC Group stock, investors should have confidence in the company's ability to leverage technology and analytics to drive higher trading volumes and margins, particularly through expansions like the Macro Hive acquisition. While integrating Macro Hive’s AI-driven analytics aligns with BGC’s technology goals, this development does not materially alter the need for continued success in digital trading platforms, which remains the main catalyst, nor does it resolve the key risk of potential revenue decline if FX and rates market volatility fades.

One recent announcement that stands out is the launch of Opti Match, an electronic trading platform for U.S. dollar swaps. This innovation underscores BGC's focus on scaling its electronic trading, a central catalyst for potential margin expansion and future growth, and complements the technology push seen in the Macro Hive deal.

Yet, in contrast, investors should be mindful of the risk that if market volatility normalizes and cyclical tailwinds recede, BGC’s revenue growth could be pressured...

[TITLE]China and the US are in a race for critical minerals. African countries need to make the rules:
[TEXT]
Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defence, and aerospace systems.

The global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.

The supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almost three-quarters of the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the world’s lithium. Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.

China dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa. It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60-70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union — long-term trading partners with African nations — have also adopted policies to secure access to Africa’s resources.

The question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.

As development researchers we address this question in a special publication on the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by the Indian Council of World Affairs. In another publication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africa’s position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.

We recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasise local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.

The competition for Africa’s critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another “resource curse.”

The emerging ‘New World Order’

A Chinese-led ‘New World Order’ is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings like BRICS and South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then, over 200 agreements have been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organisations. The initiative has expanded China’s access to resources. This is often in exchange for infrastructure development that links mining regions to ports.

In Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent

[TITLE]The launch of IBM Quantum System Two is Europe’s quantum moment:
[TEXT]
When Europe looks to the East and the West, one question stands out: how can our countries come together to lead in tomorrow’s technological landscape—and in which domains should we focus our expertise? What is needed to prepare for the future?

This month, IBM will launch Europe’s first IBM Quantum System Two, our most advanced quantum computer, at the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center in San Sebastian, Spain.

While artificial Intelligence reaches a fever pitch, quantum computing is emerging as the next great technological transformation, with an estimated value of $850 billion by 2040. UNESCO even named 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. If Europe seizes this opportunity, quantum computing has the power to be a genuine differentiator for the continent, and shape our economy, and world, for the better.

Getting there will require a policy strategy that favors technological neutrality, harnesses open-source software, prioritizes funding for algorithm and application development research, and has a low barrier of access. Thankfully, Europe’s strong leadership in the physical sciences and technical expertise provides the perfect springboard.

You may ask, in a world of AI-accelerated computing capacity, why do we need quantum computers? Simply put, there are complex problems that cannot be solved by classical computers, such as simulating molecules for drug discovery and materials science and optimizing large-scale systems in finance and logistics.

This year, UK financial services group HSBC published research that demonstrated what is believed to be the world’s first-known empirical evidence of the potential value of quantum computers for solving real-world problems in algorithmic bond trading. And E.ON, one of Europe’s largest energy companies, is exploring how quantum can improve energy pricing amid volatile weather or different usage patterns from newly electrified sectors.

In addition to unlocking the maximum efficiency of energy grids and financial services, other opportunities are being explored in how quantum could optimize global shipping, and to help understand the complex chemical reactions that could lead to the discovery of new materials and medicines.

Quantum Infrastructure for Europe’s Quantum Ecosystem

The launch of Quantum System Two follows the deployment last year of our first European quantum data center with multiple installations of our best quantum computers in Germany.

Efforts in the Basque Country represent a microcosm of what could happen across all of Europe. The quantum computer at the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center in San Sebastian expands the region’s embrace of the technology that started years ago—one that has also served to unite scientists across the continent.

These rapid deployments to meet the increasing user demand are exactly what Europe needs to ensure its industries, research institutions, and governments play a leading role in the successful use of the technology. Most importantly, they will further the European Commission’s Quantum Europe Strategy, which seeks to position Europe as a global leader in quantum by 2030.

One hundred years ago, IBM got its start in Spain setting up tabulating machines for the country’s national telephone and telegraph company—peak technology at the time that was key in connecting people and enterprises. A century later, IBM offers Europe’s industries, research institutions, and governments a data center of quantum computers, and the continent’s first IBM Quantum System Two, as important pieces in an equally transformative moment. Taking action together now, the continent’s ecosystem can lead in the development of these quantum applications with advantages never before possible.
