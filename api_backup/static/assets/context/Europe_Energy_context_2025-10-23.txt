[TITLE]Full ban on Russian gas imports on the table at EU Energy Ministers’ meeting:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 20 08:26

The European Union’s initiative to fully ban the import of gas and oil from Russia, as part of its sanctions over the war in Ukraine, is expected to move to the next stage today, as the bloc’s 27 Energy Ministers are set to adopt the measure.

Meeting in Luxembourg, the ministers aim to forge a common position on the total ban before the decision is finalized in negotiations with the European Parliament.

Members of the European Parliament already voted in favor of the proposal last week, paving the way for talks with the member state capitals.

According to the plan, imports of oil, pipeline natural gas, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be entirely and permanently prohibited by 2028 at the latest.

The ban, once agreed upon in talks with the European Parliament, will be adopted by simple majority vote — meaning countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, which still import Russian gas through pipelines, will not be able to veto it.

It is not ruled out that the measure could be implemented sooner, as efforts are underway to impose a ban on Russian gas imports under the upcoming package of sanctions against Moscow.

As of 2024, Russia still accounted for roughly one-fifth of all gas imports into the EU, with an even higher share in natural gas specifically. In the first half of 2025, EU member states imported Russian gas worth nearly €4.5 billion.

The sanctions can be formally adopted once all 27 member states agree — without the involvement of the European Parliament — allowing the process to move faster.

The punitive measures are described as temporary and can be lifted once the war in Ukraine ends and Brussels no longer sees any justification for maintaining them.

At the same time, the EU’s Foreign Ministers, also meeting today in Luxembourg, will discuss developments in the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is expected to join part of their session.

The Council will also discuss a proposal to use frozen Russian assets to finance a loan aimed at providing war reparations to Ukraine, as well as the EU’s 19th package of sanctions against Russia.

The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip will also be on the agenda. Although the EU has so far been sidelined in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, European officials emphasize that the Union intends to play an active role in efforts to restore stability in the Middle East.

[TITLE]Gasoline Prices Drop Toward Pandemic-Era Lows:
[TEXT]
The national average price of gasoline dropped below $3 a gallon over the weekend, with many U.S. motorists now paying significantly less than they did a year ago. According to popular fuel savings platform GasBuddy, average national gas prices clocked in at $2.969 per gallon on Monday, 16 cents lower than a year ago while the median U.S. gas price was $2.82 per gallon. However, prices remain widely skewed depending on the states, with motorists in California paying an average of $4.624 per gallon as per the AAA, more than $2 more than in Oklahoma at just $2.557 per gallon. Even better, GasBuddy has predicted that prices will go even lower in the coming weeks, with good prospects of motorists enjoying sub-$3 prices for extended periods.

“We saw a few $2.99 days last year, but this year brings the strongest potential for extended sub-$3 prices since 2021,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “This drop is overwhelmingly being driven by the significant increase in oil production from OPEC throughout 2025, which has meaningfully rebalanced the global oil market. That, combined with weaker demand and inflation finally easing, has created the perfect environment for lower prices. While some may be quick to assign political credit, the reality is that global supply dynamics--particularly OPEC’s production decisions--have been the primary force behind the relief drivers are seeing at the pump.”

[TITLE]Russian Oil Keeps Flowing Despite U.S. and EU Pressure:
[TEXT]
President Trump has been threatening tariffs on India unless it stops buying Russian crude and the European Union has been preparing to cut off all gas imports into the bloc within two years—even against member states’ wishes. Yet the latest data shows that Russia is still exporting a lot of oil and gas—including to the EU.

Last month, China remained the biggest buyer of Russian crude oil, even as the U.S. president says that once he deals with India on that matter, he would turn to China. According to customs data cited by the South China Morning Post, China’s oil imports from Russia jumped by 4.3% on the month in September, to a total 8.29 million tons, representing 17.5% of total oil imports. On an annual basis, however, imports from Russia fell by the same percentage.

“The increased Russian oil purchases may be China’s act of defiance ahead of further talks with the US,” Xu Tianchen, senior economist with the Economist Intelligence Unit, told the SCMP in comments on the news. “I can’t see why China would give up Russian oil unless, for example, Trump is willing to remove all its tariffs on China and lift sanctions on Chinese companies.”

China does indeed not have much motivation to stop importing energy—or anything else for that matter—from Russia. It is not part of the G7 group that has tried repeatedly to decimate Russian export revenues, specifically in energy, and it shares a pragmatic approach to energy security with its neighbor India, which analysts still say will eventually bow to the Western pressure to curb Russian imports, per a new Reuters report. The analysts add that this would simply free up more discounted Russian barrels for China.

The topic of whether India will stop buying Russian crude to make President Trump happy and seal a trade deal, ridding it of import tariffs for the United States, has been hot this month. The U.S. president has demonstrated confidence that things would go his way, claiming Prime Minister Modi had essentially made a promise to that effect. Official Indian government sources have stated there have been no such promises and some analysts have noted that Indian buyers cannot simply stop buying Russian crude, which has come to account for over a third of India’s total crude oil imports.

As such, India is the second-largest buyer of Russian crude after China, just like it is the second-largest buyer of Russian coal, per the latest monthly data from a Finland-based outlet called Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air that tracks Russian energy shipments abroad. According to CREA, in financial terms, Russia’s revenues from energy exports has more or less halved since 2022—but volumes keep strong, including to the European Union.

The European Union is currently devising plans to ban all Russian natural gas imports from 2027, officials in Brussels believe it is possible, even though at least two member states—Hungary and Slovakia—do not agree with the ban and critics point to the price differential that has kept Russian gas flowing into the EU, including as liquefied gas.

In fact, per CREA figures, the European Union was the largest buyer of Russian LNG in September, with China the second-largest, followed by Japan, which has been under pressure itself from the U.S. to stop buying Russian energy commodities. The problem is that it cannot afford to—just like the EU.

Meanwhile, traders and analysts said this week that China and India will import more Russian energy commodities this month, as international prices dip and the discounts for Russian oil deepen. November is also likely to see strong imports, according to Kpler analysts, and only in December could the effects of the latest sanction push make an appearance—or not, because a good deal is a good deal and energy security matters.

[TITLE]First SMR in Alberta Could Power the Oil Sands:
[TEXT]
A study by X-energy Canada has confirmed the feasibility and benefits of repurposing an existing thermal generation site in Alberta with X-energy's small modular reactors, World Nuclear News reports.

Funded by Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), the study found that the Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is uniquely suited to Alberta's energy needs. As well as producing electricity, it is specifically designed to provide 565°C heat and steam for industrial applications, unlocking a broad range of use cases for Alberta's industrial and oil and gas sectors, the company said. The province's established supply chain capabilities are well-positioned to support the manufacturing and construction of the technology, while the Xe-100's design means it can use air-cooling systems, significantly reducing overall water usage, and offering greater siting flexibility over conventional light-water reactors.

In 2023, ERA committed $7 million for Cenovus, a Calgary-based energy company, to study the use of small modular reactors in the oil sands.

In August, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the government sees “tremendous potential” for nuclear in the province.

While Alberta does not currently have any nuclear generating capacity, in 2021 it signed a memorandum of understanding with Ontario, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan to collaborate on SMR development, and has signed MOUs with several SMR developers. According to World Nuclear News, Energy Alberta has proposed building a nuclear power plant based on large-scale Candu Monark reactors at a site in the Peace River region of northern Alberta.

Essay by Eric Worrall

“… The goal: prop up energy sources facing cost pressures from clean technology, strengthen US control …, and shut out China …”

Trump is pushing allies to buy US gas. It’s bad economics – and a catastrophe for the climate Published: October 21, 2025 6.09am AEDT

Christoph Nedopil

Director, Griffith Asia Institute and Professor of Economics, Griffith University The price of partnership with the United States has changed. Washington is now using assurances of defence and trade access to pressure allies in Europe and Asia to buy more of its fossil fuels under decades-long contracts.

The scale is immense. The European Union intends to import up to A$1.15 trillion of US energy – mostly liquefied natural gas (LNG) – by 2028. That would be more than four times its current imports, though analysts are sceptical it will eventuate. Indonesia has signed up for $24 billion in US energy imports and Japan is exploring a similar option. These deals aren’t based on free trade. They represent the Trump administration’s geopolitical play using trade and security carrots and sticks to lock in long-term fossil fuel profitability and dominance. The goal: prop up energy sources facing cost pressures from clean technology, strengthen US control of the energy flows, and shut out China, the world’s top manufacturer of clean tech. … These unfair deals will make US allies less competitive. The main use for LNG is to burn it to produce electricity. But for almost a decade, solar and and wind have been the cheapest way to produce power, consistently outcompeting all fossil fuels.

The things they believe.

The reality is the renewable transition has failed.

President Trump is not creating gas demand, there is already a big demand for gas. The only question is who satisfies that demand.

Europe was buying heaps Russian gas before they inked the latest deals with the USA, and likely still is. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars of European investment, Europe’s renewable energy systems are incapable of supplying Europe’s energy needs.

Asia is also a long term purchaser of large shipments of gas.

So why is President Trump pushing to ink long term US gas export deals with customers?

There is a simple explanation which you would think someone who studies energy economics would know about. The world will shortly be awash with new gas supplies.

The end of this decade, early 2030s at the latest, will see an enormous influx of new Argentinian gas onto the global market.

The United Arab Emirates also recently announced $150 billion dollars of new investment in gas exports.

The only nations which have dropped the ball in this rush to supply the world’s gas needs are Australia and Russia, whose incompetent leaders have been destabilising long standing gas supply relationships.

President Trump is just doing his job – he is helping US exporters to develop new business, to take advantage of the market opportunity created by the poor behavior of other gas suppliers. Trump is using whatever leverage is available to him to maximise the share of that future Asian and European gas demand which will be satisfied by US energy exports.

[TITLE]The US Wind Industry Is Still Alive And Kicking, Despite Headwinds:
[TEXT]
US President Donald Trump has targeted the nation’s own domestic wind industry for destruction, taking down thousands of businesses and many more thousands of working households along with it. Down, but not out. The wind will continue to blow long after the current occupant of the White House (or what remains of it) leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029, and wind stakeholders are already in position to pick up the pieces.

The US Wind Industry Is Still Chugging Along

Long before Trump took office earlier this year, the US wind industry was already facing pushback from fossil fuel stakeholders and local residents. A growing number of counties have passed new restrictions on wind development in recent years, and Trump’s second term in office has exposed the vulnerability of the offshore wind industry to sudden shifts in federal policy.

Still, the latest U.S. Wind Energy Monitor report from Wood Mackenzie and the organization American Clean Power indicates that the domestic wind industry still has enough wind in its sails, so to speak, to survive at least over the next five years.

The new report covers H1 (the first six months) 2025 and beyond. The H1 end of things is rather gloomy, with wind installations down 15% compared to the same period in 2024. The record looks even worse on a single-quarter basis. “The Q2 U.S. wind market installed 593 megawatts (MW), down 60% compared to Q2 2024,” the new report notes.

However, moving out of H1 and into Q3, the coming months look brighter. The new report projects that the US wind industry is on track to install 3.8 gigawatts through the first nine months of 2025, outpacing the nine-month record of 2024.

“Despite the slowdown in Q2, activity is projected to pick up, with 51% of forecasted capacity to come online in Q4, rounding out the annual 2025 total to 7.7 GW,” the report summarizes.

The US Wind Industry Is Going To Beat Coal

The US wind industry would be in a better position for future growth without the abrupt shift in federal energy policy this year, but some projects will continue to trickle through the pipeline. The new report arrives at an average figure for new wind capacity additions of 9.1 gigawatts annually through 2029, for a total of

[TITLE]Global PPA Prices Shift Dramatically for Solar and Wind:
[TEXT]
Changes in equipment costs, interest rates, and power prices have resulted in a large shift in PPA prices globally in recent years. On the cost side, breakeven prices for solar PV and onshore wind have seen very different trajectories in recent years, with global average onshore wind increasing and solar PV decreasing. We see global solar costs stabilizing within a fairly narrow range over the next five years, while wind costs are likely to push higher and have more variation around the world. But costs are just one part of the equation. Wind projects enjoy significantly higher capture prices that, in some cases, can create more attractive project economics despite the higher initial development costs. Rystad Energy finds that fair value PPA prices for solar PV are lower than for onshore wind globally, but that large geographical differences exist.

Higher capex intensity with a large geographical spread for onshore wind compared to solar PV

PPA prices are primarily defined by two factors: the costs of the projects and the power market prices where the project will be located. Solar PV and onshore wind projects generally have a much higher capital expenditure (capex) than operating expenditure (opex), and capex is therefore the main driver of project breakeven, together with the capacity factor, which determines the generation level, and together with the offtake price determines the revenue for the project.

The capex intensity of solar projects has declined significantly over the past decades due to major technological improvements and a significant increase in manufacturing capacity that allows for greater economies of scale. Capex intensity has dropped from a global average of more than $5 per watt in 2010 to an expected level of around $0.80 per watt this year. China dominates the manufacturing of solar PV components. More than 90% of the global manufacturing capacity for ingots, wafers, cells, and modules is located in China, meaning that most of the solar PV projects developed across the world have Chinese components. This allows projects to have similar capex intensity. As a result, the spread of capex intensity across the world is quite narrow, with the upper and lower quartiles varying on average less than 10% from the median (Figure 1). The range in 2025 hovers between $0.80 and $1.00 per watt and is expected to remain stable for the next five years. China, India, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia are markets where the average capex intensity is lower than the quartile 1 level, while the US and Japan are examples where capex intensity is significantly higher than the quartile 3 level.

Wind capex intensity saw a large increase between 2020 and 2023 due to inflation and higher interest rates to which manufacturers were exposed. This led the capex intensity to increase from a global average of $1.14 per watt in 2020 to $1.59 per watt in 2023. However, costs have stabilized and are expected to remain at this higher level out to 2030. Wind manufacturing capacity is more diversified than that of solar PV, leading to a higher spread of capex intensities across the world, depending on the origin of the components and where the projects are located. Manufacturing costs of Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are higher than for their Chinese counterparts, leading development costs of projects in Western countries to be generally higher than in Asia. The median capex intensity for onshore wind has increased above $1.50 per watt over the last few years and is expected to remain roughly at this level. However, the upper quartile is forecasted to increase above $2.00 per watt, increasing the spread with the median to more than 30% by 2030. Also, in this case, the capex intensity in China is significantly lower than the quartile 1 range, being a clear outlier compared to all other markets, while Australia and the US are outliers in the other direction.

Cost of capital and resource potential have the most impact on breakeven prices

Across all 35 markets analyzed by Rystad Energy, the final breakeven price with sensitivities for capex, opex, discount rate, and capacity factor are presented in Figure 2. Both utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind power projects are highly sensitive to discount rate assumptions (or cost of capital). In power markets where the cost of capital is higher, such as many developing nations, renewable energy projects face a significant disadvantage, especially when those regions do not possess abundant solar or wind resources.

Capacity factors for solar PV and wind energy can vary widely between different markets and even within regions of the same market. As a result, breakeven power prices fluctuate substantially. For solar PV, breakevens can range from $6-8 per MWh, while for onshore wind, the range is between $9-11 per MWh. These figures reflect cases where the output is 15% higher or lower than the respective base cases, as illustrated in Figure 2. The capital-intensive nature of renewable energy projects is evident in these outcomes. Market rankings previously discussed indicate this issue may be particularly significant for onshore wind compared to utility-scale solar PV when evaluating projects across different markets.

Operating expenditures, conversely, have the least impact on breakeven prices, as neither energy source requires any fuel inputs. For solar PV, especially, changes to opex assumptions have minimal effect on the overall project economics.

Much higher capture rates for solar PV than for onshore wind

The second primary factor that determines the PPA price level, in addition to project costs, is power prices in the spot market, or more specifically, capture prices. Wholesale power prices exhibit significant regional variations across different electricity markets, driven by generation mix, grid infrastructure, and demand patterns. Within this group, California Independent System Operator (CAISO) exhibits the lowest wholesale prices, while Australian regions like New South Wales and Western Australia are positioned at the higher end.

In this analysis, we estimated capture rates to reflect the average price actually earned as a share of the market prices. We estimated the capture rate for each technology by examining the historical relationship between the share of solar or wind in power generation and their corresponding capture rates.

Solar tends to have a lower capture rate than wind, as its generation is concentrated during the same hours, which compresses revenues through competition. This is often referred to as the cannibalization effect. Storage is expanding, but its growth has not kept pace with the rapid rise of solar and therefore does not yet provide sufficient flexibility. In New South Wales, this has contributed to solar capture prices falling to around 40%. Several high solar penetration markets across the world are also seeing yearly average capture rates in the range of 40-60% or are expected to reach this level in the coming years. There are very few markets globally where onshore wind sees a capture rate below 80%, and very few markets are expected to go significantly below 70% in the coming years as well. So even though breakeven prices for solar PV are lower on average across most markets, making solar more cost competitive, the offtake from the spot market can be much lower, having a significant impact on determining PPA prices.

Solar PV prices are on average lower than for onshore wind globally

The full distribution across the 35 markets analyzed in this report, for both onshore wind and solar PV, across all scenarios with a start-up year 2025, is shown in Figure 3. The PPA prices for solar PV are, on average, lower than for onshore wind, and the lowest overall PPA price is in Saudi Arabia for the solar PV low case, with a PPA as low as $16.3 per MWh. Middle Eastern countries, together with India, China, CAISO, Morocco, and Spain, all have low cases for solar PV below $25 per MWh, either due to very low costs or very high capacity factors, or a combination. In the case of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which top the charts, they have both among the lowest costs and best conditions, making these projects very cost-competitive. Among the highest prices, we find a majority of onshore wind projects, all within the high case (high costs, low-capacity factor, high discount rate), including markets like Malaysia, Queensland (Australia), Germany, and Italy.

[TITLE]First SMR in Alberta Could Power the Oil Sands:
[TEXT]
A study by X-energy Canada has confirmed the feasibility and benefits of repurposing an existing thermal generation site in Alberta with X-energy's small modular reactors, World Nuclear News reports.

Funded by Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), the study found that the Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is uniquely suited to Alberta's energy needs. As well as producing electricity, it is specifically designed to provide 565°C heat and steam for industrial applications, unlocking a broad range of use cases for Alberta's industrial and oil and gas sectors, the company said. The province's established supply chain capabilities are well-positioned to support the manufacturing and construction of the technology, while the Xe-100's design means it can use air-cooling systems, significantly reducing overall water usage, and offering greater siting flexibility over conventional light-water reactors.

In 2023, ERA committed $7 million for Cenovus, a Calgary-based energy company, to study the use of small modular reactors in the oil sands.

In August, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the government sees “tremendous potential” for nuclear in the province.

While Alberta does not currently have any nuclear generating capacity, in 2021 it signed a memorandum of understanding with Ontario, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan to collaborate on SMR development, and has signed MOUs with several SMR developers. According to World Nuclear News, Energy Alberta has proposed building a nuclear power plant based on large-scale Candu Monark reactors at a site in the Peace River region of northern Alberta.

[TITLE]Megabatteries are powering up clean energy:
[TEXT]
Renewable energy overtook coal power to become the largest source of electricity in the world for the first half of 2025. However, many forms of renewable energy have an efficiency problem, with production not matching up to demand. Storing the excess energy with megabatteries could offer a promising way to bridge the gap.

Storing the sun

One of the biggest problems with many renewable power sources is the mismatch between supply and demand. The production rates of energies like solar and wind “fluctuate according to the weather, the time of day and the season,” said OilPrice.com . For example, when the “sun is shining and solar panels are producing the most energy,” it “also happens to be when the lights are switched off and relatively few people are home using appliances.” This causes an oversupply of energy. The solution could be to store the excess energy in the form of megabatteries.

There are several methods of energy storage, but megabatteries are growing in popularity. The batteries soak up extra power and “discharge energy as the sun sets and demand rises,” said the Financial Times . In addition, “breakthroughs in battery design have played a major role in improving efficiency.” The price of lithium-ion batteries has also dropped significantly since 2010. The “core appeal of batteries is flexibility,” said the European Business Magazine . They “store power when it’s cheap and abundant, then release it when it’s scarce or expensive,” which makes them “invaluable for stabilizing grids,” and “profitable for operators who play the peaks and troughs of wholesale markets.”

[TITLE]China’s Battery Giants Flood Overseas Markets As Exports Surge 220%:
[TEXT]
Last year, China's battery industry average utilization rate cratered to just a third of maximum capacity amid severe overcapacity following years of massive investment and expansion. This put smaller manufacturers under severe pressure and fueled further industry consolidation, while also forcing producers to increasingly seek overseas markets. Luckily, these efforts appear to be paying off: China Energy Storage Alliance has reported that Chinese battery storage forms secured ~200 overseas orders totalling 186 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the first half of this year, good for a more than 220% year-over-year surge. Not surprisingly, just 5.34 GWh– less than 3% of the total--came from the United States amid hefty tariffs by the Trump administration compared to nearly 60% that came from the Middle East, Europe and Australia.

Back in April, the Trump administration imposed duties of up to 3,521% on solar imports from Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand, with the finalized tariffs applying to shipments from China’s solar heavyweights, including JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) and Trina Solar. Further, Chinese firms are increasingly diversifying their production bases in a bid to mitigate growing tariff risks from Washington. Currently, Chinese solar manufacturers have installed ~80% of overseas capacity including solar wafers, solar cells and modules in Southeast Asia.

“The industry used to say that you either go overseas or exit the game,” said Gao Jifan, chairman of Trina Solar. “Now, due to tariffs, simply exporting isn’t enough; you must also localise production abroad.”

China’s battery storage sector is also benefiting from a rebound by the local markets thanks to policy support by Beijing. China’s National Energy Administration recently unveiled a plan to mobilize 250 billion yuan (~$32 billion) in new investment to build 180 gigawatts of new energy storage capacity by 2027. Lately, Chinese companies that operate in the energy storage space have been posting robust growth as fundamentals continue to improve. During the first half of 2025, 47 of 55 listed companies in the Chinese energy storage sector were profitable. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (OTCMKTS:CATL), one of the largest li-ion battery manufacturers in the world, reported H1 2025 operating revenue of RMB178.886 billion ($25.15 billion), good for a 7.3% increase year over year while net profit attributable to shareholders clocked in at RMB30.485 billion, up 33.33%. In its interim report, CATL revealed that sustained rapid growth in demand for energy storage cells driven by the global clean energy transition has been driving its impressive performance.

That said, battery storage expansion is expected to be a global trend: energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie has projected that global investment in battery storage will reach approximately $1.2 trillion by 2034. This investment will be needed to support the installation of over 5,900 GW of new wind and solar capacity during that period. The report emphasizes that advanced, grid-forming battery technology is crucial for maintaining grid stability as renewable energy sources become more prevalent.

U.S. Battery Storage Explodes

For years, battery systems have only played a marginal role in U.S. electricity networks, with power utilities focusing more on building out capacity from natural gas plants and renewable energy sources. According to energy data portal Cleanview, five years ago, the United States had 74 times more wind farm capacity and 30 times more solar capacity than battery capacity within its power generation system.

However, steady cost declines coupled with rising energy density levels have encouraged utilities to ramp up their battery installations, with battery storage output now exceeding other power sources in certain power markets. And, it’s boom time for the U.S. utility-scale battery storage market: currently, there are only around 5 times more solar and wind capacity in the country compared to battery capacity, thanks in large part to a 40% decline in battery prices since 2022. Currently, 19 states have installed 100 MW or more of utility-scale battery storage. According to Cleanview, there are just under 30,000 megawatts (MW) of utility battery capacity across the U.S., good for a massive 15-fold increase since 2020. For some context, the U.S. solar sector has added 84,200 MW over the timeframe, while the wind sector has increased its capacity by just 7,000 MW. Falling costs is the biggest reason for the surge in U.S. battery deployments: according to financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility-scale solar farms paired with batteries ranges from $50-$131 per megawatt hour (MWh). This makes the pair competitive with new natural gas peaking plants (LCOE of $47 to $170 per MWh) and even new coal-fired plants with LCOE of $114 per MWh.

According to Lazard's 2025 LCOE+ report, new-build renewable energy power plants are the most competitive form of power generation on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies). This is highly significant in the current era of unprecedented power demand growth in large part due to the AI boom and clean energy manufacturing. Renewables also stand out as the quickest-to-deploy generation resource, with the solar plus battery combination often boasting far shorter deployment times compared to constructing new natural gas power plants. California is, by far, the national leader in utility-scale battery storage, accounting for ~13,000 MW or about 42% of the national total. According to the California Energy Commission, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has installed ~21,000 MW of solar capacity and ~12,400 MW of battery capacity, allowing the state to rely heavily on batteries during peak demand periods.
