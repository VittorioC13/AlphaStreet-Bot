[TITLE]Microsoft sidesteps hefty EU fine with Teams unbundling deal:
[TEXT]
The Microsoft Teams app on a laptop arranged in New York, US, on Tuesday, June 25, 2024.

The European Union on Friday said it has accepted commitments from Microsoft to unbundle its Teams workplace communication platform from its popular productivity apps.

The decision essentially exempts Microsoft from receiving a potentially hefty antitrust fine after the company was last year accused by the European Commission — the executive body of the EU — of breaching competition rules with the "abusive" bundling of its Teams and Office products.

"With today's decision, we make binding for seven years or more Microsoft's commitments to put an end to its tying practices that may be preventing rivals from effectively competing with Teams," Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition, said in a statement.

Under the commitments, which Microsoft first unveiled in May, the U.S. software giant will make versions of its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites available at a reduced price without Teams, as well as allow customers with long-term licenses to switch to suites without Teams.

The company will also provide interoperability between tools that compete with Teams and certain Microsoft products and allow clients to move data out of Teams to competing products.

Microsoft has subsequently also offered to make further commitments to resolve its competition concerns after the European Commission market-tested the firm's initial pledges.

[TITLE]Deep tech entrepreneurship – a viable response to today’s grand challenges?:
[TEXT]
The rise of “deep tech” in recent years has captured the attention of investors, policymakers and innovators alike. But what’s beyond the hype? At its core, deep tech is grounded in cutting-edge scientific discovery and technological complexity, with far-reaching consequences for industry, society and the global economy. Benjamin Cabanes writes that the rise of big tech calls for a rethinking of technology transfer mechanisms.

The term “deep tech” has become central to the domains of innovation, scientific research and public innovation policy. Popularised in 2015 by Swati Chaturvedi, founder of the Propel(x) platform, it refers to innovations grounded in major scientific breakthroughs, using disruptive technologies to address fundamental societal challenges..

In contrast to digital start-ups, which often rely on innovative business models with limited research and development (R&D) intensity, deep tech start-ups are based on advances in fundamental science or advanced engineering. These are applied in sectors such as biotechnology, artificial intelligence, energy, nanotechnology and robotics.

In 2024, approximately €9 billion were invested in deep tech start-ups across Europe, through 454 funding rounds. These investments focused on several high-tech sectors. In the field of artificial intelligence, companies such as Mistral AI raised €468 million, while Aqemia secured €30 million. The space industry also attracted significant capital, as illustrated by The Exploration Company’s €150 million. The quantum technology sector saw major deals, notably Quantinuum (€273 million) and Riverlane (€70 million).

[TITLE]Europe’s Automotive Industry Needs Urgent Action—Not Another Diagnosis:
[TEXT]
On 12 September, the President of the European Commission will convene key stakeholders to discuss the future of Europe’s automotive industry. As trade union leaders representing millions of workers across this vital sector and its supply chains, we urge the EU to move beyond analysis and deliver urgent, strategic action.

The automotive industry is facing a perfect storm. Production has dropped by 20% in just four years. The transition to clean mobility, while essential, is proving more disruptive than anticipated. On the shopfloor, anxiety and anger are becoming the norm. Without bold intervention, this toxic mix could threaten the future of one of Europe’s most strategic industries.

Europe’s car industry is also losing ground globally. While domestic demand can help, it cannot replace the 4.5 million vehicles exported in 2024. A fair and strategic trade agenda is needed—one that secures market access and rebuilds supply chains for key components like batteries and semiconductors.

Decarbonisation is non-negotiable. But the transition must be just. Climate legislation must be fit for purpose and adapted when necessary. The upcoming EU “Progress Report” on CO₂ emissions must lead to pragmatic solutions—addressing infrastructure gaps, affordability, supply chain resilience including investments in battery production —and delivering guarantees for workers.

Boosting demand must be the first priority. Legislative tools—such as corporate fleet regulations and public procurement—should be used to accelerate the uptake of clean vehicles. Bridging the affordability gap is essential. Many Europeans simply cannot afford a new car, and solutions like social leasing must be scaled across member states.

Investment is equally critical. Households, companies, and public authorities need support to invest in vehicles and infrastructure. Yet austerity budgets are undermining both public and private investment. The next EU budget must reflect Europe’s climate and industrial ambitions, aligning macroeconomic governance with strategic goals like climate neutrality and industrial resilience.

The future of 13 million workers and entire regions depends on bold, coordinated action. We need a stable, skilled workforce, strong social dialogue, and tools like SURE 2.0 and a Just Transition Directive to manage change fairly and democratically.

Europe must rise to the challenge. Workers are watching. The time for gesture politics is over. Workers and their unions expect quick, concrete, and courageous decisions. Their future—and Europe’s industrial strength—is on the line.

[TITLE]Telefónica Outlines Strategy to Consolidate European Telecoms, Divest Latin American Assets:
[TEXT]
Telefónica (NYSE:TEF) is one of the most undervalued telecom stocks to invest in. On September 8, Telefonica CEO Marc Murtra outlined his vision for a consolidated European telecoms market, stating that the company is looking to acquire telecom assets in Europe and Brazil while selling off its Spanish-speaking Latin American assets.

The strategy is part of a broader plan to increase scale and maintain the company’s investment-grade credit rating. Murtra argues that Europe’s telecom market is too fragmented, with 41 companies serving over 500K mobile customers each in 2024, compared to only 5 in the US, 4 in China and Japan, and 3 in South Korea. He believes that in exchange for consolidation, European telecom companies should invest in other related sectors, such as cybersecurity and data centers, as part of a social contract with regulators.

Telefónica Outlines Strategy to Consolidate European Telecoms, Divest Latin American Assets

To gain financial flexibility for M&A, Telefonica has agreed to sell its units in Argentina and Uruguay and is exploring potential sales in Chile, Mexico, and Ecuador. Analysts at Kepler believe these sales could provide up to 3.6 billion euros ($4.21 billion) in funding. Potential acquisition targets for Telefonica could include Vodafone Spain, a joint venture with 1&1 in Germany, assets in Brazil, or a 50% stake in Virgin Media O2.

Telefónica (NYSE:TEF) provides telecommunications services in Europe and Latin America. The company offers mobile & related services and products.

While we acknowledge the potential of TEF as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

[TITLE]Zen, Neos carry out 400 Gbps upgrade between Manchester and London:
[TEXT]
Looking to address surging bandwidth demands through rapidly increasing AI adoption, datacentre growth and full-fibre roll-out across the UK, and linking two of the country’s leading business hubs, business connectivity provider Neos Networks has expanded its longstanding partnership with B Corp-certified telecoms provider Zen Internet with a major upgrade to 400Gbps connectivity between Manchester and London.

Neos Networks claims the UK’s largest business-dedicated network with more than 600 points of presence and 90 datacentres nationwide, providing high-capacity critical connectivity for businesses, from telecoms and energy to banking and emergency services.

Headquartered in Rochdale and employing 650 people, Zen offers a range of broadband, data, voice, hosting and infrastructure services to homes and businesses across the UK. It claims to be the largest B Corporation certified telecommunications and network connectivity provider in the UK.

With a network spanning over 2,800 exchanges, with more than 80% enabled for 10 Gb services, Zen also provides what it describes as “complex” network and cloud services for a range of large businesses and corporate customers through its strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services and Cisco.

Delivered over Neos Networks’ nationwide fibre network, the upgrade to the advanced corridor is designed to support the UK’s growing bandwidth requirements as datacentre investment, AI adoption and full-fibre roll-out increase across the nation, and strengthening Zen’s strategy in the independent broadband provider (altnet) market expanding fibre access for businesses and consumers alike.

It is also intended to ensure Zen’s core network is ready for the future. Beyond the Manchester to London link, Zen uses Neos’s upgraded core and exchange-backhaul services, which are critical for delivering ultrafast, resilient connectivity.

“Our long-standing partnership with Zen Internet highlights the vital role of advanced fibre infrastructure when it comes to meeting the UK’s AI ambitions,” said David Bruce, CRO at Neos Networks commenting on the new deal. “Zen’s mission to become the country’s leading altnet aggregator is well-aligned with the breadth, quality and reliability of our backbone networks, and by working together, we’re ensuring an ecosystem that will ultimately benefit the UK as a whole.”

Zen Internet technical director John Lyons added: “In Neos we have a partner that not only delivers robust, high-capacity network solutions, but also real agility and collaboration, helping us deliver for our end users. Our collaboration is built on open communication, rapid provisioning and shared engineering standards like equipment duplication, diverse routing and true east-west redundancy. This approach means we can rely on Neos to deliver a network that consistently meets the high standards our customers expect.”

Just weeks ago, Zen Internet announced a strategic partnership with Sky Business Wholesale to allow its partners and direct business customers gain access to Sky’s Ethernet-enabled exchange footprint. The partnership was also designed to further strengthen Zen’s partner portal, The Fibre Hub, after its launch in May 2025 to further enhance nationwide connectivity by aggregating services from the UK’s leading alternative networks. This offers access to a full-fibre footprint of nearly 20 million premises via infrastructure providers Openreach, CityFibre, ITS and Freedom Fibre.

[TITLE]Klarna IPO and ASML's Mistral bet revive Europe's tech dreams:
[TEXT]

LONDON — It's been a busy week for the European technology sector. On Tuesday, London-headquartered artificial intelligence startup ElevenLabs announced it would let employees sell shares in a secondary round that doubles its valuation to $6.6 billion. Then, Dutch chip firm ASML on Wednesday confirmed it was leading French AI firm Mistral's 1.7 billion-euro Series C funding round at a valuation of 11.7 billion euros ($13.7 billion) — up from 5.8 billion euros last year. Mistral is considered a competitor to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. To cap it off, Swedish fintech firm Klarna on Thursday debuted on the New York Stock Exchange after a long-awaited initial public offering. Klarna shares ended the day at $45.82, giving it a market value of over $17 billion. These developments have revived hopes that Europe is capable of developing a tech industry that can compete with the U.S. and Asia. For the past decade, investors have been talking up Europe's potential to build valuable tech firms, rebuffing the idea that Silicon Valley is the only place to create innovative new ventures.

watch now

However, dreams of a "golden era" of European tech never quite came to fruition. A key curveball came in the form of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which caused inflation to soar and global central banks to hike interest rates as a result. Higher rates are considered bad for capital-intensive tech firms, which often need to raise cash to grow. Ironically, that same year, Klarna — which at one point was valued as much as $45.6 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank — had its market value slashed 85% to $6.7 billion. Now, Europe's venture capital investors view the recent buzz around the region's tech firms as less of a renaissance and more of a "growing wave." "This started 25 years ago when we saw the first signs of a European tech ecosystem inspired by the original dotcom boom that was very much a Silicon Valley affair," Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton Capital, told CNBC. Balderton has backed a number of notable European tech names including fintech firm Revolut and self-driving vehicle tech developer Wayve.

"There have been temporary setbacks: the 2008 financial crisis, the post-Covid tech slump, but the ecosystem has bounced back stronger each time," Chandratillake said. "Right now, the confluence of a huge new technological opportunity in the form of generative AI, as well as a community that has done it before and has access to the capital required, is, unsurprisingly, yielding a huge number of sector-defining companies," he added.

Europe vs. U.S.

Investors backing the continent's tech startups say there's plenty of money to be made — particularly amid the economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. For one, there's a clear discount on European tech right now. Venture firm Atomico's annual "State of European Tech" report last year pegged the value of the European tech ecosystem at $3 trillion and predicted it will reach $8 trillion by 2034. Compare that to the story in the U.S., where the tech sector's biggest megacap stocks combined are worth over $20 trillion. "Ten years ago, there wasn't a single European startup valued at over $50 billion; today, there are several," Jan Hammer, partner at Index Ventures, which has backed the likes of Revolut and Adyen , told CNBC. "Tens of thousands of people now have firsthand experience building and scaling global companies from companies such as Revolut, Alan, Mistral and Adyen," Hammer added. "Crucially, European startups are no longer simply expanding abroad — they are born global from day one."

Amy Nauikoas, founder and CEO of fintech investor Anthemis, suggested that investors may be viewing Europe as something of a safe haven market amid heightened geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty. "This is an investing opportunity for sure," Nauikoas told CNBC. "Macroeconomic dislocation always favors early-stage entrepreneurial disruption and innovation." "This time around, trends in family office, capital shifts ... and the general constipation of the U.S. institutional allocation market suggest that there should be a lot more money flowing from ... global investors to U.K. [and] European private markets."

Problems remain

Despite the bullish sentiment surrounding European tech, there remain systemic challenges that make it harder for the region's tech firms to achieve the scale of their U.S. and Asian counterparts. Startup investors have been pushing for more allocation from pension funds into venture capital funds in Europe for some time. And the European market is highly fragmented, with regulations varying from country to country.

[TITLE]Retailers turn to tech as in-store crime soars:
[TEXT]
Sainsbury’s CEO Simon Roberts, Wickes chief David Wood, and Fortnum & Mason boss Tom Athron were among the executives to sign an open letter in August calling on the government to legislate to better protect service workers.

Headline signatory Jo Causon, CEO of the Institute of Customer Service (ICS), and her co-signatories from retail, hospitality and adjacent sectors, want the Crime and Policing Bill currently moving through Parliament to protect all public-facing workers. It includes specific legislation relating to assault of retail workers, but the ICS is calling for it to go further to deter crime in all service sectors.

Why the clamour now? ICS data from January shows 42% of customer service staff across every sector experienced abuse in the prior six months, up 19% compared to a similar study the institute published in March 2024.

Some 37% of workers surveyed said they had considered leaving their role due to hostility, and a quarter of them have taken sick leave as a result. It’s not just a problem with personal consequences, it’s a business continuity issue as well.

And the British Retail Consortium (BRC) reported in March nearly a quarter of UK consumers had witnessed shoplifting taking place in the previous 12 months, and 23% of customers had experienced physical or verbal abuse of staff, with some incidents involving weapons.

BRC’s annual crime survey, released in January, showed retail crime resulted in record losses of £2.2bn in 2024, with the 2,000-plus incidents of violence and abuse more than three times the level recorded in 2020.

Action – be it from central government, local authorities or the police – is required. In many circumstances, retailers themselves are taking matters into their own hands and deploying new technology in the name of protecting their workers and premises.

Body-worn tech Staff at H&M, Tesco and EE are among the retailers offering their staff the opportunity to don cameras as they work as a deterrent for criminals. In July, H&M said it was using the technology. Computer Weekly contacted the retailer to check on the results to date, but it is still in pilot stage and there are no learnings to report yet. A spokesperson for H&M says: “We’re testing body-worn cameras in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers.” In February, Motorola Solutions announced its VT100 body cameras had been distributed to employees across Poundland stores. It claimed Poundland had reported a decrease in incidents, including an 11% drop in violence against store employees and a marked reduction in shoplifting and theft since the tech was introduced. The footage is used by Poundland’s security and loss prevention team in its investigations. The retailer uses Motorola’s digital evidence management tool to prepare, store and process video data, according to the manufacturer – and it can tag and match body camera videos with CCTV footage and other incident data. We’re testing body-worn cameras in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have...on de-escalating and reducing incidents H&M spokesperson In February, Tesco launched a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year manned security hub as a direct response to rising crime in the retail industry. The facility was unveiled at its newly refurbished security centre in Daventry, Northamptonshire, and it aims to track down criminals targeting its premises across the UK. Staff there analyse thousands of hours of CCTV footage and they share intelligence with the police. A Tesco spokesperson tells Computer Weekly: “Our colleagues work hard to serve our customers every day, and every member of our team deserves to feel safe at work. We continue to invest in the latest technology, resources and training for our expert team in our Security Hub. This team is dedicated to joining up evidence and supporting the police to tackle crime, helping to keep our colleagues and customers safe.” Tesco introduced body-worn cameras to store staff in 2023, and last year some delivery drivers were offered the chance to use them too. The UK’s largest retailer said the cameras are not recording all the time and will only start if the driver feels unsafe, calling it an “unlikely event” that a driver will feel the need to begin recording. “Any footage that is taken will be stored securely and will only be used if an incident requires investigation,” the grocer says online, adding that the driver will inform people if they are to start recording. Meanwhile, tech retailer Currys announced in May that it is working with VoCoVo to ramp up security in its stores. The manufacturer’s headsets are being introduced to Currys shops, with early feedback from staff suggesting they feel safer wearing them because they can communicate with colleagues when confronted with shoplifters as the equipment doubles up as a comms tool for general operations. The retailer has also partnered with Auror to introduce crime reporting software into its stores. The aim of using this platform is to speed up and improve the accuracy of crime reporting, and the individual shops can share information on criminals and incidents which is then matched with data nationwide. Mobile and broadband services retailer EE is embarking on a new store strategy in 2025, investing £3m between May 2025 and March 2026 in bricks and mortar, including opening what it terms as “experience stores” containing areas where visitors get “hands on with tech”. In August, it opened in Merry Hill near Birmingham – its third store of 2025 in the new format, following openings in Nottingham in May and Sheffield earlier in the month. Asif Aziz, EE retail director, says security and tech to protect customers and employees is a key feature as the store estate is refreshed. “As part of our continued investment into our retail estate, we’re not only enhancing experiences for our customers, but also ensuring both they and our teams are safe,” he says. “Our staff wear the latest body cameras, which instantly transmit footage to our monitoring teams and law enforcement. In our stores, we utilise smart tracking systems to track stolen goods and monitor them in real-time until they are recovered. “We also employ time delay stock safes, as well as fogging and misting devices that, when triggered, instantly fill part of the store with disorienting fog and forensic marking solutions. All these security measures are helping to effectively deter and detect criminals.”

CCTV-plus In June, frozen food retailer Iceland acknowledged it had started trialling use of facial-recognition technology in a small number of its stores, including in its The Food Warehouse shops. “We will do anything and everything to help protect our staff and customers,” the retailer’s executive chairman Richard Walker said on LinkedIn, following a backlash which included privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch calling the move “chilling”.

“Organised and targeted retail crime is out of control. Every single week, I see the reports from our stores and read
