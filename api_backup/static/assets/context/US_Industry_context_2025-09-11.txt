[TITLE]NKGen Biotech, Inc. Announces Completion of NKMax Co., Ltd. Acquisition; Gains Full Control of Global Manufacturing and Intellectual Property Assets:
[TEXT]
NKGen acquires controlling stake in NKMax, marking a pivotal moment in its transformation into a fully integrated, self-sustaining, cell therapy company with global manufacturing and IP control.

Approximately $16.9 million paid to acquire 65% equity stake in recapitalized debt-free NKMax, with NKMax operations now expected to be funded through 2026.

Funding provided by AlpineBrook Capital GP 1 Limited and NKGen CEO Dr. Paul Y. Song.

SANTA ANA, Calif., Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NKGen Biotech, Inc. (OTC: NKGN) (“NKGen” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative autologous and allogeneic natural killer (“NK”) cell therapeutics, today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of a majority equity stake in NKMax Co., Ltd. (“NKMax”), a Korean biotechnology company, out of bankruptcy. This acquisition marks a transformative step for NKGen, granting full control over key global manufacturing infrastructure, intellectual property (“IP”), and exclusive commercialization rights, while solidifying the Company’s position as an independent and vertically integrated leader in NK cell therapeutics.

This transaction is a culmination of a multi-year journey that has seen NKGen overcome significant challenges, emerge stronger, and continue its unwavering commitment to advancing groundbreaking cell therapies. Originally founded as a subsidiary of NKMax in 2017, NKGen has long benefited from its parent’s financial backing to drive the development of its innovative NK cell therapy platform. In October 2023, NKGen made the pivotal decision to go public in the U.S., securing a $25 million backstop commitment from NKMax to fund clinical development of NKGen’s flagship Alzheimer’s treatment. However, NKMax ultimately provided only $10 million of the $25 million backstop initially committed, marking the start of financial challenges for NKGen.

There were several unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances which led to the suspension of trading of NKMax shares on the KOSDAQ Korean Stock Exchange, and NKMax’s subsequent collapse into bankruptcy in 2024. This created significant financial challenges and uncertainty for NKGen which negatively impacted its own stock, ability to raise funds and eventual delisting from Nasdaq. In response to these challenges, NKGen’s leadership acted swiftly, with the support of AlpineBrook Capital GP 1 Limited (“AlpineBrook”), which recognized the potential of the combined companies. AlpineBrook provided the majority of the $17 million funding to NKGen for the purchase of NKMax shares. The entirety of the funding for the NKMax shares was provided by AlpineBrook and NKGen CEO Dr. Paul Y. Song, with terms to be finalized and disclosed in due course. This strategic partnership and infusion of capital are a testament to AlpineBrook’s confidence in the long-term growth and success of NKGen, now poised to leverage its newly acquired assets to drive future commercialization.

“This is more than an acquisition, it’s a turning point in our company’s history,” said Paul Y. Song, M.D., Chairman and CEO of NKGen. “The past couple of years have been incredibly challenging, but we had an unwavering belief in the science behind our therapy and its true potential to change lives. This belief drove each of us, at every level of the company, to make sacrifices, stay committed, and keep building even though our future was very uncertain. With the support of AlpineBrook, who recognized our dedication and scientific promise, we have been blessed with the chance to now fully integrate NKMax’s capabilities and expertise into NKGen while taking full control of all IP and global distribution rights. We believe removing the uncertainty of the parent company overhang has also begun to generate renewed interest from U.S. and international investors alike and will allow us to enter a new era of opportunity and long-term growth. We believe the acquisition of NKMax will also allow us to rapidly expand and forge partnerships throughout Asia and the Middle East.”

Dr. Song continued, “I am incredibly optimistic

[TITLE]Hitachi announces historic $1 billion USD manufacturing investment to power America’s energy future through production of critical grid infrastructure:
[TEXT]
Raleigh, North Carolina and Zurich, Switzerland, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hitachi Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi, Ltd., and global leader in electrification, today announced a historic investment of more than $1 billion USD to expand the production of critical electrical grid infrastructure in the United States. These investments, among the largest seen in the electrical industry in the U.S., include approximately $457 million USD for a new large power transformer facility in South Boston, Virginia, along with significant expansions of existing facilities throughout the country.

The investments will help meet skyrocketing energy demand driven by AI data centers in line with the Trump Administration’s White House AI Action Plan and promote domestic access to these critical grid technologies. This move also supports the power needs of American manufacturing and other sectors and much-needed grid expansion and modernization efforts. Collectively, these investments will create thousands of jobs, bolster electrical equipment supply chains in the U.S., and contribute to the development of innovative technologies to enhance the security and resilience of the U.S. grid.

“If we are going to win the AI race, reindustrialize, and keep the lights on, America is going to need a lot more reliable energy,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Thankfully, Hitachi is delivering. The Trump administration looks forward to continuing to partner with private industry to ensure the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy and thousands of high-paying jobs."

“To lead in AI, America must lead in energy, and this investment proves we’re doing just that,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “Hitachi Energy’s historic investment in U.S. grid infrastructure is more than a single partnership, it signals a growing wave of investment in American energy. This momentum is driven by President Donald Trump's bold, pro-energy policies that are reigniting the American economy and powering the next generation of critical AI data centers with reliable, American-made energy."

“Prioritizing domestic production of transformers accelerates President Trump’s energy dominance agenda by fortifying critical supply chains, strengthening U.S. energy security, and ensuring our nation can meet the growing energy demand. Investments like this are essential to powering AI infrastructure and advancing President Trump’s leadership in the global AI race,” said Jarrod Agen, Executive Director of the White House National Energy Dominance Council.

“Thank you, Hitachi Energy, for trusting Virginia, again! Hard-working Virginians and a business-friendly environment are what first brought Hitachi Energy to the Commonwealth. Now, after years of success here, they are doubling down on that decision with this landmark investment in South Boston,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “Eight-hundred and twenty-five new jobs will be transformational for Southside Virginia, as will the power transformers those new hires are set to build. These transformers are critical to our Nation’s electrical grid and will be built right there in Virginia.”

Governor Youngkin continued: “We are also proud to announce a major workforce housing project to support Hitachi’s new employees. We are partnering with Halifax County and Virginia Housing to build 96 new homes supported by a grant from the Virginia Workforce Housing Investment Program.”

“Particularly at this critical moment for our growing energy demands, I’m excited to see Hitachi Energy expand their Virginia footprint, create hundreds of good-paying jobs in South Boston, and promote American energy security,” said U.S. Senator Mark Warner. “At the local level, this is a great investment in Southside Virginia’s economy and manufacturing industry. At the state and national level, this is an important strategic step to ensure we have the power needed to service our communities, businesses, and growing AI industry. I’m thrilled to see Hitachi Energy bring this important project home to South Boston.”

“In August, I visited Hitachi’s facility in Bland to learn

[TITLE]Hitachi Opens New U.S. Railcar Plant:
[TEXT]
WASHINGTON DC, Sep 10 (News On Japan) - Hitachi has begun full-scale operations at a new railcar factory in Maryland in the United States after investing $100 million (approximately 15 billion yen), positioning the site as a core hub to build trains that run across the country, notably in Baltimore, Washington and Pennsylvania.

“We recognize that America is at a critical juncture in addressing aging infrastructure,” said Hitachi President Toshiaki Tokunaga.

The project emphasizes local production for local consumption. Rows of newly built cars bound for Baltimore already line the shop floor. The company plans to manufacture 658 railcars, including units for the Washington, D.C., subway. To bolster quality and safety, the site incorporates AI-driven production systems and uses dog-like robots to inspect rolling stock.

The investment is expected to create 1,300 local jobs, with an estimated annual economic impact exceeding 50 billion yen.

Construction of the plant was approved in 2022 under the Biden administration. Yet the facility is now being touted by the Trump administration. “This factory symbolizes the administration’s efforts to deliver large, compelling infrastructure projects that benefit the American people,” Transportation Secretary Duffy said. The White House’s social-media account posted a photo of the president with arms outstretched accompanied by the phrase “Golden Age.”

[TITLE]Methode Electronics, Inc. Reports Fiscal 2026 First Quarter Financial Results:
[TEXT]
Power Product Sales Growth

Income from Operations Up $8.6 Million

Third Straight Quarter of Strong Free Cash Flow and Net Debt Reduction

Fiscal 2026 Guidance Affirmed

CHICAGO, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Methode Electronics, Inc. (NYSE: MEI), a leading global supplier of custom-engineered solutions for user interface, lighting, and power distribution applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 ended August 2, 2025.

Fiscal First Quarter 2026 Results

Net sales were $240.5 million

Electric and hybrid vehicle applications were 19% of net sales

Income from operations was $1.1 million

Pre-tax loss was $6.1 million; adjusted pre-tax loss was $5.1 million

Net loss was $10.3 million, or a loss of $0.29 per diluted share

Adjusted net loss was $7.8 million, or a loss of $0.22 per diluted share

Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.1 million; free cash flow was $18.0 million

Total debt of $323.4 million, up from $317.6 million at the end of fiscal 2025

Net debt of $202.3 million, down from $214.0 million at the end of fiscal 2025

Management Comments

President and Chief Executive Officer Jon DeGaynor said, “The Methode transformation journey made further progress in the quarter and is firmly on track, as we continued to reduce costs and improve execution. A $9 million increase in operating income on $18 million in lower sales is clear evidence of that progress. Our data center business grew again and remains on pace for a strong year. The overall business delivered strong free cash flow for the third quarter in a row, and we have now reduced our net debt by $41 million over the last three quarters.”

Mr. DeGaynor concluded, “I am very proud of the hard work that the Methode team has put into our transformation, and the progress is tangible. For fiscal 2026, we are affirming our expectation to double EBITDA as a result of our operational improvements despite an approximately $100 million decline in sales driven by lower EV demand.”

Consolidated Fiscal First Quarter 2026 Financial Results

Methode's net sales were $240.5 million, compared to $258.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. The decrease was mainly due to lower volume in the Automotive segment driven by weaker activity in North America, which was partially offset by higher volume in the Industrial segment driven by power products, including for data center applications, and lighting for off-road equipment. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by $7.4 million as compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2025.

Income from operations was $1.1 million, compared to a loss of $7.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. Income from operations as a percentage of net sales was 0.5%, compared to negative 2.9% in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. Gross profit was similar to the prior-year quarter despite the lower net sales. The improvement in income from operations was primarily due to $9.6 million in lower selling and administrative expenses than the prior-year quarter due to lower professional fees and compensation expense. Adjusted income from operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2.0 million, compared to a loss of $4.7 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. The adjusted income from operations excluded expenses of $0.9 million for restructuring costs and asset impairment charges.

Net loss was $10.3 million or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $18.3 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. Adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $7.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $10.9 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. The adjusted net loss excluded a $1.7 million valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, $0.7 million for restructuring costs and asset impairment charges, $0.5 million for the partial write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, and a $0.4 million net gain on the sale of non-core assets.

EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization of Intangibles), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $14.7 million or 6.1% of net sales, compared to $5.8 million or 2.2% of net sales in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $15.7 million, compared to $9.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. Adjusted EBITDA excluded $0.9 million for restructuring costs and asset impairment charges, $0.6 million for the partial write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, and a $0.5 million net gain on the sale of non-core assets.

Debt was $323.4 million at the end of the quarter, up from $317.6 million at the end of fiscal 2025. Foreign currency translation drove most of the increase. Net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as debt less cash and cash equivalents, was $202.3 million, down from $214.0 million at the end of fiscal 2025.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.1 million for the quarter, compared to $10.9 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant, and equipment, was $18.0 million, compared to a negative $2.7 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. The increase in free cash flow was primarily due to improvements in working capital and a reduction in purchases of property, plant and equipment.

Segment Fiscal First Quarter 2026 Financial Results

Comparing the Automotive segment’s quarter to the same quarter of fiscal 2025,

Net sales were $106.1 million, down from $134.8 million. Net sales decreased by $28.7 million or 21.3% mostly due to lower volume in North America. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by $3.8 million as compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2025.

Loss from operations was $12.5 million, compared to a loss of $5.7 million in the prior year. The higher loss was mainly driven by the lower sales volume in North America, which was partially offset by lower selling and administrative, freight, and warranty expenses.

Comparing the Industrial segment’s quarter to the same quarter of fiscal 2025,

Net sales were $123.5 million, up from $111.5 million. Net sales increased by $12.0 million or 10.8% driven primarily by higher demand for power products, including for data center applications, and lighting products for off-road equipment, which was partially offset by lower demand for lighting products in the commercial vehicle market. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by $3.6 million as compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2025.

Income from operations was $26.5 million, up from $16.9 million. Income from operations was 21.5% of net sales, up from 15.2%. The improvement was driven by the increased sales volume as well as lower selling and administrative and freight expenses.

Comparing the Interface segment’s quarter to the same quarter of fiscal 2025,

Net sales were $10.9 million, down from $12.2 million. The decrease was from lower volume of touch panels for appliances.

Income from operations was $3.0 million, up from $1.9 million. Income from operations was 27.5% of net sales, up from 15.6%. The increase was due to product sales mix.

Guidance

For fiscal 2026, the company affirmed its previous guidance expectation for net sales to be in a range of $900 to $1,000 million and EBITDA to be in a range of $70 to $80 million with the second half of the fiscal year expected to be higher than the first half.

This guidance is based on the current market outlook based on third party forecasts and customer projections and the current U.S. tariff policy. The guidance is subject to change due to a variety of factors including tariffs, the successful launch of multiple new programs, the ultimate take rates on EV programs, success and timing of cost recovery actions, inflation, global economic instability, supply chain disruptions, transformation and restructuring efforts, potential impairments, any acquisitions or divestitures, and legal matters.

Conference Call

The company will conduct a conference call and webcast tomorrow, September 10, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. CDT to review financial and operational highlights led by its President and Chief Executive Officer, Jon DeGaynor, and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Kowalchik.

[TITLE]GE Aerospace Bets On Hybrid Electric Future With $300 Million BETA Deal:
[TEXT]
GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) announced Thursday that it is joining forces with BETA Technologies to advance hybrid electric aviation.

The partnership includes a $300 million equity stake in the Vermont-based aerospace innovator, a move that underscores GE Aerospace’s growing commitment to sustainable flight solutions.

The system is intended to boost the U.S. Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) sector by offering aircraft longer ranges, faster speeds, lower operating costs and heavier payloads compared with current alternatives.

The collaboration will leverage BETA’s expertise in permanent magnet electric generator technology alongside GE Aerospace’s extensive track record in turbine design, certification, and high-volume production.

The project is expected to build on GE Aerospace’s existing CT7 and T700 engine platforms to integrate hybrid-electric solutions that align with evolving aviation needs.

As part of the deal, GE Aerospace will secure the right to appoint a director to BETA’s board. GE Aerospace Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. said the tie-up will accelerate the development of hybrid-electric propulsion systems, giving customers new options in terms of performance and efficiency.

BETA founder and CEO Kyle Clark added that the partnership represents a significant step toward unlocking hybrid-electric flight at scale while upholding aviation safety and reliability standards.

The agreement builds on GE Aerospace’s past milestones, including a 2016 electric motor-driven propeller ground test and a 2022 megawatt-class hybrid propulsion test conducted at altitudes up to 45,000 feet.

BETA, meanwhile, has logged notable flight hours and range records with its ALIA aircraft across the U.S. and Europe, positioning itself as a front-runner in AAM development.

This investment signals a broader industry push toward sustainable aviation technologies as both companies aim to scale hybrid-electric solutions for military, commercial, and future AAM platforms.
