[TITLE]European Central Bank advances digital euro, selects service providers:
[TEXT]
The European Central Bank has selected several firms to provide core services for a potential digital euro, advancing preparations for a central bank digital currency that could one day complement cash in the eurozone, according to a release dated October 2.

The move comes amid calls to accelerate the development of a euro central bank digital currency, ensuring the EU can remain competitive in the rapidly evolving payments sector with the advent of stablecoins.

Both regulators and lawmakers have argued that a digital euro would help counter the influence of dollar-denominated stablecoins.

Earlier on March 20, ECB President Christine Lagarde told lawmakers in Brussels that Europe must accelerate progress on retail and wholesale versions of the digital euro to strengthen financial sovereignty and reduce external vulnerabilities.

Selected providers

The ECB said it has signed framework agreements covering fraud detection, application development, offline payments, and secure data exchange. Each service area will have a primary provider and an alternate to ensure continuity.

Feedzai and Capgemini Deutschland were selected to oversee fraud and risk management. Almaviva and Fabrick will work on app and software design, while Giesecke+Devrient will focus on offline payment functionality.

EquensWorldline and Senacor FCS will manage secure information exchange. Sapient GmbH and Tremend Software Consulting were chosen across multiple categories.

The ECB noted it plans to announce an additional provider for offline services later.

Next steps

The central bank emphasized that the contracts do not involve any payments at this stage and can be revised in accordance with EU legislation.

A decision on issuing a digital euro will only be made after the Digital Euro Regulation, which remains under negotiation, is formally adopted.

If launched, the digital euro would coexist with physical money and aim to enhance payment efficiency while reducing reliance on private stablecoins.

However, officials have also signaled that a rollout, if approved, may not occur until the latter part of the decade.

[TITLE]Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Completes Merger With a Partnership Comprised of Worldwide Golf and Capitol Hill Group:
[TEXT]
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. and BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV) (“Big 5”), a leading sporting goods retailer, today announced the successful completion of its previously announced merger with a partnership comprised of Worldwide Golf and Capitol Hill Group. Upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the approval of Big 5’s stockholders, the merger was consummated, with Big 5 surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of such partnership.

Pursuant to the definitive merger agreement and subject to the terms and satisfaction of its conditions, Big 5 stockholders are entitled to receive $1.45 per share in cash. This represents a premium of approximately 36% to Big 5’s 60-day volume weighted average trading price prior to the transaction’s announcement.

“This transaction marks an exciting new chapter for Big 5 that allows the company to carry on its legacy of serving customers with quality sporting goods at an exceptional value while maximizing return for our stockholders,” said Steven G. Miller, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Big 5. “I want to thank our dedicated employees, loyal customers and valued vendors who continue to support Big 5 in each of the communities we serve.”

Worldwide Golf is a leading nationwide retailer of golf equipment, apparel, shoes and accessories. Capitol Hill Group is a Bethesda, Maryland-based private investment firm with diversified holdings, including retail. This acquisition combines Capitol Hill Group’s financial resources with Worldwide Golf’s specialty retail expertise to provide Big 5 with the long-term capital and strategic support to re-energize growth and further build on its competitive position in the sporting goods retail sector across its western United States footprint.

“Big 5 has a long and rich retail heritage in the Western United States,” said Ted Shin, CEO of Worldwide Golf and Capitol Hill Group. “We believe there is a great opportunity to build off of that legacy and enhance the enjoyment in sports for our current and future customers and communities. We look forward to unlocking future growth opportunities for Big 5 for the benefit of our customers, vendor partners and employees.”

In connection with the closing of the merger, Big 5’s common stock will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, and Big 5 will cease to be a publicly traded company. Big 5 will remain an independent company within the Capitol Hill Group portfolio and leverage the combined resources of the partnership.

Moelis & Company LLC served as financial advisor and Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal advisor to Big 5. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Holland & Knight LLP, and Sklar Kirsh LLP served as legal advisors to Capitol Hill Group and its related entities.

[TITLE]How Uniqlo Is Mapping Out the ‘Next Era of Clothing’ Through Circularity:
[TEXT]
Uniqlo’s circular initiative “Re.Uniqlo,” operated by Fast Retailing, Japan’s largest fashion company, is marking its fifth year. What began as a concept has evolved into a core business strategy, driven by Koji Yanai, group executive officer overseeing sustainability, and creative director Clare Waight Keller, who frames her mission as “designing the lifespan of clothing.”

Across the fashion industry, circular strategies are multiplying — global SPAs are strengthening garment collection schemes, while European luxury houses are elevating biodiversity as a strategic pillar. Uniqlo’s approach stands out by pairing donation-led cultural sensitivity with advanced recycling technologies developed in collaboration with Toray, and by linking corporate management directly with design.

Launched in 2020, Re.Uniqlo has expanded its scope from clothing collections to commercializing recycled down products, offering repair and remake services and resale pilots. This five-year phase has been

[TITLE]From gourmet fruits to artisanal breads, instant grocery delivery is going luxe:
[TEXT]
BENGALURU : With speed no longer a differentiator, grocery-delivery platforms are now serving indulgence, freshness, and aspiration—instantly.

From gourmet fruits to ozone-washed greens to artisanal sourdoughs, quick commerce is moving upmarket in search of high-end, better-paying customers to boost their margins.

The latest to join the sprint is food-delivery giant Zomato-owned Blinkit, which is looking to expand its fresh range to include ozone-washed fruits and HACCP-certified produce, as well as handpicked bread and cheese imported from Europe, two people close to the development told Mint.

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a science-based system to control food safety hazards, widely adopted by national regulators.

Doing so will help the platform increase margins and the basket size, they explained.

To be sure, it already has premium sellers such as Urban Platter selling organic produce, just like Swiggy Instamart and Zepto. However, it now plans to source hydroponics and exotic produce directly through exclusive arrangements with sellers.

“Blinkit’s market strength lends itself perfectly to premium produce, satisfying those users who are consistently showing they will pay more for better-quality farm-fresh goods," said one of the two persons, on condition of anonymity.

Blinkit declined to comment on Mint’s queries.

Its rival, Swiggy Instamart, introduced ‘Handpicked’ in June 2024, partnering with local eateries such as Brik Oven and Iyengar’s Bakery—both also available on Blinkit—to offer a range of global delicacies and oriental products. The platform later integrated the vertical with its larger Instamart service.

The category, coupled with the app's business from its private labels such as Noice, has helped drive up its average order value (AOV) to ₹612 in the June quarter of 2025-26 from ₹487 a year ago, as shown in filings with the stock exchanges.

Even Zepto, Amazon Fresh, and Flipkart Minutes are partnering with niche, upscale food and grocery brands.

The shift reflects the push by quick-commerce firms to chart a viable path to profitability by nudging customers toward higher-value, higher-margin baskets.

Gourmet items—typically priced 20-30% higher than mass-market goods—can have a direct impact on their unit economics, pushing AOV upwards of ₹600-700, according to Naveen Malpani, partner-consumer and retail at business consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat.

“These categories also carry stronger gross margins and reduce reliance on discounting, aligning with the wider premiumization trend that has been driving value growth for packaged consumer goods companies in 2025," Malpani added.

“Importantly, customers who purchase premium produce and meal packs tend to repeat more often and are more open to cross-sell opportunities such as subscriptions and ready-to-cook kits, thereby improving customer lifetime value."

While Blinkit reported an AOV of ₹669, Swiggy Instamart’s stood at ₹612 in the June quarter of 2025-26.

Blinkit's adjusted revenue exceeded ₹2,400 crore in the quarter, while it incurred a net loss of ₹162 crore due to increased investments in quick commerce.

Swiggy Instamart's operating revenue touched ₹806 crore in the same period, while its net loss widened to ₹797 crore against ₹280 crore in the year-ago period.

Value over price

With many urban consumers willing to pay a premium for clean-label produce, a new wave of farm-fresh startups has emerged in recent years.

Online grocery shoppers tend to have a higher affinity for premium fruits and vegetables, as they are generally equated with better quality, said Pratik Gupta, who founded Pluckk in 2021.

“Even though the fresh category has been typically dominated by a stronger offline presence all these years, the advent of quick commerce has changed the game," he said.

Pluckk supplies gourmet meal kits and ozone-washed, non-GMO fresh fruits and vegetables to large quick and e-commerce retailers as well as offline stores.

Anant Goel, a former executive at Reliance Retail-backed Milkbasket, who founded Handpickd in April 2024, said many users are willing to wait a few extra hours for better produce, with a large part of this shift stemming from growing quality concerns

[TITLE]The “Invisible Hand” and fake invoices, the ministers’ surprise about Kövesi, Paulson and UBS, what Goldman Sachs was doing with Mylonas, the Belgians looking into Eurobank:
[TEXT]
Newsroom October 2 09:43

Hello, I’d like to start today with the success of the “Greek FBI” in uncovering yet another major case involving forged and fake invoices, where various schemers try to steal VAT — in other words, public funds. In recent years, both the Greek Police services and, more importantly, the Anti–Money Laundering Authority and the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE) have admittedly “caught” many such or similar cases. In these cases, we often hear — because they are included in the official reports of the Authorities and sent to the prosecutor — various well-known names: artists, celebrities, football figures, and so on. The problem is that in Greece, “miracles” seem to last only a few days, just long enough to make media noise. Afterwards, everything is forgotten, and the main figures in these major fraud cases walk away unscathed (or almost unscathed) and carry on with their lives — often repeating the same or very similar financial crimes. It’s as if some “invisible hand” intervenes and magically erases or neatly covers everything up. So I want to ask publicly: who is this “invisible hand” that ultimately untangles all the messes for the country’s pseudo-celebrities, even if they’re being pursued by [Minister] Chrysochoidis, [prosecutor] Vourliotis, or [AADE head] Pitsilis? Is it one person, or a combination of entanglement, corruption, and public relations?

Kövesi – A Surprise Visit

Yesterday, European Chief Prosecutor Laura Kövesi was in Athens, where she met with Ministers Pierrakakis, Chrysochoidis, and Floridis. I spoke with all my sources, and they all told me almost exactly the same thing — with minor variations —

[TITLE]ESG vs. CSR vs. sustainability: What's the difference?:
[TEXT]
The terms environmental, social and governance and corporate social responsibility are being used more widely to describe how businesses can show their commitment to sustainability.

The terms have some overlapping meaning and are sometimes used interchangeably. But with tightening expectations on corporate practices and increasing concerns surrounding environmental sustainability, businesses should know what these terms mean, how they differ and where they overlap.

In recent years, environmental sustainability has become a top business focus, and for good reason. With growing fears

[TITLE]Shein enters bricks-and-mortar retail in France, sparking backlash:
[TEXT]
(Reuters) -Online fast-fashion retailer Shein plans to open its first bricks-and-mortar shops in France in November under an agreement with department store owner Société des Grands Magasins, a move that sparked criticism from French retailers.

The stores in the BHV department store in central Paris and Galeries Lafayette department stores in five other French cities mark a new step for Shein, which has up to now only hosted temporary marketing-driven pop-ups around the world.

SGM president Frédéric Merlin said the launch would attract a younger clientele, adding that a customer might buy a Shein item and a designer handbag on the same day.

Galeries Lafayette, which sold the stores operated by SGM under its name through a franchise agreement, said it opposed the move, which would violate the franchise agreement, and plans to stop it from happening.

“Galeries Lafayette profoundly disagrees with this decision with regards to the positioning and practices of this ultra fast fashion brand that is in contradiction with its offer and values,” the group said in a statement.

RETAILERS CRITICISE DEPARTMENT STORE DEAL WITH SHEIN

Shein, which sells 12-euro dresses and 20-euro jeans, faces pressure from other retailers, politicians and regulators in France, where lawmakers have backed a draft law regulating fast fashion that would, if implemented, ban Shein from advertising.

"In front of the Paris City Hall, they are creating the new Shein megastore, which – after destroying dozens of French brands – aims to flood our market even more massively with disposable products," Yann Rivoallan, head of fashion retail association Fédération Francaise du Pret-a-Porter, said in a statement.

French retailers were already struggling to compete with Zara and H&M when Shein launched, drawing cost-conscious consumers in with its discounts.

Several French fast-fashion retailers such as Jennyfer and NafNaf went into insolvency proceedings earlier this year.

SHEIN'S BRICKS-AND-MORTAR LAUNCH BRINGS CHALLENGES

Shein sells clothes and accessories at rock-bottom prices thanks to its business model of sending parcels direct from factories in China to shoppers around the world, benefiting from customs rules giving low-value e-commerce parcels an exemption from duties.

Shein executives have said its success is due to its online-only business model, meaning it has little unsold inventory, unlike bricks-and-mortar retailers.

Setting up physical stores is a big departure from that model, requiring the company to maintain inventory in stores, which will add to running costs.
