[TITLE]Verb Technology Company (Nasdaq: VERB) Successfully Closes $558 Million Private Placement to Launch First Publicly Listed TON Treasury Strategy Company, in Partnership with Kingsway Capital:
[TEXT]
LAS VEGAS, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verb Technology Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: VERB) (“the Company”), today announced the successful closing of its previously announced upsized and oversubscribed $558 million private placement (“PIPE transaction”), in partnership with Kingsway Capital (“Kingsway”). The completion of the PIPE transaction marks a critical milestone in the Company’s plans to become the first and largest publicly traded treasury reserve of Toncoin ($TON). $TON is the native cryptocurrency of TON blockchain, the blockchain integrated with Telegram, one of the world's most widely used messaging platforms.

The PIPE transaction, which priced approximately 58.7 million shares of common stock, included participation from over 110 institutional and crypto-native investors, led by Kingsway and anchored by Vy Capital, Blockchain.com, Ribbit Capital, and Graticule (GAMA). Additional investors include CMCC Global, Pantera, MEXC Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Luxor Capital, Arrington Capital, Animoca, Kraken, Primitive Ventures, BitGo, FalconX, Orbs Group, The Open Platform (TOP), TVM Ventures, Kenetic, Hivemind Capital, UNCAP, Pacific Coast Venture Partners, and several high-profile crypto founders like Guy Young, Founder of Ethena Labs.

“As the exclusive blockchain infrastructure powering Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem, we believe in the utility and potential growth in adoption of Toncoin,” said Manuel Stotz, incoming Executive Chairman. “With today’s completed placement and the backing of an exceptional list of investors, we are building a next-generation treasury platform to define a new category of digital asset reserves.”

Company Strategy

The Company plans to immediately begin using the majority of the net proceeds from the PIPE transaction to acquire $TON, which will serve as its primary treasury reserve asset. The strategy is expected to generate sustainable staking rewards to initiate, manage, and grow the Company’s $TON exposure in a cash flow positive manner. The Company intends to rebrand as TON Strategy Co. (“TSC”) to reflect its new direction. In addition, the Company will continue to operate its existing business units, each of which leverages its social commerce technology and video marketing expertise, which are expected to expand.

Company Leadership and Special Advisor

As previously announced, the Company will be led by a deeply experienced team driving its digital asset strategy:

Executive Chairman Manuel Stotz is the Founder & CEO of Kingsway and serves as President of the TON Foundation.

[TITLE]Software firm MeridianLink to go private in $2 billion deal with Centerbridge:
[TEXT]
U.S. financial software provider MeridianLink said on Monday it would be acquired by investment firm Centerbridge Partners in a $2 billion deal, taking it private roughly four years after its New York debut.

Optimism around potential rate cuts and easing economic uncertainty amid progress on trade deals have laid the groundwork for a pickup in private-equity buyouts. Dealmaking appetite for software businesses has also remained robust this year.

MeridianLink shareholders will receive $20 apiece in cash for each share held, implying a 26 per cent premium to the stock's last close. Shares of the Irvine, California-based company, which powers digital lending and account opening for financial institutions, jumped 24 per cent in afternoon trading.

"Industry consolidation has been a key theme in fintech and we view the multiple as reasonable," said William Blair analyst Cristopher Kennedy.

"We have long held the belief that MerdianLink would represent an attractive asset as the company generates strong EBITDA margins at around 40 per cent."

The deal also highlights the growing trend of money managers seeking strategic control of technology companies driving digital transformation in financial services.

Centerbridge is also not new to the fintech space, having acquired bank tech firm CSI in a $1.6 billion deal in 2022.

"As the pace of change across the finance and tech sectors continues to accelerate, MeridianLink is uniquely positioned to help financial institutions enhance their digital lending and credit reporting capabilities," said Centerbridge's Jared Hendricks and Ben Jaffe.

Founded in 1998, MeridianLink caters to nearly 2,000 community financial institutions and reporting agencies. Its revenue rose 8 per cent to $84.6 million during the three months ended June 30, while net loss narrowed to $3 million.

Centerview Partners and J.P. Morgan are advisers to MeridianLink on the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Goldman Sachs is advising Centerbridge.

[TITLE]4 M&A trends keeping bankers busy this summer: JPMorgan:

Forget summer Fridays.

The notion of "summer lull" has been gone from Wall Street since the pandemic, said Anu Aiyengar, global head of advisory and M&A at JPMorgan Chase. And it's never been more true than now: M&A activity has been rebounding even amid fears that Trump's trade wars could slow the economy.

"The last week of May and June and early July have all been pretty active with a good cadence of deal announcements," Aiyengar told Business Insider. "And more importantly, our pipeline and conversations continue to be active as well."

The bank on Wednesday released a report showing that M&A in the first half of the year hit its highest levels since 2022, driven largely by large deals. Here are four of the top trends keeping bankers busy as we head into a not-so-sleepy August:

Bigger is better

JPMorgan said total deal volume soared 27% to $2.2 trillion in the first half of 2025, including a 57% increase in deals over $10 billion.

Deals over $1 billion rose 72% — a 20-year high, the bank said.

Sector by sector

The bank said 7 out of 9 sectors saw double-digit volume growth, including:

Financial institutions (+56%)

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Media & communications (+51%)

Diversified Industries (+41%)

M&A volumes seemed to favor technology (23%) and diversified industries (22%), the bank said.

Pie chart JPMorgan

Private equity dealmaking

Private equity firms, known in M&A parlance as financial sponsors, have ramped up dealmaking, leading to $168 billion in take-private deals in the first half of 2025, the highest levels since 2022, the bank said.

Four mega-deals accounted for more than 50% of that volume—indicating a highly concentrated but aggressive deployment of capital.

Minority stakes

Sponsors increased their minority stake transactions, especially in high-growth sectors. Sponsor-led minority deals rose 34% year-over-year and were 9% above the 10-year average of $81 billion.

A substantial share—35% of these deals—were in technology, driven by investments in AI, compute infrastructure, and data center capabilities.

[TITLE]Singtel logs 14% rise in first-quarter profit on Optus, regional partners' boost:
[TEXT]
Singapore Telecommunications posted a 14 per cent increase in first-quarter underlying profit on Wednesday (Aug 13), driven by strong results from its Australian unit Optus and contributions from regional associates, including India's Bharti Airtel.

Singtel's improved performance highlighted price hikes for telecom services in key markets and resilient growth from its regional associates, led by Bharti Airtel, whose post-tax contribution from India and South Asia more than doubled during the quarter.

Post-tax contribution from regional associates, including Bharti Airtel, Indonesia's Telkomsel, and Thailand's AIS, grew 24.5 per cent to S$468 million.

As a result, Singtel's first-quarter underlying net profit rose to S$686 million (US$534.77 million) from S$603 million a year earlier, largely in line with the consensus estimate of S$686.9 million, according to Visible Alpha.

"We achieved a strong set of first-quarter results despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and currency fluctuations," Singtel CEO Yuen Kuan Moon said.

On a statutory basis, Singtel reported a net profit of S$2.88 billion, sharply higher from S$690 million seen last year, bolstered by one-off gains from the sale of a partial stake in Airtel and the Intouch-Gulf Energy merger.

Yuen forecast the telecom operator's data centre business to be a "bright spot" in the ongoing financial year as its data centres in Thailand and Singapore near completion.

[TITLE]1Kosmos Raises $57 Million in Series B Funding for Identity-First Security:
[TEXT]
1Kosmos has secured $57 million in Series B funding for its passwordless identity verification technology.

The company will use the investment, which includes a $10 million line of credit from Bridge Bank, to fuel product innovation, expand integrations with IAM, CIAM, PAM, and zero trust platforms, and accelerate global growth.

Today’s momentum comes amid recent achievements for the company, including FedRAMP High and Kantara certification, a $194.5 million Login.gov contract, and a Microsoft Entra ID integration.

Passwordless identity verification company 1Kosmos raised $57 million this week in a Series B round. The investment, which boosts the company’s total funding to $72 million, consists of a $10 million line of credit from Bridge Bank, as well as contributions from Forgepoint Capital and Origami’s Oquirrh Ventures, which led the round, and Craig Abod, NextEra Energy Ventures, Gula Tech Adventures, and the 1Kosmos management team.

“Identity has become the first step in the kill chain. This investment allows us to strengthen the proactive controls organizations need to prevent impersonation-based attacks—whether it’s a sophisticated hacking group or a state-sponsored developer hiding in plain sight,” said 1Kosmos CEO Hemen Vimadalal, noting the rise in impersonation-based attacks from sophisticated hacking groups and state-sponsored actors. “1Kosmos identity verification is the only practical solution that can be quickly deployed in a matter of hours to effectively combat this threat.”

1Kosmos will use the funds to advance product innovation; deepen technology integrations with identity and access management (IAM), customer identity and access management (CIAM), privileged access management (PAM), and zero trust platforms; and accelerate global expansion across North America, EMEA, and APAC.

Founded in 2018, 1Kosmos uses live biometrics to facilitate passwordless access for workers, customers, and citizens to digital services. The company’s BlockID platform creates a distributed digital identity that prevents identity impersonation, account takeover, and fraud while reducing friction. 1Kosmos’ technology performs millions of authentications each day for some of the largest banks, telecommunications, and healthcare organizations across the globe.

“The mission at 1Kosmos since its inception has stayed remarkably focused on providing individuals with a secure digital identity, one they control and use to prevent identity fraud when accessing digital services,” said Forgepoint Capital Managing Director Ernie Bio. “As the largest investor in the company, we are proud of their track record of innovation and delighted to see their accelerating growth.”

1Kosmos’ announcement comes amid a string of successes. Recent wins for the New Jersey-based company include:

Integrating its BlockID platform with Microsoft Entra ID for streamlined identity and access management.

Becoming the only full-service Kantara-certified credential service provider with FedRAMP High authorization, making it eligible for the US government’s most security-sensitive workloads.

Winning a 10-year, $194.5 million blanket purchase agreement, in partnership with Carahsoft, to supply identity proofing for Login.gov.

As organizations seek to eliminate passwords and reduce identity fraud, while improving the customer experience, 1Kosmos’ biometrics-driven approach positions it to capture the identity verification market. With fresh funding and new federal certifications, the Best of Show-winning company is aiming to scale quickly across North America, EMEA, and APAC.

[TITLE]Arkane employees demand Microsoft sever ties with Israeli military: 'We don’t want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza':
[TEXT]
Members of the French videogame union STJV at Arkane Lyon, currently developing Marvel's Blade, have published an open letter calling on Microsoft to end its relationship with the Israeli military and conduct "a transparent, independent and public audit of Microsoft technologies, contracts, services and investments to make sure they are not used to violate the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, and Microsoft’s own Human Rights Statement."

Microsoft has faced rising criticism in recent months over its entanglements with the Israeli military and its ongoing assault on Gaza, which is now estimated to have caused nearly 62,000 deaths as of August 12, 2025, many of them children. The onslaught began in October 2023 following the Hamas attack on Israel in which the group killed nearly 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.

Microsoft employees disrupted company events (and were subsequently fired) to criticize the company's work with the IDF; art rock legend Brian Eno, creator of the famous Windows 95 startup sound, issued his own call to sever ties in May. In July, a group of more than 60 Microsoft shareholders rejected the company's claim that it had investigated itself and found no wrongdoing, and called for an in-depth report into the company's human rights due diligence [HRDD].

The Arkane letter, addressed to studio leadership as well as "the heads of Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming and the overall Microsoft group," references both the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement's call for a boycott of Xbox products, and the No Azure for Apartheid petition that has been signed by more than 2,000 Microsoft employees. Regarding the latter, Microsoft has been "turning a blind eye to demands from its own team," the letter says, and that multiple employees "trying to raise awareness of the situation in Gaza and Microsoft's implication in it have been terminated."

Much like the shareholders demanding a report into Microsoft's HRDD procedures, the Arkane letter doesn't present Microsoft's support of the Israeli military as merely a moral issue, but also a practical one.

"Arkane Studios’ STJV section joins BDS and the No Azure for Apartheid in their demands for Microsoft to stop supporting the Israeli regime," the letter states. "We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don’t want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza. Moreover, we think it’s our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise.

"Finally, in a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs."

The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors

The letter calls for a termination of all current and future contracts with the Israeli military, an independent and public audit of all Microsoft technologies and services used by the Israeli miliitary, an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and a commitment to "uphold free speech and ensure the protection of pro-Palestinian speech and the safety of allies employes, as well as any actions, fundraising initiatives on internal company platforms."

This, as far as I know, is the first studio-attributed call for Microsoft to sever ties with the Israeli military, although the letter notes it comes specifically from Arkane's "STJV section," which affords protections that prior individual protesters didn't have. French labor laws include rights and protections for workers not offered in many other countries, and like other trade unions in France, SJTV isn't shy

[TITLE]Telefonica SA (TEF) Getting Rid of Huawei Equipment in Europe:
[TEXT]
Telefónica, S.A. (NYSE:TEF) is one of the best low-priced stocks to buy right now. On July 30, the company confirmed it is replacing all of its 5G equipment made by Chinese manufacturer Huawei within the European Union.

The change will affect the company’s equipment in Spain and Germany as it seeks to comply with local regulations. Telecom companies in the European Union are required to remove Huawei-made devices from core 5G networks due to security risks.

The ban also applies in Britain, whereby Telefonica says it has very low exposure to Huawei equipment on its network. Nevertheless, the company plans to maintain its equipment in Brazil as the rules don’t apply there. Brazil and Latin American nations have yet to ban or restrict the use of Huawei networking equipment.

Telefónica, S.A. (NYSE:TEF) is a multinational telecommunications company that provides a wide range of services. It offers fixed and mobile telephony, broadband, and subscription television, as well as digital solutions such as cloud computing and cybersecurity. It maintains operations in Europe and Latin America, serving individuals and businesses.

While we acknowledge the potential of TEF as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
