MONROE, Mich., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in the retail and manufacture of residential furniture, today reported second quarter results for the period ended October 25, 2025. For the quarter, sales totaled $522 million, up slightly against the prior year comparable period, reflecting growth in Retail and Wholesale segments, offset by a decline in Joybird sales. Operating margin was 6.9% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and 7.1% on an adjusted(1) basis. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.70 on a GAAP basis and $0.71 on an adjusted(1) basis.

Second quarter total written sales for the Retail segment (company-owned La-Z-Boy stores) grew 4% versus a year ago and written same-store sales (which exclude the impact of both newly opened stores and newly acquired stores) were down 2%. This represents a continued sequential improvement in written same-store sales trends over the last two quarters against a challenging consumer and macroeconomic environment.

Melinda D. Whittington, Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We were pleased to deliver modest sales growth, particularly in our Wholesale segment where we also again delivered margin expansion, continuing to create our own momentum in what remains a choppy landscape. We are investing in the business for the long term, as highlighted by the opening of 15 new company-owned stores in the last 12 months and the advancement of our distribution and home delivery transformation project. Furthermore, in the beginning of our third quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of a 15-store network in the southeast U.S. region. Our Century Vision strategy to grow our Retail store footprint and expand brand reach is working and positions us to disproportionately benefit when overall industry volumes rebound.”

Whittington added, “In addition to investing in our core, vertically integrated North American upholstery business, we are proactively taking steps to optimize our portfolio. We have announced plans to exit our non-core wholesale casegoods and upholstery businesses in the back half of the fiscal year, announced the proposed closure of our U.K. manufacturing facility, and strategically realigned our commercial leadership and corporate staffing to enhance operating efficiency. On top of this, leveraging our North American manufacturing base with ~90% of finished goods produced in the U.S., we are successfully navigating the current trade and tariff volatility. Our iconic brand, well positioned manufacturing base, strong balance sheet, and talented team provide the foundation for continued growth and margin expansion.”

Third Quarter Outlook :

Taylor Luebke, SVP and Chief Financial Officer of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said, “We expect fiscal third quarter sales to be in the range of $525-545 million (growth of 1-4% year-over-year) and adjusted operating margin(2) to be in the range of 5.0-6.5%, reflecting advancement of our Century Vision initiatives, friction costs related to portfolio and supply chain optimizations, and a measured view on the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.”

All comparisons are to the comparable periods of Fiscal 2024, unless otherwise noted.

Fourth Quarter Key Highlights:

Gross profit of $94 million, or 31.4% of revenue, increased 16%;

Net income of $51 million, or $4.22 per diluted share, increased 12%;

totaled $271 million, an increase of 1%; Backlog (2) as of September 30, 2025 totaled $1.4 billion, an increase of 3%;

as of September 30, 2025 totaled $1.4 billion, an increase of 3%; Cash and short-term investments as of September 30, 2025 totaled $476 million.

Completed the acquisition of Remsdaq Ltd., a U.K.-based manufacturer of SCADA Remote Terminal Units for electrical substation control and automation in generation, transmission and distribution.

Full Year Key Highlights:

Revenues totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 9%;

Gross profit of $324 million, or 29.4% of revenue, increased 19%;

Net income of $181 million, or $14.86 per diluted share, increased 21%;

New orders totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 9%.

Brett A. Cope, Powell’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our fourth quarter marked a solid finish to another record year for Powell. We delivered gross profit dollar growth of 16% on revenue growth of 8%, which is a testament to the ongoing high levels of execution across our manufacturing footprint. This culminated in record quarterly earnings per share of $4.22. Our order intake of $271 million was well-balanced across markets and the commercial momentum continues as we enter Fiscal 2026. We also closed our acquisition of Remsdaq, which will allow us to scale a highly competitive and margin-accretive electrical automation solution to meet a growing and underserved demand in the markets where we compete. I’d like to thank the entire Powell team for their commitment to our customers and for another incredible year, helping to further our unique position as a supplier of critical electrical distribution solutions to a growing array of applications.”

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results

Revenues totaled $298.0 million, an increase of 8% compared to $275.1 million in the prior year, and an increase of 4% compared to $286.3 million in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. The growth compared to the prior year was driven by higher revenue levels from the Electric Utility and Light Rail Traction Power markets, which grew by 100% and 85%, respectively, partially offset by lower revenue levels in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemical markets, which declined by 10% and 25%, respectively, as well as a 9% decline in revenue in the Commercial & Other Industrial market.

Gross profit of $93.5 million, or 31.4% of revenue, increased 16% compared to $80.4 million, or 29.2% of revenue, in the prior year and increased 6% from $87.9 million, or 30.7% of revenue, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. The improvement compared to the prior year was primarily due to favorable volume leverage and strong project execution, while continuing to operate in a stable pricing environment.

New orders totaled $271 million compared to $267 million in the prior year and $362 million in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. Order activity was well-balanced across our markets and was led by the Electric Utility and Commercial & Other Industrial markets.

Backlog totaled $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, a decrease of 2% compared to backlog as of June 30, 2025, and an increase of 3% compared to backlog as of September 30, 2024.

Net income of $51.4 million, or $4.22 per diluted share, increased 12% compared to $46.1 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, in the prior year, and increased 7% compared to $48.2 million, or $3.96 per diluted share, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025.

Full Year Fiscal 2025 Results

Revenues totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 9% compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by higher revenue levels within the Electric Utility and Commercial & Other Industrial sectors, which grew 50% and 19%, respectively, as well as an increase of 87% in the Light Rail Traction Power market. This was partially offset by revenue declines in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemical markets of 3% and 19%, respectively, compared to Fiscal 2024.

Gross profit of $324.4 million, or 29.4% of revenues, increased 19% compared to $273.1 million, or 27.0% of revenues, in Fiscal 2024. The improvement in gross margin was driven by the same factors mentioned above.

New orders totaled $1.2 billion and increased 9% compared to net new orders of $1.1 billion in Fiscal 2024. The increase was driven by higher levels of order activity across our Oil and Gas, Electric Utility, and Light Rail Traction Power markets, partially offset by lower order activity in the Petrochemical market.

Net income of $180.7 million, or $14.86 per diluted share, increased 21% compared to $149.8 million, or $12.29 per diluted share, in Fiscal 2024.

Cope added, “We remain encouraged as our funnel of opportunities across our markets remains very strong as we enter Fiscal 2026. Customer activity in the data center market remains highly encouraging as opportunities are growing in both size and volume as we expand our presence in this strategic market for Powell. Commercial activity continues to also enhance expanded opportunities in the Utility sector which continues to be a strong strategic focus for the entire company. Meanwhile, order outlook for our Oil & Gas market also remains positive, driven by our expectation for a strong and extended cycle of LNG activity which could persist across the back half of this decade based on current application activity and identified work. We are making the investments today to support this outlook, as our recently announced capacity expansion at our Jacintoport manufacturing facility is well underway and expected to be completed in the second half of Fiscal 2026.”

OUTLOOK

Commenting on the Company's outlook, Michael Metcalf, Powell’s Chief Financial Officer, said, “We are very pleased with our financial performance in Fiscal 2025 as well as the composition, margin profile and schedule of our current backlog. This, combined with our expectation for continued strong order activity across the largest markets we serve, leave us confident in our ability to deliver another year of solid financial results in Fiscal 2026. Notwithstanding the typical softness due to seasonality in our Fiscal first quarter, we believe that on a total year basis, the margin profile recognized in fiscal 2025 is sustainable as we enter Fiscal 2026, as the pricing environment remains stable and we continue to efficiently execute and close out projects in our backlog, supporting our outlook for a successful Fiscal 2026.”

[TITLE]Sustainable Business and Finance: Finance heads urge maturity on ‘woke banking’ debate:
[TEXT]
The committee is due to report back on New Zealand First’s Financial Markets (Conduct of Institutions) Amendment (Duty to Provide) Amendment Bill, dubbed the “woke banking” bill, on November 21.

The bill targets banking policies around ESG – environmental, social and governance policies - which guide how banks manage risks and opportunities beyond basic profit and loss.

The legislation seeks to ensure no New Zealand business is denied bank services unless the decision is based in law. Its supporters say it will prevent ESG standards from drawing on “woke ideology” in the banking sector.

Coalition Government partner Act has also called for the end of “banking wokery” and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is reported to support the bill’s aims, saying it was unacceptable for petrol businesses and mines to be denied banking services due to banks’ citing climate change goals.

Critics of the bill note that internationally, financial institutions are increasingly aligning lending with ESG criteria. Globally, more than US$2 trillion was deployed into green and transition finance in 2024 alone.

They argue that making banks invest in carbon-emitting industries introduces financial risk. If those assets lose value, it is irresponsible lending.

Meanwhile in Brazil, the UN climate conference is meeting without the United States - the world’s top oil producer and second biggest greenhouse gas emitter - whose climate-sceptic president supports the fossil fuels industry and derides renewable energy.

It’s all regrettable “noise” for the Centre for Sustainable Finance (CSF), an independent charitable trust that works across the financial system to align financial markets’ settings and initiatives with long-term resilience.

“It’s actually been a pretty hostile environment, and what we’re seeing is that it’s driving a bit of wariness among financial institutions

Management has assessed the impact of this change as immaterial to the financial statements. For the three month period ended September 30, 2024, this resulted in the reclassification of $2.9 million and $15.2 million of vessel operating expenses and amortization of deferred drydock and special survey costs, respectively, under the captions “Vessel operating expenses (including management fees)” and “Depreciation and amortization” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate amount of $18.1 million was previously presented under the caption “Direct vessel expenses” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three month period ended September 30, 2024. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, this resulted in the reclassification of $9.2 million and $45.4 million of vessel operating expenses and amortization of deferred drydock and special survey costs, respectively, under the captions “Vessel operating expenses (including management fees)” and “Depreciation and amortization” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate amount of $54.6 million was previously presented under the caption “Direct vessel expenses” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024.

Three month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024

Time charter and voyage revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 increased by $6.1 million, or 1.8%, to $346.9 million, as compared to $340.8 million for the same period in 2024. The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to the increase in the Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) rate. For the three month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, time charter and voyage revenues were positively affected by $6.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively, relating to the straight line effect of the charters with de-escalating rates. The TCE rate increased by 2.4% to $24,167 per day, as compared to $23,591 per day for the same period in 2024. The available days of the fleet slightly decreased by 0.8% to 13,443 days for the three month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 13,552 days for the same period in 2024.

EBITDA of Navios Partners for the three month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was affected by the item described in the table above. Excluding this item, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.4 million to $194.0 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $195.4 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to a: (i) $4.5 million decrease in other income, net, mainly due to the decrease in foreign exchange gains; (ii) $3.2 million increase in vessel operating expenses due to a 3.4% increase in the opex days and a 0.1% increase in the opex daily rate to $6,798 also as a result of the change in the composition of our fleet; and (iii) $2.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses in accordance with our administrative services agreement. The above decrease was partially mitigated by a: (i) $6.1 million increase in time charter and voyage revenues; and (ii) $2.2 million decrease in time charter and voyage expenses, mainly due to the decrease in bunker expenses arising from the decreased days of freight voyages in the third quarter of 2025.

Net Income for the three month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was affected by the items described in the table above. Excluding these items, Adjusted Net Income decreased by $12.8 million to $83.7 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $96.5 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease in Adjusted Net Income was primarily due to : (i) an $8.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization; (ii) a $2.1 million increase in interest expense and finance cost, net; (iii) a $1.4 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA; (iv) a $0.3 million decrease in amortization of unfavorable lease terms; and (v) a $0.2 million decrease in interest income.

Nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024

Time charter and voyage revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 decreased by $22.9 million, or 2.3%, to $978.6 million, as compared to $1,001.5 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease in revenue was mainly attributable to the decrease in the available days of our fleet and the revenue from freight voyages. For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, time charter and voyage revenues were positively affected by $10.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, relating to the straight line effect of the charters with de-escalating rates. The TCE rate was marginally lower at $22,825 per day, compared with $22,830 per day in the same period in 2024. The available days of the fleet slightly decreased by 0.7% to 40,287 days for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 40,590 days for the same period in 2024.

EBITDA of Navios Partners for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was affected by the item described in the table above. Excluding this item, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $29.2 million to $520.2 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $549.4 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to a: (i) $22.9 million decrease in time charter and voyage revenues; (ii) $19.1 million increase in vessel operating expenses due to a 4.6% increase in the opex days and a 2.4% increase in the opex daily rate to $6,961 also as a result of the change in the composition of our fleet; (iii) $6.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses in accordance with our administrative services agreement; and (iv) $4.1 million increase in other expense, net. The above decrease was partially mitigated by a $23.0 million decrease in time charter and voyage expenses, mainly due to the decrease in bunker expenses arising from the decreased days of freight voyages in the nine month period ended September 30, 2025.

Net Income for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was affected by the items described in the table above. Excluding these items, Adjusted Net Income decreased by $66.5 million to $195.7 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $262.2 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease in Adjusted Net Income was primarily due to a: (i) $29.2 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA; (ii) $26.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization; (iii) $9.6 million increase in interest expense and finance cost, net; (iv) $0.8 million decrease in amortization of unfavorable lease terms; and (v) $0.7 million decrease in interest income.

(1) Available days for the fleet represent total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Partners’ possession for the relevant period after subtracting off-hire days associated with scheduled repairs, drydockings or special surveys and ballast days. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which a vessel is capable of generating revenues. (2) Operating days are the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels were off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues. (3) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Partners’ vessels were available for generating revenue, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure efficiency in finding employment for vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels were off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs, drydockings or special surveys. (4) Opex days for the fleet represent total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Partners’ possession for the relevant period after subtracting total calendar days of Navios Partners’ charter-in vessels and bareboat-out vessels. (5) TCE rate: TCE rate per day is defined as voyage, time charter revenues and charter-out revenues under bareboat contracts (grossed up by the applicable vessel operating expenses for the respective periods) less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of available days during the period. The TCE rate per day is a customary shipping industry performance measure used primarily to present the actual daily earnings generated by vessels on various types of charter contracts for the number of available days of the fleet. (6) Opex rate: Opex rate per day is defined as vessel operating expenses (including management fees) divided by the number of opex days during the period.

[TITLE]Industry urges pragmatic EU Chips Act 2.0 to close gap with US and China:
[TEXT]
By Toby Sterling

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -The European Union must incentivise investments by computer chip equipment, materials and design firms to ensure the bloc's ​security and not lag further behind U.S. and Asian rivals, industry group ‌SEMI Europe recommended on Tuesday.

The EU Commission had asked SEMI, which represents hundreds of European chip industry firms, for ‌recommendations as it revises the 2023 Chips Act, which focused on attracting 43 billion euros of investment into chip facilities in Europe.

The U.S., China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan have similar initiatives as the race for market share and need for supply chain security accelerates ⁠in the AI era.

Following pressure from ‌national governments led by the Netherlands, the EU Commission is due to complete a review of the law in March, a half year ahead ‍of schedule, and propose significant revisions in what has been dubbed Chips Act 2.0.

"It is important to build on Europe’s strong foundations with pragmatic reforms," SEMI said.

Rather than focusing on attracting ​advanced manufacturing — such as a previous failed attempt to bring Intel (INTC) to Germany ‌— funding must go to projects that will support European supply chains and build on existing strengths such as in equipment manufacturing, where Europe hosts firms such as ASML in the Netherlands.

That means letting go of the strict "first of a kind" criterion for state aid. Meanwhile, to speed up project approvals, the EU must designate a single point ⁠of contact for firms and governments and set itself a ​public timeline to approve or deny projects, SEMI said.

European ​governments in a Dutch-led coalition in October called on the EU to adopt a Chips Act 2.0 that prioritised "the semiconductor sector as a ‍strategic industry on par with ⁠aerospace and defence and ... if necessary use all the available instruments to protect it".

In addition to investment tax breaks and project funding from member states,⁠ SEMI argues the EU should also have a budget of 20 billion euros ($23 billion) for chip ‌projects, which would represent a quadrupling.
