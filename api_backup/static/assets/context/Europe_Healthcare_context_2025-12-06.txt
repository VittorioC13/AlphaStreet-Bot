What is Acute Myeloid Leukemia?

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer that impacts the bone marrow and blood. In this condition, the bone marrow produces abnormal myeloid cells, immature white blood cells that would normally mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These abnormal cells multiply quickly, crowding out healthy blood cells and disrupting normal bone marrow function. As a result, the body experiences a shortage of normal blood cells, leading to a range of symptoms and complications. Common signs and symptoms of AML include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, easy bruising or bleeding, frequent infections, fever, and unintentional weight loss. These symptoms arise from both the reduced number of healthy blood cells and the accumulation of abnormal cells in the marrow and bloodstream. AML can advance rapidly, making early diagnosis and treatment essential.

[TITLE]Breakthrough Therapies Advance as Rare Disease Burden Intensifies Across Aging Populations:
[TEXT]
AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioMedWire Editorial Coverage: Chronic illnesses and rare disorders among older Americans represent a rapidly intensifying challenge for the U.S. healthcare system, with the National Institutes of Health estimating that more than 30 million people nationwide are living with a rare disease. Most of these conditions have no FDA-approved therapies, leaving older adults particularly at risk as age-related changes can mask or delay accurate diagnosis. This growing strain on care has heightened the need for novel treatments that address significant unmet medical needs. Soligenix Inc. (NASDAQ: SNGX) (Profile), a late-stage biopharmaceutical developer, is advancing several rare-disease therapies, including HyBryte[TM] (synthetic hypericin) for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), where it is currently running the final confirmatory trial necessary before seeking global marketing authorization. As the Trump administration pursues new health-policy measures focused on chronic and rare diseases, Soligenix’s programs are positioned at a pivotal crossroads of scientific innovation and national healthcare goals. The company is working alongside several prominent leaders in the pharmaceutical and life sciences sectors, including AMGEN Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN), Amicus Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: FOLD), Citius Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ: CTOR) and Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: TNXP).

CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, disproportionately affects older individuals.

FLASH2 represents the final major confirmatory step before Soligenix can pursue worldwide marketing approvals for HyBryte.

The initial FLASH trial delivered statistically significant results and set the stage for the FLASH2 confirmatory program.

A continuing investigator-initiated study at the University of Pennsylvania is offering additional insight into HyBryte’s real-world performance.

Beyond its established CTCL indication, Soligenix is pursuing several life-cycle opportunities to expand HyBryte’s reach and value.

A Complex Diagnostic Puzzle Amid Shifting Federal Priorities

Rare diseases have historically been hard to diagnose, but older adults often encounter even greater hurdles. Many symptoms associated with rare conditions resemble common age-related issues, such as rashes, cognitive changes, chronic inflammation or persistent fatigue, creating ongoing risk for misdiagnosis. The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) reports that patients typically endure a five- to seven-year journey before clinicians reach an accurate diagnosis.

Such delays can worsen outcomes, postpone interventions and create emotional and financial strain, especially for seniors who may cycle through several specialists before receiving clarity. Symptoms linked to rare disorders can also be mistaken for normal aging. For instance, minor-appearing skin abnormalities can disguise early cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Neurological or systemic manifestations tied to rare autoimmune or genetic conditions may be misinterpreted as dementia, arthritis, or other routine geriatric concerns. This overlap complicates clinical evaluations and often necessitates advanced diagnostics or additional expert opinions to determine the correct diagnosis.

Meanwhile, federal policy is evolving to address widespread chronic disease pressures. The Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again initiative underscores early screening, chronic-care management and broadened access to innovative therapies. The program also cites goals related to affordability, better care coordination and faster approval pathways for next-generation treatments.

Soligenix is focused on several initiatives that fit within these national healthcare objectives. The company recently shifted U.S.-based manufacturing of HyBryte’s active pharmaceutical ingredient, strengthening domestic supply chains. Soligenix is also conducting FLASH2, the confirmatory phase 3 replication trial of HyBryte for CTCL. This study builds on the prior statistically significant FLASH trial, a successful comparative study, and multiple investigator-initiated projects, together forming a comprehensive dataset that informs FLASH2 expectations.

A Rising Challenge for an Aging Population

CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, disproportionately affects older individuals. The disease occurs when malignant T-cells migrate to the skin, creating patches, plaques or tumors that intensify or expand over time. CTCL is chronic, non-curable and frequently misdiagnosed early on because it mimics eczema, psoriasis and other common dermatologic conditions seen in older adults.

Epidemiological estimates indicate that more than 70,000 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients worldwide are affected by CTCL. The global CTCL treatment market is valued at over $250 million, with approximately $90 million attributed to the U.S. Despite this market, therapeutic choices remain scarce. No approved first-line option exists for early-stage CTCL (stage I–IIA), which represents nearly 90% of cases. Most patients depend on off-label medications, phototherapy or immune-modulating approaches, many of which involve significant risks or inconsistent long-term results.

Mycosis fungoides, the most prevalent CTCL subtype, accounts for the majority of cases. Although early-stage disease has a five-year survival rate of roughly 88%, it is a chronic cancer with unpredictable progression. Many existing therapies require lengthy timelines—often a year or more—before yielding statistically meaningful improvement.

HyBryte introduces a new mechanism specifically tailored for early-stage CTCL and is positioned to fill this critical treatment gap. If approved, it could become the first front-line option for early disease, using a photodynamic approach in which synthetic hypericin is activated by visible light. Its targeted mode of action, demonstrated efficacy, and potential safety benefits set it apart from ultraviolet phototherapy and systemic agents.

Driving Toward Global Regulatory Milestones

FLASH2 represents the final major confirmatory step before Soligenix can pursue worldwide marketing approvals for HyBryte. The European Medicines Agency has already accepted the trial design, which mirrors the original FLASH study and includes an extended 18-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period. This modification reflects regulator feedback as well as findings from comparative trials and academic studies supporting longer treatment durations.

The FLASH2 study is expected to enroll

[TITLE]Laigo Bio raises €11.5 million in seed financing to advance its SureTAC™ targeted protein degradation candidates in oncology and auto-immunity:
[TEXT]
Financing co-led by Kurma Partners and Curie Capital, includes strong line-up of European investors

Matthew Baker appointed as CEO

Laigo Bio’s SureTAC™ membrane protein degradation technology targets key signaling molecules in autoimmune, graft rejection, and oncology

UTRECHT, the Netherlands - 4 December 2025 (08:30 CET). Laigo Bio, a company pioneering novel and highly differentiated therapies using its proprietary SureTAC™ precision membrane protein degradation platform, has successfully raised €11.5 million in a seed financing. The company will use the proceeds to advance its SureTAC™ oncology programs towards clinical development, and to accelerate discovery and development of its three SureTAC™ immunology candidate therapeutic programs for selected autoimmune and immunology indications and graft rejection.

Laigo Bio also announces the appointment of Dr Matthew Baker, the current acting Chief Executive Officer, as its CEO. Dr Baker is an accomplished serial biotech executive, with more than two decades of experience in inflammatory and oncology drug development, including previous roles as CEO at NeoPhore Ltd., non-executive director at Oxford Genetics, CSO at Abzena and CEO and CSO at Antitope Ltd, amongst several other senior positions. He is also a non-executive director at Fusion Antibodies, a leading CRO providing antibody development services.

“This seed funding is a strong endorsement of both the scientific foundation and the unique potential of our approach enabling selective degradation of membrane-bound targets involved in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases,” said Dr Matthew Baker, Chief Executive Officer of Laigo Bio. “With these resources, we are well positioned to initiate discovery efforts in auto-immunity and to advance our oncology programs through preclinical development. Our team remains focused on achieving key preclinical milestones and progressing our first-in-class lead programs toward early clinical evaluation, to deliver transformative therapies for patients.”

Surface Removal Targeting Chimeras (SureTAC™), developed by Prof Madelon Maurice’s laboratory at the UMC Utrecht, are proprietary therapeutic candidates for targeted degradation of membrane proteins, that have been validated as disease drivers but have eluded drug discovery, and were long considered "undruggable". Developed by Laigo Bio, SureTAC™ are bispecific antibody molecules that induce degradation by bringing the cell surface target protein into close proximity with a surface E3 ligase enzyme, resulting in highly selective and deep inhibition of disease pathways in disease tissues.

In its oncology programs aimed at the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and VEGF, and a hard-to-drug Wnt pathway receptor, Laigo Bio has shown that its SureTAC™ degradation technology results in remarkable in vivo and in vitro efficacy. SureTACs show a high degree of selectivity for targeting diseased tissue, resulting in improved toxicity and safety. Laigo Bio intends to advance its oncology programs internally until completion of preclinical studies before collaborating with pharmaceutical partners to bring them into the clinic.

The funding round was co-led by Kurma Partners and Curie Capital. The other investors were Argobio Studio, Angelini Ventures (the venture capital arm of Angelini Industries, which is investing $300 million across a biotech and digital health portfolio in North-America and Europe), Eurazeo (a leading European investment group managing €36.8 billion across private equity, debt, real estate, and infrastructure), the Oncode Bridge Fund, ROM Utrecht region (a regional investor backed by the European Regional Development Fund), and UK-based Cancer Research Horizons, the translation subsidiary of the world’s largest charitable funder of cancer research, Cancer Research UK.

Laigo Bio was founded by the Oncode Institute, together with the Oncode Bridge Fund, and Argobio Studio, an international biotech start-up studio launched by Kurma Partners, BPI France and Angelini Ventures, key players in financing innovation in healthcare.
