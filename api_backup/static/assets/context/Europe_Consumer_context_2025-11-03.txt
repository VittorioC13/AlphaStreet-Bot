Foreign institutional investors ( FIIs ) quietly lifted their stakes in most state-run lenders during the September 2025 quarter, signaling renewed confidence in India’s public banking sector. The incremental buying, spread across nearly every major PSU bank, from Bank of Baroda to State Bank of India , comes as the Nifty PSU Bank index rallied nearly 9% in October.Quarterly shareholding data shows FIIs increased their exposure to nearly all major PSU banks between June and September 2025. Bank of Baroda saw its FII shareholding rise from 8.08% to 8.71%, while Canara Bank gained 0.51 percentage points to 11.89%. Bank of India posted one of the sharper jumps, with foreign ownership climbing from 3.53% to 4.24%, a 0.71 percentage point increase.Among smaller lenders, Bank of Maharashtra saw FII shareholding rise by 0.46 percentage points to 2.35%, and Indian Overseas Bank recorded a 0.23 percentage point uptick to 0.31%. State Bank of India , the country’s largest lender, saw foreign stakes increase from 9.32% to 9.57%, while Union Bank of India moved up from 7.70% to 7.86%.A few names, however, bucked the trend. Central Bank of India and Punjab & Sind Bank saw marginal declines of 0.09 percentage points each, while UCO Bank’s FII holding remained flat at 0.13%.The renewed FII interest comes amid growing chatter that the government could lift the foreign ownership cap in PSU banks to 49% from the current 20%. The move, if cleared, could trigger billions in passive inflows and reshape the sector’s investor base.According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, such a policy shift could unlock up to $4 billion across PSU lenders. “If there’s any truth to this development, PSU banks could easily rally 20–30% in anticipation of such massive inflows,” Nuvama said.The brokerage estimates State Bank of India could attract inflows of

[TITLE]A tax-refund surge is coming, JPMorgan strategist says — and it’ll shift US economy like a new round of stimulus checks:
[TEXT]
“All of these tax breaks, with the exception of the child tax credit, are in the form of deductions” Kelly writes. “This means that the higher your marginal tax rate, the greater the value of the deduction” (1). That is, up to the point at which your income is so high that the tax cut is tapered out entirely.

Then there is the Child Tax Credit, which has been increased from $2,000 up to $2,200 and is adjusted for inflation going forward.

Employees and self-employed individuals may also deduct qualified tips from their income, with the deduction phasing out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).

The OBBBA contains hundreds of provisions. Although some of those provisions are tax cuts, these cuts are focused on specific groups. For instance, the OBBBA provided a $6,000 deduction for taxpayers age 65 and over. That tax deduction phases out when income exceeds $175,000 for a single filer or $250,000 for joint filers.

An extra $557 in tax refunds sounds like good news, but Kelly warns that this wave of repayments is not spread equally and could have unintended consequences for the broader economy. Plus, uncertainty is still looming, given the federal government has shut down as of Oct. 1. Lawmakers failed to reach a deal to pass a short-term funding bill, and the Democratic party is pushing for the reversal of some health care and social benefits cuts made in the OBBBA.

In other words, many taxpayers will pay more upfront and get a bigger refund in 2026. Kelly estimates that the average refund could be roughly $3,743 — that’s up from the average refund of $3,186 for the previous tax year, according to the IRS (2).

Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how

In a note published on LinkedIn, Kelly explained that many of the tax cuts announced as part of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) are retroactively effective from Jan. 1, 2025. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has confirmed that it will not be adjusting tax withholding rates in 2025 (1).

There’s a fresh wave of tax refunds coming for Americans in 2026. That’s according to the chief strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, David Kelly.

Story Continues

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s decision to hike tariffs impacts all consumers.

Inflation reignition

While the Trump administration is cutting taxes on personal income, it’s also raising import taxes, also known as tariffs. In an interview with Bloomberg, Kelly estimated that the current effective tariff rate is 8% and could rise to 14.5% in the near future.

“People say the retailer is going to eat it — no they’re not, they just wrote the check,” Kelly explained. “Of course, it looks like they’re eating it [but if] Walmart writes a check eventually they’re going to pass it on”(3).

Tariffs in effect as of September, 2025, could cost U.S. households up to $2,400 on average, according to Yale’s Budget Lab (4). Unlike the OBBBA tax cuts, which can disproportionately impact higher income households, these import taxes have a greater impact on poor households because a larger share of their income is spent on buying essentials, according to the Tax Foundation (5).

The combination of tariffs and tax refunds could create economic conditions that are similar to the Covid pandemic, according to Kelly (1).

“The big kicker here, that people are not talking about, is this huge rush of income tax refunds that’s going to kick in at the start of next year is going to be like an extra stimulus check,” he said. “And we’ve seen what happens…you give an American consumer a stimulus check, they will spend it ... You are going to get a second round of inflation.”

While inflation is back at 3%, Kelly estimates it could rise back up to 3.5% by the end of the year (3).

What can you do?

Although there’s no crystal ball to predict inflation or tariff rates, you can work with a financial planner to get a fair estimate of your tax refund well before tax season.

With Advisor.com, you can get matched with multiple qualified financial advisors in just minutes.

All you need to do is enter some basic information, such as your ZIP code, and Advisor.com will match you with local fiduciaries that could help you meet your financial needs. From here, you can then book a free call with no obligation to hire to make sure they’re the right fit.

If you’re earning at least $250,000 a year or are part of a household with a minimum income of $200,000, then your financial goals and needs may be somewhat unique. This is where Range might be a better fit, as they offer white-glove financial services to households in higher income brackets.

Once your equity enters this ballpark, one of the biggest financial pain points can be asset under management (AUM) fees. These fees mean that portfolio managers take as a percentage of the value, typically between 0.5% and 2%, of your managed assets — so their fees scale with your wealth.

Range offers 0% AUM fees for advisory services and a flat-fee structure so that you can preserve more of your wealth. What’s more, they also offer an all-in-one solution for everything from alternative asset management to taxes — all of which is informed by modern AI solutions, but backed by a team of certified financial professionals.

And the best part? You can book a complimentary demo to see if Range can meet your comprehensive financial needs.

Hedging against inflation

Beyond understanding your future tax situation and then working within a tight budget, there are other ways to protect your earnings against inflation.

Investing can offer better protection than a checking or savings account. That said, stock market performance can be volatile.

This is where investments like real estate and gold can become attractive alternatives.

For instance, with a gold IRA through Thor Metals, you can invest directly in physical precious metals, like gold, rather than stocks and bonds.

Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

To learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.

And when it comes to investing in real estate, you don’t have to buy property outright to tap into the market. While direct access to the $22.5-trillion commercial real estate sector has historically been limited to a select group of elite investors — that has changed now that First National Realty Partners (FNRP) stepped onto the scene.

FNRP allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.

With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to triple-net leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying

[TITLE]Stocks Finish Higher on Earnings Optimism:
[TEXT]
The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Friday closed up +0.26%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed up +0.09%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up +0.48%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) rose +0.27%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) rose +0.44%.

US stock indexes settled higher on Friday amid positive corporate earnings. Amazon.com closed up more than +9% to lead megacap technology stocks higher after reporting blowout earnings and giving an optimistic forecast. Also, Western Digital closed up more than +8% after reporting Q1 net revenue above consensus. As of Friday, Q3 earnings results from more than 60% of the companies in the S&P 500 have been reported, with more than 80% beating estimates —a bullish factor for the overall market.

Friday's minor US economic news was supportive for stocks after the Oct MNI Chicago PMI rose +3.2 to 43.8, stronger than expectations of 42.3.

Hawkish Fed comments on Friday were negative for stocks. Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said he voted against the Fed's 25 bp interest rate cut on Wednesday because "the labor market is largely in balance, the economy shows continued momentum, and inflation remains too high." Also, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said, "I did not see a need to cut rates this week, and I'd find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly." In addition, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said she "would have preferred to have held interest rate steady at Wednesday's FOMC meeting as we need to maintain some amount of restriction to help get inflation back down to target."

The markets are discounting a 64% chance of another -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on December 9-10. The markets are discounting an overall 82 bp rate cut by the end of 2026 to 3.06% from the current effective federal funds rate of 3.88%.

Stocks have support after President Trump and President Xi Jinping on Thursday agreed to extend a tariff truce, roll back export controls, and reduce other trade barriers. The US will cut fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods to 10% from 20% and extend a pause on some reciprocal tariffs for an additional year, while China resumes purchases of US soybeans, sorghum, and other farm products. The agreement also includes China pausing controls on rare-earth magnets in exchange for the US rolling back an expansion of restrictions on Chinese companies.

Q3 corporate earnings results have been running strong so far. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 80% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from +6.4% in Q2.

Regarding President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, markets are looking ahead to oral arguments at the Supreme Court scheduled for November 5 on whether the tariffs are legal. Lower courts have already ruled that Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are illegal, finding they are based on a specious claim of emergency authority. If the US Supreme Court upholds those rulings and strikes down the tariffs, then the US government will have to refund the reciprocal tariffs already collected, and Mr. Trump's power to impose tariffs will be limited to well-founded sections of US trade law. Observers expect the US Supreme Court to announce its final ruling on the reciprocal tariffs by late 2025 or early 2026.

The US government shutdown continues into its fifth week, weighing on market sentiment and the US economy. The government shutdown is delaying the release of government reports, including all the recent weekly unemployment claims reports, the September unemployment and payroll report, Aug trade balance, Sep retail sales, Sep PPI, Sep housing starts, Sep industrial production, Sep leading indicators, and others. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

Overseas stock markets settled mixed on Friday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.65%. China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.81%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 rose to a new record high and closed up sharply by +2.12%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Friday closed down -1 tick. The 10-year T-note yield fell -0.2 bp to 4.095%. T-note prices settled little changed on Friday. Strength in equity markets on Friday curbed safe-haven demand for T-notes. Also, hawkish Fed comments on Friday weighed on T-notes after Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack cited reasons for opposing Fed rate cuts. In addition, rising inflation expectations were bearish for T-notes after the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a 2-week high of 2.312% on Friday.

T-notes recovered most of their losses on Friday due to an increase in safe-haven demand after the Miami Herald reported that the US has decided to attack military fixtures in Venezuela and could act at any time.

T-note prices have continued to receive underlying support from the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields moved lower on Friday. The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.0 bp to 2.633%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell -1.4 bp to 4.409%.

The Eurozone Oct CPI eased to +2.1% y/y from +2.2% y/y in Sep, right on expectations. Oct core CPI remained unchanged from Sep at +2.4% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.3% y/y.

German Sep retail sales rose +0.2% m/m and +2.8% y/y, slightly stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.7% y/y.

Swaps are discounting a 4% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on December 18.

US Stock Movers

Amazon.com (AMZN) closed up more than +9% to lead gainers in Dow Jones Industrials and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q3 net sales of $180.17 billion, stronger than the consensus of $177.82 billion, and forecasting Q4 net sales of $206 billion-$213 billion, the midpoint above the consensus of $208.45 billion.

Brighthouse Financial (BHF) closed up more than +25% after the Financial Times reported that Aquarian Holdings is in advanced talks to acquire the company.

Twilio (TWLO) closed up more than +20% after forecasting Q4 revenue of $1.31 billion to $1.32 billion, stronger than the consensus of $1.29 billion.

Dexcom (DXCM) closed down more than -14% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after cutting its full-year adjusted gross margin estimate to 61% from a previous estimate of 62%, below the consensus of 61.8%.

Motorola Solutions (MSI) closed down more than -5% after forecasting Q4 adjusted EPS of $4.30 to $4.36, the midpoint below the consensus of $4.35.

[TITLE]Pet Perfume Market to Reach $2.7 billion, Globally, by 2034 at 6.7% CAGR: Allied Market Research:
[TEXT]
The pet perfume market is anticipated to increase due to rise in pet humanization trends, demand for premium grooming products, and the growing popularity of personalized pet care. Expanding urban pet ownership and increased consumer spending on pet hygiene further contribute to consistent sales across specialty stores, online platforms, and grooming service providers.

WILMINGTON, Del., Oct. 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allied Market Research published a report, titled, "Pet Perfume Market by Pet Type (Dog, Cat, and Others), Price Range (Economy and Premium), and Distribution Channel (Veterinary Clinics, Pet Specialty Stores, Supermarkets-Hypermarkets, Online Sales Channel, and Others): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2025-2034". According to the report, the pet perfume market was valued at $1.4 billion in 2024 and is estimated to reach $2.7 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 6.7% from 2025 to 2034.

Expanding product visibility through targeted marketing campaigns, celebrity associations with grooming product lines, and strong influence from pet-focused social media content have significantly raised awareness around pet perfume. In addition, the inclusion of pet perfume in grooming service bundles at parlors and spas has normalized regular usage. Manufacturers continue to introduce multipurpose products combining odor control with soothing or insect-repelling ingredients to address specific grooming concerns. Such developments have further propelled the growth of the pet perfume market.

Market Introduction

Pet perfume is a grooming product formulated to neutralize unpleasant odors and leave a mild, pleasant fragrance on pets. It is designed to enhance cleanliness between baths and contribute to a fresh-smelling coat. Pet perfumes are commonly used by pet owners, groomers, and veterinary professionals as part of routine grooming practices.

Formulated using water-based or alcohol-free solutions, pet perfumes often incorporate natural or synthetic fragrances along with skin-friendly ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, or oatmeal extract. These components help maintain coat hygiene without causing irritation. Beyond masking odors, pet perfume may offer additional benefits like calming effects or flea-repelling properties, depending on the formulation. Safe when used as directed, it supports overall grooming by improving both hygiene and pet-owner interaction.

Report Overview:

The pet perfume market is segmented on the basis of pet type, price range, distribution channel, and region. By pet type, the market is segmented into dogs, cats, and others. By price range, the market is bifurcated into economy and premium. By distribution channel, the market is categorized into veterinary clinics, supermarket-hypermarket, pet specialty stores, online sales channel, and others

Market Growth & Opportunities Factors:

The rise in demand for natural and organic pet products has reshaped formulation strategies in the global pet perfume market. Consumers increasingly seek grooming solutions that exclude synthetic fragrances, alcohol, parabens, and sulfate. Manufacturers are responding by using organic floral waters, plant-based essential oils, and non-toxic emulsifiers. Health-conscious consumers and urban households are accelerating the shift toward clean-label and safe pet fragrances, aligning with larger wellness and sustainability trends in the pet care industry. Transparency in ingredients and a focus on skin sensitivity have contributed to stronger market uptake, especially in developed regions.

In addition, organic pet perfumes have gained higher visibility across retail shelves and online platforms due to growing interest in hypoallergenic and eco-conscious options. Branding now highlights cruelty-free claims, biodegradable formulas, and responsibly sourced inputs. Demand in North America and Europe remains strong due to premium pet spending and regulatory support for safe grooming solutions. Brands are increasingly offering alcohol-free and skin-soothing fragrances with clearly labeled compositions, helping consumers identify and trust product safety, further strengthening their presence in the premium segment of the market.

Simultaneously, innovations in long-lasting and multifunctional pet perfumes are influencing buying preferences. Microencapsulation technologies offer extended scent duration, while added functionalities such as antibacterial action or coat detangling improve product value. Spray-on perfumes with dual calming and grooming benefits are gaining traction among time-constrained consumers. Specialty stores and veterinary clinics in markets such as Japan, the U.S., and Germany report higher demand for such solutions. Expansion of organized pet retail formats, featuring in-store testers and post-grooming product demonstrations, has improved trial and repeat purchases. Retailers offer brand exclusives and loyalty programs, encouraging regular buying. In developing markets, increasing access to structured pet retail is educating consumers and strengthening interest in pet perfumes, supporting global pet perfume market growth.

Major Challenges in Industry & Solutions:

Skin allergies and reactions in pets have created skepticism around pet perfumes, especially among owners of sensitive breeds such as Bulldogs and Persian cats. Concerns over artificial additives, alcohol, and essential oils have led to reports of rashes and inflammation, deterring trial purchases. Limited dermatological testing and lack of regulatory uniformity further undermine consumer confidence and market expansion.

However, pet perfume manufacturers can address allergy concerns by investing in clinical dermatological testing and securing hypoallergenic certifications from recognized veterinary boards. Formulating products with minimal, transparent ingredients and excluding alcohol, parabens, and known irritants can reduce adverse reactions. Marketing products with veterinarian endorsements, breed-specific suitability, and allergy-tested claims helps reassure pet owners. Expanding fragrance-free variants or sensitive skin formulas further attracts cautious consumers while aligning with growing demand for safe grooming options.

In addition, organic pet perfumes, lacking synthetic preservatives, often degrade due to light, temperature, and microbial exposure. This short shelf-life complicates storage and inventory, especially for long supply chains and e-commerce. Consumers experience reduced product performance, such as scent loss or spoilage, which leads to distrust and low repurchase rates. Retailers avoid stocking fragile products, hindering wide distribution and market growth for natural formulations.

To address this restraint, brands can extend shelf-life by using natural preservatives like potassium sorbate, grapefruit seed extract, or fermented radish root filtrate that comply with organic standards. Airless pump packaging, amber glass bottles, and cold-chain logistics improve stability during storage and shipping. Educating retailers and consumers

[TITLE]Why I'm canceling my $895-a-year Amex Business Platinum after a decade of loyalty:
[TEXT]
Terms apply to American Express benefits and offers. Visit americanexpress.com to learn more. I've held The Business Platinum Card® from American Express for nearly ten years. I’ve kept it in my wallet through multiple refreshes, fee increases and benefit changes. But when the annual fee jumped from $695 to $895 this fall (see rates and fees), I finally had to admit what I'd been avoiding: This card no longer makes sense for me. As someone who's spent over a decade optimizing credit card rewards, canceling a premium credit card I’ve gotten a ton of value from in the past doesn't come easily. But after doing the math on the new annual fee and honestly evaluating which benefits I actually use, the decision became clear.

The credits have become too restrictive to justify the cost

The Amex Business Platinum now offers over $3,000 in potential annual credits, with the key word being "potential." In reality, most of these credits don't align with how I actually spend money. Take the new $600 annual hotel credit, which sounds generous, but only works on prepaid stays booked through Fine Hotels & Resorts or The Hotel Collection via American Express Travel. The Hotel Collection requires a minimum two-night stay, and the rates are often higher than booking directly or using other travel portals. Additionally, as someone who values hotel elite status and the flexibility to modify reservations, I find prepaid bookings through Amex Travel unappealing. The Dell credit is similarly frustrating. Sure, you can get up to $1,150 annually in statement credits, but only if you spend at least $5,000 on Dell purchases. My business doesn't need $5,000 worth of Dell products every year. When I do need electronics, I don’t like having to limit myself to one vendor just to maximize a credit.

Credit card fatigue is real

If there were a DSM-5 for travel rewards enthusiasts, “benefit exhaustion” would be a diagnosis. Between activating quarterly rotating categories, enrolling in semi-annual credits, selecting preferred airlines and tracking bonus spending thresholds, managing certain rewards credit cards can be a part-time job. The Amex Business Platinum now offers credits that reset either semi-annually or annually, with some requiring a spending threshold to unlock. And many require enrollment to activate. I’ve concluded that, for an $895 annual fee (see rates and fees), I shouldn't need to work this hard to break even. The mental overhead of optimizing these benefits has started to outweigh the value I'm getting from them. Additionally, like many small business owners, I am in a growth phase. Every hour I spend optimizing credit card benefits is an hour I'm not spending on revenue-generating activities. The return on investing those hours into my business is exponentially higher than squeezing out an extra few hundred dollars in statement credits.

The earning rate doesn't match my business spending

Despite all the recent changes, the Business Platinum still earns just 1X points on most purchases. Yes, they bumped certain categories to 2X points, but only on purchases of $5,000 or more and purchases in select categories. My business doesn't make many $5,000+ purchases, and most of my business spending is on contractor payments and general operating expenses. On all of that, I'm earning just 1X points while paying an $895 annual fee (see rates and fees). I can get 2X points or 2% cash back on everything with rewards cards like the Capital One Spark Cash Plus ($150 annual fee) or the Wells Fargo Signify Business Cash Card (no annual fee). That's a better return for how my business actually operates.

The annual fee increase was the final straw

When I first got the Amex Business Platinum card, the fee was $450. Then it went to $595. Then $695. Now $895 (see rates and fees). That's a nearly 99% increase in a span of six years. I understand inflation and added benefits, but at some point, the value proposition breaks down. And for me, paying nearly $900 annually for a card that requires this much effort to optimize just doesn't make sense anymore.

[TITLE]These Utahns could see skyrocketing premiums if Obamacare tax credits expire:
[TEXT]
CEDAR HILLS, Utah County — Brick Williams can be found criss-crossing northern Utah County to teach guitar, sometimes working until well after dark most nights of the week.

He caters primarily to students, so his day often starts when school lets out. With an average of 55 to 60 students at any time, that means he typically teaches "until around 10 o'clock every night."

"It's definitely a full-time job and keeps me busy, but I enjoy it. I really like the job," he said, even if he admits "the hours of it are kind of rough."

The 48-year-old Cedar Hills resident has been teaching guitar for 24 years, since graduating with a degree in music theory from what is now Utah Valley University. He is the founder and sole employee at Brick Williams Guitar, Inc., where he also teaches bass guitar and ukulele.

Though he doesn't advertise much and relies on word of mouth, he has built a solid "middle-class" lifestyle for his family. His wife, Lisa, works part-time and takes care of their three daughters, the oldest of whom just turned 16.

Starting a small business is no small task for anyone, and Williams initially struggled to meet the high costs of health insurance premiums. Many Americans receive health insurance benefits from their employers, but as a self-employed individual, Williams was on the hook.

And his costs were far from typical.

At 19, he was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID, an immune disorder where low antibody levels lead to frequent infections. It's not uncommon for people to be diagnosed in their early adult years, but Williams recalled being "so unbelievably sick as a child and teenager" with illnesses that were likely the result of the disorder.

Williams has relied on twice-monthly infusions of blood plasma to bolster his immune system, but the treatments are costly, and the disorder initially made it difficult to stay on insurance because it qualified as a pre-existing condition.

The plasma infusions aren't optional for Williams, who said: "If I didn't get these treatments, I would likely not live very long or be horribly sick."

"We were renting, and it would be close to the cost of rent, a month just for me to have insurance," he recalled, "so, it was devastating to us financially."

Brick Williams poses for a portrait at his home in Cedar Hills on Oct. 10. (Photo: Isaac Hale, Deseret News)

That changed in 2010 with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or Obamacare, which allowed self-employed people like Williams to purchase health care insurance through the state-administered marketplace and prevented providers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.

The Affordable Care Act also provided federal subsidies to help Americans making up to 400% of the poverty level cover portions of their insurance premiums. Democrats in the Biden era eliminated the 400% income cap, meaning Americans with higher incomes could still receive some subsidies based on their annual income.

For Williams, that has meant not having to worry

[TITLE]Federal workers furloughed during shutdown face delays getting unemployment pay:
[TEXT]
For more than two weeks now during the government shutdown, Imelda Avila-Thomas has been trying in vain to get approved for unemployment compensation to help cover essentials such as food and mortgage payments for her family while she’s on unpaid furlough from her federal government job.

She kept asking questions and was ultimately sent a hyperlink to upload proof-of-income documents, which she did earlier this week. But Avila-Thomas, who works for the Department of Labor in San Antonio, said the system still deems her ineligible for benefits, saying it cannot verify her wages. She wonders whether someone who might help her has also been furloughed.

WATCH: As federal workers miss paychecks during shutdown, many turn to food banks for relief

A mother of a 12-year-old daughter and local union leader, Avila-Thomas is among the thousands of furloughed federal workers trying to navigate the unemployment system — a sharp increase, but still a fraction of the 670,000-plus furloughed workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The dollar amounts and length of benefits vary by state.

[TITLE]Puma warns of lower 2025 sales and swings to quarterly loss:
[TEXT]
Puma recorded a net loss of €62.3m versus net income of €127.8m in Q3 2024. Credit: darksoul72/Shutterstock.com.

Puma expects a low double-digit percentage decline in full-year 2025 sales on a currency-adjusted basis, alongside a reported loss in earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT), with capital expenditure planned at around €250m.

In the third quarter (Q3) of 2025, sales fell 10.4% on a currency-adjusted basis to €1.95bn. Currency movements, notably those of the US dollar and the Argentine peso, reduced revenue by €125m, pushing reported sales down 15.3%.

The German sportswear brand’s wholesale revenue dropped 15.4% to €1.38bn. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales rose 4.5% to €570m, driven by a 5.6% increase in e-commerce.

Sales in owned and operated stores were up 3.9%. The DTC share increased to 29.1% from 25.1% in Q3 2024.

In Q3 2025, Puma implemented measures to strengthen its base for 2026 and beyond, cutting lower-quality wholesale business, reducing excess inventory at retail partners, and scaling back promotions in e-commerce and full-price DTC stores.

The reset drove a broad sales decline across all regions. In the Americas, revenue fell 15.2% to €678.1m, with a modest dip in Latin America and the bulk of the decrease stemming from North America.

[TITLE]Canada Goose Unveils Paris Flagship as the First of Its ‘2.0’ Luxury Retail Concept:
[TEXT]
PARIS — Canada Goose is ready to soar.

The outerwear brand has unveiled its ambitious retail concept with the opening of its flagship on Avenue des Champs-Élysées, marking the kickoff of its reboot as “Canada Goose 2.0.”

The location, which officially opened Thursday, lays out a global design concept to redefine its retail stores as upscaled and immersive. The opening also sets the groundwork for a renewed push into Europe, a region chief executive officer Dani Reiss frames as both its historic base and a key growth territory.

Despite the Canadian name, “Europe is where it started for us,” Reiss told WWD, with Italy and Scandinavia early territories for its parkas.

[TITLE]The Rise of the Artisan Economy:
[TEXT]
Developer Shaheen Sadeghi’s vision of an artisanal, small-business-driven economy seems oddly incompatible with his environment. After all, Orange County, Calif., where the 71-year-old Sadeghi has worked for four decades, bristles with mass-produced fabrication. Home to several of the nation’s most successful malls and endless shopping centers, the region has incubated such firms as McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, Cheesecake Factory, Marie Callender’s, Taco Bell, and the epicenter of faux American conformism, Disneyland.

Yet walking around his expanding development, called the Camp, it’s clear Sadeghi has made his vision real. Located on four acres in Costa Mesa — just one mile from the South Coast Plaza — one of the most successful mega-malls in the country — is a collection filled with dozens of independent, small businesses including oddball boutiques, diverse independent restaurants, and even a bar — Cowboy and Poodles — that celebrates southern California’s cowboy heritage, with Western images and artifacts matched with kitschy images of well-groomed dogs.

“Most of retail may be dying,” Sadeghi notes, “the next generation of customers won’t go to the big stores but are seeking out a direct human experience.” Moreover: “The traditional middleman role is obsolete. People may go online to buy necessities but when they go out to shop, they want something real, something that offers the possibility of serendipity.”

Sadeghi, who grew up in Michigan, is the child of Muslim Iranian immigrants. He graduated from Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute and worked in the surf-wear industry — eventually running Huntington Beach–based Quiksilver — for a decade until he came up with his concept of “the anti-mall” in 1993. His LAB company, which stands for “Little American Business,” has some 40 projects spread across the county. For many young residents, including my daughters, the Camp and Anaheim’s Packing House (both LAB developments) replaced the conventional mall as their preferred place to hang.

Sadeghi says he believes that his developments tap an unmet demand for personal, unique experiences and, most of all, human interaction. “The rise of artificial intelligence and virtual reality, a world of robots, suggests we don’t need to interface with people,” he says over lunch at Aba, a crowded and popular Israeli restaurant at the Camp. “But people need more than that. They want that personal experience, the unexpected. Providing that is what excites me.”

The notion of an artisan economy may seem odd in an age dominated by online sales and artificial intelligence. Yet, as Sadeghi points out, this is the opportunity. As we buy routine, depersonalized products online or at a mega retailers such as Target or Costco, there remains a desire for something more human. We seek to connect more closely to the farmer, the maker of products, and to products sourced close to the community.

This counterfactual development can be seen in such things as the rapid growth of flea markets, farmers’ markets, and that ultimate symbol of grassroots free markets, garage sales. The 2000s and 2010s saw the growth of the “buy local” movement and the rapid expansion of farmers’ markets in the U.S. — from fewer than 1,800 in the mid-1990s to more than 8,770 by 2019. Flea markets have also proliferated around the world, growing at 4.5 percent a year. By 2033, U.S. flea market sales are expected to grow from $12.5 billion to almost $17.5 billion. Similar growth is projected in Latin America, Europe, and Asia.

The shift is reflected as well in surging yard sales. A July survey by Morning Consult found that

[TITLE]Online Event Ticketing Market Trends, Shares & Demand Forecast 2025-2033: Global Revenues to Exceed $100 Billion by 2033 - Investments and Digital Integration Promise Robust Market Growth:
[TEXT]
Dublin, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Online Event Ticketing Market Trends, Share & Forecast 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Online Event Ticketing Market is expected to reach US$ 101.44 billion by 2033 from US$ 60.5 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 5.91% from 2025 to 2033. The growing use of the internet and the growing acceptance of mobile applications for online movie, sports, and live performance ticketing are anticipated to have an impact on the industry. In Asia Pacific, where consumers are ready to pay extra for online handling in order to escape the hassle of standing in lengthy lines, this trend is especially noteworthy.

Key Factors Driving the Online Event Ticketing Market Growth

An increase in musical events: The online event ticketing business, which includes lucrative sales for all music-related events, including concerts, festivals, musicals, music shows, and operas, is dominated by the music events segment. Ticketmaster, a well-known online ticketing company, claims that music has contributed to over 80% of the recent development in GTV. Because of the growth of aspiring artists, music talent shows, and music streaming services for performers, concerts are the main source of income for online ticket sellers. As ticket prices increase, so does the cost of going to a performance. Despite the frequent use of fake and duplicate tickets and the continuous price increase, customers are still paying more, as seen by the growing user base.
