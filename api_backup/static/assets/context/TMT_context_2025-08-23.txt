[TITLE]Rubicon Technology, Inc. to acquire Janel Group LLC:
[TEXT]
BENSENVILLE, Ill. and NEW YORK, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rubicon Technology, Inc. (OTCQB:RBCN) (“Rubicon”) and Janel Corporation (OTCQX:JANL) (“Janel Corp”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which Rubicon will acquire Janel Group LLC (“Janel Group”) with Janel Group becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Rubicon and Janel Corp receiving shares of Rubicon common stock.

Janel Group, based in Garden City, New York, and originally founded in 1974, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Janel Corp. Janel Group had revenues of approximately $181.3 million and operating income of approximately $8.7 million for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2025. The company is a non-asset based, full-service provider of cargo transportation logistics management services. Its management team will remain in place as part of Rubicon.

The transaction allows Rubicon to acquire a profitable business and better access to capital. Janel Corp shareholders will benefit from its ownership of Rubicon.

The transaction, which was approved by the Rubicon board, including its independent directors, is subject to approval by the majority of Rubicon’s disinterested stockholders.

Additional Transaction Details

Janel Corp will sell all of the issued and outstanding equity of Janel Group to Rubicon in exchange for 7,000,000 shares of Rubicon common stock, at a value of $4.75 per share. Rubicon will assume approximately $23 million of Janel Group indebtedness and net working capital liabilities and gain access to a total of $35 million in borrowing capacity as part of a revolving credit facility under Janel Corp’s existing credit line.

Prior to this transaction, Janel Corp owned 1,108,000 shares of Rubicon common stock, representing approximately 46.6 percent of all outstanding Rubicon common stock. Following this transaction, Janel Corp will own approximately 86.5 percent of Rubicon’s common stock. Janel Corp and Rubicon will maintain the existing governance, nomination and voting agreement requiring review and approval by Rubicon’s independent directors of related party transactions between Rubicon and Janel Corp, and any of its affiliates, until such time that Janel Corp and/or its affiliates acquire more than 90 percent of Rubicon’s outstanding stock.

In order to protect Rubicon’s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards, Rubicon had previously adopted a stockholder rights plan to limit the ability of any group or person to acquire 5% or more of Rubicon’s common stock (subject to certain exceptions, including acquisitions approved by its board) by any group or person. The board of Rubicon has determined that the transaction will not impair the Rubicon’s net loss carryforwards.

Rubicon shares will continue to be traded on the OTC market.

Janel Corp Tender Offer of Rubicon Common Stock

Contingent upon a successful Rubicon stockholder vote and consummation of the transaction, Janel Corp expects to make a tender offer for an additional 400,000 shares of Rubicon stock at $4.75 per share in cash upon which Janel Corp would own approximately 90.7% of Rubicon’s common stock outstanding.

The tender offer described in this announcement has not yet commenced. This announcement is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell Rubicon’s common stock. If Rubicon stockholders approve the transaction, Janel will distribute an Offer to Purchase relating to the tender offer following the consummation of the transaction, and any Rubicon stockholder who would like to participate in the tender offer should review the terms of the tender offer set forth in such Offer to Purchase when it becomes available.

[TITLE]Trump administration is not eyeing equity in TSMC, Micron, official says:
[TEXT]
By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration is considering taking equity stakes in companies getting funds from the 2022 CHIPS Act but has no similar plans for bigger firms boosting U.S. investments, such as TSMC and Micron, a White House official told Reuters.

The official confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that the administration does not intend to seek equity stakes in semiconductor companies, such as Micron and TSMC, that plan to step up investment.

On Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government continued to work on the possibility of taking a 10% stake in troubled chipmaker Intel and suggested it would seek further stakes in other grant recipients.

"If we're going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action for the American taxpayer," Lutnick told CNBC.

While the Biden administration had been giving "money for free" to companies such as Intel and TSMC, he added, "Donald Trump turned it into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money.'"

At a March event with President Donald Trump at the White House, TSMC, which has Nvidia and Apple as key clients, announced plans for the new $100-billion U.S. investment, in addition to $65 billion committed for three manufacturing facilities in the state of Arizona.

Micron boosted its U.s. investment plans in June.

TSMC executives have already had discussions about returning their subsidies if the administration asks to become a shareholder, the Wall Street Journal said.

The White House and TSMC declined to comment. Micron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees the $52.7- billion CHIPS and Science Act, finalized subsidies of $6.6 billion late last year for TSMC to produce semiconductors in the United States.

The commerce department did not immediately comment.

Besides Intel, Micron, TSMC and Samsung were among the biggest recipients of CHIPS Act funding, but almost all of it has yet to be disbursed.

Trump has previously said he wanted to kill the CHIPS Act program.

In the past, the U.S. government has taken stakes in companies during periods of economic uncertainty to provide financial support and restore confidence.

[TITLE]EU-US deal confirms 15% tariff cap on semiconductors, more:
[TEXT]
World War Fee The US and European Union have fleshed out details on their sweeping trade deal, promising billions in AI chip sales, a 15 percent tariff cap on key sectors including autos and semiconductors, and a framework for digital rule-making that could reshape the transatlantic tech industry.

Europe traded autonomy for stability in Trump's new order of tariffs as a permanent weapon, not a bargaining chip. Strategic autonomy slips further out of reach...

The pact, announced on Thursday, confirms that Brussels intends to buy at least $40 billion worth of US AI chips for its computing centers, guaranteeing business for American suppliers and giving the EU the silicon it needs for its AI and cloud ambitions. Both sides also promised to align technology security standards to prevent "leakage to destinations of concern," with Washington pledging easier export approvals once safeguards are in place.

The proposed deal, controversially, puts Europe's $20 trillion market firmly in the frame, with the Commission saying that it "intends to eliminate tariffs on all US industrial goods and to provide preferential market access for a wide range of US seafood and agricultural goods."

The semiconductor terms are especially notable. US President Donald Trump had threatened a 100 percent tariff on EU and other chip imports, raising fears of a trade war that would have battered the industry.

Instead, both sides settled on a 15 percent cap, which still stings but is preferable to doomsday scenarios. The same 15 percent ceiling also covers pharmaceuticals (except generics) and lumber. Trump had earlier threatened tariffs of up to 250 percent on pharma to push drugmakers back to the US.

The US will cut its 27.5 percent tariff on EU automobiles and parts to 15 percent once Brussels tables the required tariff-cut legislation, but still far above the pre-Trump norm of 2.5 percent. ACEA, the European carmakers' association, called it a step forward but called for momentum to keep pushing tariffs lower.

Who pays for the new tariffs? Is it European or American companies? In its In its FAQ on Thursday's announcement, the EU was keen to ensure it was understood that "tariffs are paid by the company importing the imported goods. So, for tariffs imposed by the US, it is the American importer who pays. For example, if a European company exports shoes to the US, the US company buying these shoes owe the tariffs to the US government. In many cases, the importing company will push to offset some of this cost either by asking for a discount from the supplier or by raising the price for end consumers. In the end, it is usually the consumers (in this case, US consumers) who will indirectly pay for the tariffs."

Beyond tariffs, the EU intends to procure $750 billion of US energy products through 2028, while European companies are expected to invest $600 billion in American strategic sectors. Military procurement is part of the package, too, though details remain scarce.

Digital trade also gets a reprieve. The EU said it would not impose network usage fees, and both parties agreed to maintain zero tariffs on electronic transmissions, an essential safeguard for cloud platforms, e-commerce, and cross-border software services.

While the joint statement avoided naming it, Brussels' Digital Services Act remains the elephant in the room. The sweeping law forces US platforms to play by European rules on content moderation and transparency, and officials in Brussels are expected to use it as leverage in future regulatory discussions even if it isn't written into the trade pact.

In an FAQ published alongside the announcement, the European Commission said the pact "compares well to results obtained by other US trading partners."

"The deal safeguards the competitiveness of EU exports into the US in a situation where the US has increased tariffs on all its imports," it added. "EU exports will continue to be in a strong position on the US market in comparison to other US trading partners."

[TITLE]U.S., EU Finalize Trade Deal for $750B Energy Pledge, 15% Tariff Cap:
[TEXT]
The United States and the European Union have finalized a trade framework that commits Europe to up to $750 billion in U.S. energy purchases by 2028, while capping most tariffs at 15%. The arrangement elevates American LNG, oil, and refined fuels within Europe’s diversified supply mix, according to Bloomberg.

EU negotiators agreed to facilitate long?term contracts with U.S. exporters so utilities and traders can secure volumes under national procurement rules. In exchange, Washington will grant tariff?free access for a broad slate of industrial goods, including machinery, chemicals, and energy?related equipment. Agricultural categories such as dairy, pork, and tree nuts also gained duty?free treatment, reported the Financial Express.

For Europe’s energy buyers, the commitment is designed to reduce exposure to Russian pipeline flows following the Nord Stream outages and to provide confidence for multi?year LNG contracting. The agreement also grants relief to pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, while automobiles now fall under the 15% ceiling instead of higher duties threatened earlier this year, according to Reuters.

Key areas remain unresolved. Tariffs on metals and wine were excluded from the framework, leaving exporters uncertain about future rates. Officials in Brussels said talks on steel and aluminum will continue alongside implementation, with wine addressed under a separate track. Negotiators plan to revisit these categories before year?end once technical schedules are prepared, reported AP.

The framework now advances to the legislative phase in Washington and Brussels, where legal text must be finalized for ratification. Until then, the energy purchase commitment and tariff ceiling form the operative elements guiding planning for utilities, refiners, traders, and industrial shippers, while sector?specific negotiations proceed on a parallel timetable.

Officials said volumes could be anchored by multi-year contracts linked to new LNG regasification capacity at Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel in Germany, with additional slots at the Eemshaven terminal in the Netherlands. These facilities, built after the Nord Stream shutdowns, allow utilities to commit to U.S. cargoes on a long-term basis while aligning deliveries with hedging cycles and seasonal storage requirements.

[TITLE]AI boom in Australia: Amazon investment sparks debate on artificial intelligence and housing shortage – Jason Murphy:
[TEXT]
But what do we actually get for the money? Just data centres.

If I was making a list of things Australia should be doing with concrete and air-conditioning, it would not include making data centres. What we need desperately, what we are horribly short of, is homes.

House prices are zooming up, and not just from speculation.

We’ve had huge inflation in the cost of building. Building a house from scratch costs around A$500,000, depending on its size and location. Maybe as much as a million bucks. And the inflation data tell us that price is up 39% compared with 2020.

Even renovation costs a bomb. Chucking a renovation on a small old home is now an A$500,000+ activity.

Jeff Bezos' Amazon wants to build data centres in Australia. Photo / Getty Images

Why is building houses expensive? For a lot of reasons.

One is the tradie shortage. Prices for getting the plumbing and wiring and framework of a house all put in are up sharply. Concrete slabs cost a fortune now.

Australia needs new homes. Photo / Getty Images

When it comes to these data centres, Amazon is supplying the capital, the money, which is nice. But money is not something Australia is super short of.

We have trillions in the national superannuation fund that’s just plonked in the sharemarket. (In fact, we have more super funds than the whole sharemarket is worth, so we now have to invest in other countries’ sharemarkets too.)

What we are short of is skilled people. Unemployment is at a historically low 4.3% right now. Unemployment among trades workers (people whose last job was in the trades) is
