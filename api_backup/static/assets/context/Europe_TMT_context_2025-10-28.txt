[TITLE]Stablecoin Transfers Coming Soon to Western Union?:
[TEXT]
Western Union is accelerating its push into digital assets as it seeks to modernize its global remittance operations.

During the company’s Q3 earnings call, CEO Devin McGranahan announced that Western Union has begun piloting stablecoin-based settlement systems. The initiative aims to streamline international money transfers and improve liquidity management.

Western Union Tests Stablecoin Settlements After US Rule Change

According to him, Western Union previously maintained a cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies, citing volatility, unclear regulations, and customer protection risks.

However, that approach is shifting due to the improved regulatory environment in the United States.

McGranahan said the recent passage of the GENIUS Act has clarified federal rules for stablecoin issuance and usage. This new framework gives traditional payment companies more confidence to adopt blockchain-based solutions.

As a result, Western Union has started testing stablecoin-enabled tools within its treasury operations. These pilots use blockchain settlement rails to reduce dependence on correspondent banks, speed up cross-border settlements, and enhance capital efficiency.

“We are exploring how our global payments network can serve as an on-ramp and an off-ramp between fiat and digital currencies,” he added.

Beyond that, the remittance giant is expanding partnerships with digital-native firms. These companies aim to leverage Western Union’s infrastructure in regions where banking access remains limited but crypto adoption is growing.

“This is not about speculation. It is about giving our customers more choice and control in how they manage and move their money,” McGranahan remarked.

Meanwhile, the company’s digital transformation goes beyond stablecoin pilots.

Western Union is overhauling its technology stack and investing in global digital payment rails. It is also expanding its digital wallet offerings across Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, where remittance demand is high and blockchain adoption is accelerating.

Western Union’s renewed interest in stablecoins comes as competitors embrace similar tools. MoneyGram already supports USDC payments, and Remitly recently launched a multi-currency wallet that supports both fiat and digital tokens.

These developments highlight a broader trend where stablecoins are becoming critical to lowering cross-border transfer costs and improving liquidity for global payment providers.

Stablecoins can reduce remittance costs by up to 95% and cut global average fees from around 6.6% to under 3%. This has resulted in a sharp rise in crypto-based payments, which have surged 70% this year to more than $10 billion.

[TITLE]Shale Giants Slash Thousands of Jobs as Lower Prices Bite:
[TEXT]
U.S. oil and gas producers seek efficiencies and cost reductions amid lower oil prices this year compared to 2024 levels.

Fresh off multi-billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions in the 2023-2024 period, many major producers in the U.S. shale patch are restructuring businesses and operations.

The result so far has been a series of announcements and reports of workforce reductions across geographies and basins.

The latest such report came this week, by Reuters, which reported a memo it had seen regarding layoffs at the Canadian business of U.S. oil and gas giant ConocoPhillips.

The U.S. firm, one of the world’s largest independent exploration and production companies based on production and proven reserves, has its Canadian headquarters in Calgary, Alberta.

ConocoPhillips Canada develops the Surmont oil sands project in the Athabasca region of northeastern Alberta and opportunities in the unconventional liquids-rich Montney play in northeastern British Columbia.

According to the memo on workforce reductions, ConocoPhillips’ employees in Calgary will be notified virtually on November 5, and those in Surmont and Montney will be told in person on the following day, sources told Reuters.

[TITLE]Earbuds are getting smarter, but only Apple seems to understand how:
[TEXT]
Apple ’s new sleep feature for AirPods, live now in iOS 26 , isn't just a minor update. It’s a major signal that the definition of a "smart" earbud is fundamentally changing, and competitors are getting left behind in a big way.

What's new with AirPods in iOS 26?

For the last few years, the premium earbud war has been fought on a very predictable battlefield: Who has the best active noise cancellation (ANC)? Who has the punchiest, most accurate sound? And whose battery can last the longest? It’s been a technical race of specs, with each new model offering just a little more of the same.

But now, Apple has decided to stop playing that game and quietly shift the goalposts for the entire "hearables" category. With the release of iOS 26 , a new feature for AirPods has gone live that pushes them from a simple listening accessory into the realm of a true contextual computer. As detailed in

It’s been a technical race of specs, with each new model offering just a little more of the same.But now, Apple has decided to stop playing that game and quietly shift the goalposts for the entire "hearables" category. With the release of, a new feature for AirPods has gone live that pushes them from a simple listening accessory into the realm of a true contextual computer. As detailed in our recent post , this isn't just a new toggle in a menu; it's a new level of intelligence.In short, your AirPods can now use their internal sensors, cross-reference data with your Apple Watch, and analyze your movement (or lack thereof) to genuinely understand when you've fallen asleep. This isn't just a party trick.

The moment you're asleep, the AirPods can intelligently adjust their behavior—silencing all but the most critical, user-defined emergency notifications, for example, or managing volume levels if you've fallen asleep to a podcast. This is a massive leap from the manual controls we're used to. It's your earbuds actively monitoring your personal state and adapting their function to match.

Why this "smart" gap is a very big deal

This is where the landscape gets rocky for the competition. Let's be crystal clear: Samsung's

Take Samsung. The Galaxy Buds are packed with features, but they all require you to do something. You tap to switch modes. You open the Galaxy Wearable app to use advanced features. You have to tell them what's going on. Yes, they have "Detect Conversations," which pauses ANC when you start talking, but that's a simple audio-based reaction. It's a far cry from understanding a complex, passive state like sleep.

Recommended Stories This is where the landscape gets rocky for the competition. Let's be crystal clear: Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 Pro and Google's Pixel Buds Pro are, by all accounts, fantastic pieces of hardware. They sound amazing, their ANC is incredibly effective, and their integration with their respective Android ecosystems is tighter than ever. But this new Apple feature exposes their core limitation: they are almost entirely reactive.Take Samsung. The Galaxy Buds are packed with features, but they all require you to do something.

Yes, they have "Detect Conversations," which pauses ANC when you start talking, but that's a simple audio-based reaction. It's a far cry from understanding a complex, passive state like sleep.Then there's Google, and this, to me, is the most baffling part of the whole situation. Google is, by its own definition, an "AI-first" company. Its Pixel Buds Pro are great, but their "smart" features feel almost superficial by comparison.

Adaptive Sound, which adjusts volume based on environmental noise, is a simple, reactive tweak. Live translation is powerful, but it's a tool you have to manually activate. Google has all the AI smarts in the world, yet its earbuds have no deep, personal context. They don't know if you're on a run, in a meeting, or falling asleep. This should be Google's home turf, and they're not even on the field.

This new AirPods feature highlights a growing gap in innovation. While everyone else is busy perfecting the hardware specs, Apple is building a platform for ambient, personal computing. It’s also a brilliant, frictionless health play.

By making sleep data collection more seamless and less obtrusive (no bulky watch required, if you're not a fan), Apple is lowering the barrier for millions of users to get real, actionable insights into their personal wellness.

Do you sometimes fall asleep with earbuds in? Yes, all the time. Yes, sometimes. No, I don’t wear earbuds to bed. Yes, all the time. 7.14% Yes, sometimes. 11.9% No, I don’t wear earbuds to bed. 80.95%

The earbud race just got real (and a lot more interesting)

I'll be blunt: the hearables space has been pretty boring for a couple of years. It’s just been a tit-for-tat spec race that's resulted in many great, but also very similar, products.

As someone who bounces between all the major earbuds, my frustration has never been with sound quality or ANC. It's been with the small, human moments. It's the hassle of fumbling with my phone to silence a podcast when I'm half-asleep. It's being jolted awake by a "new email" notification chime that a simple "Do Not Disturb" schedule missed. These are the small annoyances that reveal a device isn't truly smart; it's just a well-programmed accessory.

Apple's new feature aims to solve this. It's the kind of "it just works" magic that the company built its entire reputation on, and it's a direct challenge to Google and Samsung. The question is no longer "How good is your ANC?" The question is, "How smart is your software?" The next battleground isn't decibels; it's data, context, and anticipation.

Would I use this? Absolutely. I already do with iOS 26, because it’s a genuine quality-of-life improvement. It makes the technology disappear and just serve the user, which is the entire point. Google and Samsung, it's your move.

Safepay ransomware group claims the hack of professional video surveillance provider Xortec

Pierluigi Paganini October 26, 2025 October 26, 2025

Safepay group claims the hack of professional video surveillance provider Xortec and added the company to its data leak site.

The Safepay group claimed responsibility for hacking German video surveillance provider Xortec and listed the company on its data leak site. The ransomware payment deadline is October 27, 2025.

Xortec GmbH, based in Frankfurt with offices across Germany, is a value-added distributor and systems integrator specializing in video surveillance, IP networking, and security solutions. It provides cameras, NVRs, access control, cabling, and consulting for enterprise and installer clients. Acquired by Beyond Capital Partners in 2021, Xortec is a fast-growing B2B firm with several dozen employees and an annual revenue of over €7.5 million, driven by large installation projects.

Their customers are primarily B2B: system integrators, specialist installers, system houses, and resellers operating globally, especially in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and broader international markets. Xortec’s offerings underpin security infrastructure for various sectors, including retail, logistics, public and private infrastructure, and critical facilities, given their core focus on video surveillance and communications solutions.

The hack of a company like Xortec could have wide-reaching effects due to its role in the security supply chain. Attackers could backdoor hardware or software used by installers, exposing client data, surveillance layouts, and shipment records. Compromised firmware could undermine trust in thousands of deployed systems. Disruption of Xortec’s logistics could affect resellers and end users, including critical sectors like transport or utilities—making the breach a systemic, multi-tier risk beyond a single company.

A hack of Xortec could have wide-reaching effects due to its role in the security supply chain. Attackers could backdoor hardware or software used by installers, exposing client data, surveillance layouts, and shipment records. Hacked or altered firmware could damage trust in thousands of security systems already in use. If Xortec’s logistics are disrupted, it could impact resellers, customers, and even critical sectors like transport or utilities, turning the breach into a widespread problem that affects far more than just one company.

SafePay is a fast-growing ransomware group that has been active since late 2024. It runs independently, using double extortion, stealing and encrypting data. The group targets global sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, and government. The cybercrime group operates rapidly within 24 hours of access, and avoids Russian systems, suggesting a possible Eastern-European origin.

[TITLE]Nexperia's China parent Wingtech declares cash-flow risk despite massive 280% profit surge - car production shutdowns loom as Dutch state tightens grip:
[TEXT]
Wingtech, the Chinese parent company of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, has warned investors of a potential cash flow squeeze if it fails to regain operational control of its European subsidiary, despite posting a 280% surge in quarterly net profit. The company's woes and supply disruptions have multiple car makers worldwide preparing for shutdowns as the supply of critical semiconductors for automobiles dwindle.

The alert came via an earnings filing on Friday, in which Wingtech said that Nexperia “may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit, and cash flow,” related to governance issues. This is based on a machine translation of the company’s earnings report.

The statement appears to reference the Dutch government’s recent move to tighten oversight of the company, which is one of the largest producers of commodity parts such as diodes, MOSFETs, and small-signal logic used in applications like voltage regulation modules and ESD protection. If geopolitical challenges begin to impair the company’s ability to execute on orders or invest in expansion, impacts could creep in through extended lead times and upstream pricing pressure.

While Wingtech’s earnings release did not name the Dutch government explicitly, the context is obvious. In September, the Hague invoked new foreign investment screening powers to place Nexperia under direct oversight, citing national security concerns. The decision effectively allows the Dutch state to veto or revise key choices made by Nexperia’s board. That marks the second major intervention into the company’s operations, following the UK government’s forced divestment of Newport Wafer Fab in 2024.

According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the tension has already led to halted salaries for some Nexperia staff in China and internal access issues — signs that the governance dispute could bleed into day-to-day operations if left unresolved.

This, unfortunately, raises a familiar but still uncomfortable prospect of uncertainty for PC and parts makers. But this time, the uncertainty could reach the most fundamental tiers of the supply stack. Nexperia’s tech might not attract headlines like Nvidia’s high-end GPUs, but it’s no less important in a world that scrapes by on just-in-time manufacturing.

If Wingtech can’t regain control of its European asset, or if state oversight results in slow-walked decision-making, there’s a serious risk of a logistical nightmare that could start causing problems downstream very soon.

Dutch say takeover of chipmaker Nexperia 'not against China'

by AFP Staff Writers

Brussels, Belgium (AFP) Oct 23, 2025

The Netherlands' seizure of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia was not a "measure against China", Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said Thursday as trade tensions spike between Europe and Beijing.

Dutch officials invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to effectively take control of Nexperia, citing national security concerns, as chip manufacturing increasingly becomes a focus of geopolitical tensions.

The company says Beijing has, in turn, banned it from exporting certain goods from China since October 4.

[TITLE]Nexperia China snubs Dutch HQ amid spat that threatens automotive production — says order to dismiss executive violates labor laws:
[TEXT]
Nexperia’s China unit has openly rejected an order from its Dutch headquarters in Nijmegen, dismissing John Chang as its vice-president of global sales and marketing. According to the South China Morning Post, such a move would have violated local company and labor laws, rendering the directive unenforceable under Chinese labor law, according to the company. This announcement shows how Nexperia China, which is only a subsidiary of the Europe-based company, is vying for control of the chip maker.

The issue began in early October, when the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia from Wingtech, its Chinese owner, citing the Goods Availability Act, which allows it to block attempts to move crucial technical knowledge and capabilities outside of Dutch and European soil. What makes this such an earth-shaking move is that this is the first time that the law has been used since it was enacted in 1952 during the height of the Cold War. Although the primary catalyst behind the takeover was the alleged $200 million misappropriation by the CEO of company assets, the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has certainly added more geopolitical pressure to the drama.

John Chang has been with the company for over two decades now. He started his career at NXP Semiconductors, its former parent company, until he transferred to Nexperia when it was spun off in 2017. Wingtech then acquired Nexperia in 2019, where it stands today. Nexperia hasn’t given any reason for Chang’s ouster as VP, which is probably why the Chinese subsidiary has refused to recognize this order.

Nexperia has fabs all over the globe, including Germany, the U.K., the Philippines, Malaysia, and China; however, China has the largest output among its subsidiaries, accounting for 70% of the company’s global output. This makes it economically powerful, with the subsidiary able to defy orders coming from its headquarters. Global geopolitics has also raised its head, with Beijing getting into the fray by blocking chip exports coming from its Guangdong site.

Even though both parties declare that the business is running as usual, many of its clients are looking for substitutes. It’s expected that only 30% of the company’s output is available to the global market, with the rest seemingly trapped in China until the situation is resolved. In fact, Bloomberg reports that Valeo SE, one of its clients and a major component supplier to Volkswagen, BMW, and Stellantis, has already found substitutes for 95% of the chips that it needs. Earlier this week, it was reported that Nexperia's ongoing shenanigans could have knock-on effects for automotive production in Japan, too.

This isn’t the first time that a European HQ and its Chinese subsidiary have been at loggerheads when it comes to decisions. Back in 2022, Allen Wu, the CEO of Arm’s China subsidiary, announced a plan to have an IPO independent of its parent company, which eventually resulted in his replacement. However, the difference this time is that Wu acted in defiance of his company’s board, whereas the story behind Nexperia isn’t quite as clear yet. Furthermore, there was limited to no government intervention during that episode, but now we have both The Hague and Beijing taking steps to protect their respective interests.

Volkswagen warned workers at its Wolfsburg plant this week that it would suspend production of the Golf from next Wednesday because it was running out of some essential microchips. Made by Nexperia, a Chinese-owned company based in the Netherlands, the chips are not the most advanced but they are responsible for keeping the brakes, lights, switches and wipers working.

The Dutch government took control of Nexperia, using for the first time a law introduced during the 1950s that allows the state to seize companies for national security reasons, removing its Chinese owner as chief executive. They said they were worried

Europe plans satellite powerhouse to rival Musk's Starlink

By Olga NEDBAEVA

Paris (AFP) Oct 23, 2025

Three leading European aerospace groups announced Thursday a plan to merge their satellite operations to create a powerhouse for competing in particular against Elon Musk's Starlink internet system.

The merger, whose financial details were not disclosed, comes as Starlink and Amazon's Project Kuiper are racing to deploy satellite networks to offer broadband internet access in vast regions of the world lacking reliable connectivity.

Airbus, Thales and Italy's Leonardo said they aimed "to strengthen Europe's strategic autonomy in space, a major sector that underpins critical infrastructure and services related to telecommunications, global navigation, earth observation, science, exploration and national security".

It would not include space launchers such as Airbus's Ariane rockets, which, unlike the Falcon launchers of Musk's SpaceX, are not reusable.

Many Falcon flights have carried the more than 8,000 satellites that currently make up Starlink.

In response, the European Union is planning to create its own internet satellite constellation called IRIS2, set to become operational in 2030.

While it would have just 300 satellites, IRIS2 would focus more on "secure communications", European Space Agency director Josef Aschbacher told AFP in an interview this month.

"Europe needs it absolutely urgently," he said.

Thales said separately Thursday that an initial 100-million-euro ($116 million) engineering contract with satellite operators for IRIS2 would allow it to halt planned job cuts in its space operations.

- 'Excellent news' -

Annual revenues for the new European satellite group were estimated at 6.5 billion euros based on current operations, and its order backlog would represent over three years of projected sales.

It will be headquartered in Toulouse, southern France, where each company already has major production and R&D facilities.

If approved by regulators, the new project, called Bromo, would be operational in 2027, with Airbus owning a 35 percent stake while Thales and Leonardo would hold 32.5 percent each.

The companies build, deploy and service a range of telecommunications and navigation satellites that will underpin the rollout of high-speed networks worldwide.

"This partnership aligns with the ambitions of European governments to strengthen their industrial and technological assets, ensuring Europe's autonomy across the strategic space domain and its many applications," the CEOs of each company said in a joint statement.

Finance Minister Roland Lescure of France, which along with Germany and Spain owns minority stakes in Airbus, called the deal "excellent news".

"The creation of a European satellites champion will increase investments in research and innovation in a strategic industry and reinforce our European sovereignty in an area of intense global competition," he said in a statement.
