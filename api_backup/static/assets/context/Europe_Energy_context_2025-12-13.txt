[TITLE]Genesis Energy CEO bets on AI growth but warns of data centre challenge to power grid:
[TEXT]
But the big data centres required by AI are proving a hot potato overseas because of the huge amounts of electricity they consume.

Last month, Ireland’s the Journal reported that the South Dublin County Council had passed a motion calling for a moratorium on new data centres in the area unless they operated wholly from renewable energy sources.

Most of Ireland’s data centres are in Dublin, with at least 30 of them located in the South Dublin County area.

In October, the Financial Times reported that the US power giant NextEra had agreed to reopen a nuclear power station in Iowa that would primarily provide power to Google as the tech firm races to secure clean energy to drive its AI data centres.

Johns puts data centres into three categories.

“The first is just a basic data warehouse, and that’s like putting light bulbs into the electricity system,” he said.

“The second is a data centre with ‘compute’ capacity, and that’s like putting houses onto the electricity system.

“And the third is AI data centres, and that’s like adding towns to the electricity system.

“What we’re seeing is that data centres are becoming sophisticated global networks, where the data moves around the world to the lowest-cost electricity.

“So even though you might have physical data centres in your country, they still have the option of moving the data and compute to some other country, and then you don’t sell any electricity to them.

“There is a risk that data centres actually create an enormous amount more volatility in the electricity system of New Zealand but, equally, they are as essential to the future economy as oxygen is to living on Earth,” he told the Herald.

As New Zealand decarbonised its energy system, there were going to be some “snakes and ladders” along the way.

“We just have to work out how we’re going to accommodate data centres into the New Zealand system.”

He noted that some jurisdictions had capped or banned new data centres because of their potential power drain on the grid, and that some data centre operators were investing in their own generation.

Whichever way people wanted to look at it, electricity would become more important in the future.

“Electrification of transport, electrification of light industrial heat, and data centres are going to be the three big drivers of demand growth.”

Johns has previously raised the alarm

[TITLE]Nigeria's power grid weakens as plant availability drops:
[TEXT]
Nigeria’s power grid slipped further in November as new data from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission revealed a fresh decline in available generation capacity despite improved output from leading hydro and gas plants.

The November 2025 Operational Performance Factsheet, released on Thursday, showed that plant availability dropped to 41 per cent, down from 42 per cent recorded in October, leaving the country with 5,544 megawatts available for dispatch out of a total 13,625MW installed across 28 grid-connected plants.

Although availability weakened, generation strengthened. NERC reported a 10 per cent rise in average hourly generation, from 4,271MWh/h in October to 4,701MWh/h in November, following stronger performance by major hydro stations.

The factsheet also showed that the load factor rose to 85 per cent in November, seven percentage points higher than the 78 per cent recorded in October. This means the grid utilised more of the capacity made available by generation companies compared to the preceding month.

The contrasting trends, lower availability but higher utilisation, reflect the continued pressure on the grid, as operators are forced to stretch limited generation assets to maintain supply.

The report read, “The November 2025 Operational Performance Factsheet breaks down how Nigeria’s grid-connected power plants performed this month. Plant Availability Factor: 41 per cent, showing that an average of 5,544 MW was available for dispatch out of 13,625 MW installed capacity. Average Load Factor: 85 per cent, showing that 4,701 MWh/h of available capacity was utilised.”

Hydropower plants dominated the leaderboard of top contributors in November.

Zungeru operated at 100 per cent availability, generating 412MWh/h. Kainji posted 77 per cent availability and produced 565MWh/h, with a high 97 per cent utilisation.

Jebba maintained 93 per cent availability, generating 444MWh/h. The Ihovbor gas plant also featured prominently, achieving 99 per cent availability and generating 419MWh/h, a performance that improved on its October output.

“Top Energy Producers: Ihovbor, Kainji, Zungeru, and Jebba stood out with strong availability and high utilisation levels,” It added.

Meanwhile, Egbin, the country’s largest thermal plant, operated at 50 per cent availability, down from an estimated 53 per cent in October, but delivered higher output due to a stronger 94 per cent load factor.

Some plants continued to underperform, contributing to the drop in national availability. Olorunsogo II operated at 8 per cent availability, Afam II at 27 per cent, Sapele Steam I at 3 per cent, and Alaoji I recorded zero availability, the same pattern observed in October.

Although these assets maintained relatively high load factors, their low availability continues to depress the grid’s operational capacity. NERC flagged deteriorating grid stability, with voltage and frequency levels falling outside operational limits.

The monthly average lower voltage fell to 296.50kV, significantly below the approved lower limit of 313.50kV and weaker than the average 302kV recorded in October. The upper voltage stayed within approved boundaries at 345.67kV, marginally better than October.

Grid frequency also slipped further outside the permitted band of 49.75Hz – 50.25Hz, ranging between 49.53Hz and 50.62Hz in November, compared to 49.60Hz – 50.55Hz in October.

According to NERC, such deviations heighten the risk of grid disturbances, equipment trips, and partial collapses.

The report comes at a time when the Federal Government is pushing aggressive reforms to stabilise Nigeria’s electricity market under the amended Electricity Act, including decentralised state-led power markets and new liquidity measures for the national grid.

Despite these efforts, November’s fact sheet underscores Nigeria’s long-running dilemma that stronger generation from a handful of plants cannot compensate for deep structural inefficiencies, ageing assets, gas supply bottlenecks and inadequate transmission capacity.

[TITLE]Nigeria's Petrol Imports Drop by N6tn Amid Refining Boom:
[TEXT]
Nigeria’s petrol import bill fell sharply in the first nine months of 2025, dropping by N6.07tn compared with the same period of 2024, according to an analysis of National Bureau of Statistics trade data.

The value of imported motor spirit, ordinary, stood at N5.42tn between January and September 2025, far below the N11.50tn recorded in the corresponding period of 2024. The contraction represents a 52.82 per cent collapse in the country’s petrol import bill, a shift analysts link to improvements in domestic refining output and reduced dependence on offshore supply.

A breakdown of the quarterly data shows that the decline has been consistent since the start of the year. In the first quarter of 2024, Nigeria spent N3.81tn on PMS imports, but this fell to N1.76tn in the first quarter of 2025, indicating a 53.8 per cent decline, or

[TEXT]
MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for peace in Ukraine includes proposals to restore Russian energy flows to Europe, major U.S. investment in Russian rare earths and energy, and tapping frozen Russian sovereign assets, the Wall Street Journal said.

The newspaper said the plans were detailed in appendices to peace proposals handed to European counterparts over recent weeks.

They include a plan for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap $200 billion of frozen Russian sovereign assets for projects in Ukraine, including a major new data center powered by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the paper said.

U.S. companies would invest in Russian strategic sectors such as rare-earth extraction and oil drilling in the Arctic, while Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the world would be restored, it added.

The paper said one unidentified European official compared the proposed U.S.-Russian energy deals to an economic version of the 1945 Yalta conference.

At that meeting, the victors of World War Two, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, divided up their spheres of interest in Europe.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, formed of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

[TITLE]FG unveils 40 electric buses in Nigeria for clean energy:
[TEXT]
The Federal Government on Thursday said it would continue to support initiatives that align with Nigeria’s clean-energy transition, as the Presidential Initiative on Compressed Natural Gas, PiCNG, commissioned 40 electric-powered buses in Abuja.

Speaking at the unveiling, the Minister of State for Gas, Ekperikpe Ekpo, described the rollout as “another bold step in Nigeria’s journey towards cleaner, smarter and more sustainable mobility.”

Ekpo, who was represented by his aide, Abel Igheghe, said the project reflects the government’s wider shift toward cleaner fuels such as compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and the emerging electric-mobility ecosystem.

“This gathering is not just a product showcase; it is a statement of intent,” he said. “We will continue to support initiatives that align with our clean-energy aspirations. Electric vehicles are an important part of the future, and they will create new industries, new jobs and new opportunities for Nigerian innovators.”

Ekpo added that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources would sustain policies to deepen gas utilisation, encourage technology transfer and ensure that clean mobility offers “affordable transport options for ordinary citizens.”

Ekpo, who spoke at the unveiling of PiCNG’s electric-vehicle project and strategic roadmap, said the event was more than a product display, describing it as “a statement of intent” that demonstrates Nigeria’s commitment to adopting innovative technologies and aligning with global advances in clean energy.

He noted that the rollout of the electric buses represents a major milestone in Nigeria’s clean-mobility transition. While commending PiCNG’s leadership, he said the initiative underscores the critical role of private-sector partners in delivering the ambitions of the national energy-transition agenda.

According to him, the government is pursuing a deliberate shift from dependence on traditional fuels to cleaner alternatives such as CNG, LPG, LNG and electric mobility, under President Bola Tinubu’s mandate to move Nigeria “from gas to prosperity.” He said the ministry’s focus remains on promoting gas as a transition fuel capable of powering industries, transportation and households.

Ekpo added that the electric-vehicle revolution goes beyond cutting carbon emissions, explaining that it also presents opportunities to create new industries, jobs, investments and technology-driven enterprises. With the right policies, he said, Nigeria could emerge as a hub for electric-vehicle assembly, battery innovation, charging-infrastructure deployment and local-content development.

He noted, “Today’s gathering is not just a product showcase, it is a statement of intent. It represents Nigeria’s commitment to embracing innovative technologies and aligning our nation with global advancement in clean energy and transportation.

“The unveiling of PICNG electric vehicles project and strategic roadmap is without question a significant milestone in Nigeria’s clean mobility transition. I congratulate PICNG for its pioneering work and commend its leadership for demonstrating that the private sector remains an indispensable partner in delivering the ambition of our national energy transition.”

As part of his vision, we are driving a deliberate shift from reliance on traditional fuels to cleaner alternatives like CNG, LPG, LNG and now electric mobility. Under the brother mandate of transforming Nigeria from gas to prosperity. In the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, our focus has been clear to promote gas as a transition fuel for Nigeria and to expand its role in empowering industries, transportation and household.

The minister assured Nigerians that the EV initiative would not be limited to a ceremony, noting that the newly unveiled buses would be deployed within the week and rolled out across several states to provide cheaper transport.

He added that PiCNG’s intervention would help ensure more affordable mobility during the Christmas festive season.

The minister said, “The EV revolution is not only

[TITLE]FG okays Nigeria’s first gas trading licence to boost liquidity, pricing:
[TEXT]
The Federal Government on Thursday issued Nigeria’s first Gas Trading Licence as part of a sweeping reform aimed at cleaning up opaque pricing practices, deepening market liquidity, and positioning the country as West Africa’s leading gas trading hub.

The licence, approved to JEX Markets Limited by the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, includes approval to operate a Clearing House and Settlement system, a core financial-market infrastructure that guarantees payment and standardises transactions among gas buyers and sellers.

The event, held at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, drew top government officials, regulators, security chiefs, investors, and gas producers, to improve Nigeria’s domestic gas market, which has remained largely underdeveloped, hobbled by opaque pricing systems, high transaction costs, limited contract flexibility, and market illiquidity.

Nigeria sits on over 209 trillion cubic feet of proven gas and an estimated 600 TCF of potential reserves, the largest reserves on the continent.

Yet, despite this endowment, the domestic gas market has suffered pricing opacity, contract breaches, poor liquidity, high transaction costs, and under-investment, constraints repeatedly blamed for erratic gas-to-power supply, stalled industrial projects, and slow progress in energy transition.

The new licensing regime is an attempt to overhaul those structural problems.

Speaking at the ceremony, the Authority Chief Executive of NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, said the licence marked the beginning of a transparent, technology-enabled marketplace where gas will be traded on standardised contracts with real-time reporting.

According to him, the JEX platform will support: transparent price discovery, automated real-time trading, improved market liquidity, reliable clearing and settlement, wider participation by producers, transporters, and industrial off-takers, and enhanced investment confidence.

Ahmed noted that the licence is being implemented in line with Section 159 of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, which mandates the establishment of a regulated gas trading framework for wholesale transactions.

He said, “Today we shall be presenting a Gas Trading License and a Clearing House and Settlement Authorization to JEX Markets Limited in compliance with the provisions of section 159 of the PIA for the trading and settlement of wholesale gas in Nigeria.

“The implementation and full operationalisation of this provision of the PIA will further unlock the extensive opportunity and investment potentials of the gas industry through the improved supply and utilisation of the country’s vast gas resource in our strategic economic sectors of power, industry, and transportation.

“Nigeria holds over 209 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves, the largest in Africa, and an estimated 600 TCF of potential reserves. Yet, despite this wealth, our domestic gas market has remained underdeveloped and constrained by pricing opacity, high transaction costs, limited flexibility, market illiquidity, poor sanctity of gas contracts, restricted access to gas, and low investments in the sector.

“This licence will unlock new opportunities and finally address pricing opacity, transaction bottlenecks, weak contract sanctity, and low investments.”

The Authority Chief Executive said the regulator would “actively deploy its licensing and regulatory instruments to drive participation in gas trading by producers, transporters, aggregators, and large-scale buyers.”

He explained that the goal is to deepen liquidity in the market and ensure that transparent price discovery becomes the foundation of Nigeria’s domestic gas trading ecosystem.

“As the regulator of Nigeria’s midstream and downstream petroleum sector, the Authority recognises that the true test of licensing JEX Markets is not in the ceremony of today, but in the transformation it must deliver tomorrow. To ensure that JEX succeeds as Nigeria’s pioneering gas trading, clearing, and settlement platform, we will provide a firm, transparent, and technology‑enabled regulatory framework under the PIA, giving investors the certainty and confidence required to commit long‑term capital to the gas value chain.

“We will actively deploy our licensing and regulatory instruments to drive participation in gas trading by producers, transporters, aggregators, and large‑scale buyers, ensuring that liquidity is built and that transparent price discovery becomes the foundation of Nigeria’s domestic gas market,” he added.

The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Gas), Ekperikpe Ekpo, said the launch aligned with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda, which identifies natural gas as the backbone of Nigeria’s future energy security, industrialisation, and economic diversification.

According to him, the new framework will trigger three immediate changes in the domestic gas market. First is access, as only “fit-and-proper” players will now be admitted into the trading ecosystem to ensure credibility and protect market integrity.

The second is dependability, with standardised reporting and regulated settlement processes expected to reduce contract failures and strengthen confidence among buyers and sellers.

The third is affordability, as transparent and competitive trading is projected to help drive down gas prices for the power sector, industries, and the transportation market, ultimately improving productivity and easing cost pressures across the economy.

“The Gas Trading Licence introduced today is decisive on this front, paving the way for a new, regulated market where reliable traders will feel safe doing business, where businesses can plan, and where investors can invest, knowing that it will safeguard both their capital and the public interest.

“The licence itself is founded upon sound regulations and guidelines governing technical competence, commercial capability, financial soundness, and responsible operations. Among the responsibilities of the licence holders is the adherence to the various rules on gas measurement, tariffs, pricing, and assignments.

“What does this licence mean for the market? There are three things that happen right away.

“First, access. We make gas sale and procurement agreements more trustworthy for the generation, industry, commercial, and large-scale sectors by only letting trusted counterparties into the trading environment. This is because being open

[TITLE]Green Hydrogen Set for Industrial Commoditization by 2032:
[TEXT]
North America is forecast to be the fastest-growing region, heavily underpinned by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's Section 45V production tax credit, which is now clarifying the path for developers after a period of regulatory uncertainty.

Alkaline electrolysis is expected to be the dominant technology through 2032 due to its lower capital costs and robust supply chain, while wind energy has emerged as the leading renewable source for production.

The global green hydrogen market is projected to grow at a 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), swelling from an estimated $2.79 billion in 2025 to nearly $75 billion by 2032.

The global green hydrogen market is projected to undergo massive expansion over the next decade, swelling from USD 2.79 billion in 2025 to nearly $75 billion by 2032, according to a new report by MarketsAndMarkets This forecast, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 60%, highlights the sector's immense potential even as the industry faces a period of recalibration marked by project delays and stringent policy debates.

While the long-term trajectory points toward rapid scaling, the immediate landscape is defined by a tension between ambitious decarbonization targets and the economic realities of bringing gigawatt-scale projects to final investment decision (FID).

A Market in Transition

The report identifies the primary engines of this growth: binding net-zero commitments, a surge in renewable energy capacity, and intensifying demand for clean mobility solutions.

According to the data, the market is entering a pivotal phase. While 2025 marks a valuation of roughly $2.8 billion, the anticipated leap to $74.81 billion suggests that the sector is expected to mature from pilot projects to industrial commoditization rapidly.

Dominant Technologies and Sources

Despite the buzz surrounding newer technologies, established methods remain the backbone of the industry.

Alkaline electrolysis is expected to dominate the market through 2032. Accounting for 61.2% of the market share by value in 2024, alkaline systems are favored for their lower capital expenditure (CAPEX) and avoidance of precious metals like platinum and iridium, which are required for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzers.

"Alkaline systems have been used in industrial hydrogen production for over two decades, yielding an excellent reliability record and a robust supply chain," the report notes. This maturity makes them the preferred choice for utility-scale projects where reliability and cost-efficiency are paramount.

On the energy supply side, wind energy has emerged as the leading renewable source, accounting for 48.9% of the market value in 2024. The high capacity factors of offshore wind—often exceeding 50%—allow for more continuous electrolyzer operation compared to solar, improving the economics of hydrogen production.

The Mobility vs. Industry Debate

One of the report’s most notable findings is the prominence of the mobility sector, which it identifies as the largest end-use segment with a 57.7% market share in 2024. The analysis points to heavy-duty transport, long-haul freight, and maritime applications as key drivers, where battery-electric solutions often fall short due to range and weight limitations.

However, this finding stands in contrast to recent data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). In its Global Hydrogen Review, the IEA noted that while mobility is a key growth area, the vast majority of current actual demand still stems from traditional industrial applications, such as oil refining and ammonia production. This discrepancy highlights the divide between the sector's current operational reality and the projected demand centers of the future.

North America’s Policy-Driven Boom

Geographically, North America is forecast to be the fastest-growing region, with a CAGR of 69.7%. This surge is heavily underpinned by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), specifically the Section 45V production tax credit, which offers up to $3.00 per kilogram for low-carbon hydrogen.

The region's growth has not been without complications. The industry spent much of 2024 awaiting final guidance from the U.S. Treasury on the "three pillars" of hydrogen production—additionality, temporal matching, and deliverability. With these rules now clarifying the path forward, developers are expected to move faster to capitalize on the $7-8 billion allocated for Regional Hydrogen Hubs.

Sector Recalibration

While the forecast is bullish, the broader industry context suggests a more complex road ahead.

The past 12 months have seen a "reality check" for green hydrogen, with major players like Shell, BP, and Orsted canceling or scaling back high-profile projects due to regulatory uncertainty and higher-than-expected renewable power costs.

Despite these headwinds, the consensus among analysts is that the sector is not stalling, but rather maturing. The focus has shifted from speculative announcements to projects with secured offtake agreements and viable economic models.

As the market pushes toward the 2032 horizon, the successful integration of large-scale wind farms with alkaline electrolysis, supported by clear policy frameworks in North America and Europe, will likely determine if the industry can meet its $75 billion potential.

[TITLE]Russia’s Blackout Warfare Needs a U.S. Counter:
[TEXT]
This campaign is creating a blueprint for how modern great powers will try to cripple one another in future conflicts. Allied countries must therefore treat assisting Ukraine’s grid defense not as charity, but as an investment in their own future electricity security, which underpins so many critical dimensions of modern life. Backroom deals will not end this war, but learning how to better defend Ukraine’s electricity will set the foundation for a durable future peace.

Russia is no longer simply attacking Ukraine’s grid; it is field-testing a strategy of blackout warfare. As it unleashes thousands of drones and hundreds of missiles per month across Ukraine, Moscow now combines strikes on power plants and hard-to-replace high-voltage transformers as well as and destruction of natural gas systems all the way down to the city level. The impacts are stark: families shivering in the dark, schools interrupted, hospitals trying to deliver lifesaving care with generator power and limited water, and industry starving for electrons.

This campaign is creating a blueprint for how modern great powers will try to cripple one another in future conflicts. Allied countries must therefore treat assisting Ukraine’s grid defense not as charity, but as an investment in their own future electricity security, which underpins so many critical dimensions of modern life. Backroom deals will not end this war, but learning how to better defend Ukraine’s electricity will set the foundation for a durable future peace.

Russia’s destruction will not be constrained to Ukraine. A triumphant Moscow would likely apply similar tactics in NATO countries. China is also learning from the Russian experience and is likely to employ blackout warfare against Taiwan, if Beijing chooses to pursue coercive annexation—a course of action that Chinese President Xi Jinping has consistently threatened.

Russian forces carried out at least 25 massive attacks against Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure between September 2022 and September 2024, pushing the system hard. But the attack waves this fall have been different in four fundamental ways.

Firstly, sheer volume is overwhelming Ukrainian air defenders. Data from the Ukrainian Air Force shows that to date, Russia has fired more than 62,000 long-range drones and 9,300 heavy strike missiles at Ukraine. Russia’s production investments and an endless river of Chinese-supplied components enable it to now fire dozens of missiles and as many as 800 drones and decoys in a single night to terrorize Ukrainians.

A dangerous new precision is also threatening key Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Some newer Shahed (also called Geran) one-way strike drones can even strike moving trains. This means that power plants and substations are now much more vulnerable—and that even a few drones leaking through air defenses can cause pinpoint destruction.

Meanwhile, interceptor missile supplies to Ukrainian air defenders are not keeping pace with the volume and evolving tactics of Russian missile forces. Ukraine has many options to intercept drones, but only another missile can stop a ballistic missile plunging toward a power plant or substation at supersonic speeds.

But most of all, Russia’s assault is unrelenting—and offers little chance for Ukraine to rebuild. Russia is truly attacking all of the energy system at high intensity: Most large thermal power plants are destroyed; large substations (including for nuclear plants) are repeatedly targeted; and now, the natural gas system is also under sustained assault.

As a result of Russia’s assault, this winter will likely be the hardest yet for millions of Ukrainian civilians. Burned power plants, cratered substations, and blasted natural gas compressor stations mean no lights, no heat, and no water for millions. With daytime highs dropping to freezing temperatures by New Year’s across most of Ukraine, the potential for a humanitarian crisis and refugee flows into Europe is substantial.

Indeed, this is likely one of Russia’s key goals. Since the full-scale invasion began nearly four years ago, Moscow has realized that while it cannot win on the battlefield, it can terrorize Ukrainian society instead, hoping to force collapse or concessions.

So what can Ukraine do in response—and how can its partners help? Here are three actionable ideas to start, arranged in order of what could most rapidly address the most acute humanitarian needs.

First, use frozen Russian assets to keep Ukrainians alive. It’s time for the world’s largest purchase of personal generators as well as more grid-scale batteries and solar panels to charge them. A decent generator now costs

[TITLE]Consumers urged to switch energy suppliers to save money:
[TEXT]
CONSUMERS ARE BEING encouraged to change their energy suppliers to save money on their energy bills by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.

The Commission (CRU) said today customers who switched to the best available discount tariff, or renegotiated every year, could have saved close to €1,700 on electricity and €740 on gas bills over the last four years.

Changing supplier “remains one of the fastest and most effective ways to secure better tariffs and savings on bills”, the CRU said, as well as other measures like smart meters.

The CRU has launched its campaign “Switch it Up” today to raise consumers’ awareness of the financial savings available when switching providers.

Launching the campaign, the CRU’s Director of Consumer Policy and Protection Karen Trant said on average only 20% of electricity customers switched supplier.

“Meaning almost 1.7 million customers do not switch electricity supplier when they can on an annual basis,” she said.

“We encourage all consumers to engage with their energy suppliers, whether through switching, negotiating, or simply checking in to see what options are available to them.”

She said the campaign is

[TITLE]Duke Energy (DUK) Rate Hikes Opposed by North Carolina Leaders:

Duke Energy (DUK) Rate Hikes Opposed by North Carolina Leaders

eliza-diamond-Iw2oRD2NP2w-unsplash

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) engages in the distribution of natural gas and energy-related services. The company owns and operates a diverse mix of regulated power plants – including hydro, coal, nuclear, natural gas, solar, and battery storage.

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) suffered a blow earlier this month after it was reported that North Carolina leaders had opposed the proposed rate hikes by the utility. Duke revealed last month that it is requesting North Carolina regulators to approve a hike of around 15% in its rates over the next two years, which would see its residential customers paying an additional $20 to $30 per month by 2028. The move comes as the company looks to propose new investments in the state to ensure reliability and keep up with the expanding demand.

However, North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson has now decided to intervene in the process and review it to ‘ensure it is necessary’. Subsequently, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein also formally opposed Duke’s proposed rate hike and issued the following statement:

“I am pleased that the North Carolina Department of Justice is fighting for the people of North Carolina. Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike is simply too high and comes as the company is also retreating on more affordable clean energy. At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we should be doing everything we can to make life more affordable, not less. I will continue to fight on behalf of every North Carolinian to lower costs and grow the economy.”

The North Carolina Utilities Commission is expected to make its decision on the matter in late 2026 following public hearings.

While we acknowledge the potential of DUK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
