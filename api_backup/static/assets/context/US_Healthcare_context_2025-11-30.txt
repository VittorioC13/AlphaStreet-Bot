Catalio Capital Management is adding to its team.

The $2.3 billion healthcare investor has hired Ajay Mantha as a partner within its hedge fund, Catalio Public Equities, according to a note to investors seen by Business Insider.

Mantha previously had been an executive at Zimmer Partners, a New York-based stockpicking hedge fund where Mantha built and then ran the healthcare group. He spent nine years in Bain Capital's public equities division as the head of its healthcare sector group. Prior to that, he worked as an analyst at D.E. Shaw and a consultant for McKinsey.

The note states he will start next year and report to Ben Snedeker, the firm's head of public equities.

Catalio declined to comment on the hire.

The hedge fund, which now runs roughly $900 million following an infusion of capital from Brevan Howard, is up nearly 16% this year, a person close to the manager says, besting the average fund's gains of 9.9%.

The hedge fund has returned roughly 55% since rebranding with the Catalio name at the start of 2023, this person added.

The firm, founded by George Petrocheilos and Jacob Vogelstein, originally focused on private market investments in the healthcare and biotech sectors before acquiring longtime stockpicking hedge fund HealthCor Management at the end of 2022.

HealthCor, founded in 2005 by SAC Capital alums Art Cohen and Joe Healey, was merged into Catalio but is still led by Snedeker, who invested for HealthCor for four years before the sale of the fund.

Catalio counts plenty of big names as backers, including private equity giant KKR. Brevan gave the hedge fund $200 million in a separately managed account earlier this month, Reuters reported.

Wealthy financiers such as Thoma Bravo founder Orlando Bravo and Highbridge Capital founder Glenn Dubin are also investors in Catalio.

[TITLE]Fisher and Paykel Healthcare raises full-year guidance after strong first half:
[TEXT]
FPH managing director and chief executive Lewis Gradon said it had continued to work closely with clinicians, progressed work on new products, and delivered a range of efficiency improvements across the business.

“This is a strong result against the backdrop of robust growth in the first half of last year. We saw broad-based strength across the hospital consumables portfolio during a period of lower seasonal respiratory hospitalisations, and in homecare, our latest range of masks for treating obstructive sleep apnea has performed well.”

In the hospital product group, first half revenue grew to $692.2m, up 17% compared to the same period last year, or 15% in constant currency. This group includes humidification products used in respiratory, acute and surgical care.

Sales of hardware grew by 21%, and hospital new applications consumables revenue lifted by 16%.

In the homecare product group, first half revenue lifted 10% to $395.9m, or up 8%. This group includes products used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and respiratory support in the home.

Gradon said the turnoff of 3G networks had supported hardware sales of its sleep apnoea machines.

The company said its team efforts, together with other efficiency gains, helped to offset the 32 basis-point impact of US tariffs on its hospital products sourced from New Zealand.

Investment in research and development equated to 10% of revenue, or $114.1m.

The company directors have approved an interim dividend of 19c per share, up from 18.5c per share in the first half of the prior year, set to be paid on December 16, 2025.

The share price sat at $36.70 prior to the market open, and lifted by 4.8% to $38.47 by mid morning.

Outlook

FPH also updated its full-year guidance for the financial year, lifting its expected operating revenue to be in the range of approximately $2.17b to $2.27b, up from $2.15b to $2.25b in August’s guidance.

Net profit is also expected to be higher, with the company expecting full-year net profit to be in the range of approximately $410m to $460m, up from $390m to $440m.

“Our second-half hospital consumables growth can be influenced by year-on-year variations in the Northern Hemisphere winter respiratory season, and we don’t have any additional insights into that impact at present,” Gradon added.

“Available data indicates that last winter was a historically strong season, and so a similar season this year would be pushing our result towards the top end of guidance.”

The outlook continues to estimate a 75 basis point impact to gross margin due to US tariffs. It also assumes current global tariff rates, policies and applications for the remainder of the financial year.

The board also approved a discretionary profit-sharing payment of $9m million to be shared among employees who have worked for the company for a qualifying period.

Reaction

Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie said the business exceeded the guidance it provided in August, with the result strong across the board.

“Where they saw particular strengths relative to our expectations was in the hospital hardware business, and particularly I think that is the ongoing mix shift within the business towards the products that they’ve launched in the last couple of years. That’s the Airvo 3 and the 950 system which are higher priced products,” Montgomerie said.

“It reflects hospitals moving on from one generation of product to the other. It was very strong growth and outside of that, pretty much in line with what we were expecting.”

Montgomerie said new apps and consumables had a strong half as the high growth category of the business, reflecting ongoing clinical practice change. Homecare was more or less in line with expectations.

He expects that if the business can maintain its momentum into the second half of the financial year, it should finish closer to the top end of its guidance range.

“I think the result is ongoing evidence of execution and delivery, which they’ve shown for a long period of time now.

“It’s one of those results where it’s very hard to pick any holes in it, to be honest.”

The market for medical membranes is driven by the rising global burden of chronic kidney disease, along with the resulting increase in hemodialysis procedures that rely on high-performance dialysis membranes for efficient solute removal and biocompatibility. The geriatric population, the growing number of diabetes cases, and the rising number of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are contributing to this demand. Furthermore, membrane material advancements such as polysulfone, polyethersulfone, and mixed-matrix membranes with increased flux and antifouling properties are not only making treatment easier but also leading to better patient outcomes. The growth in application areas like drug delivery, tissue regeneration, and sterile filtration, along with the trend of switching to single-use systems to minimize infection risks, is also a great catalyst for the market. Favourable reimbursement policies and the development of healthcare infrastructure in emerging economies are also among the factors that contribute to the market's growth.

The medical membrane market is mainly focused on the development of new semipermeable materials with higher selectivity and biocompatibility, along with the efficiency of the process, to a great extent, for medical and life-science applications. Innovations in this sector comprise the usage of next-generation polymer formulations like modified polysulfone, PES, and PVDF, in addition to membranes with surface engineering that helps reduce fouling and provide better hemocompatibility. Moreover, precision manufacturing methods like phase inversion technique, electrospinning of nanofibers, and asymmetric or composite membrane structures yield membranes that have superior permeability and mechanical strength. The technologies that are developed for microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and sterile filtration purposes are now being incorporated into dialysis devices, diagnostic cartridges, and bioprocessing systems to a greater extent. Automation, membrane functionalization, and quality-control advancements are also gradually making sterilization, reliability, and performance consistency better.

Polysulfone (PSU) & polyethersulfone (PESU) is the largest material segment of the medical membranes market during the forecast period.

Polysulfone (PSU) & polyethersulfone (PESU) represent the largest material segment in the medical membranes market. These materials offer exceptional performance, safety, and manufacturability, qualities that are critical in medical and biopharmaceutical applications. These polymers offer outstanding thermal stability, mechanical strength, and chemical resistance, allowing membranes to function reliably under sterilization methods such as autoclaving, gamma irradiation, and chemical disinfection.

Nanofiltration is the fastest-growing process technology segment in the medical membranes market during the forecast period.

Nanofiltration (NF) is the fastest-growing process technology in the medical membranes market. This technology can selectively eliminate certain impurities while retaining the good minerals, thus offering a medley of efficiency and safety. NF membranes, unlike ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis ones, work at lower pressures, thus reducing energy consumption and operational costs, which is a significant advantage in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. Their ultra-fine pore structure enables them to effectively eliminate divalent and multivalent ions, bacteria, etc., ensuring that the water for medical devices, dialysis and drug formulation is of high purity. The need for high-quality water in hospitals, labs, and the production of pharmaceuticals drives NF membranes' adoption. Furthermore, the process assists in meeting the stringent pureness and biocompatibility standards laid down by regulators. One of the major advantages of the membranes is their longevity, resistance to chemicals, and the convenience of being incorporated into existing setups. Besides, the increasing number of patients with chronic diseases and the building of health care facilities all over the world have made it necessary to resort to water purification solution that is reliable. The potential of NF to hybridize selective filtration with operational efficiency sets it apart.

Pharmaceutical filtration is projected to account for the largest share in the medical membranes market during the forecast period.

Pharmaceutical filtration dominates the medical membranes market. The necessity for ultra-pure water, sterile solutions, and drugs without any impurities in the processes of drug development, biotechnology, and lab testing is driving the growth in pharmaceutical filtration application. Microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and nanofiltration are the key process technologies that are responsible for the removal of bacteria, viruses, and other deleterious agents. Regulatory bodies like the FDA, EMA, and WHO have set up strict guidelines that require extra filtration, which in turn has made medical membranes the preferred choice in pharma production. The booming biopharma, vaccines, injection drugs, and sterile formulations necessitate filtration solutions to be accurate and reliable. Membranes allow for sterile processing without compromising product quality or integrity. Moreover, the scalability, reproducibility, and chemical compatibility of membrane systems allow manufacturers to build up high production volumes and at the same time to reduce the contamination risk. Advancements in membrane materials and designs have provided users with improved efficiency, longer durability, and lower cost, thereby making the systems very attractive for complicated pharmaceutical applications. As the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry continues to grow worldwide, driven by rising healthcare needs and increasing emphasis on patient safety and regulatory compliance, pharmaceutical filtration remains the largest and most vital segment of the medical membranes market.

Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing medical membranes market during the forecast period.

Asia Pacific is the fastest-growing medical membranes market due to expanding healthcare infrastructure, medical and pharmaceutical manufacturing activities, and advancement of technology for water and fluid purification. The rapidly growing population, urbanization, and chronic diseases have created more demand for hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic laboratories, which are heavily reliant on the use of good-quality water and sterile filtration systems. Besides, China, India, and Japan have made a lot of capital investments in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors, where compliance with global regulatory standards calls for the use of advanced membrane technologies. Medical membranes, with their cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability, are particularly attractive to the emerging healthcare markets. Government initiatives that support healthcare modernization and growing R&D in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are also promoting the need for ultrafiltration, microfiltration, and nanofiltration systems.
