[TITLE]Cosmos Health Launches Strategic Partnership With Prime Ledger to Transform $300M Treasury and Tokenize IP Assets:
[TEXT]
CHICAGO, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cosmos Health Inc. ("Cosmos Health" or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:COSM) , a diversified, vertically integrated global healthcare group, today announced a long-term strategic partnership with Prime Ledger LLC ("Prime Ledger"), a leading provider of blockchain infrastructure services and digital asset treasury management. This multi-phase agreement is centered on a comprehensive digital transformation of Cosmos Health’s financial operations, including participating in the management of its $300,000,000 treasury facility and the tokenization of high-value intellectual property (IP).

This collaboration will be executed in several phases, beginning with the establishment of a compliant and secure framework for Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) management. Prime Ledger will help oversee Cosmos Health’s $300M treasury, implementing sophisticated controls, protocol, and reporting systems to enhance efficiency and security while managing risk, yield and income in its corporate treasury operations.

A cornerstone of the partnership involves the tokenization of various IP assets owned by Cosmos Health. Prime Ledger will design and deploy a token issuance platform, enabling Cosmos Health to unlock new capitalization channels and model investments based on its extensive portfolio of healthcare and wellness innovations.

Furthermore, the agreement includes the integration of Cosmos Health’s data infrastructure using Prime Ledger's existing relationship with Conduit Network. This will allow Cosmos Health to more effectively manage its complex on-chain and off-chain data (i.e. data that is permanently recorded, stored, and verifiable on a public blockchain's distributed ledger and data that is external to a blockchain), consolidating flows for financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and real-time performance analytics.

Greg Siokas, CEO of Cosmos Health, stated: “This partnership with Prime Ledger is a pivotal step in our evolution, positioning Cosmos Health at the forefront of the digital economy in the healthcare sector. By digitizing our treasury and tokenizing our valuable IP, we are not just enhancing efficiency; we are building new pathways for growth and innovation. Prime Ledger’s expertise provides the secure and scalable infrastructure we need to achieve these strategic goals.”

Robert Hoffman, CEO of Prime Ledger, commented: “We are honoured that Cosmos Health has selected Prime Ledger for this transformative initiative. Managing a significant treasury and tokenizing unique IP requires a blend of deep financial security, data integrity, and blockchain expertise. Our platforms are built for this exact purpose. We are fully committed to supporting Cosmos's long-term vision and setting a new standard for digital finance in the global healthcare industry."

The initial phase of the engagement is set to commence in Q4 2025 and will focus on strategy, regulatory mapping, and the architectural design of the treasury and tokenization platforms.

[TITLE]Surprise tariffs are hitting shoppers this holiday season:
[TEXT]
If you order products from abroad this holiday season, you could end up with an unwanted surprise: a pricey tariff bill.

This is the first holiday shopping season since the Trump administration made a major change to customs rules, extending tariffs and customs fees to low-value packages that had long been exempt.

Since the new policies went into effect in late August, shoppers have reported being hit with surprise tariff charges on everything from rugs and computers to vitamins — sometimes costing hundreds of dollars.

Now, as the busiest shopping season of the year gets underway, the stakes are high for both consumers and retailers.

The National Retail Federation estimates that U.S. holiday sales will top $1 trillion for the first time this season, and Adobe Analytics expects shoppers will spend a record $253.4 billion online this holiday season.

Shoppers who buy gifts from overseas should be prepared to pay tariffs before they can put their presents under the tree. And those who dispute an unexpected tariff bill should be ready for a potentially monthslong back-and-forth with major shippers — while late fees pile up.

The $657 tariff bill

Bonnie Hardy-Compagno thought she’d be paying a standard 15% import duty from Europe when she ordered $431 worth of skincare products in late August that were shipped from Belgium.

Instead, when her package arrived via UPS in September, she was told that she owed customs charges and fees that were more than the items were worth.

“I was very shocked when it showed up and the delivery driver was like, ‘This is going to be $657 to collect your package,’” said Hardy-Compagno.

Hardy-Compagno refused her package of skincare products and reached out to UPS for clarification.

According to forms and emails she received from UPS, the shipping company said the face creams and serums she ordered had triggered a 200% tariff because they contained aluminum that was either from Russia or from an unknown country, as well as a separate 50% steel tariff.

“It is chaos trying to get it resolved,” she said. “I’ve been calling at least once a week for two months. I have been emailing.”

“They finally sent me a form to fill out

[TITLE]Flipkart festival season customer base tops 200 million; Tier-2 & Tier-3 drive growth:
[TEXT]
E-commerce firm Flipkart on Wednesday said it has reported one of its strongest growth phases in recent years, marked by a sharp rise in customer base, higher order volumes, and deeper participation from Tier-2 and Tier-3 towns.

The company said it served over 200 million customers across its ecosystem during the festive season, reflecting its expanding relevance in urban and non-metro India.

Overall orders on the platform grew 21 per cent during the festive period, and around 40 per cent year-on-year post-festive period, signalling broad-based consumer confidence and category momentum, the company said in a statement.

Small-town momentum

The festive cycle attracted 101 million customers, with two-thirds of them from non-metro areas - a trend Flipkart said reflects the accelerating shift of smaller towns toward online consumption and category diversification.

"The belief that India's consumption story is driven only by metros is outdated. We see multiple Indians shopping on Flipkart: value-conscious families, convenience-driven younger customers, and a rapidly growing segment of aspirational buyers exploring brands and new categories. This shift is structural, not seasonal. Our priority is to serve all of them with access, affordability, and trust as we deepen our role in India's digital retail economy," Flipkart Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Rajneesh Kumar, said.

Flipkart attributed its momentum to sustained investments in commerce, supply chain, and technology, supported by a seasoned leadership bench guiding its scale-up and long-term vision.

MSME boost strategy

To support this rising tide of customers, the company doubled down on enabling its seller ecosystem, particularly MSMEs.

A major development this year was Flipkart's introduction of a zero-commission model for all eligible products priced below Rs 1,000, which is expected to reduce sellers' platform costs by up to 30 per cent in certain categories.

This strategic move strengthens the platform's inclusive marketplace by allowing sellers to price more competitively, expand selection, and meet the massive demand in the sub-Rs 1,000 segment.

On Shopsy, Flipkart’s hyper-value platform, the zero-commission structure applies across all price points.

Flipkart said the change expands affordability for customers, while enabling MSMEs to scale more easily.

Sakait Chaudhary, Senior Vice President and Head of Marketplace, said the initiative is designed to widen opportunities. "Millions of customers in India shop in the sub-Rs 1,000 segment. By removing commission barriers, we allow sellers to price more competitively, expand their catalogue, and reach more households. This is how we strengthen a more inclusive, sustainable marketplace." The festive period also witnessed a strong momentum from India's MSME ecosystem. Flipkart saw participation from lakhs of sellers, with women-led enterprises, regional manufacturers, and artisan communities showing significant momentum.

Logistics at scale

The company said this signals accelerating digital entrepreneurship beyond major metros. The platform's growth is underpinned by an expanding, resilient, and greener logistics network.

Flipkart's supply chain network saw a significant expansion of 35 lakh square feet, covering over 21,000 pin codes with a logistics network of more than 100 fulfilment centres, and rapidly scaling its quick commerce business with more than 450 new micro-fulfilment centres across 30 cities.

The company has doubled its EV last-mile fleet to more than 20,000, with nearly 70 per cent of grocery deliveries now made via EVs, and has also introduced electric long-haul trucks on routes such as Delhi–Jaipur, strengthening its commitment to sustainable operations.

Hemant Badri, Senior Vice President for Supply Chain, Minutes, and Customer Experience, said the festive season showed the strength of Flipkart's long-term investments.

"Our network has been built pin code by pin code for over a decade. This season, our supply chain demonstrated robust scale and resilience, managing a 24 per cent year-on-year growth in unit volumes, maintaining 99.9 per cent uptime on peak days, and operating with a significantly greener last-mile fleet. With over 60 per cent of orders coming from Tier 2 and 3 regions, it reaffirms that our infrastructure is built to serve all of India. We are proud to have delivered not just packages, but trust and celebration to millions of households across Bharat." Underpinning the entire ecosystem is Flipkart's investment in technology to ensure a trusted and safe consumer experience.

Balaji Thiagarajan, Chief Product and Technology Officer, said, "Our platform is built for the future of commerce - a future defined by both massive scale and unshakeable trust. The number of users that seamlessly engaged on the platform grew by nearly 16 per cent this festive season compared to last year, demonstrating the exponential power of engineering at scale. Trust remains a defining factor in India's maturing e-commerce market. We have made deeper investments in platform safety and have delivered a 25 per cent reduction in account takeover frauds, 99.95 per cent accuracy in blocking malicious requests, and a 50 per cent cut in customer handling time through GenAI-powered support." Across categories, Flipkart saw a balanced growth across fashion, home, beauty, electronics, and refurbished goods with rising repeat purchases in metros and non-metros, driven increasingly by reliability, convenience and selection - not offers alone. "As India's consumption story evolves, the platforms that will succeed are the ones that deliver access, affordability, and trust simultaneously," Rajneesh Kumar said. "That is the direction we have set for Flipkart."

[TITLE]Circana’s 2026 Food & Beverage Outlook Reveals Growth Driven by Price and Product Mix as Consumers Optimize Spending:
[TEXT]
Chicago, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Circana, LLC , today released its revised 2026 outlook for the U.S. food and beverage (F&B) retail sector. The update points toward continued volume tightness amid ongoing demand challenges. Meanwhile, price expectations are expected to moderate due to evolving price trends and notable shifts in consumer behavior. Circana now expects total retail F&B dollar sales growth to range from 2% to 4% in 2026.

Circana’s revised forecast projects price/mix growth between 2% and 4%, while volume sales are anticipated to be flat or slightly negative. Although recent policy changes have provided some tariff relief, rising supply costs in packaged goods continue. The retail environment, marked by intense price competition and the adoption of AI-supported technology, is helping to keep price growth in check even as cost pressures persist.

Consumer confidence remains weak, prompting shoppers, especially in low- and middle-income groups, to pull back on discretionary spending and focus more on price-value optimization. Premiumization is likely to slow, and value-seeking behaviors are intensifying. Fresh categories are poised for higher demand, driven by healthy living trends and increased attention to product ingredients, as well as the growing influence of weight-loss drugs.

“Our revised 2026 outlook reflects a market that is tightening and more challenging, but not without growth vectors,” said Sally Lyons Wyatt, global executive vice president and chief advisor at Circana. “While pricing pressures and cautious consumer sentiment are shaping a more measured growth trajectory, the food and beverage sector continues to demonstrate resilience and adaptability. Brands and retailers that prioritize affordability, channel flexibility, and personalized experiences will be best positioned to succeed in 2026’s competitive landscape.”

Global Trends Shaping the F&B Market in 2026

Circana expects F&B value sales across Europe to continue to grow around 4% in 2026, mirroring trends seen through 2025. This anticipated growth will be primarily driven by deeper levels of promotion to support sales velocity and the continued expansion of private labels, now accounting for 44% of F&B value — an increase from 41% three years ago.

In the ANZ region, Circana projects unit sales to accelerate by 2.5% in 2026. The improvement in the consumer and economic environment will support spending. Increased demand, amid spikes in price/mix, will nudge value growth upwards of 6% and help to offset slowing population growth. Food and beverages are expected to propel growth in both Australia and New Zealand, although the growth gap with non-food will narrow.

Strategies for Success in 2026

Circana expects the F&B market to remain resilient but notes that growth will be more nuanced as consumers continue to seek value and navigate ongoing economic uncertainty. Brands that effectively balance pricing, innovation, and consumer empathy will be best positioned for success in 2026.

Circana advises brands and retailers to:

Address Value Needs: Emphasize opening price points for lower-income shoppers and fine-tune price-value for higher-income cohorts.

Emphasize opening price points for lower-income shoppers and fine-tune price-value for higher-income cohorts. Channel Optimization: Align channel coverage and promotional investments with shifting consumer migration patterns.

Align channel coverage and promotional investments with shifting consumer migration patterns. Personalization and Innovation: Differentiate assortment and messaging using AI, especially in e-commerce, to meet evolving consumer expectations for wellness, convenience, and taste.

The Indian economy is closing the fiscal year with resilient growth, underpinned by landmark tax reforms and firm fiscal discipline.This strong domestic performance comes as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares for Budget 2026 , which is expected to reinforce the government’s commitment to strategic spending and economic stability amid complex global challenges.The government’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections have displayed noteworthy stability in the current fiscal year (FY2025-26), even after the comprehensive GST 2.0 rate rationalisation implemented in September 2025.Gross GST revenue for November 2025 was recorded at Rs 1,70,276 crore, marking a marginal increase of 0.7% year-on-year. While this represents the slowest growth in the fiscal year, officials note that the collections are broadly on expected lines following the sweeping rate cuts.Crucially, cumulative gross collections from April to November 2025 reached Rs 14,75,488 crore, demonstrating a robust 8.9% annual growth. This sustained performance is a significant indicator of ongoing economic activity and better compliance.The stability in collections follows the biggest overhaul of the indirect tax system since its 2017 inception.GST 2.0 simplified the multi-tiered structure into a streamlined system, primarily featuring a 5% 'merit rate' for essentials and an 18% 'standard rate' for most other goods and services, alongside a new 40% rate for select luxury items.The reform was pitched as a major consumption booster, directly reducing taxes on essential goods like personal care products, packaged food items, and even certain small cars, leaving more disposable income in the hands of consumers.While the short-term goal of boosting household spending appears to be driving taxable value growth, the government is closely monitoring collection trends to assess the full long-term impact.The healthy tax revenue stream places Finance Minister Sitharaman in a strong position to adhere to the government’s fiscal glide path.The Budget 2025 had already set the fiscal deficit target for FY2026 at 4.4% of GDP, aligning with the commitment to narrow the gap to below 4.5% by FY2026.This commitment to fiscal prudence is crucial for maintaining global investor confidence.The Budget is expected to continue focusing on high capital expenditure (capex), which was targeted at a record Rs 11.21 lakh crore for the previous fiscal year, as a primary engine for sustainable, long-term economic growth, particularly through infrastructure development.India’s economic fundamentals remain a beacon of strength against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty, including geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Europe, persistently high inflation in many developed economies, and a significant trade shock from the United States.A major external challenge is the aggressive tariff policy implemented by the US administration in 2025. Following an initial 25% duty, the US hiked tariffs on a large portion of Indian exports to 50% by late August, making Indian goods among the most heavily taxed of any major US trading partner.This measure, partly linked to geopolitical friction over India's continued imports of Russian oil, has severely impacted bilateral trade.Meanwhile, back home, the narrative of India's economy has shifted from mere resilience to accelerated growth, while inflation has eased significantly, altering the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy calculus.Far from experiencing a deceleration, the Indian economy delivered a major upside surprise, accelerating to a six-quarter high in the second quarter of the current fiscal year (FY2025-26) as it quickened to 8.2%, beating estimates.This robust performance was driven primarily by a surge in the manufacturing sector, which grew 9.1% year-on-year, and strong expansion in the services sector. The momentum was supported by private consumer spending (which accounts for nearly 60% of GDP) and continued high government capital expenditure.However, the upcoming Budget, the third in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s third term, faces the unique challenge of balancing national growth objectives with the priorities of the established coalition government.

[TITLE]Trump says he will roll back fuel efficiency standards for vehicles:
[TEXT]
President Donald Trump on Wednesday said his administration would "reset" fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars in an effort to put a lid on rising auto prices, as the administration battles inflation and an affordability crisis.

The previous rules, which sought to lower carbon emissions, “put tremendous upward pressure on car prices,” Trump said in the Oval Office.

The president is under political pressure to address affordability concerns after Democrats swept major races last month, fueled by voters' frustration with rising prices.

Overall inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, has risen every month since Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imported goods, including automobiles and car parts, among other items. Food prices have also been rising this year. In early November, the White House announced cuts to dozens of tariffs in a move aimed at cutting food prices.

The average new vehicle price in October surged to an all-time high, above $50,000 for the first time ever, according to Kelley Blue Book. However, KBB said that "despite higher prices, retail sales continue to maintain a healthy pace."

"The $20,000-vehicle is now mostly extinct, and many price-conscious buyers are sidelined or cruising in the used-vehicle market," Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating said in October.

The Department of Transportation says the proposal will "save the American people $109 billion" or $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle, but it's unclear how fast prices could fall. The updated standards still must go through a formal rulemaking process before being finalized, likely in 2026.

The proposed change "will also revive the beating heart of American manufacturing and unshackle the nation’s automotive industry," the department and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.

It would also roll back efficiency mandates raised by the Biden administration.

"The announcement today is a shift in long-term fuel economy targets for model year 2031 vehicles,” said Mark Schirmer, Cox Automotive’s director of industry insights communications.

"Those targets are being lowered, which may change automaker long-term strategy and product development plans and pricing, but will have little impact on prices near term," he said.

The administration also said it would reclassify crossover vehicles and small SUVs as passenger automobiles instead of light trucks, removing what it called a "market distortion that existed for decades."

Trump was joined at the White House for the announcement by executives from Detroit's "Big Three" — Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley and John Urbanic, executive plant director of General Motors' Orion assembly factory in Michigan.

Stellantis is the European parent company of the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram car brands.

In statements, all three of the companies praised the move. Stellantis said it would "re-align ... standards with real world market conditions," while Ford said "we can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability."

"This is a win for customers and common sense," Ford's Farley added.

General Motors said it has "long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability."

The Chevy and Cadillac maker added that it remains "committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market."

Shares of Ford and GM stock closed about 1% higher Wednesday. Stellantis' stock jumped 4.7%.

[TITLE]Global markets edgy as investors gauge chances of Federal Reserve rate cut:
[TEXT]
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange: weak US economic data solidified expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

Global shares were mixed on Wednesday even after weak US economic data solidified expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

Dublin

Euronext Dublin finished the day up 0.1 per cent, with insulation specialist Kingspan the standout performer. The Cavan-based group, which is one of the biggest companies left on the Irish stock exchange, climbed 1.5 per cent with almost 47 million shares were traded.

The performance came days after Goodbody described Kingspan shares as “grossly undervalued” despite record profits and strong growth prospects. The brokerage said the market has “lost sight” of the company’s long-term growth drivers.

In the trading note issued on Monday, Goodbody said Kingspan was on track to deliver “another year of record profits”, and that it had outperformed most European construction stocks while its valuation “underperformed” peer companies.

Elsewhere, it was a bad day at the office for the banks as AIB and Bank of Ireland sank 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.

Ryanair finished just above flat on the day despite a lot trading activity, while food giant Kerry Group climbed 0.6 per cent.

[TITLE]Nigeria loses N544bn yearly to beans export ban, say stakeholders:
[TEXT]
Stakeholders in the agricultural sector have bemoaned that Nigeria continues to lose an estimated N543.75bn annually in foreign exchange due to the ban on bean exportation.

The concern was expressed at the two-day National Summit on Agroecology and Public-Private Partnerships on Agroecology, which ended in Lagos on Tuesday.

The European Union had in 2015 placed a long-standing ban on the export of dried beans from Nigeria due to high levels of hazardous pesticide residues.

The ban was imposed by the EU, citing excessive chemical residues found in the produce, which exceed the acceptable limits.

The two-day summit, organised by ActionAid Nigeria under its Strategic Partnerships for Agroecology and Climate Justice in West Africa and Strategic Partnership Agreement projects, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, brought together more than 300 participants both physically and virtually.

The communiqué read by the National Chairman of the Agricultural Development Projects Programme Managers’ Forum, Muhammed Rili, lamented that the continued ban had cost the country revenue, jobs, and market relevance.

[TITLE]FedEx Eliminates 856 Jobs as Logistics Layoffs Spread Across Sector:
[TEXT]
FedEx is laying off 856 employees in northern Texas as the logistics giant plans to close a facility in Dallas suburb Coppell.

The company is permanently shuttering the facility by April 29, 2026, with the phased layoffs starting Jan. 29. Roughly 60 employees will be let go to start, with the remaining terminations occurring separately over the next three months.

“This action is necessitated solely by our customer’s decision to transition its business to a new location that will be managed by a new third-party logistics provider,” FedEx said in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notice to the Texas Workforce Commission. FedEx did not identify the customer.

According to FedEx, the employees were notified in advance, with some workers eligible for other roles within the company. The company said it will provide job placement assistance, relocation aid or severance, as applicable.

The layoffs come as FedEx has been making cutbacks elsewhere amid a wider network adjustment that expects to see the company close 30 percent of its package distribution facilities within two years. The Network 2.0 plan is designed to consolidate the FedEx delivery network with fewer stations and routes, and is expected to save $2 billion upon its completion at the end of fiscal 2027.

Earlier this year, the Memphis, Tenn.-based delivery courier cut 305 jobs at another site in Fort Worth, Texas, before cutting another 131 jobs at two other locations in nearby Garland and Plano.

And near its hometown, FedEx laid off 611 employees at two facilities in Shelby, Tenn. in October.

FedEx wasn’t the only company in the apparel supply chain experiencing layoffs in the Lone Star State last month.

Dillard’s is cutting 93 jobs starting Jan. 12, when the department store closes a location in Plano. That location served as an anchor store at The Shops at Willow Bend, which is being remodeled as more of a mixed-use development.

Management shakeup at Ceva on the horizon?

Another major logistics company is reportedly undergoing its own right-sizing at the management level.

Third-party logistics (3PL) provider Ceva Logistics expects to let go of “lots of key managers,” according to a Tuesday report from supply chain publication The Loadstar. That report indicates that a “raft of other managers” are either being targeted for layoffs, or expected to leave voluntarily.

The moves come more than a year after Ceva integrated Bolloré Logistics into its logistics services business. Parent company CMA CGM finalized the $5 billion buyout of Bolloré last February.

A prior report from The Loadstar indicated that Ceva’s senior vice president of air and ocean freight, Jerome Petit, left the company this month. Petit was formerly the deputy CEO of Bolloré ahead of the acquisition.

Jean-Philippe Retif, an account management leader that came over in the Bolloré deal, was let go, along with strategic account director Laurent Fourcade, the Loadstar report said. The report said “there’s a plan for more casualties among logistics managers” during the holiday season.

Sourcing Journal reached out to Ceva Logistics.

A report from FreightWaves in July indicated that the company’s North American segment was restructuring, citing an internal memo from Ceva CEO Mathieu Friedberg to employees.

Freiberg said in the message that the reorganization was designed to bolster “profitable growth, modernization and efficiency, and people” at the unit.

According to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), seasonally adjusted transportation and warehousing jobs across the board increased year over year in September to 6,709,900 employees. This is a 39,800 worker, or 0.6 percent, improvement over the 6,670,100 workers employed across the sector last September.

When accounting for just warehousing and storage, employment declined 2.1 percent year over year, or 38,500 employees, to 1,812,300 workers during the month.

Macy’s, Fanatics, Wayfair pare down warehouse employment

Throughout retail, companies like Macy’s, Fanatics and Wayfair have cut employment across their distribution networks in recent months.

Shortly after hosting the grand opening of its new North Carolina fulfillment and store replenishment center, Macy’s is shuttering a unit of a distribution center in Windsor. Conn. starting in late December.

According to a WARN notice, 106 employees will be impacted, 77 of them being warehouse associates. The job cuts are permanent, and will take place between Dec. 28 and Jan. 10. Macy’s is closing the unit since it is shuttering the entire Backstage operation at the warehouse.

For Fanatics, the sports apparel company is closing a Riverview, Fla.-based distribution center next year. In a WARN notice on Nov. 14, the retailer said 286 employees would be impacted by the closure, with the first batch of job cuts coming March 1. Terminations will be ongoing until the closing date of Nov. 14.

Last year, the brand closed a warehouse in Jacksonville, laying off 218 employees. The brand also operates a facility in Tampa, which opened in August 2024.

Wayfair is also closing a warehouse, resulting in the layoffs of 215 staff starting Jan. 1. Job cuts will be conducted in a phased approach throughout 2026, until the Erlanger, Ky. facility’s closure on Sept. 30.

The home and furniture retailer is closing the plant after it decided not to renew the facility’s lease “as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our logistics network,” the company said in a statement.

[TITLE]Global luxury apparel market to rebound slowly after 2024 setback – analysis:
[TEXT]

The global luxury apparel market will undergo a gradual recovery after a 2.4% contraction in 2024, analysis indicates.

According to GlobalData Global Luxury Apparel Market to 2029 report, growth will return in 2025, but it is expected to be largely fuelled by price increases rather than higher sales volumes.

Macro pressures including inflation across Europe and the US and a sharp slowdown in China dented consumer spending last year, producing the market’s first material setback in several years. GlobalData’s report forecasts that the sector will grow by 2.0% in 2025 as brands raise prices to protect margins, even as volumes continue to decline.

Free Sample Download sample pages of selected reports Explore a selection of report samples we have handpicked for you. Get a preview of the insights inside. Download your free copy today.

Over the 2024–29 period, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 2.8% and to begin outperforming the broader apparel market from 2028 as the finances of aspirational shoppers improve.

Clothing is projected to be the strongest category through 2029, with a 3.1% CAGR driven by ultra-wealthy consumers who remain willing to spend on trend-led pieces; womenswear is expected to outperform menswear. Accessories – led by luxury handbags as enduring status symbols – should record a 2.9% CAGR. Footwear looks set to be the weakest area, with a modest 1.0% CAGR, as strong demand for trainers from premium and mass-market specialists limits growth for high-end shoe categories.

Asia-Pacific will be the growth engine, posting the strongest regional CAGR of 4.0% between 2024 and 2029, supported by the recovery of China and robust growth in emerging Asian markets. In contrast, Europe and the Americas are forecast to experience softer growth – 1.8% and 1.5% CAGRs respectively – hampered by sluggish economies and the lingering effects of US tariffs. The Middle East and Africa will increase its share of the global market, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates benefiting from tourism and strong domestic spending.

Luxury heavyweights retained power in 2024. Louis Vuitton remained the largest apparel brand, increasing its market share to 9.8%. Hermès was the standout performer, expanding share by 0.7 percentage points to 6.0% as its exclusivity and craftsmanship held strong appeal among the ultra-wealthy. Chanel also gained share, largely through strategic price increases. By contrast, brands such as Gucci and Burberry lost ground amid unclear positioning and weaker product offerings.

Luxury apparel rebound drivers

Several structural factors underpin the recovery outlook. Ultra-wealthy customers continue to provide a stabilising base for top-tier luxury houses, maintaining demand and preserving brand equity. Meanwhile, improvements in broader macroeconomic conditions and rising consumer confidence should gradually bring back aspirational shoppers – the expanding middle and upper-middle segments whose purchasing power was most affected during the downturn.

Social media and influencer marketing are playing an increasingly important role in engaging younger buyers. Luxury brands are courting content creators and leaning into platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to capture Gen Z’s appetite for luxury. Collaborations with celebrities, entertainment franchises and other brands continue to deliver cultural moments that drive excitement and sales.

At the same time, the booming resale market presents both opportunity and challenge. Resale apparel is expected to grow sharply – by nearly 48% between 2024 and 2028 – with luxury items particularly coveted as more affordable options. Some houses have partnered with resale platforms to reclaim share, but secondhand channels remain a threat to full-price sales, especially among budget-conscious aspirational shoppers.

China’s 2024 slowdown – driven in part by its real estate crisis – hit the market hard, and while stimulus should support a recovery in 2025, Chinese shoppers are likely to remain cautious, amplified by government messaging discouraging ostentatious displays of wealth. Online luxury retail also faces challenges: the collapse of major multi-brand platforms in 2024 has reinforced the importance of brick-and-mortar boutiques, where premium service and in-store experience are key to selling high-priced items.

[TITLE]Republic Brands Group Acquires Joie, Equipment and Current/Elliott Brands:
[TEXT]
Republic Brands Group, a New York-based brand management firm, has acquired a new portfolio of fashion brands, including Joie, Equipment and Current/Elliott, to form the Lux Group.

The brands, which will be based in New York, were sold by Los Angeles-based Sunrise Brands, which has owned them since 2021.

Sami Souid, chief executive officer of Republic Brands Group, founded the company three years ago. This acquisition is viewed as a way to reinforce the company’s goal of building a diversified collection of fashion brands with strong cultural relevance, design authority and long-term commercial success. (Republic Brands Group is a different company from Republic Clothing Group.)

“We purchased this portfolio because we believe in the value and recognizable assets of each brand. Joie, Equipment and Current/Elliott each bring an established customer base, proven market demand and a distinctive point of view that complements our groups’s broader vision,” Souid said. He declined to disclose the acquisition cost but they have been valued by a third party at a combined $36 million.

As part of the integration plan for Joie, Equipment and Current/Elliott, Republic Brands intends to expand the brands into additional categories through licensing to create full lifestyle brands and appoint new C-suite leadership and dedicated creative directors. The strategy is to elevate product design, revitalize the labels’ DNA, sign licensees and seek collaboration opportunities.

Republic Brands Group owns the brand Wilt, has a partnership with Avani Gregg, and does licensing programs for Jason Wu and Christian Siriano.

Prior to being owned by Sunrise Brands, Joie, Current/Elliott and Equipment were owned by The Collected Group, which went bankrupt in 2021. KKR, a lender to the bankrupt company, converted its debt holdings into ownership and sold the labels to Sunrise Brands.

Souid said one of the significant advantages of the deal was that there’s “major brand recognition,” with the three labels. “That’s an awesome place to start. We also did our own little research, and we’ve come to realize that they actually have a loyal following. The customer really loves the product aesthetics,” he said. He acknowledged that every company has its ups and downs, “but we felt like if we could really get behind it and bring it back in a big way, it would be very exciting.”

As a brand management company, Souid believes that these brands can be easily rebuilt. “Their identity is pretty clear. We know exactly what their aesthetics are, and the brand recognition is there.” He said he plans to rebuild them through licensees “from apparel to handbags to footwear to accessories, to even home.” He said Republic Brands Group doesn’t plan to do any of the manufacturing itself.

Republic sees opportunity to grow the three brands by shifting them away from the retail-first model and prioritizing digital DTC growth and wholesale distribution.

Souid said he will be naming new creative directors in the coming weeks. He anticipates to have product in the stores as early as the second quarter of 2026. While he has acquired the brands’ websites, he said they will be completely revamped, along with the collections.

The expansion strategy includes rolling out across major U.S. department stores and key international markets, with the U.S. remaining the largest market, followed by Europe and Asia. In the U.S., target stores will be Nordstrom, Saks, Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, along with high-end specialty boutiques across the country. The full introduction under the new group direction will be for fall 2026.

Souid said he feels strongly about eventually having a couple of mono-brand stores, especially for Joie, throughout New York, Los Angeles and maybe Houston. The brands don’t operate freestanding stores any longer.

Souid said they are still considering whether they will bring any of the current employees to the company.

As for the target audience, Souid said Joie is a brand that is aimed at a woman 30 to 50 years old who likes feminine clothing and wants to look chic and sophisticated, whereas Current/Elliott has a cool factor to it, and could be more of a denim brand for women and men from 25 to 45, which can extend. Equipment is a mix of both. “It could be great denim and a cool casual brand, but it can also be dresses and casual apparel,” he said.

He said the average price point for these brands are $195 for a T-shirt up to $995 for a leather jacket or dress.

All three brands have had a long history in the contemporary space under various owners and creative directors. Joie, which was founded in 2001, is known for its casual and accessible luxury style, Equipment was launched in 1976 and was relaunched in 2010 under Serge Azria. It became known for its signature silk shirts. Current/Elliott, which was founded by designers Emily Current and Meritt Elliott in 2009, became popular for its vintage-inspired denim, especially its “Boyfriend Jean.” The original founders exited the brand in 2012.

[TITLE]Flipkart festival season customer base tops 200 million; Tier-2 & Tier-3 drive growth:
[TEXT]
E-commerce firm Flipkart on Wednesday said it has reported one of its strongest growth phases in recent years, marked by a sharp rise in customer base, higher order volumes, and deeper participation from Tier-2 and Tier-3 towns.

The company said it served over 200 million customers across its ecosystem during the festive season, reflecting its expanding relevance in urban and non-metro India.

Overall orders on the platform grew 21 per cent during the festive period, and around 40 per cent year-on-year post-festive period, signalling broad-based consumer confidence and category momentum, the company said in a statement.

Small-town momentum

The festive cycle attracted 101 million customers, with two-thirds of them from non-metro areas - a trend Flipkart said reflects the accelerating shift of smaller towns toward online consumption and category diversification.

"The belief that India's consumption story is driven only by metros is outdated. We see multiple Indians shopping on Flipkart: value-conscious families, convenience-driven younger customers, and a rapidly growing segment of aspirational buyers exploring brands and new categories. This shift is structural, not seasonal. Our priority is to serve all of them with access, affordability, and trust as we deepen our role in India's digital retail economy," Flipkart Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Rajneesh Kumar, said.

Flipkart attributed its momentum to sustained investments in commerce, supply chain, and technology, supported by a seasoned leadership bench guiding its scale-up and long-term vision.

MSME boost strategy

To support this rising tide of customers, the company doubled down on enabling its seller ecosystem, particularly MSMEs.

A major development this year was Flipkart's introduction of a zero-commission model for all eligible products priced below Rs 1,000, which is expected to reduce sellers' platform costs by up to 30 per cent in certain categories.

This strategic move strengthens the platform's inclusive marketplace by allowing sellers to price more competitively, expand selection, and meet the massive demand in the sub-Rs 1,000 segment.

On Shopsy, Flipkart’s hyper-value platform, the zero-commission structure applies across all price points.

Flipkart said the change expands affordability for customers, while enabling MSMEs to scale more easily.

Sakait Chaudhary, Senior Vice President and Head of Marketplace, said the initiative is designed to widen opportunities. "Millions of customers in India shop in the sub-Rs 1,000 segment. By removing commission barriers, we allow sellers to price more competitively, expand their catalogue, and reach more households. This is how we strengthen a more inclusive, sustainable marketplace." The festive period also witnessed a strong momentum from India's MSME ecosystem. Flipkart saw participation from lakhs of sellers, with women-led enterprises, regional manufacturers, and artisan communities showing significant momentum.

Logistics at scale

The company said this signals accelerating digital entrepreneurship beyond major metros. The platform's growth is underpinned by an expanding, resilient, and greener logistics network.

Flipkart's supply chain network saw a significant expansion of 35 lakh square feet, covering over 21,000 pin codes with a logistics network of more than 100 fulfilment centres, and rapidly scaling its quick commerce business with more than 450 new micro-fulfilment centres across 30 cities.

The company has doubled its EV last-mile fleet to more than 20,000, with nearly 70 per cent of grocery deliveries now made via EVs, and has also introduced electric long-haul trucks on routes such as Delhi–Jaipur, strengthening its commitment to sustainable operations.

Hemant Badri, Senior Vice President for Supply Chain, Minutes, and Customer Experience, said the festive season showed the strength of Flipkart's long-term investments.

"Our network has been built pin code by pin code for over a decade. This season, our supply chain demonstrated robust scale and resilience, managing a 24 per cent year-on-year growth in unit volumes, maintaining 99.9 per cent uptime on peak days, and operating with a significantly greener last-mile fleet. With over 60 per cent of orders coming from Tier 2 and 3 regions, it reaffirms that our infrastructure is built to serve all of India. We are proud to have delivered not just packages, but trust and celebration to millions of households across Bharat." Underpinning the entire ecosystem is Flipkart's investment in technology to ensure a trusted and safe consumer experience.

Balaji Thiagarajan, Chief Product and Technology Officer, said, "Our platform is built for the future of commerce - a future defined by both massive scale and unshakeable trust. The number of users that seamlessly engaged on the platform grew by nearly 16 per cent this festive season compared to last year, demonstrating the exponential power of engineering at scale. Trust remains a defining factor in India's maturing e-commerce market. We have made deeper investments in platform safety and have delivered a 25 per cent reduction in account takeover frauds, 99.95 per cent accuracy in blocking malicious requests, and a 50 per cent cut in customer handling time through GenAI-powered support." Across categories, Flipkart saw a balanced growth across fashion, home, beauty, electronics, and refurbished goods with rising repeat purchases in metros and non-metros, driven increasingly by reliability, convenience and selection - not offers alone. "As India's consumption story evolves, the platforms that will succeed are the ones that deliver access, affordability, and trust simultaneously," Rajneesh Kumar said. "That is the direction we have set for Flipkart."
