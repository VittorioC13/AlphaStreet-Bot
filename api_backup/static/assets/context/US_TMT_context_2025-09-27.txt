This milestone, together with Kodiak’s track record in deploying revenue generating autonomous technology, underscores its leadership in the autonomous vehicle sector

Kodiak and Ares Acquisition Corporation II have raised over $275 million before expenses to help Kodiak accelerate its go-to-market strategy

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. and NEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kodiak AI, Inc. (“ Kodiak ” or the “ Company ”), a leading provider of AI-powered autonomous vehicle technology, today announced that Kodiak Robotics, Inc. successfully completed its business combination with Ares Acquisition Corporation II (NYSE: AACT) (“ AACT ”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company. The business combination was approved by AACT shareholders on September 23, 2025. In connection with the closing, AACT was renamed Kodiak AI, Inc. Kodiak AI, Inc.’s common stock and public warrants are expected to begin trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “ Nasdaq ”) on September 25, 2025 under the ticker symbols “KDK” and “KDKRW,” respectively.

In connection with its business combination with AACT, Kodiak received more than $212.5 million from certain institutional investors, including $145 million in PIPE funding and approximately $62.9 million in trust cash from AACT, before expenses.

“The transportation industry faces growing challenges, including safety risks, rising costs, and driver shortages,” said Don Burnette, Founder and CEO of Kodiak. “Going public with the support of our partners at AACT marks an important step in Kodiak’s journey to help transform how freight moves by providing our driverless solution to customers. The Kodiak Driver is already on the road, safely and reliably delivering freight every day for paying customers without a human in the cab. Our driverless operations show that autonomy is no longer a future promise but a reality today. Thanks to our Kodiak team members for their extraordinary dedication in helping us achieve this milestone, and I am eager to begin our next chapter as a public company with the support of our new and existing investors.”

Kodiak’s next-generation AI-powered autonomous driving system, the Kodiak Driver, is designed to help address critical challenges in the trucking industry and the public sector, including a significant labor shortage, rising costs, and demand for shorter delivery timelines. The Kodiak Driver integrates learnings from real-world experience across commercial trucking and public sector applications to continuously improve AI models and increase reliability and efficiency in a wide range of environments. With approximately 3 million on-road autonomous miles and over 3,000 paid driverless hours logged to date, the Kodiak Driver is already delivering value to customers. The Company has already achieved significant commercial milestones:

In 2024, Kodiak became the first company to announce delivery of driverless semi-trucks to a paying customer, Atlas Energy Solutions (NYSE: AESI), which in 2025 placed an initial order of 100 trucks.

Today, Atlas owns and operates a fleet of eight Kodiak Driver-powered driverless trucks, operating day and night, up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Kodiak has delivered over 7,300 loads for on-highway customers including Maersk, IKEA, J.B. Hunt, Bridgestone, C.R. England, and more.

“When we launched AACT, we set out to find a differentiated business primed for commercial growth and well-positioned to enter the public markets,” said Allyson Satin, Chief Operating Officer of AACT and Partner at Ares Management Corporation (“ Ares ”). “Kodiak has distinguished itself through its innovative technology, which is already integrated into customer fleets and utilized for daily, revenue-generating driverless freight operations. We are confident in Don and his team as they continue to execute on their strategy to scale as a public company, improve the safety and efficiency of the freight industry and create long-term value for investors. On behalf of AACT and Ares, I want to congratulate the entire Kodiak organization, and we look forward to our continued partnership.”

By accessing the public markets through its combination with AACT, the Company is well-positioned to scale its commercialization of the Kodiak Driver. The Company is leveraging both public capital and strategic investor alignment to capture a share of the estimated $4+ trillion global freight market. Kodiak has partnered with Roush Industries, Inc., a leading vehicle upfitter, to scale its production of autonomous trucks equipped with the Kodiak Driver. Roush delivered its first Kodiak Driver-powered truck in August 2025.

The Kodiak Driver combines advanced AI-powered software with a modular hardware system designed to integrate seamlessly into customers’ existing fleets. The platform delivers scalable, safe, and efficient autonomous trucking by leveraging learnings from millions of real-world miles across every Kodiak Driver-powered vehicle, ensuring that advancements made by one truck benefit the entire fleet. Kodiak offers its technology through a Driver-as-a-Service model, in which customers pay a per-mile or per-vehicle licensing fee to access driverless operations and ongoing support.

Investor Celebration and Bell-Ringing Ceremony

To celebrate its expected public market debut on September 25, 2025, Kodiak will display a Kodiak Driver-powered truck in Times Square, and ring the Nasdaq opening bell at 9:30 a.m. ET. Executives, board members, and key investors will gather to mark this milestone. The ceremony can be streamed live and replayed on the Nasdaq website at https://www.nasdaq.com/marketsite/bell-ringing-ceremony .

[TITLE]Oracle stock rises as White House names software giant in TikTok deal; company announces CEO shake-up:
[TEXT]
Oracle (ORCL) stock rose more than 6% Monday as the White House confirmed that the software giant is part of a consortium of investors that will control TikTok's US operations. The company also separately announced a CEO shake-up.

A senior White House official on Monday morning confirmed the details of the TikTok deal, which will move the social media app's US operations into a new joint venture based in the United States and controlled by American investors, who will have a majority of the new company's ownership stake and of its board seats.

Oracle and Venture Private Equity firm Silver Lake are set to lead the new venture, with China-based tech giant ByteDance holding a less than 20% equity stake.

The venture will receive a copy of TikTok's valuable content recommendation algorithm, which will be "fully inspected" and "retrained" by Oracle — the group's security provider — on US user data. The algorithm will be regularly inspected by US government officials.

"We feel [this] meets every security requirement that we need for the algorithm to make sure it's behaving appropriately," a senior White House official said.

Trump is set to sign an executive order later this week declaring that the terms of the new TikTok agreement meet America's national security needs. The president has touted the deal repeatedly and said Sunday that the final list of investors would be "really great people, very prominent people."

TikTok, the short-form video app owned by ByteDance, faced a US ban due to national security concerns unless it divested its ownership to a US- or US-allied country by Dec. 16. Congress passed a law effectively banning TikTok in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, and Trump promised to "save" the app on his campaign trail despite originally trying to ban TikTok in his first term. The US president extended the deadline for TikTok to divest its ownership multiple times as the app featured in high-stakes trade talks between the US and China.

The White House official said the US government has no plans to take equity, a "golden share," or a board seat — as it has with US Steel and Intel — though it might charge a fee for facilitating the deal.

Multiple outlets had reported previously that Oracle would be part of a consortium of investors that would control TikTok's US operations.

Analysts have told Yahoo Finance that Oracle's involvement in such a deal is seen as a positive for the software company because it would expand its partnership with TikTok. Oracle has worked with TikTok to store the app's American user data since 2022, and that ongoing deal accounted for 5% of the revenue seen by its booming cloud business, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), in its 2025 fiscal year, Morningstar analyst Luke Yang estimated.

[TITLE]FCC Threats Against Jimmy Kimmel Echo a Century of Speech Control:
[TEXT]
Days after the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Jimmy Kimmel joked on his show that the "MAGA gang [was] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it." This prompted Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr to threaten network broadcasting licenses, alleging that Kimmel's show violates "public interest, convenience or necessity," and to tell ABC that this could be resolved "the easy way or the hard way." The following day, ABC announced the indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!—a decision it reversed on Monday after public outcry.

Many conservatives, trying to remember where they put their keys and their beefs

[TITLE]Precision Ag Overlay to National Broadband Map Tough, But Might Be Worth It: Analysis:
[TEXT]
Last month, seven members of the House of Representatives introduced the “Data Broadband Reporting and Integration for Deployment in Geographically Essential Areas Act” (Data BRIDGE Act) aimed at, among other things, strengthening precision agriculture (precision ag).

The bill has a long title for a seemingly simple task: to update the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC’s) National Broadband Map (NBM) “in a manner that incorporates, as a layer of such map, data on the location of agricultural areas.” It is a short bill — with only one section containing any instruction for the FCC — and it leaves much to be defined.

“This bipartisan bill will bring high-speed broadband to the fields that feed America. Too often, cropland and pastures are left off the FCC’s broadband map, cutting farmers off from the precision ag technology they need to boost yields, cut costs, and stay competitive. This bill makes sure federal broadband dollars reach the acres where the work happens,” said the bill’s author, Representative Erin Houchin (R-IN), in a social media post.

What is precision ag? Why is it important? I’ve had at least some involvement with it since 2006. Precision ag enables water conversation, higher yields, reduced fuel and energy consumption, reduced fertilizers and pesticides, and a higher quality of life for our farmers. It enables so many good things for those who feed and clothe us. All these results depend on high-speed connections in some of the most rural parts of the United States.

What could be the benefits?

For policymakers: The map would be a powerful tool for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and Congress to identify “precision ag deserts” — areas of high agricultural importance with poor broadband connectivity. This would allow for strategic targeting of federal funds to close those gaps, boosting economic productivity and food security. It moves the conversation from general “rural broadband” to a targeted, mission-critical objective.

It moves the conversation from general “rural broadband” to a targeted, mission-critical objective. For broadband service providers (BSPs): A bit of a stretch in some cases, but the map might help BSPs build business cases. Instead of seeing a vaguely defined rural area with low population density, they could see a cluster of high-value agricultural operations that represent a source of potential revenue for enterprise-grade connectivity services.

A bit of a stretch in some cases, but the map might help BSPs build business cases. Instead of seeing a vaguely defined rural area with low population density, they could see a cluster of high-value agricultural operations that represent a source of potential revenue for enterprise-grade connectivity services. For smaller operations: Large farm operations may engage with fiber, fixed wireless, and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers to solve their connectivity needs, but small- and medium-sized farms might not have the same resources. For them, a clear map showing available services could be genuinely useful.

From my perspective as someone with 20 years in rural telecommunications and one who has experience with building many broadband maps, the Data BRIDGE Act is a well-intentioned piece of legislation that runs into significant practical and definitional challenges. It needs a little more consideration before moving forward.

The Challenges

I don’t think we should assume that the FCC can neatly overlay publicly available USDA data onto its NBM. Let’s remember the years and expense it took for the Commission to build the NBM, which some say is still not accurate enough to fulfill its policymaking purposes.

NBM’s Location Fabric is a database of addresses and other geo locations where there are broadband serviceable buildings. These are all geo-located points, largely on rooftops. Fields are widely spread and connectivity for example might be needed at irrigation pivots, gates, wells, generators, livestock, and other locations. This is a different level of data.

USDA collects information, such as data through the National Agricultural Statistics Service, primarily for statistical and economic analysis. It does not match well with the NBM Fabric’s precise geospatial mapping. USDA often aggregates at the county level to protect individual farm privacy and to show trends (e.g., “X county produced Y bushels of corn”). It lacks the structure-level granularity required for a meaningful overlay on the NBM’s Fabric and accurate land use information.

Data from the Farm Service Agency and other USDA divisions have more precise location data, but USDA considers it sensitive information and does not make it readily available for public mapping projects. Releasing specific farm boundaries and equipment locations would violate individual farmers’ privacy and create a major political and logistical hurdle. Farmers deal with theft and exposing where critical assets are could lead to more.

Might we find some of the needed data within NBM itself without additional work? No. Locations are classified in the Fabric where feasible by the following codes:

2–Land

3–Business

4–Unknown

5–Agriculture

6–Community

7–Industrial

8–Recreation

9–Utility

10–Mixed use

11–Transportation

12–Water

13–Communications

14–ROW

15–Wireless

0–Other

Land use is not always populated and there are no geo points or codes for some critical inputs for precision ag.

An analyst could attempt to infer this by cross-referencing Fabric locations with land use or zoning data, but this would be highly prone to error:

Many farmhouses are also primary residences.

Many rural businesses are on land zoned for agriculture.

Agricultural land is fundamentally different. It’s vast, amorphous, and farmers might change the way they use it seasonally. Mapping broadband demand in fields is a different GIS challenge than mapping a farmhouse. The NBM process demonstrated how hard it is to accurately place discrete points on a map; mapping millions of complex polygons tracking agricultural activity and expected internet demand would be an order of magnitude that is more difficult and costly.
