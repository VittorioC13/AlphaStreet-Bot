[TITLE]Stocks skid as fresh trade barbs knock wind out of rally:
[TEXT]
By Gregor Stuart Hunter

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Asian stocks tumbled on Tuesday, dogged by growing doubts over whether China and the U.S. could strike a tariff deal when the world's two largest economies meet later this month amid revived tensions over trade.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed early gains to fall 1.2% as S&P 500 futures slid 0.6%. The Nikkei stock index fell as much as 3%.

"Both Washington and Beijing are posturing before the November summit - escalate to de-escalate," said Marc Velan, head of investments at Lucerne Asset Management in Singapore. "Neither can afford a trade war heading into U.S. mid-terms."

Markets had earlier joined the rebound from Monday's cash session after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump remains on track to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in late October. But he added fuel to the fire in an interview in the Financial Times where he accused Beijing of trying to damage the global economy.

As negotiations between the U.S. and China intensify, the two nations will from today begin charging port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil.

Wall Street's main indexes had ended as much as 2.2% higher on Monday, led by chipmakers, after Trump struck a more conciliatory tone on trade tensions with China, reversing some of the panic from Friday when Trump announced 100% tariffs on China.

Citi analysts said they do not expect an escalation of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.

"The reason is not so much the reassuring President Trump tweet over the weekend, but the fact that China may be the only country with bargaining power, where the U.S. may have to be more flexible in its negotiation stance," Citi wrote.

But a spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said on Tuesday the U.S. cannot seek talks while also making threats, keeping markets on edge over the chances for a broader trade deal.

Beijing announced sanctions on Tuesday against five U.S.-linked subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean.

After early gains in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 2%, while in the mainland, the CSI 300 gauge of blue-chip Chinese stocks slipped 1.3%.

Asian chipmakers veered sharply between gains and losses. TSMC clung to gains after OpenAI said it has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors.

South Korea's Kospi index erased early gains, dragged by the broader selloff. The market had rallied at the start of the session, helped by Samsung Electronics', which projected a better-than-expected 32% rise in third-quarter profit, although the tech giant lost 1.7% as the day progressed.

Asian markets sank Monday after US President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China by threatening last week to impose 100 percent tariffs on goods from the country.

However, the losses were tempered slightly by a more conciliatory tone on Sunday when Trump described Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping as “respected”.

Trump wrote on social media Friday that he would impose an additional 100 percent tariff on China and threatened to cancel a summit with Xi, citing Beijing’s export curbs on rare earth minerals used in a range of goods including smartphones, electric vehicles and military hardware.

The extra US levies, plus export controls on “any and all critical software” would come into effect from November 1 in retaliation for what he called Beijing’s “extraordinarily aggressive” moves.

“There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive’,” he said.

Chinese products currently face US tariffs of 30 percent, while Beijing’s retaliatory tolls are currently at 10 percent.

The outburst sent Wall Street into a spiral, with the Nasdaq losing more than three percent, and came as investors were already on edge over a recent tech-led surge that has stoked fears of a stock bubble.

However, investors took a little heart from a post Sunday in which he said “The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” and added that “respected President Xi (Jinping)… doesn’t want Depression for his country.”

Beijing, in turn, accused Washington of acting unfairly, and the Ministry of Commerce on Sunday called the threat a “typical example of ‘double standards'”.

“Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right approach to engaging with China,” it said in an online statement.

The announcement came after months of fragile peace between the economic superpowers as they looked to reach a full trade deal after Trump’s tariff bombshell in April that saw the two sides ramp up tit-for-tat levies to eye-watering levels.

Markets across Asia sank into the red, with Hong Kong shedding more than two percent and Shanghai more than one percent. Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Taipei and Manila were also well down.

Still, Trump’s latest comments provided a little support, with US futures soaring more than one percent.

Gold, a safe-haven asset in times of turmoil and uncertainty, continued its rise, touching another record of $4,060.

There was also a healthy bounce for oil, which tanked Friday on Trump’s remarks, which compounded selling of the commodity owing to the Israel-Hamas peace deal that soothed worries

India’s benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty traded higher on Tuesday, led by gains in IT shares after HCLTech posted upbeat quarterly results, while easing retail inflation strengthened expectations of a potential rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India in December.The S&P BSE Sensex climbed 210.50 points, or 0.26%, to open at 82,537.55, while the NSE Nifty 50 advanced 57.30 points, or 0.23%, to start at 25,284.65.On the 30-share Sensex, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, Tata Steel, Infosys, and Reliance Industries led the gains, rising between 0.8% and 2%.Across sectors, IT stocks outperformed, with the Nifty IT index up 0.9%. Shares of HCLTech advanced 1.6% after the nation’s third-largest software exporter reaffirmed its full-year revenue growth guidance of 3%–5% and topped second-quarter revenue estimates.Broader markets also edged higher, with the smallcap and midcap indexes gaining 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.Meanwhile, India’s retail inflation fell to an eight-year low of 1.54% in September, government data showed Monday, as food prices cooled. The sharp moderation has bolstered expectations of a potential rate cut when the Reserve Bank of India meets in December.Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the market trends over the past year highlight a clear shift in investor preference. “A significant takeaway from the last one year market performance is the outperformance of large caps (Nifty up by 1.05%) and the underperformance of smallcaps (Nifty Smallcap index down by 4.77%),” he said, adding that public sector banks also stood out. “Equally significant is the outperformance of PSU banks (Nifty PSU Bank index up by 16.77%) and the huge underperformance of IT (Nifty IT down by 16.5%).”He noted that valuations have been a key driver behind these divergences. According to Vijayakumar, “IT stocks, particularly the large caps, are viewed as overvalued by the market since they are facing many headwinds and some strong structural issues. On the other hand, PSU stocks have been trading at very low valuations despite decent growth and robust balance sheets. This anomaly in valuations has been corrected by the market.”Vijayakumar expects this trend to persist but added that “in growth stocks like digital companies and renewable energy, their long-term growth potential will continue to attract investment despite high valuations.”“With Muhurat trading approaching,” he said, “there is room for a mild rally.”Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday as optimism over U.S.-China trade talks later this month was tempered by doubts about a durable deal.Early gains in MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index outside Japan and S&P 500 futures faded after initial rebounds following U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments that President Donald Trump remains on track to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.Trade tensions escalated as both nations began imposing port fees on ocean shipping firms, raising costs on global cargo routes.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.4%, while China’s CSI 300 dipped 0.1%. Taiwan led gains with a 0.8% jump as TSMC hit a record after OpenAI partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house AI chips. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.6% after Samsung projected a 32% jump in third-quarter operating profit, beating estimates. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1.2% as markets reopened after a holiday, with the dollar steady at 152.31 yen.Gold climbed 1.1% to $4,155.90 an ounce, extending record gains, while Bitcoin fell 1.9% to $113,629.29 and Ether slipped 3% to $4,161.79.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned net sellers on October 13 after four consecutive days of buying, offloading equities worth just over Rs 240 crore. Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), in contrast, remained net buyers, investing Rs 2,333.42 crore.MORE TO COME...

[TITLE]CNBC Daily Open: It's AI's world and the Fed's just living in it:
[TEXT]
Traders work, as a screen broadcasts a news conference by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the Fed rate announcement, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Sept. 17, 2025.

Investors barely flinched Wednesday, despite the release of the Fed minutes and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.

Discussions on rate cuts and shutdowns seemed to be mere background noise compared to the real force moving markets now, namely, artificial intelligence.

AI stocks such as Nvidia are now masters of the market narrative, driving record highs across the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

On the flip side, Oracle became the proverbial straw that broke the S&P500's seven-day winning streak Tuesday stateside.

But, to paraphrase Spider-Man, with great power, comes great scrutiny. The Bank of England warned that valuations appear "stretched," particularly for AI companies, adding that equity markets could be particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.

For now, Wall Street remains in hyperdrive, fueled by AI's promise and the hope that the Fed will keep cutting rates.

Investors may soon need to reckon with whether this AI-fueled rally is built on solid ground or it's swinging toward a cliff.
