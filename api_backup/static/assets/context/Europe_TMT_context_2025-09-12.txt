[TITLE]Paris is a Knowledge Leader but France as a Nation Lags Behind:
[TEXT]
Paris hosts some of the world´s leading technology companies, has several of the leading technological universities and is the European region with highest total number of knowledge intensive jobs. France as a country however lags as a knowledge economy, with limited progress outside the capital region.

Together with London and Zurich, Paris is one of the three European cities which has the highest concentration of world´s 500 leading deep tech companies. It is strong in the areas of photonics, clean energy, biotechnology and quantum computing.

Those regions which tend to have a high share of world leading technology firms, are usually also where some of the highest-ranking technological universities of the world are found. France hosts four out of the world´s QS World University Rankings top 100 leading institutes in engineering and technology. These are Institute Polytechnique de Paris, Université Paris-Saclay, Université PSL and Sorbonne University.

The common theme of the four leading universities is that they are all found in the French capital region. Likewise, while some of the leading technological companies of France are found outside Paris, in Rennes and Lille, most are focused to the capital region.

In Paris 14.4 percent of the adult population is employed in brain business jobs, a term for employment in knowledge-intensive firms in tech, information and communications technology, advanced services, and creative professions. This is not quite as high as leaders Bratislava and Prague that have 24.5 and 23.8 percent of their adults in brain business jobs, but is still one of the highest levels in Europe. However, in total numbers Bratislava only has 107,600 brain business jobs, while Prague has 190,300. Paris is the only European region with more than one million adults employed in highly knowledge intensive jobs. There are nearly twice as many brain business jobs in total in Paris than in Madrid.

Ranking and Total Number Brain Business Jobs 1 Paris 1,066,200 2 Madrid 586,000 3 Lombardia 550,000 4 Oberbayern 453,200 5 Cataluña 365,800 6 Warsaw 344,900 7 Berlin 343,600 8 Darmstadt 297,900 9 Bucharest 284,200 10 Dublin 280,700

As a country, France however lags behind in knowledge. In Switzerland 1.56 of the world’s leading 500 deep tech companies exist per million adults. The same share is 0.79 in the Netherlands and the UK, 0.61 in Sweden, and 0.58 in Ireland. In France there are merely 0.17 world leading deep tech 500 companies per million adults, above Spain (0.13) and twice that of Italy (0.08) but not amongst the European top.

In total 6.4 percent of the adult population in France is employed in highly knowledge intensive jobs. This is quite far from the leaders Switzerland and Ireland (11.2 percent) as well as Sweden (10.3 percent).

Even in Southern Europe, Malta (9.4 percent) and Cyprus (9.0) percent have a significant lead in knowledge intensity to France. Portugal (7.8 percent) likewise has a significantly higher share of its population in knowledge intensive jobs.

Paris has a strong performance, since it combines a very large size with relatively high knowledge density. Yet France as a whole has limited knowledge intensive jobs, world leading technology companies and world leading universities in technology and mathematics outside of the capital region.

France has strong opportunities to be Europe’s leading knowledge intensive hub, but high taxes and correspondingly high government expenditure are crowding out private sector growth. Strengthening education and implementing more favorable taxation and business policy, is needed for France as a whole to grow as a knowledge intensive region. For Paris itself, a challenge is to boost growth of new housing, since if growing knowledge intensive companies find it difficult to find housing for their staff, it gives them another reason on top of taxation and regulation to locate to a competing knowledge intensive region, such as the capital regions of Central European nations.

[TITLE]SEC Chairman Paul Atkins Says ‘Crypto’s Time Has Come’:
[TEXT]
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins said Wednesday (Sept. 9) that “crypto’s time has come.”

In a speech delivered at the inaugural OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets in Paris, Atkins said that while the SEC had set policy by “ad hoc enforcement actions” in the past, it will now provide “clear, predictable rules of the road.”

Atkins pointed to the SEC’s Project Crypto and said one of its priorities is to provide certainty around the security status of crypto assets.

“Most crypto tokens are not securities, and we will draw the lines clearly,” Atkins said in his speech. “We must ensure that entrepreneurs can raise capital on-chain without endless legal uncertainty. And we must allow for ‘super-app’ trading platform innovation that increases choice for market participants.”

Atkins added that there should be a single regulatory umbrella for the trading, lending and staking that may be offered by platforms.

During his speech, Atkins also addressed agentic finance, in which artificial intelligence agents execute trades, allocate capital and manage risk while adhering to securities law compliance.

These systems could deliver “immense” benefits such as faster markets, lower costs and broader access to strategies, Atkins said.

The government’s role in this technology is to maintain “commonsense guardrails” while eliminating “regulatory obstructions,” he said.

“On-chain capital markets and agentic finance are on the horizon, and the world is watching,” Atkins said. “The choice before us is simple yet profound: either America steps forward with confidence and conviction, or others will. I choose leadership, freedom and growth — for our markets, for our economy, and for the next generation.”

Atkins announced the launch of Project Crypto on July 31, saying this SEC-wide initiative aims to modernize securities rules and regulations to enable financial markets in the U.S. to move on-chain.

On Sept. 2, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a joint statement that SEC- and CFTC-registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot crypto asset products.

Three days later, on Sept. 5, the two regulators said that they aim to harmonize their regulations to provide markets with clarity and bolster the strength of America’s capital markets.

[TITLE]‘Crypto’s Time Has Come,’ Says SEC Chair Paul Atkins Amid Market Rally:
[TEXT]

US SEC Chair Paul Atkins has declared that digital assets are poised for mainstream adoption, sending cryptocurrency prices on a rally. Atkins disclosed that the US has its eyes on becoming the global crypto capital, but will remain open to collaboration with international counterparts.

Crypto Eyes Mainstream Adoption With US Leading The Charge

Paul Atkins, US SEC Chair, has stated that the window for cryptocurrencies to record mainstream adoption is open after years of a brutal regulatory witchhunt. Atkins made the declaration in a keynote address at the Inaugural OECD roundtable on global financial markets in France.

According to Atkins, the US SEC has abandoned its previous stance against the cryptocurrency industry, characterized by a shift from regulation to enforcement. The SEC Chair noted that the last direction policy drove talent and capital out of the US, with remaining firms splurging millions to build legal defenses.

“An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come,” said Paul Atkins, quoting Victor Hugo. “And today, ladies and gentlemen, we must admit that: crypto’s time has come.”

Going forward, Atkins disclosed that the SEC will pursue the development of “clear and predictable” rules for digital asset service providers. Already, the SEC has declared that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, with Atkins hinting that the SEC will “draw the lines clearly” for a distinction.

Armed with clear rules, Atkins noted that the SEC will support on-chain capital raises without legal and regulatory bottlenecks. Furthermore, the US SEC Chair seized the moment to reiterate his intention to allow for a super app platform offering trading, lending, and staking functionality for users.

“Investors, advisers, and broker-dealers should have freedom to choose among multiple custody solutions as well,” added Atkins.

While the US is mulling the prospects of becoming the world’s crypto capital, Atkins told attendees at the roundtable that the superpower is open to collaborating on digital asset regulation with European counterparts. Already, the US Digital Asset Markets considers the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) as a comprehensive regulatory playbook for virtual currencies.

To wrap up his keynote address, Atkins confirmed that the US is eyeing a merger between artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. For Atkins, the interoperability between on-chain capital and agentic finance will enable faster markets and lower costs for sector players, positioning the US at the forefront of global regulations.

[TITLE]Smart glasses and AI filter apps among new tech to transform the mental health of millions:
[TEXT]
Cutting-edge extended reality backed to deliver real-time mental health support for people across the UK, including those with severe depression and anxiety

17 projects supported by share of £3.6 million could treat people in every corner of the UK, helping reduce costs to the NHS and resource pressure with real-time support, turbocharging our Plan for Change

Smart glasses technology being developed by CrossSense in London shows how AI can help those suffering with severe depression to navigate daily challenges

Smart glasses which help people struggling with severe depression to complete everyday tasks and AI filter apps making therapy for debilitating anxiety less daunting are among the cutting-edge tech projects being backed to deliver real-time mental health support across the UK, Science Minister Lord Vallance has announced today (Thursday 11 September).

With a 40% rise in people receiving mental health support from the NHS in England alone since before the pandemic, Innovate UK is supporting 17 businesses across the UK to take low-cost innovations to the next level to improve lives up and down the country, for the most in need, including in remote or underserved areas.

Developments include light-weight smart glasses which use AI to address the impact illnesses like depression, anxiety and psychosis can have on memory loss, by recognising household objects and offering advice on a connected app.

Technology led by CrossSense helps to reframe negative thoughts while offering step-by-step instructions for carrying out daily tasks, such as keeping vulnerable users safe from harm with prompts like advice to stay away from boiling water on the hob. It adapts to the wearer’s needs over time and helps to prevent cognitive decline, including dementia, so complex mental health conditions are not an unnecessary barrier to fulfilled and independent lives.

Tech will be built and trialled over the next year to 18 months - following £3.6 million of support from Innovate UK’s Mindset extended reality ( XR ) for digital mental health programme. This investment is part of the government’s commitment to protecting record funding for research and development, as outlined in the Autumn Budget 2024, which recognises that capitalising on the UK’s excellence in science and innovation is essential to seize the opportunities of AI , drive economic growth, and support our NHS.

Science Minister, Lord Vallance, said:

These projects are shining examples of how innovation can transform people’s quality of life, by helping those with severe mental health conditions to take on everyday tasks that can otherwise feel impossible. From smart glasses helping those with debilitating depression to navigate through the day to games helping children to build their social skills, we are supporting teams across the UK to build cutting-edge tech that unlocks opportunity, supports the NHS and grows our economy.

Minister for Mental Health, Baroness Merron, said:

Technology is transforming healthcare and we are putting patients at the heart of this revolution. New tools such as smart glasses and AI filter apps show how we’re backing innovations to reach people with mental health conditions - especially in communities that often get left behind. By embracing new tech, we’re improving lives and reducing pressure on the NHS to make healthcare fit for the future, as part of our Plan for Change.

These solutions aim to treat more people, particularly those with complex needs including those in remote or underserved areas, through scalable, immersive care. They also offer further advantages in terms of reduced costs and resource pressure with real-time support; and improved outcomes through personalised, engaging therapeutic experiences.

Other work

Play Well for Life, partnering with the University of the West of England, developing an augmented reality board game, co-produced by students, psychologists and teachers to help get children back into a learning environment where they can thrive. As a group-based game that can be played remotely or in-person it helps children build their communication and social skills by visiting 4 different ‘worlds’ to help them make and keep friends, solve problems and handle emotions, reducing anxiety as the game goes on and in time building confidence.

In Northern Ireland, a project led by Life Process Program is developing a customisable virtual coach for individuals struggling with substance abuse in an interactive environment that mimics real-life therapy sessions, and in West Yorkshire EcoGPX is linking extended reality with physical activities to connect people with nature and support adults living with generalised anxiety.

A world-first app is combining AI with augmented reality to help young people create therapeutic visual content. The work by Photography Based Therapeutics, working with the University of Surrey, will enable young people to edit photographs using familiar AR filter tools, removing elements that cause distress and adding calming features or text overlays. These personalised images can then be used as virtual backgrounds during remote therapy sessions or as part of a visual diary to help therapists understand how patients are feeling

[TITLE]Here Are the Artists Who Have Ditched Spotify Over Its CEO’s Military Tech Ties:
[TEXT]
Over the past few months, a groundswell of indie artists have chosen to cut ties with Spotify in protest of CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek’s ties to the defense company Helsing.

Well-known indie acts like Deerhoof and Xiu Xiu have led the exodus, while Australian psych rockers King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are arguably the biggest band to remove their music from the streaming service. While their departures may represent a drop in the bucket that is Spotify’s music offerings, their decisions appear to be rooted in anti-war principles and the hope that their actions could spark a larger movement.

As King Gizzard wrote when they announced their decision to leave back in July, “Can we put pressure on these Dr. Evil tech bros to do better?”

Spotify has faced plenty of protests over the years, with artists declining to make their music available for a variety of reasons. Early on, before Spotify had fully become the dominant force in music that it is now, many artists criticized the streaming royalty model, with Taylor Swift famously pulling her music in 2014 and saying at the time, “I’m not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment that I don’t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music.”

Spotify’s payout system has continued to face steep criticism over the years, especially as it’s become clear that the royalty pool model tends to most benefit the most popular artists in the world, like Swift. This issue was also frequently cited as artists discussed why they are now leaving the service.

But in recent years, most artists have chosen to leave Spotify for more political and cultural reasons. In 2022, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell both removed their music from Spotify in protest of the $250 million podcasting deal the company signed with Joe Rogan. (Both Young and Mitchell wound up putting their music back on Spotify a few years later.)

As for Ek’s ties to Helsing — a German defense tech company with a particular focus on artificial intelligence — the CEO previously garnered criticism after his venture capital firm Prima Materials invested more than $100 million into the start-up in 2021. This new wave of protests, though, was sparked by the news earlier this summer that Ek was now the Chairman of Helsing; that Prima Materials had raised over $700 million for the company; and that Helsing’s focus on defense software had expanded to manufacturing drones, aircraft, and submarines. Editor’s picks

In an interview with The Financial Times in June, Ek rebuffed any criticism he might face over his ties to Helsing. “Personally, I’m not concerned

[TITLE]Klarna made a solid debut on the New York Stock Exchange with shares up 15% in first day of trading:
[TEXT]
Klarna made a solid debut on the New York Stock Exchange, with shares of the Swedish buy now, pay later company rising nearly 15%, the latest in a run of high-profile initial public offerings this year.

Klarna stock opened at $52 a share Wednesday, a 30% premium to the company’s $40 pricing. It took roughly three-and-a-half hours for the specialists on the floor of the NYSE to manually price the first batch of trades of the company. The shares rose as high as $57 before losing some momentum and ending at $45.82, up 14.6%.

More than 34 million shares worth approximately $1.37 billion were sold to investors, making it the largest IPO this year, according to Renaissance Capital. That’s notable because 2025 has been one of the busier years for companies going public.

Other notable IPOs this year include the design software company Figma and Circle Internet Group, which issues the USDC stablecoin. Investors are also looking forward to the expected market debuts of the ticket exchange StubHub and the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, which is majority owned by the Winklevoss twins.

Founded in 2005 as a payments company, Klarna entered the U.S. buy-now-pay-later market in 2015 in partnership with department store operator Macy’s. Since then, Klarna has expanded to hundreds of thousands of merchants and embedded itself in internet browsers and digital wallets as an alternative to credit cards. The company recently announced a partnership with Walmart.

The company will trade under the symbol “KLAR.” While Klarna was founded in Sweden and is a popular payment service in Europe, company executives said they made the decision to go public in the U.S. as a signal that Klarna’s future growth opportunities lay with the American shopper.

“It’s the largest consumer market in the world, and it’s the biggest credit card market in the world. It’s a tremendous opportunity, from our perspective,” said CEO and co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the IPO.

Over the years and in multiple interviews, Siemiatkowski has made it clear that Klarna wants to steal away customers from the big credit card companies and sees credit cards as a high-interest, exploitative product that consumers rarely use correctly.

Klarna’s most popular product is what’s known as a “pay-in-4” plan, where a customer can split a purchase into four payments spread over six weeks. The company also offers a longer-term payment plan where it charges interest. The business model has caught on globally, particularly among consumers who are reluctant to use credit cards. The company said 111 million consumers worldwide have used Klarna.

Klarna and other buy-now-pay-later companies have attracted increased public interest in recent years as the business model has caught on. State and federal regulators, as well as consumer groups, have expressed some degree of worry that consumers may overextend themselves financially on buy-now-pay-later loans just as much as they do with credit cards.

Siemiatkowski says the company is actively monitoring how consumers use their products, and the average balance of Klarna user is less than $100. Because the company issues loans that are six weeks or less, Klarna argues it can more easily adjust its underwriting standard depending on economic conditions.

With Klarna going public, its co-founders are now billionaires. At Klarna’s IPO price of $40, Siemiatkowski’s 7% stake in the company is worth around $1 billion, while Victor Jacobsson, who left the company in 2012, owns an 8.4% stake in the company now worth $1.3 billion. Siemiatkowski said he did not selling shares as part of the IPO.

But with Klarna’s 20-year-long incubation period before going public, and several fundraising rounds, major parts of Silicon Valley are walking with a handsome return for their patience. Sequoia Capital, the storied venture capital firm that was an early backer in the company, has accumulated a 21% ownership in Klarna worth roughly $3.15 billion. Silver Lake, another major VC firm, owns roughly 4.5% of the company.

Klarna reported second-quarter revenue of $823 million in August before going public and had an adjusted profit of $29 million. The delinquency rate on Klarna’s “pay-in-4” loans is 0.89% and on its longer-term loans for bigger purchases, the delinquency rate is 2.23%. Those figures are below the average 30-day delinquency rates on a credit card.

Klarna will now be the second-largest buy-now-pay-later company by market capitalization behind Affirm. Shares of Affirm have surged more than 40% so far this year, putting the value of the company around $28 billion, helped by a belief among investors that buy-now-pay-later companies may take away market share from traditional banks and credit cards. Affirm fell slightly Wednesday.

Klarna’s primary underwriters for the IPO were JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.

Two decades after its founding, Klarna has gone public, and its investors are finally seeing a windfall.

The Swedish "buy now, pay later" company listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Its stock popped 30% on its debut, jumping above its $40-per-share IPO price to $52 a share.

That IPO price gave Klarna a $15.1 billion valuation and netted Klarna $1.37 billion. Per Pitchbook, Klarna had raised $3.85 billion in its history before the public listing.

Klarna's IPO has been a long time coming. Founded in 2005, the consumer payments company first hinted at an IPO in 2019, telling Bloomberg it could go public in the next one to two years. Klarna had reportedly planned to go public earlier this year, but delayed its IPO efforts after Trump's Liberation Day tariffs roiled the markets.

It's the first major IPO of the fall and is expected to be one of many companies to take the public market plunge before the end of the year. Gemini Space Station, a crypto exchange backed by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, is expected to go public later this week, and 25-year-old ticket marketplace StubHub launched its IPO roadshow Monday.

Klarna's IPO price represents a major markdown from its peak valuation, however. The company raised $639 million in 2021 at a $45.6 billion valuation, but slashed its valuation a stunning 85% to $6.7 billion the next year as the fintech sector stumbled on rising interest rates and worsening investor sentiment.

Klarna chairperson and former Sequoia Capital Michael Moritz criticized the company's other investors at the time.

"The shift in Klarna's valuation is entirely due to investors suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years. The irony is that Klarna's business, its position in various markets, and its popularity with consumers and merchants are all stronger than at any time since Sequoia first invested in 2010," Moritz said in a

[TITLE]The Dutch Connection: French AI Leader Gets Backing from European Tech Giant ASML:
[TEXT]
French AI leader Mistral isn’t settling for being le grand fromage at home. It aims to be the best on earth. That means developing AI models and data centers that can go toe to toe with the best the US and Asia have on offer.

On Tuesday, the company received key backing from a continental ally. Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML opened its wallet — or portemonnee, a word borrowed from the French porte-monnaie — to become Mistral’s largest shareholder.

Which Way the Mistral Blows

Paris-based Mistral is a relative newbie in the AI world, founded just two years ago; by comparison, OpenAI, at 10 years old, is practically ready for senior citizen discounts. The maker of the chatbot Le Chat has been hailed by policymakers, including French President Emmanuel Macron, as key to Europe’s ambitions of building its own tech bulwark to fend off dominant US and Asian competition. Named after a famously strong wind in southern France, Mistral is also building data centers to establish European competition against major US cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, making it a strategic bet on two fronts.

Enter ASML, one of Europe’s undisputed tech giants. Its $1.5 billion, 11% stake in the French startup announced Tuesday is a breakthrough moment in continental synergy. The fresh cash fuels Mistral’s efforts to develop new models and data centers, and ASML could hardly be a better-positioned partner. The Dutch giant has a de facto monopoly on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines essential to making advanced semiconductors. This has placed it at the heart of the global AI boom, furthering its lucrative symbiotic relationship with chip giants like Nvidia. On Tuesday, its $316 billion market cap made it the most valuable company in the European Union, which is something Mistral can look up to:

ASML’s stake, part of a total $2 billion round, values the French company at roughly $14 billion. That number underscores how far Mistral trails its AI competition in Silicon Valley: Anthropic closed a $13 billion funding round with a $183 billion valuation last week, while OpenAI is planning a secondary sale at a $500 billion valuation.

Mistral has another unique backer in Macron, who has encouraged blue chip firms to do business with Mistral and positioned the company as a key beneficiary of a €109 billion ($127 billion) national AI plan. France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance is also among its backers, though Mistral has no shortage of prominent international investors, among them Lightspeed Ventures, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia and Microsoft.

Double Dutch: And speaking of European companies with Microsoft ties, the US tech giant reached across the Atlantic on Monday to do business with another Netherlands-based tech firm. Nebius is a new arrival to Amsterdam, having split from Russia’s Google-equivalent Yandex last year. It ditched the search engine business of its former Russian parent to focus on AI infrastructure and computing capacity, something Microsoft has a growing need for as it builds out new products. Nebius will make at least $17.4 billion, and up to $19.4 billion, for providing Microsoft with dedicated AI computing capacity from a new data center being built not in picturesque Amsterdam or elegant Paris, but the land of gardens itself … New Jersey.

LONDON -- ASML, a leading Dutch maker of chipmaking gear, is investing 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) into French artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI, the two said on Tuesday, announcing a partnership between two of Europe's top technology companies.

ASML Holding, based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, holds an important role in the global tech industry because it makes equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, including the most advanced microchips used for cutting-edge AI systems.

Mistral was founded two years ago in Paris by former researchers at Google DeepMind and Meta Platforms and quickly became a European tech darling.

The partnership underscores Europe's efforts to reduce exposure to American technology. President Donald Trump's increasingly hostile attitude to European Union tech regulations has fueled debate about whether the continent is too dependent on services provided by U.S. tech companies such as cloud computing and mobile operating systems.

Mistral makes the Le Chat chatbot but it has struggled to keep up with American AI companies like ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, and Chinese rivals like DeepSeek.

ASML's chipmaking equipment can cost hundreds of millions of dollars but the U.S. government has blocked it from selling its most advanced machines to China.

The deal gives ASML an 11% stake in Mistral, and values the startup at about 11.7 billion euros. The 1.3 billion euro investment is part of a larger funding round worth 1.7 billion euros, which also involves venture capital firms and chipmaker Nvidia.

[TITLE]How local advertisers are breaking through in a fragmented media landscape:
[TEXT]
Marketers have reached an inflection point with media fragmentation, with 54% of advertisers citing it as their top challenge according to research by Amazon Ads. This fragmentation creates friction, especially for advertisers with a regional focus and limited resources.

The infinite options available — there are more than 32,200 linear channels and 89 unique streaming sources in the U.S. alone — can often feel more like a challenge and less like an opportunity. But by simplifying media planning and buying, leveraging automation and unifying data and audiences across platforms, local advertisers are deriving more value from their campaigns and driving better business outcomes — vital in an environment in which marketers everywhere are forced to do more with less.

While fragmentation continues to challenge local advertisers, the industry is rallying around smarter, more scalable solutions — a theme that continues to come through strongly in conversations, including at Cannes Lions. Much of the discourse is centered on channels that are especially relevant to local advertisers, including streaming video and audio.

The introduction of a “red tape challenge” across Government to significantly reduce regulation for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is among the priority actions identified in a major new report designed to boost the State’s competitiveness.

The Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity, which was launched on Wednesday by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Simon Harris, contains 85 actions for enhancing competitiveness, with 26 of these identified as priority.

Each action has been assigned to a Government department or agency which will have responsibility for its delivery within a specified time period. Implementation will be overseen by a senior officials group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.

The report says the “red tape challenge”, which is marked priority, is aimed at “simplifying and reducing” administrative burdens for SMEs by 2029.

“This would include a review by each Government department to identify regulations to be removed or reduced without impacting on policy objectives and a public consultation to identify areas of high burden or where burden reduction could be launched,” it said.

Ibec executive director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien called the move “an important step forward”.

The report also commits to establishing an SME scaling fund next year to increase the available public capital for direct and indirect investment to support scaling, improve access and choice for founders, and encourage new private capital into the Irish market.

On housing, the report commits to “further embedding” supply and demand side initiatives at design and procurement stages, as well as “strengthening industry capability”, with a focus on digitalisation, sustainable practices, lean processes and the adoption of modern methods of construction.

Separately, the plan commits to providing the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission with new powers to impose administrative financial sanctions for breaches of consumer protection legislation.

Another priority is the establishment of a National Artificial Intelligence Office by 2026 to provide “a focal point” for the promotion and adoption of transparent and safe AI in Ireland, and to ensure that the State fully captures the opportunity AI presents.

The report notes the economic potential of encouraging the adoption of innovative technologies by the SME sector, and commits to examining options such as the introduction of new tax-based supports to encourage innovation by all firms.

It further commits to the development of a new agency called IP Ireland designed to position the State as a global hub for intellectual property, leveraging its strengths in technology, pharmaceuticals and creative industries.

On energy, it commits to bringing forward legislation to permit and implement a new “private wire framework” allowing the private sector to install electricity grids to enable the deployment of renewables and storage, and allowing “innovative energy park systems” to emerge in certain locations.

In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach is to co-ordinate a “range of actions” aimed at regulatory reform across Government departments, including the establishment of a central economic regulators forum out to 2027.

[TITLE]Almost 100 bodies in Ireland responsible for regulation and licensing, new competitiveness plan discloses:

There are approximately 95 national bodies with responsibility for regulation, licensing, data collection or standards, the Government’s new competitiveness plan has disclosed.

The plan highlights that the impact of planning and regulatory delays on energy infrastructure delivery in Ireland has been significant (including applications for grid connection).

The plan also points to the slow pace of planning, permitting and licensing systems in the manufacturing sector.

The Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity was published on Wednesday by Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke. It was originally scheduled to be produced later in the Coalition’s term but was brought forward to address issues for Ireland’s export economy, raised by the imposition of tariffs by the US.

The plan proposes 85 actions across six key areas. A central component is a “step change” in the funding for innovation and collaboration with higher institutions.

Other big actions are the creation of new structures on artificial intelligence (AI), intellectual property (IP) and start-ups, the reduction of red tape and less delays caused by regulatory bodies and by the courts.

The report finds that delays remain a feature of the Irish legal system. It points to the fact that 300 cases are awaiting delivery of a decision in the superior courts, 50 of which have been waiting for more than 12 months.

The plan recommends the full implementation of the recommendations of a 2020 report on the administration of civil justice, chaired by former president of the High Court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly.

It also said the reforms of judicial review contained in the Planning and Development Bill 2024 should be quickly implemented, as they will reduce delays and legal costs.

The 125-page document highlights the “significant investment gap” between multinational companies and Irish SMEs in research, development and innovation (RD & I).

“The under-investment in RD & I by SMEs in Ireland, and by the Government, raises questions
