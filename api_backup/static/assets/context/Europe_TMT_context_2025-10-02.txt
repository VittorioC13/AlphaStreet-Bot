The European Union is less than three months away from launching its carbon levy — the world's first large-scale border tax on carbon-intensive goods. The forthcoming step, which has the potential to completely transform global trade, comes as part of the bloc's efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions from heavy industries and promote cleaner production processes across the globe. Starting from Jan. 1 next year, the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will impose a cost on goods such as steel, fertilizers, cement, aluminum and hydrogen imported from outside the 27-nation bloc. Under the terms of the policy, importers bringing these goods into the EU will be required to purchase CBAM certificates to cover their associated emissions. The cost of these certificates is expected to be the same as the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) market price.

[TITLE]EU member states back calls for Chips Act changes:
[TEXT]
Momentum is gathering behind calls for a Chips Act 2.0 to strengthen Europe's competitiveness in the semiconductor sector amid growing geopolitical uncertainty over global markets and supply chains.

The Semicon Coalition, a group now composed of all 27 EU member states, has signed a declaration [PDF] setting out its goal for a stronger Chips Act to bolster Europe's position in the global semiconductor industry.

It follows earlier calls from European chipmakers to look beyond the Chips Act and do more to support other areas of the sector, not just manufacturing, while the European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA) also previously said it would like to see more public funding and greater input on decisions.

In response, the European Commission says it is already conducting an evaluation and review of the initiative, and opened a public consultation and call for evidence earlier this month. Those with an interest in the sector are invited to share their views on how the Chips Act is performing today and how it should be adapted.

The declaration says a revised version of the strategy must address Europe's vulnerabilities, and aim to make its chip industries stronger in response to geopolitical, technological, and environmental challenges. This is to build on existing strengths as well as emerging market opportunities highlighted in the Draghi report on European competitiveness.

Those challenges include volatility with America - the Trump administration is using every trick it can think of to force tech companies to dance to its tune - and China's attempts to push chipmakers in other countries out of business by flooding the global market with cheap subsidized products.

However, on the strategic objectives for an updated silicon initiative, the declaration says the amibiton to achieve 20 percent share of the global semiconductor market by 2030 is currently unachievable – something many critics had already pointed out – because it lacks clear strategic direction on where and why Europe should lead in the semiconductor supply chain.

Instead, a revised Chips Act 2.0 must be "grounded" in three overall objectives: enabling a competitive European semiconductor ecosystem that can deliver prosperity; developing technological leadership at critical points in the supply chain; and building a stable and reliable supply of trustworthy semiconductors for Europe's critical industrial sectors.

These objectives need to be backed up by measurable targets, periodically reviewed by the European Commission working with member states and relevant stakeholders in the semiconductor ecosystem, the declaration proposes.

A long list of policy priorities is identified, most of which can be grouped into creating a strong ecosystem within Europe, ensuring enough funding, and developing a workforce with the right skills.

The latter would involve support for greater collaboration between academic institutions in the EU, with the establishment of a European Chips Skills Program. Fostering collaboration between industries across Europe and boosting R&D efforts all the way up to first deployment of a particular technology, are also part of the mix.

Funding suggestions include aligning national and European-level finance streams, as well as encouraging private capital to back up the public money.

Also mentioned are issues that hold back construction of new industrial infrastructure: permits, grid access, power supply, and other preconditions.

"We will explore emergency permitting legislation to fast-track strategic investments in the semiconductor ecosystem," the declaration states, echoing similar measures being implemented in the US and UK to allow projects seen as vital to side-step the usual planning checks.

The declaration issues a call to action, saying the signatories are ready to work with the European Commission on a revision of the Chips Act that will drive the development of a stronger local sector.

"Together, we can out-innovate, out-compete, and out-perform," it says rather optimistically, "ensuring Europe's leadership in the critical technologies that will define our future."

Luis Fernandes, IDC Senior Research Manager for EMEA Digital Infrastructure Strategies, said that a review is quite normal for this type of initiative since it has reached its two-year anniversary.

"That being said, it is hard to classify the first iteration of the European Chips Act as a resounding success," he told The Register.

"The first Act was focused on a limited number of projects. This next iteration has the potential to enlist other member states that might want to partake in this endeavor and expand the capabilities and resilience of the initiative," he added.

The Semicon Coalition was formed earlier this year, initially composed of Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the Netherlands.

In a published statement, Minister Vincent Karremans of Economic Affairs for The Netherlands said: "Today all EU Ministers agreed on the fact that Europe's industrial strategy should adapt to the increasing geopolitical tensions in the world. This unique unity is a landmark step forward in securing future strategic autonomy and broad prosperity."

Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Enterprise in the Irish government, said: "This morning I am proud to stand with my European colleagues in endorsing the Declaration of the European Semiconductor Coalition. And I join with them in calling for a revitalized European Chips Act to secure Europe's place at the forefront of the global semiconductor industry."

"This is Europe's moment to align national ambitions with a shared vision: to build a semiconductor ecosystem which secures our sovereignty, drives innovation while ensuring prosperity for generations to come."

Gaurav Gupta, VP Analyst in Gartner's Emerging Trends and Technologies team, said that Chips Act 2.0 needs to better define the end goal.

"The original plan of 20 percent market share was too optimistic and broad – I would say it was rather vague. Once there is a better understanding of what the EU wants to achieve with 2.0, it should channel resources in the right direction. Then it would be a matter of execution," he told us.

Where the original act largely just followed what the US and China were doing, the EU should play to its strengths, Gupta believes, such as in research, automotive and industrial chips, emerging energy-efficient technologies, and wafer fabrication tech (think ASML).

"The EU doesn't have the same resources that China and US have with regards to investing in and leading in advanced semiconductor process nodes. It must rather rely on collaboration for certain aspects, while ensuring better utilization of its own resources.

"Another challenge [the] EU has is that with many participating nations drafting these policies, rather than crisp decision making, it can fall into the trap of interests that serve a particular entity. [The] EU needs to overcome those issues and be quick and aggressive." ®

[TITLE]'Much of the value creation in the semiconductor industry is occurring outside the EU' says EU member states, and they want a fresh plan to claw some chips back:
[TEXT]
A new declaration from all 27 EU member states lays out an "urgent need" for a new and improved EU Chips Act. Essentially, Europe feels like it's fallen behind in chip production and design, and it would like to see a concerted effort from the European Commission to regain ground.

"To secure and strengthen our global position," the declaration reads (via The Register), "the EU must prioritize the semiconductor sector as a strategic industry, on par with aerospace and defence, and treat it as a key target for investment, R&D and innovation, and—if necessary—use the available instruments to protect it and act collectively.

"However, while global competitors are significantly ramping up public investment, much of the value creation in the semiconductor industry is occurring outside the EU," it continues. "This underscores the need for a strengthened, second-phase EU Chips Act that is both ambitious and forward-looking."

You have to agree with the signatories here, which represent each of the countries within the EU today, that Europe has slipped up with chip production. An OECD report (PDF) on the semiconductor value chain shows how the largest exporters of chips tend to be in Asia, such as China, Korea, and Taiwan, with companies in the US making the most money from these chips, as per this Semiconductor Industry Association report.

Europe does have a place at the table with big firms such as Dutch company ASML, which builds most of the world's cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing machines. There are also companies such as Infinion, Europe's largest chip manufacturer, and Arm, thought the latter was previously sold and since listed on a stock exchange outside of Europe. Though this 2020 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association suggests the EU only makes up for 9% of global manufacturing capacity—lower than some individual countries such as Taiwan (22%), South Korea (21%) and Japan (15%). It also suggests this share will decrease by 2030 to 8%.

As the declaration rightly points out, when you're depending on semiconductors for "enabling necessary societal transitions", you sort of want to be in a good place to produce the ones you require, especially as global trade and relationships can be so easily fractured.

Here's what the report suggests should be the objectives of a revised EU Chips Act:

The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors

Prosperity: enabling a competitive European semiconductor ecosystem that enhances Europe's economic and broad welfare and value creation across end-markets. Indispensability: maintain and develop Europe’s technological and innovation leadership to secure critical control points in the global semiconductor value chain. Resilience: secure a stable and reliable supply of trustworthy semiconductors for Europe’s most critical sectors, particularly in times of global disruption or geopolitical uncertainty.

Yep, that all checks out. What self-respecting country or country bloc wouldn't want these things? That's the issue here, it's not what you say, it's how you do it. And competing in the highly-competitive world of semiconductors, especially when you're already behind the times, is going to be excruciatingly tough going.

This is the revised Chips Act, so what happened to the original one?

That's still very much in play, operating to increase the EU share in the "global market value chain by revenue" to 20% by 2030. The big issue is how realistic the act is. Right now, the EU is expected to be around 11.4% by 2030, as laid out in this report on the EU's digital transition. This being so unrealistic is one of the main causes for concern at the original Chips Act, as noted in a special report by the European Court of Auditors, who suggest the target may have been "overly ambitious".

"We recommend that the Commission carries out an urgent reality check and swiftly begins preparing the next strategy," the special report published in April says.

The EU has opened a public consultation on the Chips Act, too, asking for evidence to review the effectiveness of the act.

Well, these many reports won't do very much on their own. The original, surprisingly lightweight declaration suggests a few key topics for a future revision to the Chips Act. Here's the quick version:

Collaboration between industries, supporting tech champions, and fast-tracked legislation.

Public and private investment and cross-industry collaboration, including quantum and AI fields.

Supporting skilled workers.

Supporting the green transition and clean energy.

Foster global collaboration.

There are some fine details in there on specific programs for skilled workers or funding programmes, though most represent points that I think anyone with a half-decent idea of semiconductors would also end up with if tasked with a plan of action for Europe. That's not to say it's ineffective, as it's clearly a signal of intent with powerful backers (every EU member state, don't forget), but the real question remains: how much money is the EU prepared to spend on this?

The US rolled out its own CHIPS and Science Act back in 2022 under the Biden administration, which invested roughly a couple hundred billion dollars into US chipmaking and research. That has ended up being tweaked by the current president, Donald Trump, as he used funds previously awarded to Intel under the act to buy shares in the business instead. This deal struck with Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, who also canned the company's planned European megafab, which was a big part of Europe's optimistic push into more domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Intel still operates a big fab facility in Ireland.

The Trump administration has also pushed Nvidia and AMD into deals relating to their China business, and pushed chip designers (so-called fabless companies) to buy more of their chips from US manufacturing than foreign fabs. You can see the difference between carrot and stick here, right? China also recently rolled out similar measures to block local firms from buying up foreign-made tech, including Nvidia's purpose-made and only very recently green-lit AI chips.

[TITLE]How much digital sovereignty does the UK have left?:
[TEXT]
After weeks of stormy headlines, the announcement of tens of billions of pounds of US investment into the UK’s tech sector must have seemed like manna from heaven for the British government. Announced in conjunction with President Donald Trump’s second state visit to these shores, the list of commitments from tech giants including Microsoft, Google and Nvidia would, according to the Business Secretary Peter Kyle, “create thousands of high-quality jobs across the UK — from clean energy to advanced manufacturing.” What’s more, “[w]orking closely with the US strengthens our global position and delivers real results for British businesses.”

The sheer size of the commitments – several of which came with the wonderful word ‘billion’ at the end – made this argument seem especially persuasive. Google would invest £5bn, to be spent on capital investment, R&D and engineering tasks, helping to support over 8,000 jobs a year. Palantir, meanwhile, would create hundreds of new jobs with its £1.5bn investment in the defence technology sector, while a collective £22bn from Microsoft, Coreweave and Salesforce would support the expansion of the UK’s nascent AI infrastructure – with GPU giant Nvidia pouring £500m into UK-based AI firm Nscale to help create a British version of the US ‘Stargate’ program.

As a result, predicted Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, “the UK is going to be an AI superpower,” with the latter deal finally combining much-needed GPU capacity with the country’s prodigious wellspring of AI talent.

Then came the caveats, first, ironically, from Huang himself, who pointed out that there probably wasn’t enough electricity on the grid yet to power all these new AI data centres. Others opined that Nscale, Nvidia’s ostensibly British partner in building out all this infrastructure, was not only functionally beholden to US investor interests over and above its potential UK customers, but ‘owned and operated by Australians,’ had only just opened a London office and operated only one data centre in Norway (in a statement to Tech Monitor, Nscale said that it is “UK-based”, “was officially incorporated in the UK in May 2024” and “has multiple data centres,” the number of which is not disclosed “due to security and client sensitivities.”)

Would, then, the UK’s future be shaped not by its own government and companies, but by US tech giants? For many critics, the answer was indisputably ‘yes,’ and at great cost to this country’s agency in controlling its tech stack, otherwise known as its ‘digital sovereignty.’ The deals announced in the wake of President Trump’s state visit, the Ada Lovelace Institute’s Gaia Marcus warned Politico, increased UK public and private sector reliance on US tech firms – already massive – to a sinister degree. “We mustn’t just focus on what the figures look like today, if the cost is technological lock-in tomorrow, limiting our ability to seek alternatives in the future,” said Marcus. Ex-Meta majordomo and former Lib-Dem deputy prime minister Nick Clegg went even further, arguing that British tech prowess was “defanged” by such arrangements, which were little more than Silicon Valley’s “sloppy seconds.”

The CIO’s view of digital sovereignty

Is that fair? From the UK government’s point of view, after all, these are probably minor niggles in what constitutes a near-unprecedented slew of investment deals for this country’s economy. Heaven knows we need it. The UK not only lacks for AI infrastructure, but also the means and impetus to invest in such infrastructure itself. It’s not going to come from the government – spending commitments to repair the damage caused by decades of underinvestment in comparatively more important areas like transport, health, social care and defence have put paid to that – and British businesses have historically proven reluctant to match the commitments of their French, German or US counterparts to invest in themselves, much less the wider tech sector.

If the money comes from foreign investment, then, what’s there to worry about? After all, it’s not going to make much functional difference for consumers used to using Google, ChatGPT or Microsoft Word. At the C-suite level, it gets a bit more complicated. Those companies for which data residency laws are actually something to worry

[TITLE]Telecommunications Industry Ireland names new leaders:
[TEXT]
Elaine Carey (left) and Nicola Cooke have been named as new chair and director at Ibec's Telecommunications Industry Ireland.

Telecommunications Industry Ireland (TII) has named Nicola Cooke as its new director and Three Ireland CEO Elaine Carey as new chair of its council.

The organisation represents electronic communications as is part of employers’ group Ibec.

Nicola Cooke, is a former journalist and public relations consultant, she previously led corporate communications with NBI (National Broadband Ireland) and Bus Éireann.

Elaine Carey, the new chair of the TII Council, is currently the CEO of Three Ireland, and was formerly the chief commercial officer for Three Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Members of TII include providers of broadband, broadcasting, cable, fixed, mobile, satellite and wireless internet as well as tower companies, network providers and equipment manufacturers, it said.

They comprise of large industry players such as Three, Vodafone, Sky, Eir, and Virgin Media.

Firms in the telecom sector have invested approximately €5bn in Irish communications infrastructure over the past eight years, it said.

The sector provides high quality employment to 24,000 people in Ireland, and supports thousands more jobs through the €2.7bn it pays annually to suppliers in Ireland for various goods and services.

It is a crucial time in Ireland’s digital transformation, with investment in world class broadband by telecom operators, Elaine Carey says.

“Our mobile and broadband networks are world-class, and that is down to the significant investment that telecommunications operators and broadband providers have put into them.

“These networks are critical infrastructure for our country.”

However the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) means that all sectors within telecoms needs to make the most of its benefits, says the new director Nicola Cooke.

“Almost every sector will need to digitise and embrace the benefits and efficiencies of AI, if they are to remain competitive into the future.

“It is the Government’s stated ambition for Ireland to be at the forefront of European and global digital developments, and we want them to work more closely with TII to achieve this.”

Ms Cooke has also been appointed as director of Audiovisual Ireland, the Ibec representative group for the screen industry (animation, independent film and television production, postproduction, television broadcasting and VFX).

The sector employs approximately 16,000 full-time equivalent jobs (FTEs) and has an estimated Gross Value Added in excess of €1bn and is a key part of national cultural life and profiles Ireland as a destination for tourism, it said.

[TITLE]Denmark calls in Nato help after series of drone incursions:

Denmark is receiving security assistance from North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) allies before a high-level meeting of European leaders in Copenhagen this week after a wave of drone incursions that authorities say may be linked to Russia.

Germany, France and Sweden are sending reinforcements, with troops, anti-drone capabilities, radar systems and a helicopter among the support dispatched to the Danish capital after a string of drone incidents disrupted civilian and military sites over the past week.

The sightings of large, professional-grade drones forced the temporary closure of several Danish airports, among them the country’s main hub in Copenhagen. Over the weekend, military authorities again reported new activity near several defence facilities.

The incidents have triggered a major police investigation and led the government to impose a five-day ban on civilian drones to avoid confusion with potential hostile activity.

European Union leaders are due to gather in Copenhagen for an informal summit on Wednesday and a meeting of the European Political Community on Thursday, bringing together a broader group of European leaders.

Although investigators have yet to identify the source of the incursions, Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen has linked it to Russia’s efforts to destabilise Europe, a statement Russia denies.

“Putin wants to divide us,” Mr Frederiksen said in a post on Facebook on Monday, naming Russia as the primary country threatening Europe’s security. “No country can handle a hybrid war alone. That is why we have our strong alliances. The EU and Nato.”

Other European countries including Poland, Estonia and Romania have also suffered unprecedented airspace violations this month, prompting European warnings to the Kremlin that they’re ready to respond with full force, including potentially shooting down planes.

German defence minister Boris Pistorius, speaking at a security conference in Warsaw on Monday, criticised the recent incursions as unacceptable, calling them “an irresponsible provocation in times of already heightened tensions”.

“Russia is becoming more and more of a threat to Nato. It is testing Nato allies with growing frequency and intensity,” he said. “Putin deliberately attempts to undermine European security and the territorial integrity of European nations.”
