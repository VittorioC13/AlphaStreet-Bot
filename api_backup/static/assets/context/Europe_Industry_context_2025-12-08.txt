[TITLE]JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says Europe Has a ‘Real Problem’:
[TEXT]
(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called out slow bureaucracy in Europe in a warning that a “weak” continent poses a major economic risk to the US.

“Europe has a real problem,” Dimon said Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum. “They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”

While he praised some European leaders who he said were aware of the issues, he cautioned politics is “really hard.”

Dimon, leader of the biggest US bank, has long said that the risk of a fragmented Europe is among the major challenges facing the world. In his letter to shareholders released earlier this year, he said that Europe has “some serious issues to fix.”

On Saturday, he praised the creation of the euro and Europe’s push for peace. But he warned that a reduction in military efforts and challenges trying to reach agreement within the European Union are threatening the continent.

“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore,” Dimon said. “It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important.”

He said the US should help.

“We need a long-term strategy to help them become strong,” Dimon said. “A weak Europe is bad for us.”

The administration of President Donald Trump issued a new national security strategy that directed US interests toward the Western Hemisphere and protection of the homeland while dismissing Europe as a continent headed toward “civilizational erasure.”

JPMorgan has been ramping up its push to spur more investments in the national defense sector. In October, the bank announced that it would funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next 10 years — as much as $500 billion more than what it would’ve provided anyway.

Dimon said in the statement that it’s “painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing.”

Investment banker Jay Horine oversees the effort, which Dimon called “100% commercial.” It will focus on four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence and resilience; and frontier and strategic technologies.

The bank will also invest as much as $10 billion of its own capital to help certain companies expand, innovate or accelerate strategic manufacturing.

Separately on Saturday, Dimon praised Trump for finding ways to roll back bureaucracy in the government.

“There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America,” Dimon said. “That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that.”

[TITLE]EU plan would boost ESMA powers over crypto and capital markets:
[TEXT]
The European Commission has proposed expanding the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) over crypto and broader financial markets in a bid to narrow the competitive gap with the United States.

Published Thursday, the package would transfer “direct supervisory competences” for key pieces of market infrastructure, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), trading venues and central counterparties, to ESMA and strengthen its coordination role in the asset management sector.

The proposal still needs approval from the European Parliament and the Council, where it is under negotiation.

If adopted, ESMA’s role in overseeing EU capital markets would more closely resemble the centralized framework of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

EU proposal aims to streamline markets and strengthen ESMA’s authority. Source: finance.ec.europa.eu

In September, France became the third European country to call for the Paris-based ESMA to take over supervision of major crypto firms, joining Austrian and Italian securities regulators.

The move followed growing criticism of Malta’s crypto licensing regime. In July, ESMA released a peer review of the Malta Financial Services Authority’s authorization of a crypto service provider, saying that the regulator only “partially met expectations.”

Due to concerns over more lenient regulations in some jurisdictions, France has also threatened to block the “passporting” of European licenses obtained from member states, raising enforcement gaps

[TITLE]Integrated capital markets and centralised supervision key to urgent investments in Europe:
[TEXT]
Today, the European Commission has presented its new legislative package to promote further integration of capital markets and to centralise supervision in the EU. The Socialists and Democrats welcome it as an important, necessary step to reap the full benefits of the single market and ensure the urgently needed massive investments in Europe.

Over a year ago, Mario Draghi, former Italian prime minister and president of the European Central Bank, warned in his report on competitiveness that Europe needs €800 billion in annual investments, an amount that cannot be met through bank financing alone. He also emphasised the need to improve European competitiveness through measures such as supervisory simplification.

The S&D Group has long called for further integration and completion of the EU’s Capital Markets Union, including giving European supervisory authorities direct oversight of large cross-border financial firms.

This is crucial, as the persistent national fragmentation in Europe’s capital markets severely limits the benefits that can be gained from the EU’s single market. According to the International Monetary Fund, internal barriers in financial services alone act as the equivalent to a tariff of over 100 percent.

Jonás Fernández, S&D spokesperson on economic and monetary affairs, said:

[TITLE]Calystron Capital Announces Strategic Global Expansion Across Europe and Asia:
[TEXT]
DENVER, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Calystron Capital today announced a new phase of international expansion, marking an important milestone in the firm’s long-term vision to build a global investment presence supported by advanced technology and cross-market expertise. This initiative centers on deepening the firm’s footprint in Europe—particularly in Spain and Germany—while simultaneously accelerating entry into key Asian markets including Singapore and Japan. Together, these regions represent growing financial hubs with increasing investor demand, regulatory openness to innovation, and strong alignment with Calystron Capital’s technology-driven investment philosophy.

Christopher Ellington, Chief Investment Advisor of Calystron Capital, emphasized that globalization is not only a strategic choice but a natural extension of the firm’s core competencies. With more than thirty years of experience across major financial centers, Ellington noted that global markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, making cross-regional diversification a requirement rather than an option. “Our clients need access to opportunities beyond their home markets,” Ellington said. “Global allocation is no longer optional. It is essential for risk management, resilience, and long-term performance. A truly modern investment architecture must operate across borders.”

Calystron Capital’s expansion is anchored by two defining advantages. The first is the firm’s technology-driven investment infrastructure, which integrates the Calystron Quant Framework™ with the Calystron AI Trading System™. Together, these systems generate data-rich strategies, multi-market liquidity intelligence, high-frequency analytics, and adaptive execution models capable of responding to rapidly shifting environments. This technological backbone allows the firm to monitor global capital flows, cross-asset behavior, and macroeconomic transitions with precision, enabling more sophisticated portfolio construction for clients across diverse regions.

The second advantage lies in Calystron Capital’s approach to combining localized expertise with global oversight. By establishing specialized teams in European and Asian markets, the firm aims to directly understand local investor behavior, evolving regulations, and emerging sector opportunities—while still applying the disciplined standards and risk framework developed in the U.S. institutional market. This blend of local insight and international perspective is designed to create a more robust, diversified investment ecosystem that can adapt to global and regional cycles alike.

As part of its global strategy, Calystron Capital also intends to guide U.S. investors toward broader international diversification—especially in fast-growing European and Asian industries—while helping international investors gain access to the depth, liquidity, and stability of U.S. capital markets. According to Ellington, this two-way flow of capital is becoming increasingly important. “We want to build a bridge between markets,” he said. “Our role is to help clients navigate that bridge with clarity, discipline, and intelligent technology. The future of capital management lies in global mobility and intelligent allocation.”

Looking ahead, the firm expects its expansion to accelerate over the coming year as new research hubs, trading nodes, and advisory teams begin operations across Europe and Asia. With technology and financial expertise serving as its dual engines, Calystron Capital aims to position itself as a central connector between intelligent capital and the world’s major financial regions, shaping a future where innovation and global access define long-term wealth creation.

[TITLE]ED files chargesheet against Reliance Power, subsidiaries in 'fake' bank guarantee case:
[TEXT]
The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday said it has filed a chargesheet against businessman Anil Ambani's group company Reliance Power Ltd. and 10 others in a money laundering case linked to issuance of an alleged fake bank guarantee of Rs 68 crore for securing a tender.

The other accused named in the prosecution complaint include former Reliance Power CFO Ashok Kumar Pal, Reliance NU BESS Ltd. and Rosa Power Supply Company Ltd. (subsidiaries of Reliance Power), an Odisha-based "shell" company Biswal Tradelink Private Limited, its MD Patha Sarathi Biswal, Biothane Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. and trade financing consultant Amar Nath Dutta.

Some other accused include Ravinder Pal Singh Chadha, Manoj Bhaiyasaheb Pongde and Punit Narendra Garg, as per the agency.

The chargesheet has been filed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at the Patiala House court in Delhi on Friday, as per officials.

The case pertains to a bank guarantee of ₹68.2 crore submitted to secure a tender from the Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) on behalf of Reliance NU BESS Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Power, a listed company. The company (Reliance NU BESS) was formerly known as Maharashtra Energy Generation Limited.

Probe found, as per the agency, that Reliance Group officials were well aware that this was a "fake" bank guarantee. "Fraudulent" endorsements were being submitted to SECI from a "spoofed" email ID of SBI and when SECI detected the fraud, Reliance Group arranged a genuine Bank Guarantee from IDBI Bank within a day of intimation of the fraud by SECI.

"However, SECI refused to accept the fresh Bank Guarantee as it was submitted after the due date.

"Since Reliance NU BESS Limited had emerged as the L-2 bidder, in order to save the tender, Reliance Group officials even tried to arrange a fresh endorsement of the fake foreign Bank Guarantee from an SBI branch in Kolkata," the ED alleged.

The Reliance Group had earlier said Anil Ambani was "not on the Board of Reliance Power Limited for more than 3.5 years and is not concerned with this matter in any manner".

It claimed to have been a "victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy" in this case adding that it had made due disclosures in this context to the stock exchange on November 7, 2024.

The ED added that Reliance Group officials signed a "dummy" agreement and also obtained the "Certificate of Enlistment" of Reliance NU BESS Limited from Kolkata Municipal Corporation by submitting "bogus" address documents, it said.

However, when they again failed to get the fresh endorsement done, in order to shift the entire blame onto the intermediary, they filed a complaint against Biswal Tradelink Private Limited and its MD Partha Sarathi Biswal.

Biswal was arrested by the ED in this case apart from ex Reliance Power CFO Ashok Kumar Pal and Dutta. They are currently lodged in jail under judicial custody.

The money laundering case stems from a November 2024 FIR of Delhi Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW). It was alleged that Bhubaneswar-based shell entity Biswal Tradelink was engaged in issuing "fake" bank guarantees against commission.

Reliance Power Limited submitted this bid for a tender issued by SECI for setting up 1000 MW/2000 MWh standalone BESS projects under tariff-based competitive bidding.

The investigation has "established" the "connivance" and "mala fide" intentions of the Reliance Group in securing the SECI tender by submitting fake Bank Guarantees purportedly issued by foreign banks and their forged endorsements in the name of SBI, the ED said.

The agency also stated in the chargesheet that it has attached assets worth ₹5.15 crore as part of this probe.

The agency added that Reliance Power, with a mala fide intent, hired the services of Biswal Tradelink to arrange a fake Bank Guarantee from FirstRand Bank, Manila, Philippines, which is a "non-existent" branch, and from ACE Investment Bank Limited, Malaysia.

"Endorsements of the fake Bank Guarantees were done by using a spoofed email ID of SBI and forged endorsement letters purportedly issued by SBI.

"A fraudulent domain, s-bi.co.in (a look-alike of genuine address sbi.co.in), was used for the said purpose," it said.

Describing the role of other accused, the ED said Reliance Power routed funds of Rs 6.33 crore from its other subsidiary, Rosa Power Supply Company Ltd. to Biswal Tradelink under the guise of bogus transportation services, in order to meet the required funding for arranging the fake Bank Guarantee.

A "fake" work order and "fake" invoices were executed by the officials of Reliance Group in collusion with accomplice Biswal.

"After arrangement of the fraudulent Bank Guarantee by Biswal Tradelink Reliance Power also paid a hefty fee of ₹5.40 crore to the said shell entity in order to depict the entire arrangement as a genuine commercial transaction," the ED claimed.

As announced on April 7, 2025, the Company had entered into a forward sale and exclusivity agreement with an unaffiliated third party (the “Buyer”), granting the Buyer the exclusive right to submit a bid for the conversion of the M/T P. Sophia into a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit for a proposed offshore project (the “Offshore Project”). The Buyer has informed the Company that the M/T P. Sophia was not selected for the Offshore Project. As a result, the potential forward sale and exclusivity agreement has automatically lapsed, no sale will be completed under its terms, and the vessel will continue to operate in the Company’s fleet.

[TITLE]How Mexico Revived Its Renewable Energy Sector:
[TEXT]
After several years of stagnation in Mexico’s renewable energy sector, the introduction of more favourable reforms alongside several new solar energy agreements suggests that the Latin American country is pursuing a more diversified energy mix. After several years of energy policy that focused on greater nationalisation, the door is once again open for private participation, which is expected to include the development of several green energy projects and attract investment from various firms worldwide.

Under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), who led the Morena party from 2018 to 2024, Mexico’s energy sector underwent a significant nationalisation, during which time it became harder for private companies to participate in the industry. AMLO decided to nationalise Mexico’s energy sector, citing over-greedy international energy companies, sectoral corruption, and the need for enhanced national energy security.

During his presidency, AMLO supported fossil fuel expansion, bailing out the state-owned oil and gas company PEMEX several times, as well as investing heavily in the construction of major new refineries. Meanwhile, investments in green energy stagnated as AMLO did not prioritise renewable energy development at the national level or allow for investment from private companies.

Since President Claudia Sheinbaum came into office in 2024, Mexico’s energy sector has begun to undergo a transformation, following the introduction of a new energy reform in March 2025. Sheinbaum followed in AMLO’s footsteps by maintaining the national majority ownership of the electricity sector, meaning the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) must provide at least 54 percent of the country’s electricity. The reform also disbanded the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), replacing them with a centralised National Energy Commission (CNE).

While Mexico’s energy sector will continue to be dominated by state-owned companies, Sheinbaum has reopened opportunities for foreign investment in the sector. In her national economic development strategy, Plan México, Sheinbaum introduced the aim of adding almost 23 GW of new power generation capacity by 2030, as well as establishing 100 transmission and distribution projects.

During her electoral campaign, Sheinbaum stated her commitment to renewable energy, emphasising the potential to develop Mexico’s abundant solar and wind resources. “We are going to propel renewable energy in Mexico,” Sheinbaum said during her inauguration. “The objective is that by 2030, 45 percent of the country’s energy will be powered by renewable sources.”

The government plans to invest over $22 billion by 2030 to expand CFE’s electricity generation and distribution. Meanwhile, Mexico aims to attract between $6 and $9 billion in private investment to establish between 6.4 GW and 9.5 GW of new clean-energy capacity by 2030. The new energy reform allows both CFE and Pemex to enter mixed contracts with private companies, so long as they hold a majority share of the project.

In October, Mexico’s Energy Ministry invited private companies to participate in the construction of 34 new power plants to accelerate the expansion of the country’s electricity capacity. The projects include 23 solar photovoltaic and 11 wind power plants across 20 states. Operations are scheduled to commence between 2027 and 2030. Once completed, the facilities are expected to add 5.97 GW of installed capacity.

“The call is part of specific mechanisms to develop strategic and priority projects aligned with binding planning, ensuring an orderly and coherent approach to meeting the National Electric System’s capacity needs,” the Ministry’s announcement stated.

In late October, the Spanish clean energy firm The Cox Group announced an investment of $4.2 billion for new solar and wind farms in Mexico’s border state of Nuevo León. The projects will be developed in the state capital of Monterrey, as well as other municipalities, and are expected to support the creation of 4,000 temporary jobs and 250 permanent positions. The Cox Group and the state government are developing a comprehensive strategy that includes water treatment and reuse, gas cogeneration, and energy efficiency.

In November, the German utility RWE announced plans to launch solar projects in Mexico. RWE’s subsidiary Oyamel Recursos Ambientales is developing a 120 MW PV plant in Veracruz, while its Biznaga subsidiary aims to build the 90 MW Cerro Pelón PV plant in Jalisco. Meanwhile, Canadian Solar’s Recurrent Energy hopes to get approval for a $63 million solar plant in Zacatecas. Spain’s Global Dominion Access and Canadian Solar also submitted environmental permit requests to develop solar operations, while Iberdrola announced plans to develop two solar projects totalling 535 MW in Mexico.

A recent report by the energy think tank Ember forecast that private investment and energy storage in Mexico could grow to as much as 36 GW of solar power and 30 GWh of battery storage in the coming years, owing to a greater openness to private participation in Mexico’s energy sector. As much as 46 percent of the country’s electricity generation could come from private projects, suggesting the beginning of a shift away from nationalisation.

[TITLE]The UK wants to unlock a 'golden age of nuclear' but faces key challenges in reviving historic lead:
[TEXT]

The U.K. was the birthplace of commercial nuclear energy, but now generates just a fraction of its power from it — big investments are underway to change that. The country once had more nuclear power stations than the U.S., USSR and France — combined. It was a global producer until 1970 but hasn't completed a new reactor since Sizewell B in 1995. Today, the country takes the crown not for being a leader in atomic energy, but for being the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear projects. Nuclear energy accounted for just 14% of the U.K.'s power supply in 2023, according to the most recent data from the International Energy Agency, trailing its European peers and well behind frontrunner France at 65%. There is ambition to change that and have a quarter of the U.K.'s power come from nuclear by 2050. Nuclear is considered an attractive bet gas it's a low-carbon, constant energy source that can act as a baseload to complement intermittent sources like renewables. "There's a very clear momentum that has been observed," Doreen Abeysundra, founder of consultancy Fresco Cleantech, told CNBC. It's in part due to geopolitical tensions, which pushed energy security and independence onto public agendas. However, the U.K.'s Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce called for urgent reforms after identifying "systemic failures" in the country's nuclear framework. It found that fragmented regulation, flawed legislation and weak incentives led the U.K. to fall behind as a nuclear powerhouse. The government committed to implementing the taskforce's guidance and is expected to present a plan to do so within three months.

Going big – or small

The U.K. is spreading its bets across tried-and-tested large nuclear projects and smaller, next-generation reactors known as small module reactors (SMRs). British company Rolls-Royce has been selected as the country's preferred partner for SMRs, which are effectively containerized nuclear reactors designed to be manufactured in a factory. Many include passive cooling techniques, which supporters argue makes them safer and cheaper. Nuclear has long come under fire by environmentalists due to radioactive waste and disasters like Chernobyl. Indeed, the U.K.'s first commercial plant Windscale became its worst nuclear accident in history when it melted down in 1957.

On October 10, 1957, Windscale became the site of the worst nuclear accident in British history, and the worst in the world until Three Mile Island 22 years later. A facility had been built there to produce plutonium, but when the US successfully designed a nuclear bomb that used tritium, the facility was used to produce it for the UK. However, this required running the reactor at a higher temperature than its design could sustain, and it eventually caught fire.

Most SMRs use light water reactor technology – think of the planned large-scale nuclear plant Sizewell C, just "shrunk down," said Abeysundra – which is tried and tested. Other designs, known as "advanced" reactors, are more experimental. For example, those that change the cooling solution or solvent, which is typically used in the process of separating and purifying nuclear materials. The U.K.'s first SMR will be at Wylfa, in Wales, though no timeline has been given for its completion. The site will house three SMRs and grow over time. In September, the country signed a deal with the U.S. to enable stronger commercial ties on nuclear power and streamline licensing for firms that want to build on the opposite side of the Atlantic. However, "the first thing is, there is not, at the moment, a single SMR actively producing electricity under four revenues. They will all come at best in the 30s," Ludovico Cappelli, portfolio manager of Listed Infrastructure at Van Lanschot Kempen, told CNBC. While SMRs are a "game changer" thanks to their ability to power individual factories or small towns, their days of commercial operation are too far away, he said. From an investment standpoint, "that is still a bit scary," he added. To secure the large baseloads needed to offset the intermittency of renewables, "we're still looking at big power stations," added Paul Jackson, Invesco's EMEA global market strategist.

SMRs "probably" do have a role — "they can clearly be more nimble" — but it will take time to roll them out, Jackson said, casting doubt on the U.K.'s ability to be a leader in nuclear, as France and China are already miles ahead. The U.K. government body Great British Energy-Nuclear is set to identify sites for an additional large-scale plant, having already acquired one in Gloucestershire, in the west of England, as well as the site in Wales. "We are reversing a legacy of no new nuclear power being delivered to unlock a golden age of nuclear, securing thousands of good, skilled jobs and billions in investment," a spokesperson for the U.K. government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told CNBC. "Sizewell C will deliver clean electricity for the equivalent of six million of today's households for at least six decades, and the UK's first small modular reactors at Wylfa will power the equivalent of three million homes, bringing energy security," they added.

Innovation in funding

The U.K. has a strong legacy to build on. It pioneered fresh funding mechanisms to make large-scale nuclear projects investible so that they are less reliant on direct government funding, such as a Contract for Differences, which was used for Hinkley Point C. The mechanism guarantees a fixed price for the electricity generated over a long period of time in order to de-risk investments in an industry that's known for running over time and budget. Hinkley Point C was initially expected to cost £18 billion (over $24 billion) but the bill has slowly crept up. "That fixes one part of the equation, the price risk," Cappelli said of nuclear investments, but the second risk is construction delays. The Regulated Asset Base (RAB), first used for nuclear at Sizewell C, attempts to reconcile this. Investors get paid from the day they cut a check for a nuclear project, rather than the day it starts operating. Sizewell C is expected to cost £38 billion to build. Private market investors are increasingly interested in next-generation nuclear as a way to offset soaring energy demands from AI, resulting in a host of young companies trying to build out facilities. Perhaps the most famous is Oklo, a U.S. firm that was taken public by a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman.

The U.K.'s advanced modular reactor hopeful Newcleo, which uses lead for cooling, moved its headquarters from London to Paris in 2024 — a strategic move to deepen its European footprint. At the time, it told World Nuclear News that it still plans to have a commercial reactor up and running in the U.K. by 2033, but the firm has since scaled back its British efforts. Meanwhile, Tokamak Energy and First Light Fusion call the U.K. home. They both focus on nuclear fusion, the process of generating power by combining atoms, though this technology is yet to get out of the lab. All of today's nuclear power comes from fission, where atoms are spit. The U.K. announced £2.5 billion for a world-first fusion prototype in June.

The next generation of engineers

The U.K. faces challenges in access to relevant talent, which is crucial for scaling projects effectively. The country is heralded for its world-class universities and technical know-how, "but that is very much book knowledge," said Van Lanschot Kempen's Cappelli. "What we need is real on-the-ground expertise, and that we are probably lacking for the simple reason that we haven't been doing it for a very long time," he said. For Abeysundra, there's one area where the U.K. stands out: its mindset. "There is so much knowledge, innovation, and that can-do attitude, which I don't see as much in other nations," she said, pointing to the U.K.'s trailblazing role in the Industrial Revolution and establishment of offshore wind energy.

watch now

The U.K. government positioned nuclear energy as a key element of the future clean energy workforce in its Clean Energy Jobs Plan released in October, while its national roadmap for nuclear skills, set out in 2024, focuses on apprenticeships, PhDs and upskilling mid-career workers. Industry-led initiatives such as the Energy Skills Passport also support the likes of oil and gas workers to gain green skills.

Securing the supply chain

Perhaps the toughest issue, however, is the supply chain. Uranium, the fuel used to make a nuclear reaction, is dominated by just four countries, including Russia. Global demand for uranium could rise by nearly a third by 2030 and more than double by 2040, according to the World Nuclear Association, adding further reliance on a select few countries and pressure on developers.

Since returning to office, President Trump has made the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) a key focal point of his second administration. Just last week, the president signed an executive order launching the “Genesis Mission,” a new “national effort” that seeks to utilize AI to “transform how scientific research is conducted and accelerate the speed of scientific discovery.”

“With the Genesis Mission, the Trump Administration intends to dramatically expand the productivity and impact of Federal research and development within a decade,” the order reads.

While AI appears poised to become a major facet of everyday life moving forward, there’s a negative underside to this burgeoning technology that is wreaking havoc on communities across the country: AI data centers.

The crypto market is heading into 2026 with a fundamentally different character from the one we knew even two years ago. In 2025, the industry has already started moving its conversations from experimentation to integration in traditional financial institutions, from volatility to structure, from narratives to fundamentals. Over the next couple of years, the narrative will no longer be anchored in cycles, speculation, or catalysts. It will be anchored in architecture, the slow, deliberate construction of a market that institutions can rely on.This shift is reshaping everything: behaviour, liquidity, infrastructure, and the expectations placed on market leaders.Sometimes the most important development is also the quietest. Institutions are beginning to treat Bitcoin as operational capital, not merely market exposure. We'll see Fortune 500 companies incorporating Bitcoin into capital structure as working capital management.What changed is not the asset, but the ecosystem around it. Credit markets built on BTC collateral are maturing. Custodial standards now resemble regulated market infrastructure. Settlement technologies are being designed for enterprise treasury rather than retail speculation.The net effect is profound. When an asset becomes a source of collateral, a liquidity instrument, and a treasury tool, it stops behaving like a cyclical trade.The digital asset universe has matured well beyond crypto price speculation. Tokenized assets grew from $85 million in 2020 to over $21 billion by April 2025, encompassing real estate, private credit, U.S. Treasury instruments, and alternative investment vehicles. Stablecoin supply surged 54% to reach $247 billion, with stablecoin holders rising to 161 million. These programmable instruments enable 24/7 settlement, automated compliance, and operational efficiencies impossible within legacy financial infrastructure.Decentralized finance protocols now offer institutional-grade liquidity with transparent risk parameters. Custody solutions have advanced through multi-party computation and sophisticated cryptographic protocols, addressing the security concerns that once deterred institutional capital. The ecosystem has built the infrastructure required for serious financial institutions to participate at scale.2025 witnessed key developments in global regulations. Europe’s MiCA framework now gives exchanges and stablecoin issuers a single rulebook across 27 countries. Singapore and Hong Kong have published clear tokenisation guidelines that banks can operate under without ambiguity. Global banks are adopting ISO 20022 messaging standards that allow tokenised asset flows to move seamlessly across jurisdictions, making cross-border settlement far easier. Japan now permits banks and brokerages to issue tokenised securities on regulated blockchain networks.Protocol upgrades on leading networks are reducing transaction costs and enabling institutional-grade throughput. Policy timelines across the U.S., Europe, and Asia are converging around digital asset product approvals and compliance expectations, while some regions are implementing rules ahead of schedule, accelerating market discipline.For the first time, institutional investors will access tokenised assets , yield markets, and settlement liquidity through compliant, globally interlinked channels. For example, banks in Singapore can now settle tokenised Treasury products issued under European MiCA rules, using interoperable custody and reporting standards across both regions.What these mean for 2026? Global regulation will function as a coordinated system, enabling real-time cross-border tokenised markets, shared compliance logic, and deeper collaboration between regulators and market infrastructure providers.Back home, the last couple of years have given Indians real-time, seamless access to global assets. This is a historic wealth-building moment for a digitally savvy generation. Such access simply did not exist before. Indian exchanges have played a central role in enabling this. We took a complex global technology and made it simple, compliant, and safe for millions of users. The mission is straightforward: take this technology to the masses, the same way tech made it possible for people to invest in stocks or gold.2025 proved how powerful that access can be. Millions of Indians continued adopting crypto, and India remained on top of the Chainalysis index for the third consecutive year. Investors moved well beyond Bitcoin. CoinDCX data shows rising participation in Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and other layer-1 networks. Users experimented with diverse strategies and more mature asset allocation. New participants from equities and commodities entered the market, treating digital assets as a diversification tool, exactly how global investors approach them.This acceleration in user maturity in 2025 naturally increases the need for faster regulation.When millions of Indians participate in an asset class with this level of sophistication, regulation cannot stay in observation mode forever. Policymakers are not ignoring crypto. They are watching how the market stabilises, how risks evolve, and how user behaviour changes. As with any emerging technology, responsible innovation is moving faster than regulation. But high-adoption countries like India will eventually revisit their stance as participation becomes deeper and more structured.Leading exchanges like ours are already shifting from reactive compliance to proactive partnership. We work with policymakers, share data and insights, and bring global references to help shape frameworks that protect users and support innovation. In 2026, users and exchanges expect clearer frameworks that protect users while enabling India to stay competitive in the global digital asset ecosystem It is now our responsibility to provide users with the safest environment, high-quality education, and transparent products. Our goal remains the same: bring the rigor of traditional finance into digital assets, and ensure every user experiences trust at every step as the ecosystem enters its next phase in 2026.: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own. These do not represent the views of the Economic Times)

[TITLE]JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says Europe has a ‘real problem’:
[TEXT]
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called out slow bureaucracy in Europe in a warning that a “weak” continent poses a major economic risk to the US.

“Europe has a real problem,” Dimon said Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum. “They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”

While he praised some European leaders who he said were aware of the issues, he cautioned politics is “really hard.”

Dimon, leader of the biggest US bank, has long said that the risk of a fragmented Europe is among the major challenges facing the world. In his letter to shareholders released earlier this year, he said that Europe has “some serious issues to fix.”

On Saturday, he praised the creation of the euro and Europe’s push for peace. But he warned that a reduction in military efforts and challenges trying to reach agreement within the European Union are threatening the continent.

“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore,” Dimon said. “It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important.”

He said the US should help.

“We need a long-term strategy to help them become strong,” Dimon said. “A weak Europe is bad for us.”

The administration of President Donald Trump issued a new national security strategy that directed US interests toward the Western Hemisphere and protection of the homeland while dismissing Europe as a continent headed toward “civilizational erasure.”

JPMorgan has been ramping up its push to spur more investments in the national defense sector. In October, the bank announced that it would funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next 10 years — as much as $500 billion more than what it would’ve provided anyway.

Dimon said in the statement that it’s “painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing.”

Investment banker Jay Horine oversees the effort, which Dimon called “100% commercial.” It will focus on four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence and resilience; and frontier and strategic technologies.

The bank will also invest as much as $10 billion of its own capital to help certain companies expand, innovate or accelerate strategic manufacturing.

Separately on Saturday, Dimon praised Trump for finding ways to roll back bureaucracy in the government.

“There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America,” Dimon said. “That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that.”
