Trump Media & Technology to merge with fusion energy company TAE in $6 billion deal. Here's why.

CBS News ^ | 12/18/2025 | Alain Sherter, Aimee Picchi

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Trump Media & Technology is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in a deal worth more than $6 billion, aiming to harness the fledgling technology to power energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.

TAE, which is privately owned, is developing technology aimed at producing energy by fusing atomic nuclei. Trump Media & Technology owns President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.

The merger comes amid a difficult year for Trump Media shares, which trade under the ticker DJT — the same as Mr. Trump's initials. Through Wednesday, the stock was down 69% for the year, even as the S&P 500 had gained 14%.

After the merger was announced Thursday morning, Trump Media shares jumped $3.37, or 32%, to $13.84.

Trump Media's strategic shift

More recently, the company has pivoted beyond its roots as a tech business. Earlier this year, Trump Media struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency, and it has also rolled out investment funds with "America-first" strategies.

The merger with TAE represents a continuation of Trump Media's "America first" principles, former California lawmaker Devin Nunes, now chief executive of Trump Media, said in a Thursday conference call with investors.

"Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense and secure the energy needed to guarantee America's dominance of AI technology," Nunes said on the call.

He added, "This combination positions the combined company to help lead the global AI revolution and kickstart an American energy renaissance."

Fusion?

I think this is a bridge tooooo far Westinghouse already solved the problem Westinghouse isn't putting a big reactor in a trailer, but they're developing eVinci™ Microreactors, which are factory-built, small nuclear batteries about the size of a school bus or shipping container, designed for remote power, mining, data centers, and even space, offering clean energy for 10+ years without refueling, relying on heat pipes and passive safety for deployment in containerized units that can power off-grid locations or supplement grids, a key step towards mobile nuclear power

We have Fusion Power available locally on da Erf at night? Yeah, fusion exists on the Sun, and the Sun shares the power during the day, we grab it into batteries for night. The way I see it, the merger is Trump's quest to use fusion to create gold from lesser elements. He needs more to decorate his accomodations.

[TITLE]Technology M&A: AI infrastructure and regulation redefine the deal cycle:
[TEXT]
Deals are ramping up in the tech space, driven by trends like AI, cybersecurity and connectivity. Credit: Adobe/Creative-Touch.

A powerful rebound in tech dealmaking

Despite a forbidding backdrop of geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty, technology M&A has hit the accelerator. In the third quarter of 2025, transactions in the tech, media and telecom (TMT) sector reached $256 billion, a 51% jump on the previous quarter. The scale of the rebound is significant in a market that only recently seemed stuck in neutral.

The resurgence has been led by very large transactions. Deals worth $1 billion or more accounted for $220 billion of Q3 2025 value, spread across 37 mega-deals. The largest of these was the $55 billion takeover of Electronic Arts by a consortium including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, which alone absorbed more than a fifth of quarterly tech deal value. Buyers are once again prepared to commit serious capital. Yet, in an age of anxiety

The suspension of the “technology prosperity deal” comes amid rising frustration in Washington over the progress of trade discussions with the U.K., the Financial Times reported Monday (Dec. 15).

The deal, announced in September during President Donald Trump’s trip to the U.K., is designed to promote collaboration between the countries on artificial intelligence, nuclear energy and quantum computing, according to the report.

The U.S. suspended the deal last week, the report said, citing unnamed U.K. officials. The White House is lobbying for concessions from the U.K. on trade areas beyond the scope of the agreement, formed in response to tariffs on U.K. goods.

The U.S. became frustrated with the lack of willingness from the U.K. to deal with “non-tariff barriers,” such as rules and regulations on food and industrial goods, the report said, citing unnamed sources.

Although the U.K. agreed to allow 13,000 tons of U.S. beef to enter the country free of tariffs each year, the trade deal said the two sides would continue to work together to improve market access for more U.S. agricultural products, according to the report.

The U.S. has for years pushed the U.K. to recognize American food and agricultural product standards, although there were no specific commitments included in the deal, per the report.

Meanwhile, Trump has criticized the digital services tax imposed on tech companies by U.S. trading partners. However, one U.K. official denied that this tax, which affects American tech companies, was a serious issue, according to the report.

“The digital services tax is a red herring,” the official said, per the report. “We are down to negotiating some of the most difficult issues. Both sides expect this to take some time. But the dialogue remains open, active and constructive.”

The trade deal was accompanied by a $1.6 billion investment from financial companies, including PayPal, Bank of America and Citigroup, with commitments to create 1,800 jobs in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

“Strengthening ties with the U.S. boosts our economy, creates jobs and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change,” U.K. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said in September. “These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the U.S. presidential state visit.”

[TITLE]U.S. and China are headed for an A.I. collision * WorldNetDaily * by Oren Etzioni, Real Clear Wire:
[TEXT]
Trump and Xi Are Talking — But the U.S. and China Are Headed for an AI Collision

President Trump spoke by phone to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Monday November 24 and later posted on Truth Social, “Our relationship with China is extremely strong!” The warm feelings from Washington came on the heels of the two leaders holding a productive meeting in Korea recently and scheduling several more get-confabs for the year ahead.

But bubbling beneath the surface is a rivalry between the two countries over the most vital technology of the 21st century: artificial intelligence.

To understand the rivalry, consider a recent announcement by the U.S. Justice Department: on November 20, it charged two Americans, and two Chinese nationals, with a conspiracy to illegally export

KATHMANDU, Nepal -- The white dome of Boudhanath rises like a silent guardian over the chaotic sprawl of Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, crowned by a golden spire that pierces the sky. Painted on each of the spire’s four sides are the benevolent eyes of the Buddha — wide, calm, and unblinking — said to see all that unfolds below.

Those eyes have served as a symbol of sanctuary for generations of Tibetans fleeing the Chinese crackdown in their homeland. But today, Tibetan refugees are also watched by far more malevolent eyes: Thousands of CCTV cameras from China, perched on street corners and rooftops to monitor every movement below. This intense surveillance has stifled the once-vibrant Free Tibet movement that had resonated around the world.

Nepal is just one of at least 150 countries to which Chinese companies are supplying surveillance technology, from cameras in Vietnam to censorship firewalls in Pakistan to citywide monitoring systems in Kenya. This technology is now a key part of China’s push for global influence, as it provides cash-strapped governments cost-effective, if invasive, forms of policing — turning algorithms and data into a force multiplier for control.

The irony at the heart of this digital authoritarianism is that the surveillance tools China exports are based on technology developed in its greatest rival, the United States, despite warnings that Chinese firms would buy, copy or outright steal American designs, an investigation by The Associated Press has found.

For decades, Silicon Valley firms often yielded to Beijing’s demands: Give us your technology and we will give you access to our market. Although tensions fester between Washington and Beijing, the links between American tech and Chinese surveillance continue today.

For example, Amazon Web Services offers cloud services to Chinese tech giants like Hikvision and Dahua, assisting them in their overseas push. Both are on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Entity List for national security and human-rights concerns, which means transactions with them are not illegal but subject to strict restrictions.

AWS told AP it adheres to ethical codes of conduct, complies with U.S. law, and does not itself offer surveillance infrastructure. Dahua said they conduct due diligence to prevent abuse of their products. Hikvision said the same, and that they “categorically reject any suggestion that the company is involved in or complicit in repression.”

Chinese technology firms now offer a complete suite of telecommunications, surveillance, and digital infrastructure, with few restrictions on who they sell to or how they’re used.

China pitches itself as a global security model with low crime rates, contrasting its record with the United States, said Sheena Greitens, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.

“It’s got a set of solutions that it’s happy to share with the world that nobody else can offer,” she said. “(But) they’re certainly exporting the tools and techniques that are very important to authoritarian rule.”

The AP investigation was based on thousands of Nepali government procurement documents, corporate marketing material, leaked government and corporate documents, and interviews with more than 40 people, including Tibetan refugees and Nepali, American and Chinese engineers, executives, experts and officials.

While thousands of Tibetans once fled to Nepal every year, the number is now down to the single digits, according to Tibetan officials in Nepal. In a statement to AP, the Tibetan government in exile cited tight border controls, Nepal’s warming ties with China and “unprecedented surveillance” as reasons for the drastic plunge.

A 2021 internal Nepali government report, obtained by AP, revealed that China has even built surveillance systems within Nepal and in some areas of the border buffer zone where construction is banned by bilateral agreements. In a statement to AP, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied coercing Western companies to hand over technology or working with Nepal to surveil Tibetans, calling it a “sheer fabrication driven by ulterior motives.”

“Attempts to use Tibet-related issues to interfere in China’s internal affairs, smear China’s image, and poison the atmosphere of China-Nepal cooperation will never succeed,” the statement said.

The Nepali government and the Chinese-controlled Tibetan authorities did not respond to requests for comment.

Under pressure, many Tibetans are responding the only way they can: Leaving. The Tibetan population in Nepal has plunged from over 20,000 to half of that or less today.

Now 49, one-time protester Sonam Tashi is just a father trying to get his 10-year-old son out — before the net pulls tighter. The boy was born in Nepal but has no document proving he is either a refugee or a citizen, a result of Chinese pressure.

Tashi described how those considered likely to protest are picked up in advance around key dates — like March 10, which marks the 1959 Tibetan uprising, or July 6, the Dalai Lama’s birthday. In 2018, Nepal confirmed that it was building predictive policing, which allows officers to watch people’s movements, identify in advance who they think will protest and arrest them preemptively.

“There are cameras everywhere,” Tashi said on a winding bus ride toward the Indian border. “There is no future.”

After China crushed a Tibetan uprising in 1959, thousands fled across the Himalayas to Nepal, carrying only what they could: Religious paintings, prayer wheels and the weight of families left behind.

Their exodus, led by the charismatic Dalai Lama, captured the American imagination, with Hollywood films and actor Richard Gere’s congressional appeals putting Tibet in the spotlight. Washington trod a careful line, defending the rights and religious freedom of Tibetans without recognizing independence.

Today, the future of the Free Tibet movement is in question. Without refugee cards that grant basic rights, Tibetans in Nepal can no longer open bank accounts, work legally or leave the country.

Nearly all police cameras monitoring Kathmandu link back to a four-story brick building just a few blocks down from the Chinese embassy, where officers watch the country in real time.

The building hums with the low breath of cooling fans. Inside, a wall of monitors blinks with feeds from border towns, busy markets and clogged traffic crossings.

Officers in crisp blue uniforms and red caps sit in the glow, scanning scenes. Beneath the screens, a photo published in a Nepali daily shows, a sign in English and Chinese reads: “With the compliments of the Ministry of Public Security of China.”

Operators can track a motorbike weaving through the capital, follow a protest as it forms, or patch an alert directly to patrol radios. Many cameras are equipped with night vision facial recognition and AI tracking — able to pick a single face out of a festival crowd or lock onto a figure until it disappears indoors. The system not only sees but is learning to remember, storing patterns of movement, building a record of lives lived under its gaze.

A 34-year-old Tibetan cafe owner in the city watched the city change in quiet horror. “Now you can only be Tibetan in private,” he said. He and other Tibetans in Nepal spoke to AP anonymously, fearing retaliation.

The first cameras in Boudhanath were installed in 2012, officially to deter crime. But after a Tibetan monk doused himself in petrol and set himself ablaze in front of the stupa in 2013, police added 35 night vision cameras around it.

The Chinese embassy in Kathmandu worked closely with the police, said Rupak Shrestha, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who studied surveillance in Nepal. He said the police received special training to use the new cameras, identify potential symbols associated with the Free Tibet movement and anticipate dissent.

In 2013, a team of Nepal Police officers crossed the northern border into Tibet for a seemingly straightforward mission: Collect police radios from Chinese authorities in Zhangmu, a remote border town,

[TITLE]ICT sector generates N9.44tn in renewed broadband push:
[TEXT]
The Information and Communication Technology sector contributed N9.44tn to the economy in the third quarter of 2025, indicating heightened conversation around broadband expansion.

This came as stakeholders called for improved subsea capacity with inland distribution, elimination of wasteful infrastructure duplication, and a commitment to local manufacturing.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics’ Gross Domestic Product report, under the ICT industry, the telecommunications and information services subsector led with N7.47tn, representing a 1.22 per cent year-on-year growth from the N7.38tn recorded in Q3 2024. However, the Q3 2025 performance fell 3.95 per cent from the N7.78tn recorded in the second quarter of 2025.

Other significant contributors include broadcasting, which generated N1.04tn, and the motion pictures, sound recording, and music production subsector, which contributed N911.77bn. Publishing recorded N18.6bn. These figures highlighted the sector’s immense economic weight as stakeholders increasingly demand aggressive broadband expansion to sustain growth and drive national development.

Despite these multibillion-naira contributions, stakeholders have noted that Nigeria still needs to bridge the digital divide to realise the full potential of the sector and spur widespread growth.

Notably, urban centres like Lagos enjoy relatively stable connectivity, while vast swathes of the country struggle with digital connectivity. Industry leaders argue that the current economic output represents only a fraction of what the nation could achieve if the government successfully bridges the infrastructure gap between the coastal landing points and the hinterland.

In an interview with The PUNCH, the President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Leye Kupoluyi, described broadband penetration as a fundamental economic infrastructure for the youth and the broader economy. He noted that while Lagos maintains a fair level of connectivity, the sub-national governments must ensure that the “hinterland” benefits from similar investments.

“Broadband penetration is a form of economic infrastructure for young people and for the whole economy, too. It’s good in Lagos, but how much of it has gone to the hinterland? The sub-national governments have to see that broadband penetration in every nook and cranny of Nigeria is very important to economic growth, including our input on agriculture, security, and food production,” Kupoluyi said.

He linked digital connectivity to the survival of the agricultural sector, which remains one of Nigeria’s largest employers. He argued that the value-added potential of Nigerian cash crops, which currently stands at

[TITLE]India's New Spyware Mandate Sets A Dangerous Precedent:
[TEXT]
The government of India released an order that all smartphones manufactured for Indian citizens must come with a pre-installed government app. This app, known as Sanchar Saathi, is supposed to protect against phone-based crime such as stealing smartphones or miscellaneous telecom scams. India's Department of Telecommunications (DOT) specified that this app cannot be disabled or restricted by users, and that phone manufacturers would have to submit a comprehensive compliance report within 120 days of the order.

This was met with backlash, with some feeling that this was a privacy infringement and that this app could easily be used to track people's movements and collect data from the phone. In response, a few days later, the DOT released a new statement stating that because users are already accepting this app, the pre-installation mandate does not need to be imposed on phone manufacturers.

This entire situation has caused a great deal of concern regarding the government infringing on the privacy of its citizens under the guise of wanting to prevent crimes. Though there are ways to find and remove spyware from your Android phone, this app won't be so simple. It may bring to mind Big Brother from the novel 1984 by author George Orwell, where citizens were constantly under surveillance. It also sets a dangerous precedent for individual rights being limited based on a culture of fear and protection.

[TITLE]Deeptech funding ticks up as startups move beyond labs in 2025:
[TEXT]
ETtech

India’s deeptech sector saw a marginal increase in funding in 2025, with capital increasingly flowing into startups that have moved beyond proof-of-concept and laboratory-stage validation. Deeptech startups have raised $1.55 billion across 264 deals since the start of the year, slightly higher than the $1.4 billion raised in 2024, according to data accessed from Tracxn.Venture capitalists say deeptech funding in India will remain in the $1-1.5 billion range over the next two years, before picking up in 2027-28, driven by policy support, the launch of the Research Development Incentive fund and a stronger pipeline of startups beginning to reach maturity. Some are also betting on growing interest from Indian family offices, global funds and limited partner interest in the sector.In 2025, early-stage rounds accounted for more than half of the total funding at $850 million, up from $690 million in 2024, with investors looking to back startups that can commercialise their technologies. However, initial cheques dipped to $277.4 million from $332.9 million last year.“While it’s good that we celebrate milestones and announcements, if you look at the absolute numbers, deeptech funding is still relatively anaemic–though it is improving,” said Sateesh Andra, managing director, Endiya Partners.The early-stage venture capital firm, which is currently investing from its $100 million Fund III, remains focused on enterprise, frontier tech, healthcare and industrial technology.Murali Krishna Gunturu, a founding member of Inflexor Ventures, which is looking to close its $150 million Fund III , said early-stage innovation will continue to drive deal flow in 2026. “The most visible shift will likely be an increase in scale-up rounds as more companies mature beyond early pilots,” he said.Within deeptech, subsectors such as semiconductors, defence-tech, quantum and spacetech continue to attract capital, while others including energy storage, battery technologies, artificial intelligence (AI)-led infrastructure, biotech, drones and smart manufacturing are seeing investors reassess risk and long gestation periods.Semiconductor and chip-design startups emerged as the strongest performers in 2025, raising $191.1 million so far, compared with $41.4 million in 2024 and $71.8 million in 2023. This shift aligns with government incentives, geopolitical supply-chain disruptions and India’s push to build a domestic semiconductor ecosystem.Spacetech funding has also held up, with startups raising $93.7 million since the start of 2025, compared with $68.9 million in 2024 and $139.2 million in 2023. Digantara’s recent $50 million round , Agnikul’s $17 million fundraising and several other startups currently in talks to raise growth capital will help sustain investor interest, said VCs.Manu Iyer, managing founder of deeptech fund Bluehill VC, said that advances in communication technologies are emerging as a key focus within spacetech. “High-capacity satellite downlinks, combining advanced RF with laser systems and electronic warfare is becoming interesting,” he said, adding that the sector’s growth is driven more by global use cases than domestic timelines, allowing faster commercial traction.Most deeptech ventures funds said they are evaluating more spacetech and semiconductor startups and plan to write initial cheques and participate in follow-on rounds in 2026.Speciale Invest, which recently announced a Rs 1,400 crore early growth-stage fund, said year-on-year funding numbers can be misleading in deeptech. “The capital stack is improving, and the foundation is just getting built,” said managing director Vishesh Rajaram.From a deeptech lens, there are probably no more than 300 true deeptech companies in India today, an investor said on condition of anonymity, adding, “Among these, fewer than 30 have raised more than $10 million so far. That shows how thin the growth capital layer has been until now.”Deeptech founders said fundraising has become more focused, with specialised deeptech funds and greater patience in the system. However, they pointed out that access to specialised talent, infrastructure costs and expectation management remain key challenges.Shashwath TR, cofounder of semiconductor startup Mindgrove Technologies, said investors are increasingly recognising that hardware-heavy deeptech takes time. “Semiconductors, industrial AI and deeptech in general move slower and that’s okay, because the upside is significant,” he said.Mindgrove Technologies is preparing for the commercial deployment of Secure IoT, a high-performance 28 nm microcontroller system on chip for smart devices.Founders said that access to larger cheques becomes easier only once startups can clearly demonstrate where their first Rs 10-50 crore orders will come from. “It’s about balancing moonshots with sustainability. That’s where most space startups still need clarity,” said Anirudh Sharma, founder of Digantara.“Capital helps companies build capabilities. The sector growth looks positive while some may not scale, but that creates merger and acquisition opportunities for companies,” he added.

[TITLE]OpenAI sees better margins on business sales, report says:
[TEXT]
OpenAI has squeezed better margins out of its paid products this year, as it races to maintain its pole position in artificial intelligence, according to a report in The Information.

The publication reported that the company improved its “compute margin,” an internal figure measuring the share of revenue after the costs of running models for paying users of its corporate and consumer products. As of October, OpenAI’s compute margins reached 70%, up from 52% at the end of 2024 and double the rate in January 2024, the publication said, citing a person familiar with the figures.

An OpenAI spokesperson said the company didn’t release the figures and declined to comment further.
